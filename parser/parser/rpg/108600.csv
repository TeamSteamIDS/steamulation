								""This is the story of how you died""Project Zomboid is one of the few Zombie survival games that actually tries to have everything loved from the genre. Crafting, cooking and farming. Barricade windows and doors, build a safe house and scavenge supplies to stay alive.  Using the skills to build and cook or fight will allow you to become better at them, so there is some character progression.Also let's not forget the awesome music in this game. Highly reccomended!If I had to compare it to any games I would say it is like the sims+ Don't starve+ night of the living dead.Future plans are in place to add npc's other than zombies and polish to the engine and graphics. It really is quite addicting and a great early access title to get your hands on. Especially if you liked state of decay and wanted a little more. Also word going around that a story campaign will be put in as well.With amazing details like food degradation and injury/ illness/ exposure to cold and heat/ mood debuffs/ weapon durability/ character encumberance/ sound and light attraction of the zombies this game can be a nice challenge on the nice open maps. It isn't an FPS but it plays great and has similar controls to an FPS.Just remember this is Early Access and there are some bugs and such. As it stands the game is very much in a good playable state and well worth the money.  Hearing about the coming changes to this title, I am even more stoked about this particular purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								One or two years ago, I'm not sure why, I bought this game, probably thinking ""that's a team of devs whose project I want to get behind!""a month later I dropped the game, thinking it was unplayable and would most likely never be finished....I was wrong as poultry with dentures!!in-depth doesn't even start to describe it, the gameplay might scare you away but it's efficient once you grasp the goals at hand. just act with your best judgmentfirst game in a year:- me and a friend meet up near muldraugh, when I get there he tells me he's got attacked, he's wounded.- fleeing the undead, he got lost and bumped into an abbandoned lumber mill with solid metal doors.- he gives me directions. I see where he is. while I struggle to get drugs, bandages and disinfectant, he discovers the joys of stitching oneself.- we join and, while he recovers from his wounds, I board the place up and gather all the wood and tools I can. we sleep in the break room. they're 5 feets away, clawing at the boards. they never break in.- after a few days we start scavenging the suburbs, just what we need, we have projects.- a few weeks later, we're settled, the crops we planted on the roof after transporting some dirt there is flourishing. days passed by, peacefully. the place is clear and we start to feel in control. he picks up cooking.- one night, I hear moans and cracks, the building's on fire. whole groups of them came to see it. my friend passed out while cooking and canning food for the winter.- he almost dies in the fire to save the seeds and tools we couldn't survive without.- once set up in a smaller building, we heal and consume all our reserves, the meds are gone and the water shuts off. we peek outside.- the Z's have massed, we can't reclaim enough terrain for a field or rain collectors. after making an inventory of what's left we decide to loot the gun store, one town away. we'll have to get out anyway and at least, if we go there, we could clean our home afterwards.- the way there is easy, we're well rested, fed and hydrated. we run there, only stopping for the night in a gas station half way- just before we arrive, we're starving. we ate all our food, drank all our water.... we see a supermarket!- we drink soda and eat meat for the first time in a month. we're safe in the offices, the stairs are broken. we can rest peacefully and the shop is within a stone throw.-the next morning we silently climb down the roof with a rope made of bloody clothes.- the score is easy. I distract them, shooting our few last bullets and run into the woods while he brings down the metal roll-up door of the gunshop as fast as he can with a sledgehammer.- we've got 'em! we're armed to the teeth and we paint our way out of town red.- I already aim better by the time we reach the gas station. it's a tough fight to reclaim it and I get scrached. a cold gives me fever and I freak out at the idea I might be infected. I drink and smoke all night to forget the worries.- by the morning I'm all better (besides the hangover but who cares, I live!) but my friend is nauseous. he didn't rest and looks sickly. he tells me he thought we were above use-by dates. after surviving what we did. he couldn't just die from bad cabbage... could he?- a few miles later, he can't run anymore. I run my lungs out, straight to the city. he'll die if I can't get him supplies.- before he stops answering he says this:  ""I can't run anymore. I'm exhausted, sick, wounded. they'll catch me soon"" I have to go back.- I put the gun bags down, raid the first house I find for basic pharmacy goods and just run his way.- I battled to find his bright orange shirt in what's left of his last stand and found him.  brought him peace, losing some flesh on the way.-I was now the one wounded, exhausted, sick and lost. alone on a country road with a dead friend, his murderers and three sports bags full of guns and bullets...we had played 13 hrs straight at that point. no rage or regrets. just ideas for next time... seriously, buy it. now.

								I've lived entire lives in this game.  Braved bitter winters.  Sorted and labeled crates of canned food, wondering how long it would last me.  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease.  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely.  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly.What I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this.But the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matter, death will find you in the end, but it will be a hell of a journey.			"

								Okay so here goes.  I am a State Level Emergency Manager, and I saw this game when I was recovering after a hospital stay.  What they say they deliver not only is it a great game one of the only truly open ended games I have ever seen.   It also follows pretty much what would happen theoretically during a wide scale Emergency Event. The Vanilla game is good, drop some Mods onto it and the entire game gets a depth that I have not seen in other franchises.  I have well over 2000 hours played on this game, but it needs to be said if you like a thought provoking game, where you will pay dearly for complaceny then this is the game for you.  If you want a mindless game set in the zombie world then this is not the game for you.I have to say this game will be one I play for years and with the mods and multi aspect of it it can be immersive as you want it.  I played it with my kids (there is an option to lift the zombies out) and tought them some fundamental survival skills though a game normal survival concepts work and pay off.I have also found the team at Indie Stone to be highly responsive to their gaming community and their pride in product shows.  I recently showed this product to several state level emergency managers and they were impressed at the implications and concepts that could be taught, ala the Oregon Traill game in the early 90s.I have not lived that long with any of my characters:   top one year - however I understood how I died and in this game you learn from your mistakes, dont make them again and you live longer.In closing thank you Indie Stone and thank you to all the Mod Developers and people that make this game so good and give it a depth that is almost never reachedPS as a SWAT guy the building clearing dynamics work well. . . .eventhough you would not prefer to do this alone			"

								This is a text I sent to my wife: ""I played Project Zomboid for seven hours last night. I killed eighty zombies, looted multiple residents and businesses, survived in the wild and constructed a safe  house. AT the end I died because I put a tv dinner in the oven and went to sleep, I woke up to the house in flames and burned alive. I've decided this is the best life simulator I've ever played and proves I need a wife to survive."" 10/10. Can't wait for more content.			"

Early Access Review
								You should play this game. It's definitely not Resident Evil. And that is a good thing. Seriously. You even have a demo available. Play it.Why is this man, who has only a few hours invested in the game ordering you around? Well...Even though my hour count states that i've just bought my game, that is not exactly true. I played this game a lot a while back when it was still on Desura and I think I really can give you guys an objective opinion here.The fact that the game is flawed is true, yet i always thought this is the game that zombie fans deserved. It's not some cheerful ""sit with your friends and giggle while blowing zombie heads off"" game like Left 4 Dead series were. I mean, i like L4D, but it never got right what i really wanted off an zombie game. It's also not wannabe ""scary and atmospheric horror game"" like Resident Evil that's in the end just funny, especially with the addition of co-op in RE5 which has broken every last bit of atmosphere that Resident Evil 1 and 2 had. (Seriously if you haven't play the old Resident Evils, they are good)This game can be easily compared to DayZ to some degree, in the aspect that both of them make you feel like a masochist and that both of them consist of learning by trial and error. By fire. The games differ in the fact that DayZ is action filled and most of your playthroughs are ended by an infamous axe-guy that doesn't want to cooperate, and zombies (even with their fixed and upgraded AI's) feel more like an annoyance then a threat, while in Project Zomboid many times i died just because some zombie slowly shambled 30 meters behind me and i forgot to dispatch it before it came to my house. It broke my window and in the middle of the night hell broke loose.This game is a game where every one of your playthroughs will learn you a new thing, where you will evolve from a guy that runs around with a butter knife and tries to kill as much zombies as possible before dying a slow and painful death, to a guy that silently scavenges whole blocks of buildings, and knows how not to take unnecessary risks.If you take into consideration the fact that this game now also HAS MULTIPLAYER. So if you feel like shooting some zombies with your friends, that is just one more reason to try this game out. Also, keep in mind that multiplayer is also in its early stages, but for me it worked like a charm.The cons are that the control system is kinda weird to get used to, and that the game doesn't really instruct you that much about all the dangers of the world, and believe me, they are many.Many times you will find yourself dying of just one lucky bite or of the cold that you ignored for too long. There are many many little things that make this game a true zombie apocalypse simulator, not just another action game that includes zombies. But, also i have to mention a really friendly and awesome community over at game forums that will answer most of your questions and help you in any way possible.TL;DR VERSION: The game has a steep learning curve and is really not your ""everyday zombie game"". If you are, on the other hand, looking for a closest thing to an zombie apocalypse simulator, you have to at least download the demo and try the game. It's a wonderful game with many details that make it really atmospheric and easy to immerse yourself into.EDITED 21.06.2014. - Yay! They added multiplayer			"

Early Access Review
								A fantastic zombie apocalypse simulator, helmed by one of the nicest and most determined developers I've ever seen in the industry.The game starts by spawning you at a random location in a massive world map filled with flesh-craving zombies (Which you can fully customize... want a shambler? Runner? No problem, the game allows you to change almost every aspect of your undead foes.) after which, you must then search for supplies and an adequate safehouse for survival. The game is very hardcore, with permadeath as well as essentially an insta-kill system, if you get attacked by a zombie, you either get bitten or scratched, being scratched has a small chance of you becoming infected, while being bitten is pretty much always going to infect you (95% chance I believe). Infection leads to a slow, unavoidable death.The game also has multiplayer, however it lags a good deal for me to the point where it just isn't fun, but I do have extremely poor internet, so it probably will be a lot of fun for those with proper internet.The developers are also currently working on an amazing NPC system that could very much rocket this game into one of my favorites of all time, it's supposed to be able to generate events that are similar to situations from the walking dead, but randomly!Of course... being early access does mean that the game has bugs, it is however fairly stable from what I've played so far. But it does have a fair share of annoying bugs and issues, particularly with the UI.Overall... I can't recommend this game enough, it's just amazing so far, and they're planning on adding a huge amount of stuff that'll make the game even more worth the purchase! If you like zombie games, and extremely nice and helpful development teams and communites centered around your games, then you should get this game.I would recommend if you wish to research the game, that you watch recent let's plays, while you can read the wiki, it seems to be outdated in cetain aspects, and probably will remain so until the developers stop updating the game so regularly.Here's the wiki link: http://pzwiki.net/wiki/Survival_GuideNote: this was the first review I've ever made. I also kind of suck with my paragraphs, so give me a little slack :PAnother Note: I had a section here where I said what things had been added since I first made this review, but decided to delete it since I wasn't updating the section, and I don't think that would give justice to how much stuff they actually have added into the game since this review was published.

								Hey nasKo, this is for you: 🖕🏻WARNING: Don't buy this game, read first. Important notice: I was banned off their forums and project zomboids general discussion on steam for saying stuff they disagreed with. They didn't give me a turn to speak in response to what they've said, so I'm not going to give them one either. As in the wise words of nasKo himself: ""... we don't have to host you being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."". Neither do I, so say goodbye to any comments made by the PZ Team or their moderators. Progress is a funny word; it seems like it changes on a daily basis for the Project Zomboid team.I've been a member since 2012, developer of the first would-be project zomboid overhaul mod, and an overall fair rater.  they were making really great progress all the way up until they started to lie. For the last 2 1/2 years, the community of this game has been manipulated into thinking that things are going to get done. These things include (but are not limited to): Cars, NPC's, moving/roaming/interactable animals, and most importantly, animations. There is a lot I want to say. Me and my brother are private modders who play with our own version of Zomboid and we get fed up with these lies the team makes every Mondoid and game update. It's about time they start listening to the other half of their community if they wish to still have what they call ""supporters"" in the future.Animations, oh ♥♥♥♥ lol, I remember back in 2015 when they mentioned they had started working on them. Of course, it was a time when Jeb made the model loader and things were going smooth in the project zomboid community. The forums had frequent mod updates, posts, and requests for help or making other mods. Everything seemed as planned, they weren't really breaking any promises. However, mid-2015 was when they started to do less, and less. Think about this, 6 years in development, and it isnt really that hard to develop this within 6 years. Hell, there is already 1 guy who made working cars, survivors, and a chainsaw.Now lets go to 2016: A year of lies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery, and removal of a very good modder. If any of you used ModelLoader in the past, be thankful to Jeb, he created it. He was accused of his model config files being used to hack RedBoid (a popular project zomboid server), and thus caught ♥♥♥♥ from the project zomboid administration. However, the administration team and redboid had little to no evidence of this, and went off a limp leg. The project zomboid's team's comments were very childish (except for a few) and gave no ground for Jeb to disprove them. I've talked to Jeb, and there is no way his files could of been used for such a purpose. Lets move on to the animations, shall we? As I've stated before, they started in 2015 working on them. There was pretty good progress (or so it seemed), up until they just kept making excuses in 2016. They kept saying, we got bugs, we got problems, balblalbalblablablalb. It was understandable at first, but they had a new 365+ days to work on them. If it takes you that long to make animations with a development team like yours, that is just pathetic. Still in March 2017, it seems like they left that idea in the gutter, just like they did with NPC's. They have the same problem I've noticed with DayZ: Start working on it constantly, respond to the community early on. Next, wait 2 years, bait community and start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game by making excuses and lies. If anyone complains, say that your team is working hard and its early access, while in reality you just sit on your ♥♥♥ with the money you made from people who bought this game. Then the next year, you just ignore the community and barely even work on the game.Stop being lazy project zomboid devs, you are better than this. I remember when you worked your asses off to provide us a game with meaning and it wasn't the same thing everytime! I'm sick of running around by myself in empty houses, and seeing that OUR community are the ones developing the main things that you promised! You DIDN'T develop working cars first! A STEAM workshop community member did! You DIDN'T develop working NPC's that are very interactive! A STEAM workshop community member did! You DIDN'T make the source code to the movable objects! A community member did! It makes me sad seeing this game and its team digging itself a grave right now. I trusted you guys, instead you just took a ♥♥♥♥ on my face like you've done to so many others. Some of them still have the ♥♥♥♥ on their face and are brainwashed into thinking the project zomboid team is actually working on these things for real.EDIT:Wait a minute! -clears throat-, i forgot to include a few other things! You know the person who wanted to create fully working animals? Oh my bad, he got banned off the forums for being ""wrong""! If you ever create something and have a discussion/argument with the development team because they started ♥♥♥♥ with you first, you end up getting blamed and harassed for it. I've gotten sick of their hypocrisy on the forums; everything the admin does is right, but if the member catches the admin breaking the rules or stepping out of line, they get punished for saying the right things. I'm very unhappy to see Jeb and the creator of the animal mod depart from this once great game.Also, an extra thing about animations: Ever notice they say, ""We just have to fix it up!"", or, ""Just some minor changes to be made before its released!, or even better, ""They will be out next build, we just have to add a few more things and tweak it a little!"". Gives me a good ol' slap on the knee because I know it isn't true.I want to also mention sound replacements; currently, there is no way to replace zombie or ambient sounds because, the dumb ♥♥♥ Dev's put them in .bank files to prevent theft. If someone really wanted to steal your sounds all they would need is audacity and patience. Besides, your game isn't really coded to prevent piracy, people can still use the old executable from previous builds to execute your game and play it.Multiplayer character saving, oh yes, everyones favorite. It wasn't really the intention of the developers to leave this lying around, but it is something that needs to be addressed. Players can die, but have their old multiplayer character files saved on their computer, then just copy + paste right in the Zomboid/Saves/Multiplayer folder like it was nothing. It's always bothered me knowing that everyone is unkillable, unless they get caught by a professional anti-exploit script/tool, or a very aware admin and/or community. I get sick of have seeing people with level 10 sprinting running at unhuman speeds. Just because you've jogged for 1 month doesn't mean you're a god damn Bugati. I rest my case, and zomboid rests in its coffin currently. Hope some grave robber, or even the people who gave birth to zomboid come back and revive it. My guess is that the community will end up leading this game instead of the original developers. Its a sad ending, but at least we will have someone to rest our hope on.			"

Project Zomboid  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7.5 Zomboid chose an art style and stuck with it, and it worked out great. Animations are fitting, and satisfying. Though there are still several glitches, I have no doubt they will be worked out and fixed.   Gameplay 8.5 A uniquely fun twist on the giant list of Zombie games, Project Zomboid actually brings back the feeling of surviving the zombie outbreak, not just simply gunning your way through it. Has a classic RPG skill picker, with several crafting elements. Brutally merciless, Zomboid doesn't want you to live to see the next morning. With a unique take on your characters field of view and LoS, Zomboid challenges you to stay alert and aware of everything going on around you. There are still several kinks they need to work out for combat and some actions, and it take a long, long time to level up your skills, but the updates steadily roll in and it gets better with each update!   Story N/A Not much of a story currently in the game, though there is one in the works.   Multiplayer 10 An absolute blast with your friends. Gather as many as you want, host your own server (or join an online one) and figure out how to survive together. Or watch as your ragtag group crumbles into some twisted Walking Dead equivalant society. Work together to build a fort and prepare to live as long as you can. Set out on expeditions into town to gather supplies, and watch in horror as your friend is mauled to death, and there's nothing you can do but run.   Replayability 10 You can keep coming back to Zomboid for more and more. Currently the end-game is a bit easy, but they are still pushing out plenty of updates for the game, and are working on making it even more difficult. An absolute blast to play over and over with your friends.   Overall 9/10 The most refreshing take on Zombies you will have yet. So many Zombie games anymore are simply shooters, and the survival element is lost. However, in Zomboid, every movement, and every moment, count. Didn't check that dark corner before you rummaged through the house? That zombie just jumped you and bit you, and now you might turn. Do you tell your group, or press on and hope it blows over? Made the mistake of running to fast? The zombies have heard you, and the horde is coming. It's not a matter of if you'll die, simply a matter of when. How quickly that happens is entirely up to you. A must buy for zombie-survival fanatics.

								One of my absolute favorite games of all time; however it still needs a lot of work.No other game has ever captured the true essence of zombie apocalypse as Project Zomboid has.In Zomboid you have to be smart, resourceful and careful. In many cases, not scouting out and planning your approach could very easily mean your death. Zombies are a real threat here; the smallest scratch can be fatal. Despite the graphics and the camera style (which personally I love), there have been some situations that have had my heart racing and my hair left standing up. The smallest event can have great consequences if incorrectly handled. Don’t like your slow, one-bite-kill zombies? Customise them the way you like in the sandbox mode! Live in the zombie apocalypse you want, with the world rules you want! Don’t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks? Change it! Don’t like the way the zombie virus is spread? Change it! Maybe you’re a fast runner Left 4 Dead type zombie lover (good luck you crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) or maybe you like the slow but intelligent zombies that open doors and like to watch you sleep… All up to you!Zomboid is the zombie game for the strategic man, the man that thinks before he does and the man that cries himself to sleep at night. If you are any of those things… This game is a thrill to play! I have yet to try out the multiplayer, but I’m sure it’ll be a blast.  "

Let me sum up the bad reviews:- Game had a great demo back in 2011. looked great.- Game goes on preorder.- Game goes on early access.- Devs take out half the features, promise to put them in later.- Devs keep updating the game more or less.- Years pass.- Devs realize they already got paid, basically abandon the game.- 2017, the most wanted features are still missing. NPCs. Physics.- Game still in Early Access.R.I.P.VERDICT:For Newcomers: For 13,99 still a fun game, still above average compared to the usual indie survival crap. Gets boring quickly though. But still nice.For Supporters: A slap in the face. A disappointment. A damn shame.From my perspective: I'm torn. But ultimately a thumbs down, for the empty promises and Early Access BS. :(			"

								I've never played a better game than Project Zomboid. I play this regularly, both single player and on a 360 controller coop with my girlfriend. Its an amazing experience to try and survive together, even more so against people online on our own locally hosted server!The Pro's?- Amazing Dev team that really care about the end product, even with the setbacks they've faced in the past they kept going!- Good replayability and customization!- There's a lot to do!- One day we will have AI, Vehicles and hookers. In fact, forget the hookers. - Big community who keep modding the game, and the developers are using some parts of this to advance the games development!- Multiplayer!- Updates that really add to the game each time! (plus its actually updated unlike some other titles!) - News via their website every Monday that lets you know what they're doing to the game, (can also sign up to the news letter) usually quite a nice read!Cons- It can get repetitive building and killing zombies, haha who am I kidding it never gets old!- The only objective is to survive, so you do need to either have an obsessive hoarding disorder (lol) or simply enjoy surviving to get the most out of this gameEDIT: Bit of advice, if playing co-op, always check the oven!

								If you've ever watched/read a Zombie Thriller and thought that you yourself could do better than its characters at surviving a Zambo Apocanips, here's your chance. P. Zomboid offers what seems to be the most complete ""Zombie Survival"" experience (with graphics) there is by providing a huge amount of elements that range from putting yourself together on Day 0 and scavenging for supplies to stabilishing a fortified farm house months later, everything in between included. A sandbox mode allows you to create your own Apocalypse-to-Survive by permitting you to edit the Zombie Lore and behavior along with map conditions.Despite being far from finished, the game is very much enjoyable in its current state and has a fair amount of big features yet to be impletemented - such as Online Multiplayer, NPC survivors & interactivity along with many more crafting options. Having been in production for years along with getting an engine reboot, the development has been picking up a faster pace in the last few months and doesn't seem to be halting anytime soon; with its ample modding support, Project Zomboid just might end up being the next big thing, one that is definitely worth picking up at its currently discounted dev price ($15). There is also a demo of the current build available which is worth checking out.special thanks to gangan for being such a charitable brassknuckles wielding monk			"

Early Access Review
								OK, review time. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's one hell of a fun game that just keeps getting better with each new build. It's not perfect, there are still a few rough edges, but the Devs are busting their butts to get everything working properly. The gameplay is surprisingly addicting, sometimes I look at the clock and wonder where the last 4 hours went, but looking at my fort shows me where they went.There are some great elements of the game still being worked on (NPC's, Map Expansion) that will certainly alter the current games play style. No longer will we be ""limited"" to just raiding Muldraugh, West Point, or the ""New(ish)"" Mall area/recent expansion......which to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with. It honestly necessitates a new Safehouse/Fortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointless...as the current map is that big....(map link) http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ and the planned additions of Louisville, Fort Knox and whatever lies in between them will make this a HUGE map.My play style is a little Kamikaze(ish), i love to get a Nailed Baseball Bat or an Axe and take on a horde or two, just swinging away till either the zombies are dead, my weapon breaks, or i have to run and get bandaged up.....maybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed. Consequently, i rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game. But that's the fun of the game, it lulls you into thinking that you are ""Too Good"" for the mere zombies to hurt....until they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last time, that you would not let that happen again.But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself and see how well you do. Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game ""This is how you died""EDIT on November 30, 2014As i write this we have just had a recent hotfix of Build 30, which brought in a Medical Overhaul. I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legs, requiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal. I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windows, had to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandaging, possibly having to stitch the wound. Been scratched and bitten by zombies, requiring me to disinfect, stitch/bandage the wound and hope i did not get infected.Of course, before i can do any of this, i had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map. With the new overhaul, it's even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aids, bandages, or even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage. One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuse.I swear, every new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersion, and they have plans to ""adjust"" the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of time. The MP has continued to improve, with more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory.  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build (30.3) We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new game, including adjusting how often Zombies respawn, whether or not you want random loot respawn and it's frequency.OH yeah, the incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the map...vines growing up buildings, cracks in pavement, trees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comes, bushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove them, SNOW, and so much more that i just cannot think of right now.OK, I don't want this to be a 10,000 word review so i'll stop here. but as before, if you would like to see some gameplay there are plety of videos on youtube from guys like MatthasGames and Eckyman. Or, check on Twitch or Hitbox and catch a live stream. Either way, I hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid community.			"

Early Access Review
								After 290 hours of game-play I feel like I can finally give a full review of the game.Let's start with the good:The game-play is fantastic. I have never had such a realistic zombie experience with an in-depth (But limited) world. The player really gets a sense of being alone, with zombies around every corner. You have to carefully ration food and manage your noise levels. Also, be aware of having a proper nutritious meal every now and then or you might still starve! This game can EASILY take 10 hours of your time if you let it. Not to mention the fun and engaging leveling system in which you can customize your character. I also REALLY enjoyed the food/cooking system. If you get this game for free, or for 10 dollars - hell yes.Let's get to the point though.After 290 hours of game-play, over ~4-5 years of development, the game has changed very little. Besides a graphical overhaul/engine overhaul the gameplay remains the same. ""Why is this a problem?"" - you may ask. Well I have to respectfully say that the gameplay becomes dull and repetitive once you reach the 'end game'. Once you learn the lack-luster combat mechanics (Which was promised an overhaul over 2 years ago?) zombies are no longer a challenge. That's right. The games BIGGEST BADDIE is no longer a challenge once you get a nice baseball bat. If you decide to turn up the zombie count...well...you are still faced with the eventual same problem except with the exception of a single helicopter bringing hundreds of zombies to your location, and the only REAL way to deal with them is by lighting the horde on fire or using those nice OP bombs. And forget being able to see the majority of this amazing map they created - there is no way to travel except by foot. Which becomes dull very fast if you want to go check out the mall on the other end of the world. And while exploring the world is initially exciting there is not much to find besides an empty world full of zeds. No other AI survivors. No vehicles. Just woods and a few buildings.  The world feels empty and lifeless, and besides nature slowly taking over the world it, the environment does not change with any interesting or challenging mechanics.So that's my biggest complaint.Now for the 2nd challenge this game has.The multiplayer.The multiplayer makes the game so much more enjoyable...except for the fact that it makes the above problems WORSE. And if you have too many zombies on the screen they begin to warp around and teleport (MAGICAL ZOMBIES!!). I have seen this on several dedicated servers.Sigh...that's not all. Because my friends and I LOVE this game. We thought ""HEY! The game has SPRINTING zombies!!! Those are good because they are DIFFICULT and make the game SCARY and a small group of zombies is VERY FUN to fight against!""Well. Sprinting zombies work good in singleplayer. But DO NOT work in multiplayer as they warp around terribly and teleport every which way. This has been a bug for YEARS. Which leads to the 3rd challenge this game has:The development team. The development team moves slower than any other team I have seen. If you do not watch the news of the game you would believe the game was abandoned. Sure, they have frequent updates. But no true new game mechanics that actually create new challenges for the game. Enemy AI have been promised for ~2 years and they are using valves ""It's done when it's done"" as an excuse.When reporting the teleporting sprinting zombie bug for nearly 2 years the dev's eventual response was exactly this:""The option will be removed from MP at later date."" - EngimaGreyNo explanation as to why. Just simply saying ""It would be too hard to do"". Come on.After nearly 2000 hours in development for ArmA mods and talking to many other developers I know that ""It would be too hard"" = ""We don't want to tackle that challenge because we are lazy."" (Or as others say ""Too busy"", because prioritization is NOT a thing with this team).It simply comes down to the developers struggling to put the work into their game that it desperately needs. It is difficult to compare apples to oranges, but when looking at many other EA games their work pales. I can do without the additional food recipes, please give me AI to interact with. Please give me a difficult zombie curve. Please add more gameplay options for the late-game. Please add a purpose or goal for this world. Why am I surviving? What obstacle is there to overcome once you have that nice baseball bat and enough food?I will change this review as updates come along but I am significantly dissapointed with the direction of development.To wrap it all upThis game offers a VERY FUN experience for the initial few run throughs and I recommend it for free to 10 dollars (Which is subjective, I know)I would wait to purchase this game if you are waiting for more meaningful mechanics to come into play. Because you might be waiting another 2-3 years for the first introduction of anything really impactful to gameplay.Frequent Responses:1) It is difficult to include feature X! You can't expect them to include feature X because of that.Coding and working on a game takes massive time, dedication, patience, and skill. Just because something is difficult does not exempt it from examination. Having a proper working government is difficult to do, however that difficulty does not exempt it from criticism. Still, it is the developers right to NOT do something and I can not fault them for taking the game a direction they want. However, this does nothing to lessen the dissapointment of NOT having sprinting zombies just because of a percieved difficulty. It was one, of several promising mechanics to keep the game fresh which was removed before it ever really worked.2)You played it for 290 hours...How could you not give it a good review?Hours played have no bearing of my final satisfaction of the game. After 290 hours of gameplay I feel very dissapointed in the state of this game and very doubtful of the future of this game. Compare this to other games in my library: (Only 2 due to space issues)7 Days to Die : 906 Hours - Still love this game to death. I don't play it as much but would still recommend it heavily.Doom: 49 Hours - I do not play this anymore, but would still heavily recommend this to people. Not dissapointed with the purchase.At the end of the day I can look back at MANY other games with over 50+ hours and not feel regret. Project Zomboid, for many reasons, has left me with no urge to return to the game as the development team continues to abuse the early access system and continue to pat themselves on the back for next-to-nothing updates.

Project Zomboid is one of those rare zombie survival games that actually encourages you to survive in stead of facing wave after wave of the undead. It's truely unique with a visual style that may sadly not attract anyone, but its deep surviving system makes Project Zomboid one of the best zombie survival games in recent memory.The Good:· Zombies aren't the only threat: you'll have to eat, drink, rest, calm down and avoid sickness among others in order to survive.· A simple yet clear looting system: there's your basic inventory and additional backpacks to carry more stuff around.· Retreat and recreate:  you could go outside and risk your life for some fresh water, or you can find a well-placed house your new home. Once you have what you need you can cover up the windows with sheets, stack your food and other recourses in fridges, closets and many others, relying on the water from the tap and the vegetables you plant. · Be the survivor you want to be for as long as you can: it's almost certain that you will die within the first half hour of playing Project Zomboid. Hell, I still die every half hour. But that teaches you that your approach to a certain situation was wrong. Did you kill al the zombies but died from a cold? Or did you try to stay inside and were forced out when all the food ran out? You can scavenge all houses (if you can make it that far, that is), you can choose a certain location and hold your ground, you can try to kill countless infected in order to scavenge in peace and so on. Options are almost limitless.· A true zombie survival experience: forget games like Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead that have you mowing down zombie after zombie in order to survive and progress. In Project Zomboid zombies can be the least of your worries when you play your cards right.The Bad:· It's still in pre alpha, so some of the mechanics could use some extra polishing. The devs have been very active and do their very best to fix even the smallest of issues however, so I put my faith in them one hundred percent. This is the zombie game you'll want to play none the less, pre alpha or not.· The style of the game may not appeal to anyone. It feels pretty retro and yet uniquely innovative at the same time, so slapping a certain style on it isn't as easy as you'd think.The Ugly:· Project Zomboid is gorgeous for what it aims to be. Obviously triple-A quality isn't expected (once again, depends on the style you like) but it manages to be pretty enough in terms of animations and effects to be immersive none the less.Final Verdict:I have played unfortunately little games like Project Zomboid and I'm very glad the devs managed to create a one-of-a-kind zombie survival experience like this. It's thrilling, it's atmospheric, and it's everything you'll love from the zombie-genre. 8.5/10			"

								Day 1: Started out with my friend. We spawned in different locations. I made a safehouse and gathered stuff, while he did the same.Day 2: Friend died from horde. He made a new character and started over. I barricaded my safehouse and gathered more stuff.Day 3: We tried finding each other, and through the helpful use of a map, no thanks to the game, we found each other.Day 4: We explored around the area and looted everything we found.Day 5: I went to another place, while he tried to find a good 2nd safehouse. Gunshots around him with the horde following, so he retreated back to the safehouse. I looted stuff at the motel.Day 6: We both went around looking for a good safehouse, and finally found one. After putting sheets on the windows and gathering food and weapons, a chopper passed through.It was the most intense situation I've seen, with more than 15 zombies coming right at us. We fought the horde, and through some exploitation of AI we were able to kill them.Day 7: Looting around the 2nd safehouse. Unfortunately, I got bitten by a bathroom zombie. I had an injury, wrapped it with Ripped Sheets and took painkillers. A few in-game hours later I started feeling nauseousDay 8: We were looting around and found another horde of zombies. Killed it and looted some more. After getting back to the 2nd safehouse I started feeling Sick. Looked it up on Zomboid Wiki and we arrived to the conclusion that I'm infected.Night 8: Me and my friend ran around the safehouse naked. He was trying to kill me because I might turn into a zombie. We both tried hitting each other. Then he had this great idea. ""Why don't you try jumping off the windows?""I said ""Sure, why not."" and thought ""I'm gonna die anyway.""So I jumped out the window. I fell, naked, only with boxers. My friend was watching right outside the house. As I landed, we laughed heartily as my character did a non-fitting death animation and died.10/10 would jump againPlaythroughs aside, this game is absolutely great. Bunch of complex mechanics, fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer. Mondoids(regular Monday reports) keep the community updated about the game's development. The great thing is, the progress is fast, and definitely has the quality. The devs listen to the community's suggestions.I suggest getting this even on Early Access. This is probably on the top 10 most progressive Early Access games on Steam. Get it, you will not regret your purchase.			"

								While Zomboid is a great game for anyone who likes hardcore survival games, one aspect I'd like to talk about is the multiplayer. This game has something that I've never seen before in other zombie survival games. This game encourages you to team up with others and support eachother. Sure, there are people who will kill you for your stuff, but I have never met any. I think that this is because of how realistic the game is. Keep in mind that this is a game where broken bones and injuries take a pretty long time to heal, and you don't just bounce back. Additionally, food and weapons are not readily available in multiplayer. It gets to the point where the game is so hard that teaming up with others is an obviously wise move, compared to murdering them for the rare chance that they have a weapon or food. What I'm saying is that this game often makes you think like you're in an actual zombie apocalypse situation, where people are worth more than just what items they have.Once I fell out of a two story building's window and ended up breaking a leg. Remember, Project Zomboid is not a game where mending broken bones and injuries just means slapping on a bandage. Broken bones are supposed to take weeks to heal in this game. And to add insult to literal injury, broken bones make you slower than a sloth. Luckily, I was with other people, but without them, I would have been easily a meal for zombies.My point is that if you enjoy realistic and difficult zombie survival games, where the emphasis is on surviving, and not killing other survivors, then by all means, do get this game.

								Enjoying this game a lot. For an Early Access game the experience has been pretty darn good (not too many bugs). My only gripe is that at some point you may realize there's really no point to playing the game other than to see if you could survive a little longer. Still the gameplay is intense enough to keep you coming back to see if you could survive just one more day!			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very good game. Latest Edit: June 29, 2015Pros:Zombies don't 'spawn' in.All the zombies in the town spawn at the start. Zombies can't spawn inside the safe area you set up. Realistic, and also an issue a lot of games get wrong. This also makes it technically possible to kill ALL the zombies in the game - good luck with that though.Edit: Zombies do now spawn in, but not in areas you are in - aka no 'magic zombies' like I mentioned above. Sandbox options allow this to be tweaked.The isometric style works well for the genre. The more 'old school' method of graphics actually enhances gameplay - especially if you are playing on a lower spec PC. You can have hundreds of zombies comming at you - and its not going to crash or lag. This simply cannot be accomplished realistically and effectively in a full 3d first person high-res format.You aren't a super man.You can't carry 6000 cubic feet of dirt, or wood, or potato chips. You are forced to make realistic decisions as you would in a real zombie apocalypse. Simply running through and clicking a 'loot all' button is not how this game functions. Also, don't expect to jump 6 feet into the air, or run 35 miles per hour either (Edit, a very fast character is currently possible, but with severe drawbacks). You also have realistic amounts of ammunition, which has weight - so even a well-off survivor isn't going to be spamming bullets.When you die, you're dead - or undead.Regardless of if you like this or not - you can't deny: Things just got real.General RealismFood can spoil. Planned sickness and and infection (non zombie) system with medical system to combat such issues (Implemented Now). You can scavenge for food (bugs and berries). Fishing. Trapping. Hunting (Planned). Fatigue (Needs Tweaks). Mood system (Patiaally implemented).Good CommunityIts in the early stages of developement - and it already has a modding community thats doing some pretty good work - in fact, the developers are aware of this and support this, even working with a modder to incorporate their mod into the base game. (This has happened more than once now) Indie developing at its finest.Good MultiplayerYou can survive the end times with friends, or duke it out with them in the zombie apocolypse (Pvp needs tweaks, and those tweaks are planned) (Some tweaks already implented, I have not yet tested them.Planned Singleplayer and multiplayer NPCsHigh quality NPC's planned, with the same functionality and needs as players. They eat the same, they kill them same. etc.Very good sandbox customization. Almost everything you could think of can be tweaked for your own personal optimal experience. Growth rates of plants, abundance of food, stregth of zombies and how often they spawn, or if they 'respawn'. Level of experience progression. All of these things can be tweaked to a players preferences.Several character profession options with more being worked on and added.Cons:You cannot rotate the camera.You cannot and you won't ever be able to. It doesn't break the game in any way, but its a drag, we just have to deal with it.Needs more hotkey options.Item binding buttons for switching to various items while still moving. Craft X options. Cook X options. (Upon release I'd like to play with a group, and it will just be easier for the guys cooking and whatnot.) Quality of life improvements mostly. There should be a hotkey to drop bags in a pinch if you need to abandon weight and run. There isn'tWould like to see some minor automation. (Some of this has been implemented, much to my delight.)Ex. You can build using wood at your feet currently, but if its a space over, you have to move it, or hold it to use it - all entered as separate commands. I would like a 'use nearby' option to be toggleable, for example. If I tell a guy to build a wall, I would like for him to walk (or run if toggled) back and forth to the wood pile and wall and build the wall/ floor, etc. if its reasonably close. It should also be toggleable to prevent this if unwanted. I would also like to see this with the cook or craft X options. Streamlining repetitive menial tasks improves the experience.Realism. and Lategame Tweaks. (This has been largely fixed with new zombie migration patterns and respawn behaviors. Only experienced players will be able to outplay zombies consistently with the difficulty turned up. This is a very very good thing for this game.)The realism is good, but with realism comes even more expectations. I would like to see food preservation options. I would like to see societal rebuilding in the lategame (especially with NPCs) However due to the lategame currently being somewhat easy, I suggest that new challenges are thrown into the mix. Horde Migrations (Planned). Bandit/ Raider group - From another town? Vehicles and weapons to combat you with - that you can get if you win perhaps? Restore power (In minor ways). Restore running water (Partially). The idea is that eventually you must die, but farming made it possible to live indefinitely. I think surviving forever should be possible - but should be made difficult. Dudes attacking with machine guns and zombie hordes will always be a real threat.Waiting.Lots of planned features. Good features, but features that take time, and as the indie market and development process is a somewhat new phenomenon, and it goes against the modern world's fast-life culture, it can be difficult at times. Movable funiture, Portable Storage (Wheelie bins, Wheelbarrows), Vehicles. NPC's. NPC's.  . . . . NPC's. All things we're waiting for.Minor ConcernsTweaks NeededThere are various things that don't quite work that well yet, and need to be solved, like sleep/no sleep options in multiplayer - as well as how some moodles function (moodles are buffs/debuffs/warnings that describe various status effects on your character) - but the game is early release, so it gets a pass on those things for the time being.The map is huge, but there is no 'random' map - and your map options are limited.The only map options are what region/town on the map in which you spawn. The base map is fantastic, and features a good mix of environments, and they do continually expand the map. (If map expansion continues - especially beyond release - then one map only will make a lot more sense and this will go into the 'pro' category -  Especially if the map becomes ALL of kentucky like some rumors have suggested) [Even if its DLC, or if modders have to do this - DO IT. lol] - More maps are being made by modders as well.The biggest issue for me currently is multiplayer sleeping. Currently, sleeping is simply removed from multiplayer, but I would like to see the option for a 'minecraft style' sleeping arrangement that is not default, but can be enabled for private servers. Removing a very integral requirement/need from characters in multiplayer really hurts the multiplayer experience. I know this will be resolved before final release, but in the interim I would like to see some options so we can at least pick our 'downside' to multiplayer sleep rather than have that experience choice made for us.

								So when I learned this game supports splitscreen co-op, I ran out to gamestop and grabbed 3 usb controllers for my brother, my girlfriend and I to play this over the weekend. Here's how that went.We spend the first 30 minutes figuring out how the controls work. Zombies everywhere in custom difficulty. Brother and I run, girlfriend somehow gets bit. We bunker down overnight and the bite wound kills her. She raises as a zombie and I have to put her down.We try a few more custom difficulties until we decide to just go with the first bite. We spawn in a decent house with a white picket fence and a grill in back. Not too many zombies in sight. Until we see the horde down the road. Girlfriend thinks it's like left 4 dead and goes in swinging her bat, gets bitten again. We don't change the bandage out often enough and it kills her. She raises again as a zombie and I have to put her down again.Her THIRD character gets a small scratch from a zombie. By now, I have it down on how to treat the wound. I fully heal her. Then I notice her status goes to Zombified and I sigh, taking her out back with my spiked baseball bat and await the inevitable. I put her down for the third time.Her fourth character does better, though now she avoids any zombie. My brother, our scavenger, accidentally jumps from a second story building and fractures his leg. He waddles back to base and my girlfriend treats him, since she's supposed to be the medic while I'm the carpenter. It took an in-game week for his leg to heal enough for him to run with the splint on. It heals while he's out...and he accidentally falls out a second story window, breaking his leg again. I talk him out of drinking bleach while I gather corpses in the middle of the street to burn. I start the campfire and my pants leg catches on fire. I panic, running about and then into a building to grab water to throw on it. I die and my burning pants set the building on fire, making me glad I didn't walk into our base.			"

Early Access Review
								After almost two and-a-half days of my life invested into playing this game, and it now being one of my favourite games of all time, I feel it was only fair that I spent a little time writing a proper review for it. So, here goes.This game, is actually the greatest of the great, to say the least, in the whole 'Zombie Sandbox-Survival' and now 'PVP/PVE Multiplayer Survival' genres.The gameplay, to begin with is intense, fast-paced and complex to the greatest extent of these phrases I use to begin to even attempt to describe my feelings. The Indie-Stone, a small, multicultural dev-team have now spent day-in, day-out on this... Masterpiece, the first word to come to mind, since 2013. And boy, has it come far. Each patch, brings more and more depth and accompanying excitement, time and time again. And with the full-release 1.0 Update on the horizon, being in full manufacture by the small, yet just so detrimental and capable Indie-Stone most likely at this very moment.I am excited, to say the least. Off-topic, but back on track - Gameplay.This isn't just your run-of-the-mill, chop-zombies-heads-off kind of game - Deep systems of mechanics, player development through skill points and experience, micro-management to the extent that we're keeping our own little person alive, in the same ways we keep ourselves alive today. You will need to deal with fatigue, sickness, poisoning, infection, dehydration, malnutrition, exertion, broken bones, burns and our favourite; boredom. All fueled by decline in living standards accompanied by surviving successfully - Or in most cases, unsuccessfully, in a Zombie-Infested Knox County, Kentucky.- Combat is superb, with all the basic stuff; damage increase with skill levels, defense increase with skill levels. But then you throw in the fact that an average fire-axe used by Fire Departments in the United States weighs up to ten pounds, and your character only got five hours sleep because he got home from that loot run the night before far too late, you're gonna have a bad time - Damage decrease with exertion, damage decrease with ill-effects on the body, damage decrease if you just jumped from a second-story window to escape near-death.- Mechanics and Micro-management, eat, drink, farm, rest, stockpile, make a run to town, get scratched on your left arm trying to face one-too-many zombies with only a spoon for a means of self-defense, run home, open your first aid kit, tip everything out, clean your wound with whiskey, stitch the wound, disinfect a bandage with the same bottle of whiskey, apply the bandage, take some freakin' pain killers like Max Payne, sleep it off, bandage is dirty when you wake up, repeat steps 700-9,000,000. This game, will make you stress, more than you do, in real life - Especially if you are running a 5 month character, and your character is a hypochondriac. (One of the many customizable traits offered to you upon creating a character.) Farming is a huge thing, especially late game, depending on the fruit/vegetable you are growing, your harvest can take weeks of careful nurturing before you are able to reap your 230 Fresh Potatoes, and not be able to eat them, tortured by the fact you have to watch them go rotten, because you were simply unable to eat them all before the lack of refrigeration got to them. (Which may not be a problem, as alternate means of electricity generation are speculated/planned for the game's future! But that doesn't mean everyone will be able to wrap their thick mind around operating a 2,200-Watt Ryobi Generator! Professions, in their linear current state, are planned for a huge overhaul, in which certain lines of work, will restrict certain commodities to a particular person with the appropriate experience.)This is enough for now I feel, I've spent about twenty minutes typing this, sharing my opinions and what-not.If I think of anything else to add, I'll be sure to edit this and make additions where appropriate, setting aside this is already a massive wall of blabbering text to begin with.Saying that I 'recommend' this game, is an understatement, in all honesty.If there was a way to donate, without purchasing the game over and over, I probably would have by now. There just isn't any words that begin to describe how exceptional Project Zomboid is, nor are there ways I can begin to thank the Indie-Stone for providing me with *days* of entertainment, at such a low cost, and with such an up-to-date forum and blog, providing your weekly Mondoids every Tuesday (Monday for America, I'm an Australian :P ) , there are no words other than : ""You are one of the most amazing Development Teams to ever exist in the Indie Game content-base, and this is one of the greatest games ever created to date.""Well done.

Early Access Review
								I praised the heck out of this game back on it's steam release, I was a daily member of it's forums, and I was in the twitch stream with the devs and hundreds of people during the steam launch. I stuck around before it was on Steam and the devs seemingly disappeared, playing the hell out of 1.5d. This game was amazing to me.But here we are 4+ years of development and the game is well, the same. I know technically a lot of changes have happened, and a lot of improvements have been made. But this review is more set for people unsure of the games Early Access tag, and honestly I really suggest steering clear until they knock some of those planned features off the list because they are taking immense amount of time to seemingly accomplish little. And I am very doubtful we will get some magical update releasing a boatload of content for the game so instead we have to wait day after day, months after months and years at this point for them to release NPCs or a campaign. It's not as if the game can't be fun, but holy hell they need to get in gear here, the map is still very very much unfinished with furniture and room layouts that make 0 sense, NPCs have no ETA STILL (as of 2017). We still don't have the friggin new animations that I remember being mentioned over a year ago, and some weapons still don't even have actual sprites in the game. I am not saying it's a bad game, I am just saying they have gotten very comfortable being early access and they need to get a move on here with the base game features. Who seriously wanted higher resolution textures that horribly clash with the games player/zombie models?With that out of the way, what of the game itself currently is wrong?Music: For the most part the music is dreary and sets a depressing mood that you are going to die. Except when it doesn't, when the music is suddenly this loud unfitting orchestra and you hear the lady making weird ♥♥♥ noises during the song, and then the tone shatters completely. The game shouldn't have combat music at all, especially if it's so wildly different then the exploration music, which even then can be unfitting. One song with no doubt gives a tone of building up, it's something you'd hear if you were preparring for combat, but the reality is that I am just queitly sneaking between houses and looting and it becomes really unfitting.Combat: It's terrible, seriously it's very bad and inconsistent and I assume inconsistent because the game takes into account things like stamina and health etc. And it's excecution is more frustrating then it is enjoyable. Majority of the time you are going to use a melee weapon for everything, because it's suicide to try using firearms as they will alert everyone and there mother to your location, and even then you will still likely miss most shots of the gun from a few feet away unless your guns skill is high enough. Combat is purely swinging the bat over and over with no form of blocking, no special moves to do. Nothing. I think it has some timing element to it, like timing the hit or whatever, but I rarely see it come into play at all.Stealth: Just hold ctrl, it's not hard, most of the time you are completely unsure why the group of zombies heard you, or decided at that moment it was going to go stand idly a few feet away. Stealth has little to it, you can't stealth kill zombies, and you can't do actions in a stealthy way defeating the point. And honestly, doing a slow walk everywhere I go is annoying from a gameplay perspective. It doesn't feel engaging at all and comes of more as a default state that you do without realizing it.Skills/Trait System: This is terribly balanced. As the user Capt. Awesome puts it best with his workshop mod.""I understand that they wanted to remove the possibility of creating superheros from the game but it seems unbalanced that you cannot have a full time job and a minor hobby without also being an obese, hemophobic, illiterate, lactose intolerant, failed bikini model. ""It's not even an exaggerated statement, this is actually as frustrating at the current trait system is. In my opinion the trait system should be removed, but if it had to stay then make it function like it does in the Fallout series, where traits are double edged swords that you can optionally add. Technical: The UI is clunkyl and buggy, they mentioned a long time ago overhauling it a second time so eventually that might happen. They are at least aware it's not very good. I found that often that the windows stuck to my cursor or that the buttons weren't working unless I clicked slightly to the left of them. It didn't happen often but it DID happen.I did encounter crashes as well, not as common as it use to be, but it's not that rare. Performance is shoddy, don't expect to happily run this game at 1080p 60FPS without struggles, it defintely doesn't have that many problems, and anyone with an Intel HD 4000 and up will get a playable experience. But the game still has improvements to be made especially when it suggests you run the game with a 30FPS cap at 720p.Other Stuff: Food and water intake is okay I never felt like it was all that unfair, and the medicine system feels a bit to basic like it'd be cool to visually see my character banaged up, or if my leg is in a cast actually show it. Feels like some weapons end up shadowing others, feels like the game isn't encouraging me to use it's sandbox elements to build with the harsh weight of building supplies, especially when it doesn't supply any other means of moving large quantities of objects.Bags: These were exciting when they first came out but there is no sidegrading with bags, so you simply get the better bag, which isn't hard. The best bag is the Big Hiking Bag which is spawned at a high rate where you can easily skip using any other one until you find it.The general gameplay itself all works nicely, it really can be a fun experience, but it seems like most deaths will not be from you doing something stupid. A lot actually result in you getting bored and playing a bit more wreckless to spice up things a bit, it'd be nice to fortify a building and risk hordes attacking for a bit and having to defend, or we had something to do other then loot the generic homes over and over. It just loses momentum once you get a basic grasp of the gameplay. It just ends up being a stale experience. Once you get the hang of the game after a couple ingame days it doesn't do anything else for you. If we had NPCs and it lived up to half the promises it won't end up making then the gameplay would improve massively, things would feel tense as you'd approach a lot of situations differently, the other AI would make zombies move about the map, and you'd have a lot of interesting encounters. Obviously this needs to be added, but I'm not holding my breath for it to end up being decent. Heres the thing, the game prides itself on keeping things to the George Romero lore established from his movies, but fails to bring the other elements that made his movies good, and that's the characters. If we don't have characters then we are just left with a game that will quickly bore you when nothing happens.Multiplayer is like any other survival, you'll spawn in a wrecked area, everythings looted and people kill on site, some technical issues aside it's a game you'd have more fun playing with a group of friends rather then a public server. I personally struggled to find anything with a low ping while having players. And even then, player interaction in multiplayer is incredibly weak.Overall, it's a fine game, really it is. But it's been in development way to long, it needs to pick up the pace, I know they have the money to get more people, and I know they have the capabilities. But this game needs to start moving forward. And if it ever does then I will recommend it, until then I don't think you should buy it.			"

								The Development of this game is slower than a shambling zombie. The truth is i used to love this game but the lack of progress over the years and the condescending attitude of the forum moderators have ruined it for me. Week after week we listen to the cheerleaders chanting for the Dev's but those of us who have been here a long time know the truth. The Dev's announced Animations were ""coming soon"" and ""Close""but...here we are over half a year later and still waiting.  They refuse to commit to any Eta's because frankly they've never been able to meet a deadline so they just leave us in the dark waiting and waiting. The Dev's get side tracked working on features no one really wants or asked for like the nutrition system, Metal Working  and TV shows. They haven't focused on finishing and implemanting the features that everyone actually wants like NPC's, Animations, Vehicles and even something as simple as being able to see a back pack on your character's back.. It's like they have some form of development ADD.I can't recommend this game... I've been following it's progress for several years and what I've seen is that people are getting sick and tired of an unreasonably slow rate of progress. Combine that with endless excuses and a cult like follwing ready to rush to the defense with ""the Dev's are awesome and you all just need more patience"" mantra.  People have shown an unbelievable amount of patience and i respect that but i feel sorry for the fans that are waiting monday after monday for months even years for any sign of the promised features.  How long does it take before patience becomes Resentment.. . for me it was way to long.2/10			"

								I have bought Project Zomboid multiple times over the years, on multiple platforms. I was there in the beginning. I have spent countless hours losing myself in the game... But right now, even though I love the game, I cannot recommend it at this time. Prepare for a PZ Fanboy turned realist's opinion on the current state of Project Zomboid. *FINAL WARNING, BIT OF A RANT AHEAD, SKIP TO SUMMARY IF UNWILLING TO READ THE WALL OF TEXT.*And before you read on, it is not because of the slow development time that I am disappointed, at least, not entirely. You see, the developers have said time and time again that they need to, and will, take their *sweet ol' time* with the development of the game. However, what I find comepletely unexcusable is that lack of information being provided by the developers, who were once the best Indie company I had ever known.Every monday, the Indie Stone, developers of Project Zomboid, release a ""Mondoid,"" which is an informative blog post detailing development that had taken place over the week since the last Mondoid. Well, informative they are no longer.In the beginning, I looked forward to seeing a Mondoid every Monday. Unfortunately, for the past six months or so, the Mondoids have become little more than bland, generic blurbs that the Indie Stone don't seem to feel the need to put much effort into. If I'm wrong, it'd be hard to prove it; look at some of the recent posts on their website. Actually, the content in recent Mondoids is so similar that I can basically summarize every one you might read.Intro of the Mondoid:-Begins by saying that it's a ""Short, sweet Mondoid this week,"" or, ""Not much to write in this Mondoid,"" etc.Meat of the Mondoid:-Proceeds to blurb about how a lot of ""good work"" has been done on the coding aspect of the game, but doesn't go into much detail.-Talks about some ""secret exciting project"" they have coming up for the game, that almost always is way overhyped.-If lucky to get a post larger than a few paragraphs, you might get lucky and see a picture or thirty second video of features that were said to be, and should have been, added years ago.Ending of Mondoid:-Usually just a copy-paste message talking about the thumbnail of the Mondoid, or how you can subscribe with your email to get notifications on every Mondoid that comes out, as soon as it comes out. (Although, from the way thing have been, you won't need this feature, as you won't likely be missing much.)Their Mondoids rarely provide any new, noteworthy information, creating a film of dishonesty and distrust between the player and the Developer. Now I know what those Project Zomboid Fanboys are going to say; ""The Devs need their time, Tyler! You can't rush them! Be patient!""I have been patient... For almost seven years, I believe. Since then I have seen little change after the first four years or so. I have been told to sit tightly, and have been promised a new, interesting Mondoid where all my concerns will be adressed; yet each time I am very disappointed. And I know I said that the slow development wasn't the reason I gave this game a negative review, but it did have a hand in the decision. NPC's were said to be released in 2016 at the latest. Were not even close to seeing them, if we ever will. We have been promised proper animations, and although there has supposedly been some work towards adding them into the game, they are quickly taking the NPC direction. This game is slowly becoming vaporware. The updates are getting fewer and farther between, and are adding fewer and fewer features with each one. Most of the time we are told of ""AWESOME FIXES"" to the code and game, but I have seen nothing change. Oh, and the Indie Stone often says that the reason why it takes so long to add things to the game is because the features are in need of polishing... Well, I agree with that, but your game is in Early Access. Everything doesn't have to be ♥♥♥♥ing perfect to be added in, just workable. That way you can get better feedback on issues and suggestions, which is sorta why Early Access became a thing in the first place. Just give us all something, ANYTHING that you have promised; show us that you have actually been working on the game, that you haven't given up on it, because right now, that's what it looks like. There is a bubble surrounding the Indie Stone community that filters out a lot of criticism; I know, because I was in that bubble. But my eyes have been opened by the repetitive Mondoids, and obvious lack of content being added over the years.In fact, let me think of the most notable additions that I've seen in the past six months...-A TV and Radio system, consisting of Meta content and text-based broadcasts that add little more than lore to the game.-A nutrition system, I think. (I'm not even sure it's been released.)-Multiplayer. (Quite broken, from my experience.)-What else... Oh, what every ♥♥♥♥ing game ever says. Numerous *fixes* and *changes*.If there is anything else I missed, well, I'm sorry. But the features I missed are probably so uninteresting and overdue that my brain has literally rejected it.*SUMMARY*I love you Indie Stone, you're a great company, at least, you used to be. But you need to give us something to go on. Right now were getting little more than your ""word"" that content is being added and will arrive ""shortly."" You need to quit being so generic with your Mondoids and actually put some effort into them again. And you need to get some help with developing your game, as I've seen much more impressive work done in a much shorter time. And don't say it's because you're a ""small indie team,"" I've seen a hell of a lot more come from two person teams, sometimes even one-man projects. That's no excuse, and there's no excuse for the lack of information you have provided in recent times.I will gladly recommend this game when some actual content is added, but that may be quite a long time. So for now, bookmark this game, write it down somewhere. Then come back maybe five years or so. You *might* see a weapon or two. If you're lucky, and are an extra good boy or girl this year. Maybe. Probably not though.			"

								This game has been in early access for years, and it will never leave it. The developers are perhaps, the worst aspect of this game. They have proven time and time again that they refuse to listen to feedback, or criticism, instead opting to ban those who don't agree with them. Ever since the ""Stolen Laptop"" incident.The big reason for saying the devs are generally just bad people is the fact that they don't update their game in any meaningful way, and instead constantly speak about all the work they do. Which forces the customer to interact with them only based on their words, and not actions.The game itself is only solid not outstanding, however still has issues that have persisted for many years, from lighting to even simple performance problems on rigs that should be more than capable of running PZ. No meaningful content other than multiplayer(Which has its own long list of issues) have been added in nearly two and a half years. You're buying the game as it is NOW, with direct quotes from the devs being ""with future prospects of possible updates to the game"". Don't ever expect this game to be finished. The game is acceptable(sometimes) with overhaul mods.I was also banned as of 11/29/2016 from all PZ discussions due to saying that the developers have poor public relations. Keep in mind, this was while one of their officers was arguing with someone about their development practices in their second most recent update news.			"

								I wish the developers would spend more time working on content and promised features for this game instead of writing those bullcrap essay blogs they call mondoids.I bought this game 3 years ago and it still feels exactly the same as it did back then. It's okay for the first few hours but then you just get bored because nothing exciting happens.I reinstall this game every 6 months lured by the prospect of new features and content but I've been left disappointed every time... nothing worthwhile has improved and those promised features from years back such as NPC's and Animations have made no progress at all. Has this game hit a brick wall or something?EDIT:To give you guys an idea of what the gameplay is like...There's no storyline to this game, your only goal is to survive for as long as possible. You'll start off in a random tiny 1-storey house in one of the major cities and will spend the majority of first few hours going from house to house collecting food, water, tools/weapons and other supplies and eventually securing a building to serve as a safehouse.You'll encounter zombies everywhere, especially in big open areas such as parking lots and on major highways. Occasionally, you'll get spooked by a zombie in a building as you go from room to room looting it in dark, often cramped rooms.After a while (depending on your difficulty settings), water and electricity will shut off forcing you to build rain collection barrels for water and boiling it to sterilise before drinking. Restoring electricity is pretty useless as petrol for the generator is scarce and the noise attracts zombies.Every so often, random meta-events will occur such as screams and distant gunshots which will draw zombies in the direction it came from, often making them pass by or overwhelm your safehouse.Once you've looted all nearby buildings and built up a decent safehouse, you'll either migrate to a different area for supplies or begin farming (which takes a long time to yield crops).That's about it... as I mentioned above, the game is fun for a little while but then once you're set up and fully self-sufficient... the game gets incredibly boring and unrewarding.

								I have now played this game more than any other game on Steam.  Basically, I LOVE it.  It is absolutely addicting.  As a basic warning:You will die.You will die a LOT.Until you can find a weapon and set up a basic safe house, you're in Constant danger.The Maps are HUGE.The Zombie herds are Massive.This was the map when i started:  http://pzmap.crash-override.netIt might help when trying to figure out where to make a ""safe"" house.IF you find the game too easy or too hard, you can play in sandbox mode.  This will allow you to make it very easy or insanely difficult.  If you have any questions,  just ask on the forums.  You'll usually get an answer Very quickly (either from the developers or another player).  Plus the developers release weekly email updates on what they've accomplished to improve the game.  (I've read reviews complaining about the developers and I just don't understand - it seems like they're in CONSTANT contact with the players).Unfortunately, this game is still in early release.  I can't imagine how much better its going to be when officially released cause it's Amazing now.  Things to look forward to:  radio broadcasts, NPCs, etc etc etc.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the offical release so I can play Multiplayer on a private server with all my friends.  That will be SO much fun.  Basically, this is one of the best Zombie game I've played so far.  Yes, i'm putting it right up there with Left For Dead 2.  Give this game a shot.  It really is wonderful...10/10EDITED REVIEW - 11/27/16I recently restarted the game under the current build.  While the game is STILL considered an Early Release game, it has changed quite a bit since my original review.  No, NPCs are still not finished, but they've added the radio broadcasts at the start of the game.  You now have radio & tv broadcasts at the start of the apocalypse.  They've also made the night music So much creepier.  There are also much larger groups of Zeds all over the place and quite a few houses are already burned out.  As before, the game is totally addictive.  Give it a try, it's an amazing game!Still 10/10			"

								The development team of this game is an absolute joke. They've had animation updates ready for 6 months and bait their fanbase along while not releasing any new content to the game what so ever. An independent modder was able to create and release a working vehicle mod in less than 4 months while this dev team couldn't do it in 5 years.I've owned the game for almost 2 years now and have followed it extensively. During the animation update promisses my little brother expressed his frustration with the team on the indy stone forums. He never insulted anyone, just simply asked questions such as, ""Where is the money going?"" ""Why haven't you relelased a product that has been finished for basically 6 months."" Through all of this the moderators of the development team threw false dichotomies in his face and were very passive aggressive with their answers. Eventually they simply banned him and deleted all of his posts from the forum, which was indeed shady and shocking.From here I expressed confusion and disbelief as to why he was banned and asked for solid answers for their reasoning. I was answered with my own banfrom theforum stating, ""It's embarrasing to create another account to pretend to be someone else.""I recieved an email warning from the forum, which I responded to explaining that I was indeed a different person. This moderator who I spoke with in email was different than the one who banned me from the forum, but explained to me that with 95% certainty that we were the same person. This blew my mind considering I am 6 years older than my brother, he lives across town, and I am more than this pathetic 95% sure that we are indeed different people. It also stated that if we fell through some 5% unsure window, he would only apologize. Further more, it was said to me that neither account, mine or my brothers would be unbanned ever. Mind you we have separate IP addresses that were seperately banned... How can we be the same person.I responded as such,""I am a different person. The first ban was my little brother. This certainly falls under your 5% window, considering I am a completely different person with a different computer who lives at a different address.Your analysis couldn't be that careful if you came to that conclusion. Simply look up the IP addresses and you will find that 2 completely different computers were on these 2 completely different accounts. Our grammar is different, our arguments are different, and I certainly do not have the colorful vocabulary my little brother has.This is really sad considering your ""careful analysis"" wasn't very careful""The moderator responded,""Your language is similar enough, added to the tracking and tracing tools we have. As I say, if you're in the 5%, I can only apologise.However, at the end of the day, you, or your little brother, broke the rules, fairly spectacularly. That cannot be ignored, and when our tools are telling us what they are, we must act on them.""Our language is similar enough? That is the basis of your unrelenting ban on my account in these forums? And what rules did we break? We broke no rules. We never threatened anyone, harrased anyone, or did anything past ask questions.I responded one final time,""I broke no rules, I simply asked questions and expressed disbelief. The language is similar enough because we are brothers and spend a lot of time together, though honestly his vocabulary is far better than my own.How can you only apologize? You have the power to unban my account since I did nothing wrong. So it is against the rules to question motive? It is against the rules to express disbelief? This is some sort of dictatorship where simple questions go unanswered and bans are handed out without simple research as to who people are?This is sickening. I will make sure to leave a wonderful review on the steam forums as to how this games development team chooses to ignore fact and simple questions that come nowhere close to breaking rules. I'll make sure to copy and paste each of these emails and feature these shenanigans on my team's blog.If you hope to be successful with the development of this game, I suggest your team takes a look in the mirror, and people's IPs before banning, and asks themselves, ""Are we really treating our fans and PAYING CUSTOMERS right?""Sincerely,Someone who will find a way to get their money backP.S. I am a registered CNA in the state of Oregon, and on top of that with some simple searching you could find some of my brother's information. Maybe you should take the tiniest amount of effort to not be so utterly wrong""Now this whole thing is so frustrating because without the forums to research, it is near impossible to keep up with latest updates and development of the game itself. This team is just trying to take your money and they don't want to have to explain a single thing. Careful what kinds of questions you ask, because team Stalin here will prevent you from accurately following the production of a game you paid for.			"

Early Access Review
 Project Zomboid  I Drank a Bottle of Bleach to Relieve My Thirst   Genre Isometric Post Apocalyptic Zombie Survival   Plays Like DayZ, Don't Starve   Positive   Well realised, oppressive zombie apocalypse. Well balanced survival elements properly reward scavenging.    Negative   UI needs work. You'll likely want a wiki companion.    Recommendation Yes. Finished or not, it's one of the best survival games to date. Project Zomboid is a hardcore survival game with the works. You have to manage the usual things like hunger and thirst, but also new considerations like sleep, overheating, freezing, fear, sickness and infection. It's a balancing act that has lasting appeal with an ever growing variety of ways to deal with your situation. Which brings me to Early Access.I personally don't find the distinction between a finished game and an unfinished one to be all that useful. The feeling of fun that I have while playing a game doesn't care if it's ""finished"" or not. If your game is functional and enjoyable before it is officially released, then I'll happily give you money to continue creating a product that I would have probably bought anyway. After all, this same method is how we have come to enjoy many games that likely wouldn't have been made. Some games, perhaps most famously Minecraft, will likely never be finished, with new content being added on a regular basis. Project Zomboid is possibly in the same situation. If being in Early Access is one of your considerations against buying a game, then I hope this review is at the very least informative for you.Zombie survival often turns into dumb action, so it's nice to see a game that is more The Walking Dead than Dawn of the Dead. The Zombies themselves aren't that threatening in small clusters, but the real danger comes in numbers. I had an experience where I had boarded up a house with a small vegetable garden, only to wake up in the middle of the night to a horde migration on its way to the city. I escaped, but my stash became inaccessible. After the initial frustration, I looked back and thought, ""that's a really cool feature"". Coming across an event as catastrophic as a migration or even something mildly hazardous like finding a zombie behind a door that you weren't expecting add excitement to the gameplay. Once your character is dead, you have to start a new game, so even being scratched by an unnoticed zombie can be devastating, and in more than one case, lethal. I love this. You approach scavenging cautiously. You pick your targets and pass over ones that you think would end badly. It's an elegantly designed difficulty curve that while not unique to Project Zomboid, has been well implemented.A large part of the game is character progression. You create your character with a basic background and positive and negative traits, customise the games difficulty settings to your preference and then are dropped into rural America to fend for yourself. There are a selection of skills available to you. The way they improve is simple. The more you use a skill, the better you get at it. Thats it. This encourages variety in the way you play your game as new options open up the better you get at a skill. Currently there are 20 skills. Most are related to different physical abilities, but there are ones that affect how well you can farm, build, cook, trap, fish etc. While the system itself works mostly without player interaction, it's still nice to see something going on under the hood in a genre where most games are just content with a hunter-gatherer style of gameplay.So what actually is the scope of the game? Well, when you start you literally just have the clothes on your back. Among your first concerns are food, water and a safe shelter to sleep through your first night. You will scavenge for anything of use and try to carry as much as you can without making you a slow, easy target for nearby zombies. Once you've found a nice place, preferable close but not actually in a town, you'll probably want to go about barricading it to reduce the risk of zombies breaking your windows or even worse, just wandering through the back door you forgot to close. Once you have found your new home, you'll go about nicking as much as you can and dropping it off for later use. Eventually, the utilities will be shut off, so you'll have to find alternatives to using refrigerators to keep food fresh and taps for easy access to water. Long before this, you'll need to consider actually growing and catching food yourself, a task made difficult by roaming walkers. This status quo balancing act can go on for months until you finally run out of bandages or meds to keep you going. I found the variety of things to manage to be really immersive, thanks in no small part to the attention to detail. If zombies are banging on your door, your character will become anxious so you need to give him sedatives or risk him being less effective when it comes time to run. I really liked Project Zomboid. It has a wealth of content in its current state and still has new things added to it each time I play. It is everything that I want from a survival game in a package that clearly has had a lot of care and attention put into it. Again, being an Early Access title, you'll have to decide for yourself whether you'll find value in this purchase. I certainly feel like I got my money's worth.			"

								Project Zomboid is probably the best zombie survival out there. If you are not into graphics and special effects and you want to play a sandbox survival game. Then this is a must for you.The game has payed a lot of attention to survival detail. Your health is not only a bar that fills with red colour. You have to deal with stress, boredom, deseases and exoustion. You have to be prepared for situations, take a breath after fighting, probably smoke a bud and drink some whiskey before you continue looting or your character may become too stressed, have a nervous crysis breakdown or become insomniac and never get good rest. When hit by a zombie except the chance of infection your wound will start getting infected if you don't change and sanitise your bandages. Your inventar is not just a bunch of square containing things. It is complex and you have be aware of your speed and your overall stamina because you will have to cope with wearing a bagpack and sport bag in one hand, and probably a gun or something to defent yourself with in the other.The electricity and water will stop. There will be no endless supplies of food and water. You will eventually want to start gardening, building and fishing because sooner or later you will run out of it and you will die or get a desease.The game is really slow, don't expect forever runnig and forever killing.Cons - the graphics are really bad, looks like the first Sims game. I was expecting when I zoom in for the game to scale the textures but instead everything gets really pixelated. It could go as ""art"" but if the game could have mroe HD feel would be better.Pros - best survival game I have ever played and I have played a lot (resent are The Forest, DayZ SA, 7d2d and How to survive). The way you interact with the world is really easy and intuitive. You have to really mind all the small details.And for the end of my reviw just one thing - never - ever - ever - EVER forget your oven ON in your main HQ ...			"

Early Access Review
You start off as a survivor in the apocalypse with nothing but your shirt, trousers and shoes. Luckily you spawn in a house which appears to be zombie free, giving you a chance to search for some food and a weapon. You wander around checking each draw, shelf, cupboard finding nothing but a pen, can of dog food, load of clothes and some nails! You've been in the apocalypse for a few months now but luckily electricity and water are still on. You check the fridge for supplies and find some uncooked chicken and watermelon. This won't last you very long but it is better than nothing. You decide you have to go out and look for more supplies if you plan on surviving any longer in this world. As you go outside you spot one zombie looking away from you, the only thing you have is a pen but it will have to do. You sneak up behind the zombie and jab the pen in its head, instantly killing it. Searching the body you find a diamond ring. In the previous world this might have been worth something but in this one it is worthless. You walk towards the opposite house and peer into the window. Seems clear. You open the window and climb in. Scavenging the entire house you find some supplies and a baseball bat, your first real weapon, sweet! But it looks like you had your back turned away for too long, a zombie sneaked up on you, luckily you turned around just in time and pushed it on to the floor and smash its head. Seeing it is getting dark you decide to close all the doors, get a bite to eat and then go upstairs to bed.

You wake up to the sound of gunshot in the distance. You look outside and see a horde of zombies walking towards your house! It just isn't your day. Looks like some of them spotted you and they are now banging their faces on the door, you rush downstairs and open the back door only to see more zombies, you turn around and run back upstairs, ripping your shirt and trousers off, turning them into a rope. You slam the bedroom door closed and throw the rope out the window. You quickly climb down the rope and run off down the road in nothing but your boxers and shoes. Since you are sprinting you're making  a lot of noise, causing even more zombies to start running towards you. You smash a window of a nearby house only to have the burglar alarm go off, bringing even more zombies to your location. You can't go back now! You jump into the house dive into the corner. They start pouring through the windows and doors. No escape. No hope. You take out a pencil and notated, writing your final words onto it. You have one last meal, a sip of whisky and whip out your bat for one last stand. They burst down the last door and charge straight at you. You whack at them but it is no use. They grab and surround you, pinning you down. You open the health tab to see everything flashing. Left arm being eaten, right leg gone. Then finally, you pass. I initially dismissed this zombie game as I thought it was going to be a 2D version of Dayz. How wrong I was, Project Zomboid exceeds my expectations, having everything I desire in an Indie game. Unlike Dayz, PZ is much easier to understand, a LOT less buggy and more vast in the zombie apocalypse.While the ingame map isn't randomly generated, it is large enough to keep you wandering for days (but there is an  online map	 [pzmap.crash-override.net] which helps you to pinpoint your location quickly). What you get in the game however is randomly generated. Anything you find in one play through may not be there in the next. But as one would expect, certain items will be found in certain places. By this I mean if you find a food shop, you will be more likely to find a load of food. If you find a construction site you are more likely to find a bucket full of concrete and a sledgehammer etc. I've only had it for a few days but I'm loving every bit of it. Some of the best things in the game currently are:Health system - You get shot in the shoulder, you're going to need to pull the bullet out, disinfect the wound, stitch up the wound and bandage it. (pull out the stitches too soon and it will reopen).Viewpoint - You see from your characters view point, not yours. If there is something behind your character you won't see it until it is right on top of you. You may hear a groan though, giving you a chance to retaliate.Traits - You character can be altered to survive different situations. One trait will make your character stronger, giving you extra damage, carry weight and knockback. While another might make you less prone to getting sick. This will cost points which you gain by picking negative traits, which give you more points depending on how severe it is so the total is 0 or more.Jobs - You can pick a job you had before the apocalypse. Currently you can pick to be a police officer, fire officer, construction worker, night guard, ranger or unemployed. All but unemployed give bonuses corresponding to the job. For example, A night guard will need less sleep than everyone else. Police officers are better with guns. Currently they have plans to add even more jobs. UPDATE:   More jobs are coming next build [projectzomboid.com]Time - Over time things will change. The power and water may be on for the first few months but after that will shut off, leaving fridges, ovens, microwaves, taps and lights all useless. This means you'll either have to start making camp fires to cook and containers to collect rain water or finding non-perishable food and bottled water. Over time everything will also decay. The first month in the apocalypse will look quite tidy but a year later everything will be overgrown, cracking etc.Shelter - When you need to rest you can't just go in a house and jump in a bed. Zombies may see you and start crawling in your house while your asleep. Unless you are in a zone with no zombies, you'll have to hang up sheets by the windows to stop zombies from spotting you in your house (this also stops you from looking out while they are closed so you'll have to rely on hearing). To be extra secure you could barricade all the windows and doors.Safety - Once you got a nice house, barricade the windows and the doors you might think you can stay in there for a few months. The game however might throw random noises in some direction like a helicopter flying over by or a gun shot, causing zombies to go towards the direction it came from. This may be towards your house, threatening your safety. Although they haven't seen you, you haven't seen them either. It could be 3 zombies outside moaning or 50. They may be on the other side or right in front of your doorstep. The only way to check is to look out, but if you look out you might be seen.Skills - You can level up as you use items or do certain things. These include how fast you can climb, how fast you can run, how well you can give first aid, how well you can cook, how good your aim is, how well you can barricade etc. This can create roles in a multiplayer server (one player might be the cook while another the doctor).If you love zombie games, I definitely recommend you buy this. Beware this is still in early access so you won't have the full game and there will be bugs (although haven't found any at all yet). Compared to some other Indie games, this advances quickly (Previous update was on the 8th of September, current one was released unstable on 3rd of November and properly released late December). I am quite pleased with it. This game was gifted to me by a very kind stranger but if I knew it was this good, I wouldn't have spent all my money on other games and I would've spent it on this. While I can see it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly one hell of an indie game!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is one of the best zombie survival games out there. It's not a DayZ clone, it's full-out survival, a thing this genre needed done right. REAL survival. Not a Free-For-All PVP Walking Simulator.Getting into a fight with even a single zombie can be dangerous, as a bite nearly guarantees that you will be infected. Scratches can also infect you, but it's not as likely as being bitten will. Always travel with a weapon ready, but be careful with what you use. A gun can bring in a MASSIVE amount of zombies from EVERY direction.On top of that, weather and temperatures will affect your health as well. Out in the rain too long and got sick? Stay in your shelter and take it easy for a few in-game days. Too hot out? You'd better have something to drink.If you survive all of the above, your life will get much, much harder. Eventually, water and electricity shut off for good, so you'll need to farm your own food and drink from wells or rain collecting barrels which you can build.There's a lot more to the game, but I don't want to make this review too long. I'm going to have to give Project Zomboid an 8/10. It already feels like a finished game, and they keep coming out with updates that make the game bigger and better.			"

								I don't want to get in depth, i'll just say that this game has incredible ammounts of potential.Unfortunately it's being developed very slowly, I would love to give it a thumbs up but 6 years in an early access is a joke for me. With this kind of pacing i don't see it being finished in the near future.It's a shame really, this is one of a kind game that can give you that creepy vibe so desperately needed for a zombie - survival game. The washed up graphics and colourless landscapes feel amazing in this game.Anyways, the developers keep writing their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t essays for upcoming updates and nothing ever happens, feels like game died a long time ago.

								Honestly not sure what to believe anymore. Once you reach a threshold of time and keep hearing the same ""It will be ready when it's ready"" chant for years now you tend to listen to your gut a lot more. My gut is telling me the devs have lost most of their interest in continuing development of their game from the time factor alone. Don't care if a theft happened (or not) as development even at that particular point was extremely slow to non-existant even then. The fact that they didn't have cloud storage backup (or any off site backup) tells me that they lost interest in their own project a long time ago. Sure PZ had it's day when it was new up to the first couple years after but unfortunatley this game needs to just be released ""as is"". The important part is that the devs need to put this into ""complete"" status to lift a huge weight off their shoulders. Then, if they decide to do anything further, go for it, or not.			"

Early Access Review
								My first experience with this was short lived.I ran outside of my front door and wielding a trusty baseball bat, attacked a group of zombies. I was 'scratched and bleeding' on the foot and I couldn't find, or figure out how to bandage myself. So I died.From a cut on the foot.Second character starts to freeze to death within just a couple of minutes of playing, so I get together some materials for a camp fire and make it in the safety of my bathroom. 30 seconds later my character is running around the garden being chased by zombies with his legs on fire, watching his house burn to the ground.Third character survived for a long time. I found a warehouse and wanted to look for axes or sledgehammers but there were too many zombies around. So I lured them all to follow me, planning to trap them inside a house and then run out the back door. An excellent plan!!I opened a house door, ran inside and the zombies started pouring in, an excellent plan I thought!! Wait, where's the back ♥♥♥♥ing door???? There is no back door. Cue Laurel and Hardy music as I sprint circles around the living room as more and more pour in the door. By the time I'd remembered that I could climb out of a window it was too late.My first multiplayer experience with this was like an episode of The Walking Dead.I created my character, an illiterate clumsy oaf with incredible strength and tough skin, and then spent the next 6 hours trying to get the server to work. (if you've tried everything but still can't get it to work- on the router settings make sure the device the game is connected with is your IP, not your local machine IP, or your router's IP, but your IP. Not your public IP. Damn it's complicated. For me it starts with 192.... but there are two of those, one with 256 at the end, the other with 140 at the end. The 140 one is the one I connected the game to and then it worked.)But nevermind that.My character's name is Rick Grimes. I ran out of my door taking a bunch of food with me and sprinted down the main road, leaving a bread crumb trail so I don't get lost. I find a huge warehouse where I scavenged a few planks and hammers, a buttload of nails and duct tape, and also somehow managed to FALL DOWN THE STAIRS, breaking my leg.I ripped up my vest into sheets and tied a wooden plank to my leg as a makeshift splint. Sorted!My friend at this moment managed to log in. We cheer! But then sigh as he has spawned in a house filled with zombies and the doors and windows are barricaded shut. WTF??? He screams. He sends me a voice message telling me he's already getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with the game and that he's about to log out.Hold on!!! I tell him.... just hold on!!I go online, load up the map of the area and tell him to take a picture of his house zoomed out. I manage to match up this quirky looking road out front of the house to where it is on the map and..... holy ♥♥♥♥ balls. It's miles away.Nevermind the distance, I thought! I'm going to rescue my friend!! Hang tight, I tell him, I'll be there soon!As soon as I start sprinting I realise that a broken leg in this game actually means something.So 45 minutes later, I arrive at his house. To my astonishment, he's actually managed to take down the 5 zombies in his house with his bare hands and he's just been waiting there starving to death.The feeling of seeing him stood there, through the crack in the barricades on the window, was pretty amazing. My friend called it a Golden Gaming Moment.I looked through my inventory and ♥♥♥♥ myself. I don't have a hammer... I can't take down the barricades. So I start wailing on them with a golf club. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. Nothing.... panicking that he's going to have to wait another 20 minutes for me to find a hammer, I remember my schoolbag. I open it and.... ah yeah there's my hammer.I take the barricades down and I know for a fact if there was a BROHUG emote in the game we would be spamming the hell out of it.We survived for a good hour and a half before we started to get cocky trying to take down small hordes of zombies around our safe house. I got scratched and cut on my leg and arm. Bandaged up no problem. But my friend got bitten on his chest and it was deep and needed rebandaging every 2 minutes or so. He was losing health.Instead of continuing to back away from this horde, we stupidly decided to carry on trying to exterminate it one zombie at a time.I got scratched on the foot again and decided to just back off and give up, but due to miscommunication, my friend decided to balls out try and kill them all by himself. He got swarmed!! I managed to push them all away and I went rampant as they swarmed him, managing to knock down or kill the last of them.My friend's waddling around leaving a trail of blood.HOLD STILL I yell to him as I frantically begin the medical check.He has 4 injuries and is already half dead. I bind one wound- OK. Another wound- OK. I bind the third wound.. ♥♥♥♥!! That wasn't a wound, I just took off a dirty bandage!!! At that moment, he dies. If I had bound the last wound instead of unbinding the old wound, he would have lived, but in the heat of the moment I couldn't focus and I got him killed.There's silence. I head back to his safe house with the barricades and I take all of the best food we have scavenged so far from the fridge, with a plan to rendevous with him at his new spawn location.His new character spawns, incredibly luckily, in MY safehouse. Barricaded windows. Two story for look outs. Sheets over everything to stop any zombies peeking inside. TONS OF FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.... oh and a bunch of turd weapons and backpacks. Sorted.I run back to meet him and we begin our plan of scavenging the streets for food and stockpiling it all over again. But this time, his character looks like Patrick Stewart.And my legs still broken.Next time we play, the plan is to get a small farm going, build a wall around the house to further protect it, and head out to try and find some assault rifles or axes.I honestly can't wait until they add cars and NPCs into the game. It's going to be incredible!!!My friend came up with an awesome idea also, that there should be little missions that happen randomly like the power can just randomly cut off in a large area. Meaning that you have to go to a power plant or something to essentially fix it yourself. I added that without good electronics skills, you would have to just flip the switch, which would turn the power back on but it would set off a loud alarm which would make escaping and getting home difficult.The hints that the military are going to be implemented and ideas about being able to sit in the back of pick up trucks shooting zombies while your friend drives around are the reasons why I've given up on all farming / survival games in favour of this one for the foreseeable future.Check it out guys you won't be disappointed.

								My favorite zombie game to date. This game combines a zombie-survival gamemode with intentional pixelated graphics which makes the game one of my favorites. It has slow moving zombies that respond to the player's actions, such as firing a gun, or breaking a window. The game consists of many actions that the player may control, such as cooking, putting a sheet over a window so zombies/players cannot see in the house, boarding up windows/doors, and much more. Once you start playing it is hard to stop. 10/10 from me.			"

								I had high hopes from the game, but it's (permanently) stuck in the development hell. I believe I bought the game in 2012 or 2013 from Desura and I regret it. Even back then they promised NPC, story mode and all the cool stuff, but those are still in development. I'm not sure, if they are even developing the game anymore, because the progress is so slow.

								This game is awesome I play it (locally) with my gf and my son also likes playing although he is 9 and spends most of his type shooting at zombies (an missing)then getting swarmed while shouting ""Dad  help me, stop laughing its not funny I am going to die"" as they maul him, each time this happens we re-spawn him and adda number to his name, so all say high to Daniel 34 and please take a minute toremember the 33 Daniels that came before him.-Plus it is one of the few split screen games on steam that is worth playing in my opinion.-Regular (every Monday) updates or news of upcoming updates9/10 great game if you like survival or zombie games this is for you.

								So I bought this game when it was on sale and decided to write a review about it.I need to say that the devs did a great job on PZ. This game is for people who really want to survive, not just to shoot some zombies in the head.What I really like from this game:- Survival is very hard- Every thing you do has consequences- It gets better every update- You really need to take some time with what you do- The world is very interactive-  Everything CAN go wrongWhat I think that could have been better:- More options in the sandbox mode, since it really just stays survival but easier or harder- The multiplayer really still needs some work ( But they are working on it) So if you like really hard survival games and realism, pick this game up			"

								Proof: For those who just want proof and don't want to read, follow the link at the bottom of this review to show how slow the game development is and give you an idea. Mind you, some of those videos were posted 2 years ago:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About the development:Approximately 5 years ago, I purchased Project Zomboid on Desura when I heard of a youtuber who I enjoy, played it himself and recomended it to me. I played it to death, and guys believe it or not there actually was NPCs at the time. Granted they were basic and had simple emotions and function, but they worked. Although, they did away with these basic NPCs because they were too simple. Now development back then was active. Honestly, I think about updates were weekly if not bi-weekly. Right now, months go by without content.      I knew development can and will be slow and I wasn't going to let that be my deciding factor how I felt about a game, but a couple months ago I felt like they at least had some sense of direction. I felt like they were actually trying to pump out NPCs and vehicles and animations, and actually knew that they were on track and going to work at it that is untill they released a TV and radio system not to mention a ""caloric intake"" addition which these features; no one asked for at all. Their Mondoids, are a weekly Monday blog about what to expect from future updates as well as development information and how it's going. These phrases are what you can see in every Mondoid since almost the beginning of this year, ""NPCs are coming"", and ""NPCs are always being worked on and animations too"". You hear them talk development, but they have little to actually show. Speaking of which...        A youtube channel by the name of ""Chris Simpson"" that I was subscribed to, posted videos of Project Zomboid development. Four of these videos had sneak peaks at the NPCs and their functions even going as far as watching an NPC preform complex tasks on its own. Check these out for yourself, I'll put a link at the end of review. Also bear in mind that this was two years ago at the posting date. It's been too long with too little.For the Project Zomboid Youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/user/lemmy103 "

								Ah, Project Zomboid; it's been so many years since I saw your early build with green zombies and Kate & BobSo, what, it's been like 12 months since you started working on the anims or more?Yeah, maybe even more.If this title gets released within the next decade I'll be very pleasantly surprised, but as it stands 2074 is the closest we're gonna get to a solid date for a 1.0 version with all the promised features (NPCs, the most important part) and a HUD that doesn't make me want to claw out my eyes.Seriously, they haven't been touching the UI at all and it's ugly beyond human comprehension while being extremely clunky to use.Sorry, I've been with this game for years, even when your old work computers got stolen, but this is just a joke at this point.""It's ready when it'll be ready"" is just what you keep saying so nobody thinks the game is abandoned, but it's taking so long that everyone is losing hope.The combat is terrible, cooking is buggy, the map is big but there's just nothing to do and everything loses its flavor extremely quick.Stop adding idiotic and trivial features that nobody cares about like ""calories"" (seriously, who spends development time on that instead of things that actually matter) or overhauled animations or garbage like that...We've got the bones but there just isn't any meat, and there's not gonna be any within the foreseable future.If you want some fun for around 10-12 hours, this is your game...but anything past that? No. Even No Man's Sky is less boring.Not recommended.			"

								Project Zomboid is that game I can't stop coming back to. I have dozens and dozens of games on steam but after a while I always start to get an itch to head back to the zombie infested worlds that I've spent hundreds of hours in already. PZ is not messing around and it will mercilessly end your existance. And again. And again. Then eventually you'll get some food, shelter, weapons, etc. and start feeling good about yourself. You might think you've ""beaten"" the game because there's no way you can die now. Then with no warning your power goes out, the water stops running, and all your food goes rotten. Yup. Such is life in the zombie apocolypse.Project Zomboid is a hardcore retro-style take on the zombie survival and Minecraft-esque games that have become so popular over the last several years. While there are games that do similar things to PZ, none do them quite as well. This is a hard game and it doesn't pretend to be easy. It demands both focus and patience. You're not going to just pick up a gun and start cleaning out the streets, you're going to be sneaking house to house terrified that you'll get seen and praising the heavens when you find a can of beans. Easily the best part of this game is the community that's built up around it. There are hundreds of mods available for the game in the workshop that add so much impressive content and whole new areas. The developers have done a great job of both adding their own content and working with the modding community to ensure that the game never gets stale. The multiplayer servers are also great. This is a game that will absolutely consume you if you give it enough of a chance. Pun intended.			"

Early Access Review
								(I only played solo, so my rant is about my solo experience, I don't know how good the multiplayer experience is)This game showed a lot of promise back when I bought it but after coming back to this product now that it has been in EA for 3 years I gotta let others know about the issues I have with this game.There is no point.I'm not even going to get into the whole lack of meaningful updates and promises that they've yet to fulfill in detail, I'm not all too savvy about it. The problem I have with this game back when I bought it which hasn't changed at all is that there is no long-term point to anything. You create a character with its pro's and con's from the use of a profession and negative/positive traits and then the game lets you out into the gameworld (which is massive). The game doesn't really inform you well about how things work so you'd do best to look up stuff on google but whatever, you find a neat weapon, a good bag to carry loot in and then set off to find a house to claim for yourself. After you've found a nice little house that seems appropriate for defense and accessability(?) to the rest of the city so you can gather supplies you start the old crafting formula of building a base. Well, I found an axe by using a online map to find a hardware store and cut down trees and started crafting walls so I could keep my house as safe as possible, cutting off access to a lot of windows and putting sheets up on the doors which had glass windows on them so zombies couldn't see inside. In the process I've been scavenging nearby buildings for supplies and I have a revolting amount of preservable food and access to a nearby pharmacy that has any healing items I could possibly need. My house is safe. I'm well stocked. ...Now what?That's the problem I've faced in other survival games before and Project Zomboid is no different. You've caught the carrot that has been dangling in front of you, pushing you forward and now there is no carrot, so you look around and see nothing of interest. Why keep going? Why not just go home(stop playing the game)?The problem with PZ in its current state (and considering I haven't seen much changes in its gameplay formula for years I doubt this is going to change, regardless of how much the devs are promising things) is that there is no point to it. There is no end-game. In fact there is no early-end game, middle-late game, middle game or early middle game either. If the point of PZ is to survive for a very long time then the problem is that there isn't anything to hold your attention for such a long time. I had everything I needed within one day (I played yesterday offline on another computer) and once I had secured my future... Then what? What do I do to pass the time? Explore? And find what exactly? More loot so I can horde even more excess? There aren't any diaries or anything around that gives depth to the games world. There are no NPC's or quests. There aren't much unique stuff to find either. It's just more of the same. So what else is there to do? Craft more stuff? Sure, you could do that I suppose. But I've learned my lesson from other games and I know that I will just reach that point of ""now what?"" again  when I run out of stuff to craft. So why bother? I'm not crafting anything unless I need to. I don't find it enjoyable to gather resources and craft things when there is no reward that feels like a saving grace.You could go around killing zombies. But the problem there is that they respawn. So if your goal is to cleanse the world of undead filth then that's not possible. Besides, it's not really that much fun in the first place. The game was hardly ever difficult and you don't want too much difficulty when out ♥♥♥♥ing around killing deadheads either. Why? Cause the game uses a one-save system and if you die then you stay dead.So I can't recommend this game.It showed promise back in the day but at this point it is laughable how little progress has been made on the game and how many excuses they are pulling as to why nothing of substance has been added. The game is a big sandbox of nothing. No matter what you do to try and pass the time it is inevitable that you will reach the point of ""now what?"" and would you rather feel like you've wasted a couple of hours or that you've wasted dozens of hours on a game with no conclusion? Maybe the multiplayer is better since you can always ♥♥♥♥ around with a comrade, wouldn't know. Don't care to know. The solo experience of the game is severely lacking.Save your money and wait, if they update the game so that it finally has a damn point to playing it then great! Buy it then. And if it never reaches beyond a ""now what?"" then hey, at least you won't have to feel like you've wasted money on a product that never amounted to anything.			"

								I actually Live in Kentucky. :) PZ doesn't kill you, bad decisions do. ;)Pros------------------------------------ The Map? HUGE, the devs are going to add Louisville(So I've heard) as well. The map itself already sports four small towns, two of which are like mini cities in game, they are so big. The other two are like small towns(Still pretty big) Tons of woodland, farmhouses, hunting cabins and lakehouses. Gunstores, clothestores, supermarkets, trailer parks, and the Dreaded ""The Mall."" The Mall has every item you could possibly want, But don't go there. Saying ""The Mall"" to a PZ player is like saying ""Voldemort"" to Harry Potter.*Everybody Shudders* (o.o)The map is so big, you will probably never explore all of it in a week. I still haven't done it with all the hours I clocked in, I've barely scratched the surface.You are currently only allowed to spawn in places like West Point and Muldraugh (the two mini cities) but there are two smaller towns as well. One being called ""Dixie"" and the other Bedford (I think)- Realism (You will find no other game like this, it is incredibly challenging and makes you feel like you're actually surviving a zombie apocalypse.) The water and power gets shut off, Nature overgrowth after a period of time, roads crack, food rots, seasons change affecting survival dramatically. You could live off berries and trapping in the summer, but expect to survive solely on traps in the winter, as food is scarce.- Zombies (Because who doesnt love getting eaten at 3AM when you peek out of your safehouse)-Zombies beat down doors, smash windows and follow you out of two story windows, albeit jumping.They Also Horde up, so dont be suprised. :P- Survival (Build traps, farm, build rain collectors, build your own house, walls, fish, forage, etc.)- Live practically anywhere (Its definately a game about decisions, tactics, and overall using your head. If you try to be A Rambo, you generally wind up dead within about 2 game days at the least (Standard Survival mode time, about 1 whole hour) Though I have been killed in just mere 16 in game hours. That being said, You can live anywhere you want, in any house, or just live in the woods.-Ridiculously challenging (Expect 1 zombie to do nothing to a door, but set off a house alarm and fail to leave the house in time, massive hordes will be beating down the front door in 20 seconds or less. Its realism in the game also makes it incredibly difficult as one bite and you're done. Zombies are everywhere, and one jump from a window, one untreated wound, eating a rotten bird or rabbit or just dehydration and you're done. Just like in real life, death is everywhere in this game; and it finds you eventually. It's not really combat based, the gameplay is more centered towards survival, so it makes you think. -It has Several mini games about trying to defend a house with randomly spawned items from hordes that increase in number. Great for Ingame strategy practice.Hide behind that Bar with your ol' Twelve gauge and make a final stand, or barricade the windows and doors and ready that kitchen knife.There was also a mini game where you wake up drunk in a burning house, but that brings back bad memories. I don't like to talk about it. ._.-Sandbox Mode, which is probably the most played game mode in PZ. Customise everything about your game, from Make zombies Sprinters (Like 28 Days later) or make them Shamblers like ""Night of the living dead"". You can customize their senses, i.e. how well they can smell fresh blood(Dont cut yourself on broken glass from those windows. :P), how well they detect sound, how well they can see...You can increase the Zombie amount, Loot amount, season, time, The abundance of farming, foraging etc.You can basically set the scenario how you want.But Survival mode is the challenge, the default play of the game. Few make it past 3 months, even fewer live to see winter. There are those who have survived over a Year in game, and they are what our little PZ community like to call ""Gods"" because if you bought the game an knew the situation we PZ players face, you too would call them ""Gods"" :P-Weapons: Whether you like it or not, sooner or later, you're going to have to fight. How you do that depends on what you prefer in real life. If you wanna kick open your safehouse and send the Undead back to hell with your sawnoff shotgun that you made, Go for it. If you don't like guns and don't like the thought of stabbing with a knife, then nothing says ""I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" like flailing a claw hammer or some other blunt instrument in an attempt to fight the undead.If you like Sticking to the shadows or Sniping from the rooftops with your hunting rifle, they got Sniper rifles with Scopes.If you're passive aggressive they got pistols, meaning whilst you're trying to get out of that Gun store you're looting alive, you pop a couple zombies that are in your way and flee into the night with your 9mm as the Undead hordes chase after you.Keep to the shadows and live a quiet life with just your Club or blade, or be a tactical warrior who always looks to weigh any situation to their advantage, even if that means a couple boxes of 00 buckshot. (But Nothing says I'm pro like wiping out an undead horde with a camp fire.) :3-Guns: they got em. Shotguns, pistols and hunting rifles(Pretty accurate for Kentucky) with Customizations from long range scopes, ammo straps and using a Hacksaw to really polish your scattergun, if you know what I mean. ;) Lasers for the pistols, red dot sights, etc.Ammo is pretty abundant if you know where to look. There are places to find guns all over the map, and zombies tend to drop pistols and ammo often (With the Lucky trait)-Fortify your base: Just like in real life, you can desperately kick in doors and make planks to barricade windows if you think that a zombie eating you alive whilst you sleep is gonna be a problem.Though nothing will save you if a horde comes and you chose to live in a one story house. D:-Jobs: Your character will be who you want them to be. If you choose the police officer as the job you had before the outbreak, then you will be calm in panicky situations and good with a gun.Lots of Jobs to choose from though. - The Devs themselves are really loving, down to earth folks and respond to their customers and even ask for suggestions to add to the game. (Sometimes they even add it if they think its a good Idea) Which makes them unique. :) Of course I could go on and on (Which I already have done) :P But you get the idea.Its a really good game in that spectrum it offers far more than I mentioned, and I know its in Early access, so it isn't complete.Cons------------------------------------------------------------------I live in Kentucky as I have stated, and the biggest problem I have seen that take away from realism in this game (Since it is based in Muldraugh) is that Kentucky is like most other states, except the people here, almost everyone and their grandmother owns guns, and hunting equipment. It rarely snows, and the summer heat is extremely intense, and it barely ever rains. They got the extremely rural part right though. :P-It rains too often in game (Kentucky rarely gets rain, so our crops die alot. And the snow thing, we get a good snow about every 3 years, so ingame it should probably be rarer. It's usually just rainy and cold.)-Hunting and kitchen knives are rare in game, but in reality, Kentuckians own more knives than baseball bats, and golf clubs.-Guns are extremely Rare,  in reality as I have stated, every other household has a Gun here. I would expect it to be different in Project Zomboid.Shoot, I watched my little 60 year old granny cut tree branches down with a Scattergun. Wait, what are we talkin about again? :P Yall take it easy and be sure an give this review a like or two.			"

								Its like the Sim's in a Zombie apocalypse except it's just you, your the last person alive (that hasn't turned), no friends or family to be with (unless you play multiplayer). There will be NPC's added in future patches but the interactivity with these is still unknown, they will most likely be hostile.In the early game your first challenge is finding a decent weapon, as a Spoon just doesn't cut it. However, breaking into peoples houses can set off security alarms, which attracts nearby Zombies that will chase you down unless your quiet and stay out of eyeline. During the first couple of weeks the Electricity is working so you can use household appliances like Ovens to cook food. It's not long before it turns off and you have to resort to eating canned food (if you have a can opener) or other dry products. Most food in the fridges will go off quickly as it is no longer chilled. You can cook your own meals by building a Campfire though I found this unnecessary as it's easy to stock pile large amounts of none perishables. Eventually the stored food will run out as well as the Water supply. You will have to come up with other ways of survival like Farming, Fishing and collecting Rainwater in Barrels. Learning Carpentry skills is essential as you can then use collected Wood to make all kinds of structures like Wall's, Box's, Furniture, even Barricades for your Doors and Windows to stop the Zombies getting in your safe House. BTW you can cut down Tree's with most weapons it just takes much longer than an Axe.The game really is a survival sandbox with no real story except the one you make for yourself. Overall I enjoyed this game more so than games like DayZ. I like the isometric 3rd person viewpoint as opposed to 1st person as you can see if someone is sneaking up on you.The developers have announced that future patches will contain NPC's and Vehicles which will add another dimension to the game.I give this game a solid 8/10 and can recommend it to people who like sandbox style survival games.TIPS: Always carry Beta Blockers with you as it reduces your panic level when around hordes of Zombies. Carry bandages & Painkillers as if you get bitten/scratched your less likely to turn if you attend to the wound immediately. Always carry a spare weapon as low durability can cause them to break. Take Drinks & none perishable Food with you as you may be away from your safe House for a long time. Find a ""Large Hiking Bag"" as it can carry the most items. When exploring buildings, whack Doors before you enter. This will let you know if there is a Zombie on the other side as they will start banging on the Door. Give yourself escape routes, when I enter a building I open all the Doors as you can quite easily get pinned down by charging Zombies. Take spare clothes with you (unless your already fully clothed) as you can die from Hyperthermia / Hypothermia if there is a sudden temperature change. Attack crawling Zombies from behind, they are slow to turn around and much less dangerous.			"

This is the story about how I diedJuly 23rd 2015I don't know how I got into this. Not long ago, I was an aspiring cinematographer that just finished his work on a movie soon to be released; had a party with my wonderful friends to celebrate the wrap. Was about to propose to my girlfriend, Liz.But now, I am all alone. It's a weird, terrible feeling to know you are alone in this world. It reminds me of the moment when I got lost at a mall, separated from my mom when I was a little child.Noone's there to give me a hug, to cheer me up, to dry my tears.All my friends, my family, my colleagues turned into these terrible, mindless creatures that run after me and just have one thing in their minds: to disembowel me. Why am I still alive at all? It just doesn't make any sense to me.I need to leave our...I mean my house, all windows are broken and these monsters are just awaiting the moment I fall asleep to get me.July 24rd 2015I just found out that my neighbors fled to the north as I'm reading their note directed to their daughter who was expected to come home from college. I found her, in pieces on the floor and wallpaper. What a tragedy, she was so beautiful and smart.I knew her dad likes to drink so I took his whiskey and a few blankets. Maybe they get handy one day. I found a house to live in; but I don't feel safe- I need more blankets to disguise the windows. Luckily, the former owner had a good storage of food.Ok, I will f***ing leave... just needed to kill five zombies- this area is polluted with these rats an I was wounded on my right hand.Used the whisky to disinfect and blankets to bandage. Hopefully, it will help.... hopefully? Or isn't it better to die? I feel the urge to make a rope out of the blankets I found...July 25rd 2015I finally found a small, secure house. In the surrounding houses I found enough stuff to close the windows. I expected it would be difficult but in each house I found their owners turned to monsters. I don't know how many people I killed. Men, woman and even kids. Although I have a rather safe place to sleep, I feel like if each minute a small part of me dies.While accessing a house I cut both of my forearms on broken glas, I aches like hell. And finally, I accidentally triggered an alarm and there are hundreds of zombies around. I can't hear that sirene anymore. Hopefully, its battery dies soon. I feel like a  kid when I press my face into the pillow just not to hear that terrible noise of zombies scratching on the outside of my shelter.I'd like to drink the whisky to raise my mood but I need to keep it to clean my wounds. July 26rd 2015I spotted a zombie waiting on my front door. I thought it would be the best to kill it, but I didn't recognize another one just around the corner.I killed both but I'm heavily wounded. I don't think I will make it.If this is the last record you read- I'm Dan, 34. Liz, I'm coming back to you.			"

Early Access Review
								Review posted on 7/8/2015 Build 32.To give you a little bit of insight as to the type of person this review is coming from.I have played a good number of Zombie Apocolypse games with and without the survival element and am a big fan of the genre/concept.One of my favorite story(s), accounts, or portrayals of this genre would have to be World War Z (the book by Max Brooks, the movie is rubbish in comparision).No it is not perfect I would not try to tell you otherwise, I see people on the forums who are having issues installing or running the game for various reasons. Personally I had no trouble at all, it runs great except for occasionally closes out of the game completely upon exiting out of the current game, which should have brought me to the main menu. It is often easy to forget that this game is still in early access. While there are many exciting items and features planned for the future, the game feels and plays almost like a finished game.Here are some features in the game at the time of this review that I like and/or appreciate and feel add a substantial amount to the immersion of Project Zomboid.-Crafting & Barricading.-*Combining.-Day & Night cycle.-Logical loot distribution.  In other words you will find loot in places that make sense in the world.-Hunger & Thirst system.-character creation process.  Play as a male or femle, name them, choose a pre apocolypse profession (each profession comes with bonuses) or unemployed, plus give them merits and flaws. (I am paraphrasing here, I forget what they are called in game).-Weather (rain, snow) and yes, seasons!-Temperature system.-The ability to create your own ""custom sandbox"" zombie apocolypse-Upgrading and repairing. Bat+hammer+nails=Spiked Baseball bat, then use tools to repair it when needed.-Item conditions. Weapons get damaged and then eventually break.-Functional L.O.S. (Line of Sight) for both players and Zombies.   In other words you can only see the zombies in the direction your character is facing.-Multiplayer. Lots of Servers to join.-Skill system where if you want to improve a skill, you have to keep using it...and live long enough to improve it! Also you can read books related to skills for a xp boost when said skill is used.*Combining. Example A: I already have a kitchen knife and a jar of peanut butter. Find some bread, use the knife to cut the bread, knife+sliced bread+peanut butter=peanut butter sandwiches.Example B: Enter a house that still has power. Already have a frying pan equipped. Look in the refrigerator. Frying pan+chicken+peas (perhaps with a dash of salt and/or pepper, optional) = chicken and vegetable stir fry. Turn on the stove, place the stir fry in the pan on the stove, cook, and yum!Honestly I am glad I paid full price. Yeah I know it might sound crazy, it was just on sale not long ago but honestly the devs deserve every cent.I would easily give this game in its current state a 9/10. *Important* Just keep one thing in mind, this game is hard. Actually for those who may not know, you CANNOT win. There is no cure for the zombie virus and I am not sure if that will ever change. Playing Project Zomboid is playing out the story of a character, the story of how they died. This may be a deal breaker for some, which is why I bring it up. There is no way to 'WIN"" the game, you just survive as long as you can.			"

Early Access Review
								The Sims meets the end of the world - simply put! - This game has the most hours played in all my steam collection (with the possible except of DayZ where i have spent DAYS running from town to town) - If you love zombies this game is the best one on steam - First off Its indie developers are a lovely bunch of people who care passionately about their game, Modders have been taken into the fold - Don't let the early access put you off - its got one of the best communities of any game ever!Day 1 you start in a random location with nothing - and basically you have to survive, you won't though, no matter how good you are - eventually you will die - if its from rotten food, a small cut climbing through a broken window - or a helicopter flying over and bringing the zombie hoard to your door - you WILL die.The tension in the game is incredible, looking at the graphics you won't believe how invested you can get in your base/Equipment/character but you do - The tension when you're scouting a house and a zombie comes at you from nowhere and you have to beat him down with a frying pan - its just so intense!I have nearly 200 hours in this game, and it cost me less than £10 - I have converted about 5 people to the game, bought it for 3 other people WITH MY OWN MONEY because i would like to support the development.With NPCs coming - All new animations and running system (which looks amazing) - Split screen Co-op - Multiplayer this game is going from strength to strength - My go to survival game, and the most fun you can have with your shirt off!

								NPCs have been in development for years now.The animation update that was supposed to come out several major builds ago has been in development for years now.There's still an absolute dearth of content other than smacking zombies and looting houses. None of the story progression stuff, or any of the more interesting gameplay mechanics like mental states actually being important have been implemented. I remember, back when the devs suffered a loss of much of the game's data due to a burglary (I think?) and lacking an offsite backup, and one of the devs went on a drunken rant on twitter- I remember defending them, saying that sure, it was stupid to have only one backup, but this game was shaping up to be the zombie survival RPG thing that we all wanted at the time. Several years down the line, no meaningful progress has been made.			"

								Best Zombie Survival Game Available.  If you havent played it...its like never having tried Sex, Drugs or Rock N Roll.  You'll be telling your friends OMG its AMAZING...DayZ is great for the ""First two weeks, close up experience""   7D2D is great for the building, fun and zombie killing action.Project Zomboid however is the best at giving you a simulation that captures the REAL fear, the melancholy, and the grim seriousness of being a survivor in a zombie apocalypse.The level of detail, depth and design of the game is sheer brilliance, and the Development team is a case study of how to do things right, you cant say enough great about them.Many different settings to tailor the game to your own taste, Fast or Slow Zombies?  Strong or Weak? Is a bite something that just needs a bandage or should you start making funeral arrangements ( AKA Drunken Bleach Fueled Suicide Run Going Down Guns Blazing ).You decide.			"

								Attempt 1. I spawned in an office inside a construction site where I Found a pencil and a piece of paper. I Went outside and got attacked by zombies. I managed to kill a few with my pencil but got quite scratched up. I hopped the fence and got attacked again, My Pencil broke in a zombie skull and I got bitten on the arm. I managed to get away but was moving slowly due to my injuries. I found a house, ripped up a shirt and bandaged up my wounds. I went to the bathroom to look for some pain killers but found a zombie and got hurt again. I stumbled from the house and got attacked again, I headed towards some trees to try to lose the pursuing zombies but died just as I made it to cover.Time survived 6 hours. 4 zombies killed.Attempt 2.I spawned in a trailer park where I found a school bag which I filled with a selection of food from the fridge and a bottle of water.  I went trailer to trailer gathering more food until I found a baseball bat. I left heading north and found a house to stay the night. The house across the street looked like a good place for a base with a high fence around 3 sides. I went through neighbouring houses, sheds and garages for supply’s during the days and read some beginners books for carpentry and cooking by night. Zombies kept wandering into my garden over night and I had to clear a few out each day with my trusty baseball bat.  I found a warehouse while exploring and found a hammer, nails, saw and axe. After a day of chopping trees and sawing logs I closed off the entrance to my garden to a narrow opening and that seemed to keep the zombies out. I got good at killing zombies with my new axe while on supply runs, Things were going well. I got over confident and managed to scratch myself on a broken window. I bandaged it but after a two days of replacing bandages I had an infection. I pushed forward my plans to raid a medical centre I had seen a long way south. I travelled the train tracks and entered the medical centre. The alarm went off as I made my way through but I carried on stocking up on supplies even as I heard zombies entering the building from the front. I planned to hop out the back window when I was done but they came through there too, trapping me. I battled my way out of the building but was scratched and bitten and in a bad way. I headed to a nearby house I knew I was going to die. So I stashed my bags of gear in a cupboard and went outside to die.Time survived 8 days and 14 hours. 147 zombies killed.Attempt 3. I don’t know where I am but I've got a rolling pin and I’m gonna find my house and then go and get my stuff back!I would definitely recommend this game. I’m only interested in playing single player mode so I feel it really needs the planned NCP characters to add more interest to the game. Also looking forward to the addition of vehicles. The new animations in the weekly blog look like they will improve the look too.			"

								This game is an absolute blast. It's hard to effectively convey how much fun this game is, because it doesn't seem like it would be fun and the trailers and screenshots do not do it justice, at all. But believe me when I say; if you're looking for a truely intense zombie apocalypse survival experience that is as realistic as it gets, where almost every moment incites true butterfly-inducing terror that resonates with your innermost being, while giving you all of this glistening, pant-soiling brilliance in a slightly retro, top-down, isometric view. This is your game. I mean, for pete's sakes, you have to change your bandages at least twice a day or you run the risk of making your wounds infected, which will slowly kill you, unless you disinfect them with alcohol and a sterilized bandage. You have to cover up windows with blankets, otherwise zombies will see you/lights inside houses and they absolutely, definitely, positively will check and break a window. When you get bitten? It slowly gets worse as you succumb to the zombie virus, you don't die instantly. You get paranoid of anything, you become fatigued and, after about a day, you die. Slowly, but surely. This game is cool as all hell.The controls are easy to grasp and the game runs smoothly, even if you're running the server software the game comes with and hosting at the same time, which is something I do frequently, to play with friends. It's also very easy to set up and comes with it's own server options.Speaking of options. Holy hell, the custom options for starting a new game are phenominal. You get to customize what your character is like, down to their personality as well as how often weapons spawn, how often things decay and what type of zombies you're dealing with. You could opt for a 28 Days Later feel, making them fast, strong and generally a massive pain in the backside, or if you're more into your Romero lore, you could set them up to be classic, brittle shamblers that seem to spot you from 700 lightyears away.Oh yeah, it's hard as hell as well. Don't expect to live forever, like other zombie games seem to allow you to do. This game is very realistic and eventually, you'll most likely run out of food and water. If you do manage to ensure your indefinite survival, then congratulations. You'd probably end up surviving a real zombie apocalypse.This game. Is awesome. 11/10. Best indie effort in ages.			"

								SINGLE PLAYER REVIEWProject Zomboid is like a crescendo that leaves you hanging forever.  Imagine climbing up a sheer cliff and then jumping off onto a giant comfy pillow.  That describes this game's difficulty curve.In the beginning you will be unarmed, unskilled and uncertain of what to do.  After a few trial-and-error deaths you'll get the hang of combat, how to move around safely, and what sorts of items you need to bring back.  You'll learn that some skills, namely carpentry, are far more important than others.  At that point you'll be faced with a choice of building a carpenter character or grinding your existing character into a carpenter through endless repetitive tasks.Why a carpenter?  One of the ultimate goals in this game is to build a safehouse that is impervious to zombie attacks.  You won't succeed without the carpentry skill, which lets you build walls, doors, storage devices and so on.  If you can build a wall around a water source and some dirt, you can eat and drink forever without risk of zombie attack.  This reveals the issue I have with Project Zomboid.  Once you have a nice stockpile and once you have a secure base, there is nothing else to do.  The zombies will never, ever be able to touch you unless you actively seek them out.  Even then, it's very easy to clear out the neighbourhood with an axe or gun to the point where you won't even see zombies anymore unless you set them to respawn in the world generation options.  In your safehouse you'll never run out of food or water so long as your sources are maintained behind safe walls.  Without the need to scavenge you'll have nothing to do except work on additional carpentry projects until you get bored, run outside with a shotgun and bag of shells, and court death in the middle of some giant horde.Project Zomboid says it is the story of how you died.  When you first start out, this will be absolutely true.  It's quite fun to sneak around town looking for bags of chips and planks of wood, although if you spend any time fighting you'll quickly learn how to lure zombies into chokepoints and kill them with impunity.  This game has been in Early Access for years.  I first played when you had to download versions from the Indie Stone forums, but I can't say that the game has really changed all that much.  It has a bit of a graphical overhaul, some additional features and types of loot, but also subtractions.  There used to be NPCs who would raid your house and hole up around town, but they've been removed and pending re-addition for ages.  All in all, it doesn't feel like the game has progressed significantly in spite of the years of development.  Likely, by the time a final release hits Steam 90% of the player base will have moved on to something else.This is a single player review, but it also extends to multiplayer with friends.  It's even easier with a couple of friends to build an invulnerable safe house and wind up with nothing left to challenge you.Final verdict:  It's quite fun for a few days, but once you get the hang of survival there will be no challenge.  Wait until if and when the game is finally done before you buy it, unless you love crafting games so much that you are desperate for a new one.  In that case, this game will tide you over.  If you have a lot of friends or want to play on a public server you can enjoy chaos, raiding and even warfare.  In that case the game may indeed be worth it.			"

								Been checking in on this game for years and it never changes. I used to be a devoted supporter, but have been seriously turned off by the development team's approach and lack of progress. Frankly, I don't believe that this game will ever be finished. I expect that the developers will eventually just get bored with programming an in-depth can opening simulator, release a half-finished version of the game, and move on.But seriously, I am disappointed. This one seemed like it had a lot of promise back in... Dammit, I was still in my twenties then!! *facepalm*			"

								Maybe I will bite my tongue (or should I say my fingers) and take my words back at some point. But for now I must say that this game is no more than a joke. Updates just doesn't make any sense. No vehicles, no npcs, no navigation - absolutely nothing that is really important. And things has been this way for few years now. Those """"""""updates"""""""" they're releasing reminds me horse armor dlc for Oblivion. It is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S. Just read the news feed for this game (and pay attention to the feature itself, not the way they tell about it) and you will kinda understand it on your own. Re-texrure, re-animation, re-sound and a new super feature ... CALORIES. Sounds fun, eh?They ""forbid"" to talk about that in their community forum, you see. They gone ""silence mode for our own sake"" (or some b*llsh*t like that) and don't give any feed about progress on serious stuff they promised long time ago. My guess - it's 0 and it's not going to be above anyway. Pretty sure they kinda mad they can't as well delete reviews here, in Steam store. Well, bad for you Indiestone, I will complain all I want here. Because I can. Because this is not your personal forum with only your loyal zombie-funboys army. After all, I paid my money for it. And I hope that at least one person will read my review and will not make this same mistake.			"

								It's not that bad of a game... BUT... It has promised quite a lot for a while now that it just hasn't given. We are only just getting cars and what not. The weapon system is rather flawed at the moment. The career options are rather limited and don't have much of an impact on the game. There is no story at all, so there isn't anything that really keeps you playing after like an hour or so. The crafting can be confusing to those that have never played this kind of game before. If we in the future get the NPC characters we have been promised for so long as well as some kind of story to follow then this will be a great game. I would hate this to turn into DayZ and be a derad title in the next year or so due to people giving up on the developers.			"

								I've been a fan/follower of this gamer almost since it first released, and enjoyed it then; it was a niche game at the time, and still sort of is, and quite fun (to me) if you have the patience for that. However;I haven't played this game (for more than 5 minutes) in over 2 years now, and development in that time has been close to zero - in fact it WAS zero, until a small update about a month ago. I stopped following the newsletter because there simply wasn't anything substantial going on - this game is just taking far too long to work on. Features that have been promised for years are still in development, mainly the holy grail of AI survivors, but Workshop support can help flesh out the game a little more, and multiplayer will add in other survivors, but still...It's definitely a good game, at least a solid 6 in my opinion, but with the constant promises of, and still lack of, certain features like MUCH needed vehicles, NPC's etc., it feels like the game has been let down - this would be a positive review if news hadn't been promising these features for years now. If you're happy with the game as it is now, as though it wouldn't ever change, then go for it I guess, but I can't recommend it right now			"

								Hi, I'm from the year 5527.NPCs and transportation are still 'coming soon'It's a good game for a while, and probably the best zombie survival game out there. It's just that the developers are so slow now that it's hard to actually recommend this game. They continually put out mundane updates and claim they are working on NPCs, but it's just so slow. This November it will be 3 years on Steam Early Access, and apparently it was out on their site for a while before then.Right now it suffers from the problem that every other survival game has - the world feels lifeless. Sure, there are zombies, but you end up feeling like the Omega Man.I'll come back to the review once NPCs have been added, should that ever actually happen.			"

								Game will never be finished, don't buy unless you want a solid 90s walking simulator without content. If you want to be bored and run around senseless and enjoy an empty world without opportunities (but with hordes of zombies at least), this game absolutely is  for you. Don't be fooled by the earlier positive reviews. The game once started promissing  but, as often, it's in Early Access since 6+ years now; in other words: the game will never be finished, it's just another eternal project of rookie coders.

								I have supported this game for a long time, have been patient, have given it the benefit of the doubt, and have done my time waiting.NPCs are never coming. They are not even being looked at. They were promised two, maybe even three years ago. It's never going to happen.I play the game every now and again to see what has changed, and all I keep seeing is the map getting bigger and more pointless items and clutter being added. This game is in dev hell. I bought it, because I believed it could be something great. And I still believe it could be, one day. Unfortunately that day may be sometime in the winter of 2050. You know, right after three hundred zombie survival games have been made from the ground up in the time it took them to implement NPCs.			"

								Project Zombiod is a cool game.I had looked at it a couple of times, but always veered away toward something else because of the graphics.When I look at titles described as ""rogue like"" or ""old school pixel graphics"", I make a little tsk-tsk-tsk and think to myself, ""c'mon it's 2015, make a great game AND give it modern, polished graphics"".I've never understood why a developer would create a game with retro graphics or why a gamer would choose a game like that.So yeah, I never would have purchased Project Zomboid, and it would have been my utter and absolute loss.The game really is great fun.  It's got depth, it's immersive, and when you are succeeding in your struggle to survive, it makes you feel like one man standing alone in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.You can do all kinds of things in this game, fighting and avoiding zombies, obviously, but when you loot common-place items, you can use them in all kinds of ways.  Barricade yourself, create sheet rope to have an escape from a top storey window, cut down trees, create planks, build all kinds of defenses, structures and utility items.  (And as you get better at your carpentry, the things you build look less rickety!)Heaps of ways to die, heaps of ways to survive.			"

								Never has drinking bleach been this much fun. Bleach is always realisticaly placed where it should be under most kitchen cabinents under the sink.

Each game I start up I challenge myself to see, just how much bleach I can actually drink before falling over dead. 10/10 game can't wait to see the finished product.Bleach Drinking Simulator 2012			"

Early Access Review
First of all I would like to give a special thanks to an anonymous friend who purchased Project Zomboid for me some time ago. To be honest, I do not believe anything I say can bring justice to how fantastic this game is to me. Though I will attempt to keep this review as professional as possible, I do apologize if there are outbursts of bias within the contest. Project Zomboid is a top-down zombie survival game in which the player must create a character destined to die in the world with the goal of determining exactly how long they survived during the grueling face of an overrun population, with plagued populations of undead serving as the opposing force. Since this game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s posting, it does not yet contain all of the features that are planned for the full release. However, in its current build, I would recommend it at its current sale price.Here are just a few of the things that make Project Zomboid such an amusing title:The Developers - I realize that this point is not a core component while playing the game itself, but I feel as though I must give recognition to the development team of Project Zomboid. I personally have never witnessed such a respectful cast of individuals when it comes to interacting with players and the game itself. As a primary mention, these individuals send notifications to subscribers consistently every Monday, termed Mondoid Monday by the Indie Stone, which provides readers with updates as to what ideas are to be implemented, answering questions from contributors, and informing players of the current build’s status. Though the game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s writing, these constant updates presented by the developers have the potential to comfort players such as myself as to the condition of the completed product. Project Zomboid may be considered by some to be concluded as it stands; this is much more satisfying in strict comparison to other Early Access titles that stereotype the build and tend to break promises.Pre-Game Setup - In the general disarray that encompasses the world regarding defeating and surviving against an endless undead hoard, there are certainties in the abundance of pre-game editing that tailor the experience as one that is unique to the individual player. ///  I would first like to speak about the initial world composition, which allows simple attributes while playing through modes such as Sandbox to be altered. With these features, the player creates how the apocalypse occurs by selecting a premade map, modifying certain functions such as how long a typical in-game day lasts-ranging from five minutes to a realistic twenty-four hours out of game-, and the period of time in which electricity and water will remain operational throughout the selected world. These attributes can be set to be more random while in Sandbox mode, but add so much to customization that they should not be overlooked; of course, the game was updated many times since my last online play-time so I may be missing out on some features as it stands.///  Character creation appears to be very simplistic but its intricate nature is revealed while the players flesh out their individual during play. The player selects a basic set of clothing as well as a profession, traits, and look; a character’s profession outline starting equipment and statistics while the character’s appearance is merely cosmetic. Character traits are where the game excels, though, as these allow the player to outline how they will possibly play. For example, a character with claustrophobia will be plagued with fear while indoors, but may have a trait which counteracts this. As players select possible traits, negatives must also be selected to even things out, so there is decent balance to this system.Undead Artificial Intelligence (AI) - The enemy AI react to players as you would expect them to: merciless, in a one-directional path with the intent of slaughtering the player’s created character to produce the end-game indication. As simple as this may sound, the undead AI in Project Zomboid is actually quite brilliant, as they can track your movements only if you are in a presented location-such as on the other side of an open window; a hoard crowds a character if a gunshot is heard. Interaction with these enemies intensifies the atmosphere of lay, and has likely been improved with more recent updates. Though neutral non-player characters are not yet present in Project Zomboid in the time of this review’s writing, tests by the developers suggest a promising finished product.Gameplay and Mechanics - Your character has much more depth in-game then what is in their biography and statistics sheet. There are multiple conditions which must be monitored by the player-including thirst, hunger, fear, mood, and physical strain. Given status effects may afflict the player such as fatigue, and determine the player’s tactics, with enough openness to allow the use of multiple approaches; with a world infested by the undead this is highly necessary as the game’s open-world style should permit such an approach. Unlike other top-down zombie survival titles, Project Zomboid features an impression of realism few others can accomplish: line of sight is paramount for your character, which enhances the survival aspect perfectly; be sure to watch your back! Apart from the conditions and base statistics associated with your character, they can also learn new skills such as farming, carpentry, and cooking to perform unique and useful tasks by taking time in-game to read related books. This system permits the player to specialize in specific skills that may enhance play.TL:DR - I regretfully can say that there are some features such as the Steam Workshop and Creative mode that I have not yet experienced, however the base game is so fantastic that I would like to vouch for it being worthy of its current retail price of fifteen dollars. If you enjoy more realistic survival games and combatting or running from hordes of undead while scavenging a rather large world, then this game is most definitely for you. This title is also recommended for players who enjoy roleplaying as characters in an open-world adventure; I prefer to write journals for my characters to enhance this aspect. Please give this game a go even in its current Early Access state. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

								Project Zomboid is a game I own since 2011, back when it was still only available on Desura and The Indie Stone's website. The hardships the developers have faced during the years of development and the passion they've shown for the game and it's community is extraordinary. Aside from that, Project Zomboid is also damn fun to play and this is what earns it my recommendation.Update 23-11-2016: Nominated for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award!

Early Access Review
								dont get me wrong i love this game.. well at least i did, here is why im starting to get annoyed.. having played this almost since the beggining of its gaming life i am finding its additions rather lacking... i jump on every 6 months hoping that NPCs would be introduced.. still not in the game? no worries i can wait, but at least bring back a random survivor, i miss kate so much... even if her dialogue ended after a few lines it still gave that sence that your finding resouces and needed to be brought back home... every house now is just a storage containment unit... but i can wait... I jump on and see that there adding a food calories section.. ok im starting to worry, why in gods name in a zombie survival game must i worry about my calories? Food quality i understand but am i going to have to start washing hands before i eat? Am i going to start brushing my hair... ok.i get some like that nonsence... but the last straw is seeing i now have to wash my clothes due to blood splatter WTF... this is a zombie survival game and every passing day its just turning into the Sims. If you havent played it yet, i strongly reccommend you do, but for those of us whom supported this game from the start its becoming a bit of a joke now. What exactly is your aim here lads? are you tring to create true Artificial intelligence before releasing NPCS, and thats what worries me the most, its almost like there vision is bigger than what it should be for this game. I honestly hope they succeed and i will change my downvote when the time comes, but this vote is just to show some displeasure at its direction. Come on guys i have faith in you, add a dog or cat that i can take home .. anything.Remember the guy in the supermarket with a shotgun.. found a survivor, starts shooting at ya, you panic knowing he is just bringing the horde closer and closer, take him down, loot what you can, run to safety.. that was exciting.. washing my clothes isnt.This Review was posted a while ago, but due to the nature of morons seemingly not being able to understand that i do love playing this game, it seemed to deviate from what i had wanted it to be.. a positively negative protest review that still urged people to play it, or at least get the demo and give it a go.. so im reposting it without the comment section that could only be described as cancerous.. Jesus Chuck Norris Christ, watch out for there fans.			"

Early Access Review
								I was alive. Now I'm not.I started in my house. It was a small little cottage, in a suburb close to the city.But there was a couple of pieces of food in the fridge, so I knew I needed to go out and actually scavenge. I did not know things were this bad though. Right when I stepped outside, one of them spotted me.Not wanting to lead it inside, I ran around the outside of my house. Little did I know that an entire group of them waited around the other side. I panicked and they spotted me. As they slowly shambled towards me, I ran back into my house into the bathroom. I frantically shut the door behind me. As soon as I did that I heard my windows shatter, along with pounding on my door and many low groans. I knew I couldn't stay there.I, as quietly as possible, snuck out my bathroom window while the horde pounded down my doors. I snuck past them and made my way to another small house down the road.On my way I had to take down one of them with my fists. I frantically beat the infected woman down until each my blows were responded with a crunch. I searched her body to find a pistol and six bullets.With that I felt invincible! Finally I had a weapon to use against them. Now when I got there I was exhausted. My house was destroyed and I had nowhere to go and no one to even talk to. I didn't even bother to check the house or close the curtains. I just immediately sunk into the closest bed I could find. I quickly fell into a deep slumber...Suddenly, I sprung up. I heard a window smash, and two figures were climbing through it, into my room. Terrified, I grab my pistol and fired at them, only landing about two shots.That was my mistake. I heard hundreds of more groans outside. The sound was deafening. I sprinted through the house to escape. But just as I opened the door, another one of them was right behind it! I fell back, only to have one of the ones from earlier grab and bite my hand. I jerked it away, leaving my left hand cut and bleeding bad. I scrambled past them to the nearest room I could find. As soon as I got in I slammed the door behind me. I was in another bathroom. But this one had no windows, no other doors, no ways to escape. As I turned back the way I came there was a loud 'thunk' on the door. It was quickly followed by another one.Scared for my life, I sunk back into the corner. I was still bleeding badly and was starting to hurt real bad. I had no meds, so I took of my sweater and tore it up to form a makeshift bandage. Hours pass. The banging on the door had continued relentlessly. I was still bleeding real bad and hurting even worse now. It felt like my bones would break with each move. I was now starting to think I was infected. That sudden thought of dying sparked something in me. I suddenly felt brave. I could take on whatever was outside. It didn't matter that I was half awake and starving. I could do it.I powerfully swung the door open, only to knock back one of them onto the floor. It seems as if the rest of them just straight up and left after their meal ""got away"". I bravely stomped it down, and opened the door to take on the world.I ran straight to the city in my fit of bravery. But the city quickly ended my fit of bravery. There were a lot of them in the city. It seemed like tons were waiting around every corner. Feeling defeated, I sheepishly slinked down an alley to go back. Only to have one of them at the end spot me. As I prepared to fight it, all the pain, hunger and tiredness from earlier flooded my body again. I tried to fight, but was powerless against the creature. I pulled out my gun, but was in no condition to shoot, much less aim. I obviously missed.That made it worse. The crowds funneled into the alley to feast on me as my body quickly was torn up. I drifted out of consciousness, into dark oblivion...Also you can garden. "

Early Access Review
								August 29th, 2016- The Developers showed us a working preview of the animation update in March. It is now about to be September and animations are still TBA. The past 8 weeks of Mondoid newsletters have been a constant stream of excuses and problems getting the animations together. Animations were slated to be added back in build 34 but were delayed. We are now in build 35.11 on the beta branch with still no animations. Week before last they were trying to get the Females working right so they could get them into the beta branch. The next week they had it working, but had to 'iron things out' (again) before releasing them into the beta branch. Now this weeks mondoid they are at a convention and no work is being done(again). As someone that keeps up with this game and religiously reads the Mondoid Newsletters every Monday over lunch, I'm entirely expecting at least 4 more weeks before we get any access to the animations that were shown back in MARCH. I really want to like this game, I've been keeping with it for 2 years now. But we still dont have any NPC's, animations, vehicles, or anything to do past setting up a base and grinding food for all eternity. Some things have been added over the past year(tv's and radios that do nothing but add story fluff and attract zombies). They've been re balancing nutrition now for months and its still not done. Lone modders have developed more content for this game in the past year than the dev team has. As of now i cannot recommend this game, maybe 2 years from now when it gets 'rushed' into 1.0, but certainly not right now.Update-September 5th- Still no animations. More problems getting them ready. Finally got a 'transfer all items button' programmed though(after years), and now you can dry a towel...September 12th- Still nothing. ""The new animations system is the first step in our internal plan to feed all our remaining 1.0 features into the game, something we’ll expand on once we’ve kicked the anims out of the door."" This is the same song we keep getting in the Mondoids. If this is the 'first step', and its taking this long, I expect it to be a several year plan.September 19th- Animations still not out. Another rehash of the ""Once we’ve got the Incidentals out of the way we can release and get motoring with the pipeline that leads to all of our other 1.0 features"" statement we've been getting for a few months now. They were a little more forthcoming with info this week on whats going on though. Evidentially after these months of working on the animations they still are full of 'gaps' and ""You can’t turn on a dime with the new animations, so it can feel a little clunky when you’re indoors"". They did get a few new things done this week, such as lumberjacks walking through trees faster, and the ability to find jars in packs for improved pickling mechanics.  Devoting team resources to pickling is more pertinent in a zombie survival game than the ability to move properly...September 29th- It has now been a month since I wrote this review and (surprise!) the animations still have not been delivered. I'm getting to the point now that I'm not even reading the Mondoids the day of anymore, because I know that the animations still won't be out and it'll just be another disappointing read. I feel like General Arcade is doing more work on this game than the actual dev team at this point...Here's to another month of fruitless patience!October 3rd- Month 2 begins with more delays in the animations as now the faces needed to be redone. Fortunately they gave the anims the ability to blow their own brains out this week too, so they dont have to suffer the incompetence of these devs anymore.October 10th- No update at all this week. They are too busy 'banging away'. Starting to take bets on how many more weeks... months, it's gonna take for the anims. My guess is sometime in 2017.October 24th- Gave an extra week to continue this review, thinking maybe that would give a little more time for some progress.... nothing has been done. Its now almost been 2 months since I started this, and the game is in the same exact state. Everything is still ""coming soon"" just like it was a year ago. Fortunately the devs have picked up on the fact that its fan base is turning against them, and made half the Mondoid last week about pleading for people to be patient. Maybe if we're patient for another year the animations will 'come out soon'... or (if the devs history repeats itself) won't.November 1st- After another lovely month of nothing we finally get some form of update! Now the map has more areas! You can continue to play the same outdated content in the same buildings with slightly different layouts! Never-mind that the animations still aren't done and are being talked about less and less in the Mondoids. As another month has now passed, Im once again reassured by the same ""we're busy banging away"" quote I've received on a weekly basis now for a year...December 5th- Another month gone by, still no animations in sight. Still 'banging away' indefinitely with not a single hint at release, the team is now working on testing the VOIP work General Arcade did for them. It has now been over 9 months since the animations preview was shown in a video demo. I could have conceived, grown, and birthed a human child in the time its taken, and TIS still don't have any clue of an ETA on animations.January 10th, 2017- Still no info or eta on animations. Devs are now preparing to outsource development on vehicles to General Arcade(they were actually able to do some work and get the VOIP done). Guess they are starting to feel less confident about their capability to code. Two more months of this and it will have been a year since the devs showed us that 'working' preview of the animations. STILL NO ETA IN SIGHTApril 4th, 2017- We are on Build 37.5 now and there are still no animations(they were said to be Build 34). As of now the animations have completely fallen off of the radar and are no longer being talked about. You get a nod to them existing at best. Vehicles are still being worked on, are the new big feature we are being teased with now(they seem to have forgot the last 4 big things they were working on for us), and will be out 'soon' once they are done 'banging under the hood' some more. In more tangible news: this weeks mondoid states that the new build will be in beta branch this week. Its been 4 months since the last build was released and in a 3rd of a years time they have managed to get a microwave ui and a lootable maps system done. Fortunately the devs are talking about hiring on outside AAA and indie devs to help them(probably since outsourcing work from GA is the only thing thats gotten anything substantial done recently). Can't wait to see how long until the vehicles fall off the radar and some new feature that will never come out is teased.  ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE WORKING PREVIEW OF THE ANIMATIONS WAS SHOWN.			"

								This game interested me for a while before I finally bought it.  I have to say it's well worth the 15 bucks I spent.  The atmosphere is amazing.  When I play I usually turn off all lights, and then use a headset for a full immersion experience.  I love the fact that you make the story as you go along.  I haven't played for very long, but with that said I will be playing this game a ton from here on out.  In my last play through I lived 16 days.  I found a huge warehouse surrounded by loads of zombies.  I cleared them out for a full in game day.  Finally when I was done I searched the warehouse.  The power was off by this time in the game.  I was stumbling around in the dark as I forgot my flashlight.  I went to the 2nd floor trying to find a bed or couch to sleep as I was exausted.  I thought I saw a door......well was no door was a railing.  Fell to first floor and got stuck behind crates with a broken leg.  Eventually I died as I couldn't move.  I killed over 200 zombies, secured my safehouse area, gathered enough food and water to last me a month in game time, and the thing that kills me is that.  This game is amazing! 10/10			"

								Amazing depth for an Early Access Release (although, going on 3 years now), so many things to find already, crafting and building seem endless and the zombies are classic Romero style...the Devs are very active on and off the forums with regular feedback and game updates / fixes...Explore, scavenge, build, kill, craft and more...with a story mode and NPC's down the road (way down the road), there is multiplayer, a day/night cycle, migrating zombie hordes, an ever growing map, modding support plus Survival / Sandbox / and Last Stand game modes along with a metaverse system that tracks off-screen survival...this will be a must have for anyone looking to play not only a great zombie survival game, but a great survival game period!How will you die?

TL;DRThis is as real as the apocalypse gets for video games.I've played lots of zombie games, like the Rebuild series, State of decay, the last stand, you name it, and this is the most realistic out of all of them.This is a great game whether or not you have friends to back you up and every playthrough is different especially if you choose different traits in game.Although this has a few minor items that make the game feel less real (like lack of clothing options or lack of cars) this is still a great game that you should try at least once.Pros+Constant updates (If you are using IWBUMS that is)+Huge map+Lots of player-made content+Very realistic+Mod friendly+Good community+Huge selection of items found in every day situations+Good crafting system+Good graphics+Very dynamic character upgrades+Players can get sick, injured, sad+Zombie speeds can be changed from walker, to jogger, to runner in settings+Still has room for a lot of improvementCons-For character torso, you either have a vest or sweater.-For character bottom, you can only have pants and shoes. (Or take it off)-No NPC's (Yet- I'm not counting this against the review)-No Cars (Yet- Again, not counting against.)RatingWithout a doubt a 10/10This gives other zombie games a run for their money in terms of realism, and I am scared and excited for this game's full release.This review will be updated upon playing the full release "

								When somebody sees this game, they might think it's just another early access zombie survival game, most of which being awful. However, this game is not another game where you play as ""the Rambo of the apocalypse,"" shooting every zombie in sight, crafting better and better weapons. Instead, you play as the average Joe, who somehow managed to not become one of the hundereds of zombies occupying Knox County. Instead of having some crafting table where you can build a castle right off the bat, you need to find everything needed to build the walls just to protect your garden. The loot system works pretty well, you find stuff where you would normally find it. Houses have average loot, including food, bats, golf clubs, and the occasional gun or case of bullets. Warehouses will generally have crafting supplies, police stations will have guns and ammo, and so on. You will find the occasional out-of-place item, like a gun or bullets in the elementary school. You need to debate doing anything in the game, since one slip-up could spell certain death. There have been way too many times where I decide to go loot a building by the highway and am ingulfed in zombies. The dev team, The Indie Stone have done a superb job at creating this game, and every update makes the game much more fun, realistic, and, of course, difficult. You will not find a better zombie survival game out there, and I more than reccomend it.			"

								The steam release date is so misleading. This game has actually been in developement for more like 5 years. I totally sympathize with the studio, what with their building being robbed of its computers and code at one point in developement. But its at a situation now where they should just bite the bullet and hire on more programmers. We've been waiting on NPC's for years now.I definitely recommend this game, but only once the NPC metagame is added and truly justifies base building.			"

Sad to see this one dieNow... I've never felt extreamly sad about a game dieing before, but this one is just a massive heartbreaker. So much potental... waisted.It is a Good game, honestly one of the best zombie apocolyse survivor sims out there, but if you are looking for a game that will finish in your lifetime then dont even bother. The only things that add any extreamly immersive content to the game are the mods that you can download off the steam workshop.A few years ago the devs were active, but now they're just not. Puny ""updates"" that add the most minor and trivial features to the game, with apsolutly no mention of the MAIN FEATURES they were talking about several years ago! The modding communty is more friken active, and involved then the devs are.I'll change this review when they actualy DO somthing with this game.			"

								Truly a good game. Eventhough without NPCs, I can still feel the feeling of isolation and hopelessness. When the eletric shut, I was desparate. When water finally hit, I keep hoping my rain collector will be enough. My garden hardly sustain me. Zombies are everywhere. No one to talk to. Everything is hard. Life beome dull and moody.I have truly feel the feeling of the apocalypse.The bad:Roads look unrealistic with 90 degree angle, little to no tutorial,crafting is confusing.Items lack tooltip to show what we can do with them.Too much useless items with no real use yet.Guns are not viable.Stealth mode need improvement.Map still have flaws.Annoying popup iventories get in the place when you try to look up to spy enemies.No sitting animation, no jumping. I wish I could sit down and read the books. but no, I have to stand there reading.			"

								The only true zombie survival game out there probably. Seriously, this game is worth the 15 dollars, especially if you have a friend. It may be early access, and the devs might be a bit slow at releasing FULL new builds, but you can play the new builds in play testing pretty much every month. There is alot of polish on this game, which is probably why it takes so long to come out with new builds. This game is a SIMULATOR pretty much. Not a joke, you gotta eat, sleep, watch your wounds, not panic, not get tired....it's a tense experience all around. If you get bit, you might as well drink bleach or chug sleeping pills and wait for it to end, or go out in a blaze of glory. You can do whatever you want in this game, build a base at a motel, live in the forest by farming and collecting rain water, or just be a nomad. Just be prepared for when winter rolls around...... ANYWAY! This game gets a solid 9/10, completely reccommend. Only reason it isn't 10/10 is because, while it has enough content to justify even a 25 dollar price tag, it IS in early access. That comes with the full early access package of: Bugs, glitches, unfinished content, etc. But like i said before, these devs are trustworthy. And EVEN IF THEY DID run away with the money, it's still a game worth checking out considering it is comlpete enough to justify the price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Zomboid is an immensely intricate, challenging, rewarding game supported by a dedicated team of indie developers, and is a must-play for anyone interested in the zombie survival genre.Many people choose to turn to the FPS genre for their zombie apocalyptic survival games, but with Project Zomboid, I feel that the developers at The Indie Stone scratch that itch perfectly.For starters (and I feel that this is sorely mentioned in reviews), The Indie Stone has been CONSISTENTLY developing this game since it was released on Steam. They continue to show their passion for this project with regular updates, developer blogs, videos explaining new features, and much, much more. They have provided a strong example of how Early Access is supposed to be done, and I fully anticipate that they will have a full release of this game at some point (though, as far as I'm concerned, the game in its ‘early access’ state is worth far more than the $15.00 asking price).As for the game, mechanics can be read about here in other reviews, found online (particularly in the Zomboid Wiki), or learned as you play – they aren’t that difficult to grasp, and their simplicity makes the game that much more charming.HOWEVER, do not be deceived by the surface simplicity – this game is incredibly challenging, and as a good game should, it rewards those who ‘get it’ with a truly unique gaming experience. Every time I start up a new character, I get further than I did on the last. Let that be a testament to the game’s consistency – you’re not going to die constantly from zombie bites if you know how to evade/fight them; you’re not going to bleed to death if you know not to climb through a broken window OR how to patch yourself up if you do.Virtually any building can be made into a shelter. Doors and windows can be barricaded. Ropes can attach to upper story windows for security. Furniture can be moved, taken from other buildings and brought to yours, or built. And with tools like the sledgehammer, virtually anything can be destroyed. You can even build entirely new structures once your carpentry skill is high enough and you have the supplies to do so.How do you get the supplies? Looting. This game’s inventory system is simple and repetitive at times, but it gets the job done. Backpacks and hiking bags help you deal with the large amounts of weight you’re going to be carrying. Looting houses, diners, warehouses, and even banks requires thought and skill to decide what you need and what you don’t. Supplies are finite, so there’s always the constant thought of, “well, maybe I’ll need this box of paperclips sometime! Better grab it now while I’m here!”When looting, be careful of your surroundings. Zombies are almost always present, and while at times the game can feel like more of a general survival simulator rather than a zombie game, they’re always lurking around the next corner.I could go on and on about the intricacies of this marvelously crafted game, but suffice it to say that, if you’re looking for a zombie game that surpasses the norm and want to support fantastic indie developers, look no further than Project Zomboid.

								SECOND EDIT: Another two months have passed and they've made no progress whatsoever on animations, let alone NPCs (don't ask about them on the forums, anyone who isn't a moderator will jump on you in an instant). They seem to be focused on making food realistic instead. This will be my last edit as I'm officially done with this game and it's devs. Goodbye Project Zomboid, it was fun.EDIT: It's been about five months since I wrote my original review. Literally nothing has happened development wise, and I do mean literally. This last mondoid was what prompted me to write this, seeing as the last year has been ""animations right around the corner, coming soon"". As far as I'm concerned this game is dead in the water and won't be finished. Don't waste your money.I've had this game for a very long time (Around 3 years) and many others have had it for even longer (Around 5 years). The general consensus among non-fanboys is that the development time is overly slow and the Dev's ""It's finished when it's finished"" policy is detrimental to their standing. Anyone asking about NPCS, vehicles, etc has their thread locked and are sometimes banned. However, the game is still very good. One of the best Zombie Survival Games out there. The problem is that without NPCS single player gets extremely lonely and tedious, and in multiplayer some features can't be properly used because you can't time skip (IE Farming). Once you get farther into the game you pretty much just sit in your fort and eat/sleep, or in multiplayer you do the same but without sleeping. When the game is finished (2 years from now at least), I'll give this game a wholehearted recommendation. Until then I'll not support TIS until they deliver on years old promises.Pros:+Large maps to explore+Good crafting system+Good injury system (Simple, but still)+Good graphics for a top down gameCons:-Boring combat-Shallow end game content (Sit in an invincible safehouse with unlimited food/water)-Lack of weapons and clothing-Guns are completely worthless-NO NPCS-No ETAs whatsoever, any questions regarding undelivered content is met with ""It's done when it's done"" and a lock. EDIT: This is no longer the case, the mods are much more lenient about this now. Fanboys will attack you however.			"

								ShakyShawn8151's Review: I played this game in the past, and just recently picked it up on steam. I played it when it was not very well developed. Then today I picked up a copy and I will share with you all my experiance.Started out by clicking beginer. I am no noob to survivial games, so I started out in a nice house. It was a 1 bedorom flat with a open living/dining room. there were curtains on all the windows so I took the chance to close them after taking a glance out them to check my suroundings [It was all clear]. I then had a small sence of security that I knew would not last for long, as all it takes is for my poorly spec'd char to make a noise and attract walkers (thankfully I did not see any runners). I then made my way to the kitchen and saw that there was 2 windows, one with no curtain and one by the door, which was really good as I did not want to open the door and be rushed by zombies. I grabbed a sheet I found and covered it over the other window.  The house was now poorly secured and would provide a temporary shelter. I then went though the house and looked for all things that i could put to use. Sadl all I found was some food, which I ate then decieded I had to journey out to the unknown or I would not survive an attack or defend my shelter, I looked out the windows and tried to get an idea of what was around me, I saw another house to the east of my location, so I had to get there and hope it was empty.After I left out the back door all sence of security left me, and I felt like a small part of a huge world. I looked around a bit and slowly made my way to the backdoor of the house, I then did not feel safe to just walk right in, so I snuck around to each window and peaked in and saw every room was empty, besides the one that did not have a window. I then entered the house via the backdoor, and started looking the house, I found a skill book (cannot remember which book it was) I then took a bat, some sheets, and some food, I then snuck back to the house I started in. After stuffing my face my character started feeling like a fat misserable person (depression kicked in). I then found a magaziene in the bookshelf and gave it a read hoping this might take the players mind of the depression, after a good 5 minutes of messing around I went to gets some sleep after going out and checking to see if the perimiter was safe and secure. I slept for 7 hours.I awoke with one thought; ""How long can I survive like this""I searched and looted, and fought my way day by day, every day being harded than the last, food running shorter and shorter. I ended up getting caught while transvering the forest in the night (Which I still feel like an idiot for) I was panicing out in the rain in the dark, and was trying to get back to my shelter. I had not known that I had a pack of zombies on me, and I ran back into my shelter. within 2 minutes that had me surrounded so I knew I had no way out, I was a sitting duck, I managed to use up the ammo I did have and had to run upstair to fend off what I could before I met my maker, I was backed into a corner and fought to keep 15 zombies at bay with a hurt leg and bleeding for 3 minutes before I died... 9/10 would die again and enjo my experiance anyday. was a good buy. HIGHLY RECOMENDED			"

You can even choose passive skills✔You can build your own fort with garden, generators, traps and etc.✔Sound design of the game. It creating depressing and sometimes horror mood. Perfectly fits the game✔Regular updatesCons:✘Lack of NPCs and venicles (you can hardly call it cons,cause they definitely gonna be in full version).So far i cant find any serious issues in this game.

Get to a house to want to hole up in, start covering the windows with sheets, miss one or you miss a zombie that followed you. The next thing he's beating down the window, attracting everything around, you panic. You go outside split him with a hammer. Go back inside, you're safe - for the night...10/10 would die again.

								If only they spent as much time trying to finish the game as they do writing essays.Zomboid isn't as much of a mess as most other EA games I've bought into or seen, but the bar for EA games has fallen very very low. If you play zomboid you'll probably have a good time. That good time will last a few days depending on how many hours you can get in, but once you figure out how to survive and build your first safehouse, you'll lose intrest quickly.I can't recommend the game at this point while it's missing so much content, and while I'd like to say I'll come back and change my review when it's done, somehow I feel it'll still be unfinished years from now.

								I remember when they said the game was going to be 'finished' in 2016...here we are in 2017 still undone with little added since. There's been no talk of NPCs for damn long while and honestly whats a zombie game without interaction with a 'human' faction? A good zombie narrative isn't about the zombies, its how the humans survive. Yet they're focusing on cars(which was brought up well after npcs) and other 'new' stuff that doesn't change the game much. At this point, if you're looking for a good zombie game your best bet is playing a FREE roguelike(Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead)  or waiting until State of Decay 2 is released.			"

You can even wall in the entire downtown area and be a self proclaimed mayor. Imagination is the only limit. +Realistic zombies with tons of options to customize them to your liking in sandbox mode. Only want shamblers, with bad hearing, excellent eyesight, average smell, dont respawn after being killed and is urban focused? YOU GOT IT! PLUS a TON more options. +Looting and scavenging for survival. Break in to every house and see what goodies you can find, maybe it is a former survivor house with tons of food stashed away or maybe the house alarm will trigger and draw massive zombies to you location, LEG IT!I mean, I just scratched the surface here, I could go on and on about this game. it is fantastic! AND it will get better. With a mature community and a developer that listen to its players, thing can only go in one direction. "

								Alright. First of all, I do not know why I am writing this. It won't probably get noticed, but if you are reading this, and are thinking of buying it, listen up.Do you like left 4 dead? If you do, this game isn't similar to that, at all. This is a game where you create a story. Create a character and try your best to live his last days or weeks (or even months, if you're skilled enough). This is a game of patience. You have to slowly experience your character to his limits. You have to teach him how to fish. YOU have to teach him how to build a fort, and you have to teach him how to fight the greater evil. Be careful though. This isn't a story about how you suddenly met 100 zombies and went full rambo on them and now you're the old man telling your grandkids these tales. It is a story, a tale on how you survived against the dozens of hordses what came around when the mankind fell. This game, THIS GAME is the one where you can prove your point with your friends in the argument of ""Who is the one of us to die first?"" or ""Who will last longest?"". This is the suitable game for that. They are even going to add advanced NPC's soon that are going to function just like a normal player. Spooky, aint it? Now, back from the character. The music is extremely good. Let me give you an example of an interactive music demo from ingame music. Click on the link, and read the text and try to live the story. You don't have to listen to the whole song.Imagine the violins playing when you've fought your last battle, and got bitten. You know you have a few hours left and decide to take your stuff and leave. You wander off to the city. The city is quiet, but suddenly zombies appear around every corner. You ready your shotgun.Your panic increases when you put the bullets in the barrel and you become slower every second. You dropped a bullet accidentally out of panic. There's no time for more reloading. You equip your shotgun and stand still for a few seconds to aim correctly into the horde. A few zombies fall, but it doesn't hinder the movement of the undead. You take a few steps back and you fall. You get up as fast as you can. You can hear the zombies growling a hundred feet away.You arrive home. Your last moments are near. You open the drawer and find a picture of your family, dead a long time ago. Your tears drop down the picture, and it gets wet. After 30 minutes of crying, the tears start fueling your rage. You are after revenge.You return to the horde. You walk slowly and wait until the zombies hunker near you. You have your trusty machete in your hand. As the zombies come you slice them up and roar like a predator from every slaughter. As you work your way through all of the zombies, they start to increase in numbers. Suddenly, when youre swinging the blade into the skull of the last nearby zombie, the color of your sight starts to disappear. You now see only in the colors of white and black. You try to retreat but eventually pass out.THIS IS HOW YOU DIED.The game will become even more masterful when the seasons, the medical overhaul, and the other survivors arrive. Just wait. I love this game. You should try out the demo if youre still considering, but I have a few things to tell you. Enter houses through windows, holding E when you are trying to access them. The doors are rarely open. You also have limited time, because the character youre playing as has got bitten. It gives some taste what the game is like. I have no idea how outdated it is what-so-ever.Oh, its an early access game? The devs are the most active devs I've ever seen. They are very systematic, every monday there is an update of what they are doing, was it big or small, its still there every week. They are also open for suggestions, as they added a brilliant mod to the develop scheme a few weeks ago, what introduces seasons. I would reccommend this game to anyone, and soon you can still play it alone with no friends because of the NPC's. You can literally team up with them and arrange them to loot for food and such.

Early Access Review
								Dawn of the Zed - Lively Community :DFor a top down survival game I was pleasantly surprised. You spawn in random house in one of three small american towns (connected by roads) and are tasked with surviving as long as possible.In the PvE servers I found this very fun. Zombies aren't very dangerous individually but when a zombie hits you it applies a 1 second invisible debuff that halves your movement speed. If multiple zombies are hitting you then it stacks to the point where you can barely move at all. What's more if you are wielding anything other than a knife then your character can only shove and grapple with zombies when they are pressed up against you meaning that if 4-5 zombies grab you then you are doomed, you will only be able to keep shoving them away but they close in again before you have pushed them all away from you.With good timing you can still melee groups of 10 zombies, swinging just as they are about to enter range but this is absurdly dangerous and you will need to attempt to divide the groups by luring the slightly faster ones away or running around the group picking off stragglers. Or even just play is safe and avoid them, you get little loot from zombies and are encouraged to kill them only if ignoring them is even more dangerous.Guns are powerful but take skill to use with the exception of the shotgun which is almost as effective at low skill as high skill. However they make a lot of noise and draw zombies from VERY far to your location so you will mostly want to use melee weapons and only fire a gun if you have 100+ shotgun shells and intend to clear the entire areaThe game uses a profession, trait and skill system. Different professions offer different skill boosts and even unique bonuses that cant be gained other ways like desensitization for a military veteran or high fitness for a fitness instructor. They also give positive or negative trait points which brings me to the traits. Positive traits cost trait points and negative traits give trait points. You cannot complete your character unless your trait points are 0 or higher. This encourages the player to pick positive and negative traits to reflect their intended role in the gameFor instance a homemaker character might be a carpenter who has the traits that provide a starting skill boost and exp multiplier for carpentry, cooking, first aid, farming, fast learner and foraging, but to balance this they took the negative traits of cowardice, asthma, thin skinned, disorganisation, clumsy (loud) and poor healingOn the other hand a scavenger might be organised, aware, graceful (quiet), stealthy, athletic, a sprinter and lucky (high chance of good items in loot containers), but also illiterate, stupid, hemophobia and cowardlyThen again a dedicated zombie slayer to accompany scavengers might be a fireman with brave, strong, fit, self-defense and thick skinned but illiterate, deaf and disorganizedSadly there is a little balance in skills and some are more effective than others. Carpentry is amazing as the skill, as are the combat skills and sprinting, but farming, cooking, foraging and fishing are pretty useless, and first aid is pretty useless outside pvp too.On the servers I played on there were plenty of resources when you know where to look, and once you get good at avoiding zombies or dividing groups to pick them off one by one the zombies aren't much of a threat either. The building materials (nails, axes) and ammo are usually hotly contested and a lot of players steal from each other. As a result the other thieving players become the greatest threat on pve servers and you will either have to hide your stash well such as in dense woods, or place traps throughout your house, and by that I mean removing floor tiles and covering them with zombie corpses that float over them so they can't see the hole. A fall means a guaranteed broken leg which leaves you moving at half speed and takes 3 weeks (21 hours) in-game to heal with the fast healer perk. Not impossible to heal I've managed it myself, but most players would just stash their items, commit suicide and make a new character than limp around for most of a real day. Unfortunately there are also griefers who put holes in public buildings to break the legs of other players and in a game with perma death it really is harshI really wouldn't recommend pvp. The range of the screen is not that high and if you are running down a street the opposite direction to another player they will be in firing range by the time you realize it. Players can take a lot of bullets from guns before they die, but a single lodged bullet will cause a player to bleed out unless treated with rare medical tools. If you have 3+ lodged bullets you will bleed out before you can remove the bullet, stitch the wood and bandage all 3 woods even with high first aid and the dextrous trait. What's more the gunshots will draw zombies to your location forcing you to quickly vacate the area before you can even stop to treat the wounds. The only exception to this is if you chose to play a police officer and gun down about 3000 zombies to get to level 10 aiming. At 10 aiming a players fires a handgun like it's an uzi and each shot had about a 25% chance of killing instantly with a headshot. This means you will likely kill a player armed with a shotgun before they out more than 2 lodged bullets in you and if you creep up on them will likely kill them before they shoot you at all. But with a shotgun I'm not kidding here someone crept up on me and fired 6 shotgun shells point blank into my back and I still had time to turn around and shoot him twice before I died, causing him to die as well a minute later from blood loss. For pvp to work gunshots would have to be far more instantly deadly to players and the range of the screen would have to be extended or every player encounter results in mutual destruction regardless of the time each player has spent in-gameThat said the community is the best I have ever seen, even on the pvp servers. Everyone is really helpful and friendly and quick to answer any question! There are a few bad apples and thieves but nowhere near to the extent of survival games like Rust and Reign of Kings.Another interesting addition is challenge modes. Really CD DA day has the player start in a burning house, naked, wet (imminent cold that causes sneezing and attracting zombies like gunshots), drunk and with lodged glass shards in their crotch (equivalent to a lodged bullet). What's more the map is winter with sparse resources and maximum numbers of zombies, which I assure you is a lot. The player must escape the burning house, find clothes, sober up, find tweezers, bandages and a needle and thread to remove the glass, stitch the wound and bandage it, all while sneezing to attract the hordes, then find somewhere safe to rest and recover without starving to death or being killed!3 more interesting challenges have just been released, one where the player is in a small town with few zombies but after 1 day zombies appear at the edge of the map in a massive horde and head straight after the player, death isn't a question of if but when! In another map the player has 1 day before a frigid winter begins and before this the player must scavenge resources, and find a warm shelter to survive the winter if they can. In the third one the player is in a mall which is surrounded by thick masses of the dead, and in 3 hours the doors will open!All in all I highly recommend this game. Even for an early access game there are plenty of features, the game is updated frequently, it's very intuitive and easy to get into and the amazing community is great fun to play with!Final verdict: 9/10			"

								This game is so awesome, even though i'm only few hours in it, i already got it. It is totally the best zombies survival game out there, not DayZ not H1Z1 just Project Zomboid.In this game you will experience the real fear, the real feelings, you will get into the game as a survivor! you won't feel like you are playing a normal game. It is like you're in The Walking Dead series.This is one of the most realistic games ever.if you like this genre, please don't waste your time and just buy this game already! totally recommended.

								I love it. Especially the open sandbox feel. I'm also glad there's no swearing and it's pixelated blood is right up my alley for a dad with three kids constantly prowling behind me watching what I'm playing. I also enjoy exploring a new place for the first time. Stealth based games are also fun. Looting at 3 am in the morning game-time with nothing but a bat and a flashlight has a certain appeal.The pros -- the above. The cons -- mainly inventory management. It could use some work, but it's really not too bad once you get the hang of it.			"

								This game survived (pun intended), grew and prospered despite contunual setbacks and misfortune that The Indie Stone faced throughout the last few years - and I tip my digital hat to them for not abandoning their title when they could. Whether it was sheer bad luck or stupidity on their end, or a combination of both - it doesn't matter, because they still manage to get back on their feet. Every. Time. I've patiently watched this game's development since its early development stage back when it was available exclusively through Desura. It's come a loooong way since then and it's an amazing feat.The game's currently in Alpha stage, so be aware that there WILL be some bugs, but nothing so bad as to be gamebreaking. There's only one goal in the game - to build, fight, scavenge, and thus SURVIVE, for as long as you possibly can. Death is inevitable... It's just being prolonged.The game features dark, eerie and spine-chilling music by young and talented Zach Beever[www.zachbeever.com], there are quite a few new features[pzwiki.net] planned, plus PZ has a very healthy and devoted modding community. Thus, it's pretty safe to assume that this just might be the next ""Minecraft"" hit. We shall wait and see.If you enjoy harsh roguelike survival games of the likes of Don't Starve (another title I very highly recommend), then you'll most likely appreciate what this game has to offer, even in its unfinished state.

								I wrote this review a while back, well over 2 months ago now and we still have no major update. If you go to the PZ forums, hordes of PZ SJW's will attack you for giving criticism toward the devs and game itself, making any criticism fall silent. You legit cannot say anything bad about this game, its ridiculous, especially when its a product people PAY FOR. I've played around 83 hours of this game but after around 20 hours you will most probably get bored due to a lack of content and updates. To put the games development time into perspective: The new animation work was mentioned and was being worked on in late 2014, we still do not have the animations in the game and PZ has remained the same since around this time last year, nothing has changed. The devs release weekly updates but they have become so shallow and pointless that its a joke.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off let me just say that the screenshots on the store page are old, the graphics have been improved slighlty and thus, the game looks a lot better.I will try and keep this review short.PZ is probably the best zombie survival game there is right now. I can't think of another zombie game that nails the whole ""survival"" and ""zombie apocalypse"" aspect that many zombie games try to do, but ultimatley fail. PZ is fantastic, but.....The world is dead, literally. The only lifeform in this game is you. It's just you against thousands of zombies. Whilst fun at first, dont get me wrong, it gets boring the longer you play. Every playthrough is the same, find supplies, get a decent weapon, build a safehouse, find more supplies. And before everyone attacks me ""But it's a survival game, thats what you need to do to survive"" I understand, but please hear me out.I, along with 99% of other players want this world to feel more alive, or was once alive. There are no driveable vehicles not even destroyed vehicles litter the barren streets. There are no NPC's, no notes or old radio broadcasts, no overrun safehouses that have been built by previous survivors, nothing. This, to me anyway, makes it feel like this world has always been infested with the undead and that no one has ever lived here, its boring. Dead.I want to be able to do some sort of quests and trade with other survivors or recruit survivors so we can rebuild.The devs have promised NPC's to arrive at an unconfirmed date using their ever so popular catchphrase of ""soon"" but they have been promising NPC's for over a year now, just like they have done with the new animations, which were promised over a year ago but are STILL in development and the team are ""ironing out bugs"" in the new animation system every ♥♥♥♥ing week.Who knows where the damn vehicles are, thankfully there is a mod that adds vehicles in the workshop though, but it's not perfect.Indie Stone, we want NPC's, new animations, new clothes for our characters and the ability to see the damn backpack we have equipped, we want other modes of transport apart from walking. Stop jerking yourselves off every week and add the stuff us players ACTUALLY WANT.TL;DR, buy this game WHEN NPC's have been added.			"

								Okay this game is one of the best examples of how a indie-game company should make their games. there are so many reasons why this game is so fun. It Truly captures the feeling how it would be out there if a zombie apacolypse ever broke out. The game doesnt even suggest survival. I't simply asks the question ""how long can you survive?"" This is one of those games that just seem impossible, but as you figure it out and you die and you die, you notice that each time you survive a little longer. you learn from the mistakes you make and the feeling you get from that is really rewarding.As for the game machanics itself, when i was playing it I almost forgot it was still in Early Acces. 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								I've owned the game for a few years now and haven't played it much.  I bought the game when they had NPCs.  Then they removed NPCs and decided to work on things to make it more ""realistic.""  I feel as that the developers can't see the forest through the trees anymore.  People have been clamoring for NPC's and the devs continue  to work on other things which the majority of users don't care about.  Now they're looking at ""caloric intake"" as a factor to consider during the zombie apocalypse.  Is it a good idea.  Yes.  But is it more important than what the majority of users want?  No.  The devs were so focused on having a realistic ""radio"" system.  They spent months working on radio broadcasts.  Then they spend months working on radios for the player in multiplayer.  They have to create walkie talkies. It's it a good idea. Yes.  Should it take priority over what the majority of users want (NPCs).  No. The fanbase wanted cars.  Developers don't think it's a priority.  It was ignored.  So modders created cars.   The fan base wanted more firearms.  Developers didn't thin it was a priority.  It was ignored.  So modders created firearms.  I could go on and on about how the developers just ignore what the majority of the fans want.Did I mention there is still no in game map available?  No map of the area since the game was created.  Some guy had to create a map of both play areas so you can have a vague idea of where you are.  You have to alt tab to the map website and figure out where you are.  Oh, it's realistic.  But is it fun?  Nope.  If they wanted to be ""realistic"" they could allow GPS technology with google maps for the first few months of the zombie apocalypse and then have it shut off . . .Also, the zomboid fanbase is rabid.  You say anything against the developers they pounce on you like a bunch of . . . zombies.  I'm sure I'll get a good amount of flame from the zomboid acolytes from my review as it is forbidden to be critical unless you are punished. Other problems - my game is constantly stuck on ""updating workshop content"" in an endless loop.  Uninstalled the game, deleted the folder.  Verified game cache before I did this.  Nothing works.  By the way, the game is super boring without mods.Now on the plus side - The developers give weekly regular updates as to what is happening with the game.  Not actual software updates. They just tell you what they are working on.  They are more active with their fans (i.e. they actually interact with them) more than the developers of the Fun Dumps, Seven Days to Payout game.  And team zomboid releases more updates to the game than those knuckleheads, even though team zomboid has a development team which is only a fraction of the Fun Dumps.  The graphics are decent and proof of concept ideas are great.  Looking forward to seeing them implementing the new running and side strafing system.  The new 3d models will be good. But nothing has happened yet.  Multiplayer is okay fun.  But it's ridiculous trying to find anyone.  No way to find them with the games build in map.  You have to say, ""oh I'm near the quickie mart in muldrah.""  Which one?  The partially burned out one.  I don't know where that is.  Well, good luck survivor.  If you do know where it's you'll have to go on foot because you started on the other map. So, as it is I wouldn't recommend the game in its' present state.  They need to listen to their fans and include the NPCs.  It's been years now  developers.  If you don't care about income then just keep going this route and doing your own thing.  And probably a few things will happen.  You'll close your doors because you can't support development on the game because nobody will buy it.  Or another developer will make a similar game with the features the fans want.			"

								Yes, this is the hardest zombie survival game out there. No, there is no winning. You only win when you die. Were you expecting a ""and he/she lived happily ever after""?No, there isn't a vaccine or magic potion to heal a zombie bite. You ♥♥♥♥ed up, live with the consequences. Do you want your mama to kiss your boo boo as well?Yeah, loud noises DO attract the zombies. If you fire a gun, prepare to fire at the entire towns population, because they heard it, and are coming for you.Oh yes, electricity and water works for now... but if you somehow manage to miraculously survive after 2 months without becoming a human happy meal, that is all shut down now. You better have stockpiled on water. If you haven't, well... let's hope it rains?Do you have windows in your home? Ahhhhhh, isn't the view great?No. It ♥♥♥♥ing isn't. cover that ♥♥♥♥ up with sheets, unless you want corpses eating your corpse.Like I was saying, you don't get a second chance. Sure, the dead are definitely pretty dumb. The only problem is that there are a lot of them. How many zombies would it take to take over your base?10?50?100?1,000?I gues we'll see.			"

								I love Project Zomboid, it is my favourite zombie survival game so far on the market.I've played it both in single and multiplayer, more so in multiplayer.Troughout playing I've encountered little bugs, and one huge one that is game breaking and makes me feel I cannot play this game anymore until devs take it seriously.It's about the server creation and access. Lately I cannot even create a server for MP.Or if I try to access the one I've played on for 50+ hours and developed immensely, it keeps saying my files do not match those of the server (note that I AM the server, and nothing has changed on my PC since the day before when I've played PZ, and poof in the morning after I cannot access it anymore!).This made me abandon a lot of my servers and huge progresses I've made, and made me really unsatisfied with this game and it's developers.This game has a lot of potential and a faithful crowd of followers that keep giving it zillion chances over and over again just to be dissapointed time and time again.

								This is zombie survival, but it couldn't be more different from the other games on the market in the same genre! For starters, its top down view, not first person. This doesn't take anything away from the experience though! I've been made to jump a couple of times from walking into a room that I didn't know had a zombie inside!What I love most about PZ, is that it's truly a survival game, even without the zombies. Society has crashed which means you have to scavenge to survive, searching through houses, caravans, schools, apartments etc. to find food, water and supplies. But it's not just hunger you have to contend with, your character can get bored, stressed, scared, angry, even too hot or cold depending on the conditions.For those who survive the first days, you can craft items like walls and doors, even grow plants!Multiplayer is in the game but in my personal experience it needs work. Every server I found was picked clean of everything, all the zombies were dead and the lag often made it unplayable.The graphics aren't anything special, but they grow on you more and more over time. The devs have used lighting as a great way to make you feel uneasy, walking the streets at night can be a death trap when you can barely see whats around you! "

								The HUD and inventory system, more specifically transferring contents of containers and backpacks to be useable is very clunky and unorganized.The rest of the game is pretty cool yet this one thing really makes it a painful experience and not even in a challenging way.When your only way of interfacing and interacting with the game is this disorganized and user unfriendly it makes the whole experience a negative.Despite my appreciation for how this game tries to have a more original and challenging take on the zombie genre I simply could not and would not reccomend it to someone with only two human hands given this glaring issue.Were this issue not the case however, I would most definitely hop back onto the game and consider a 180 degree spin on this review, but as it stands any time I tried playing I ended up stopping, not because I died, but because the inventory system, hud, and bag system made me want to drink bleach.

								Fans of serious zombie survival games that is mainly focused on slow, shambling corpses and barricading/defending style of gameplay have to check this game out. It has collected all of the great things that I've been wishing to see in a zombie game, but never found executed in the correct way.Even in Early Access state, developers have pushed themselves to make it as stable as possible, so anyone who buys into it wouldn't feel like beta testers but actual consumers. There is nothing you can hate in Indie Stone. The Passion these developers have about their game is enormous. At it's stage the game already has a huge list of languages you can play with, completely translated by the community.Mod tools, Last Stand, Sandbox, Survival, Story - Combine all of that, and you'd get carried away for longer than you might expect. If you love zombies and survival elements - you MUST purchase this game. ________________________________Очень давно ждал игру, которая по настоящему передавала атмосферу выживания в зомби апокалипсисе. DayZ подошел очень близко моим ожиданиям, но быстро был перехвачен людьми, которые убивали без всякого повода. Наткнулся на Project Zomboid несколько лет назад, и сразу влюбился в команду разработчиков. Они, как оказалось, на равне со мной рады выпустить игру как эта. Не смотря на то, что игра в Early Access, разработчики вложили все свои силы чтобы сделать игру незабываемой, и чтобы баги отвлекали насколько можно меньше от игрового процесса. Естественно - баги будут присутствовать, но по сравнению с остальными играми про зомби что я здесь видел (иногда даже полностью выпущенные, как WarZ) Zomboid стабильнее, чем вы ожидаете. Они даже умудрились внедрить целый лист языков, на котором вы сможете играть в эту игру, полностью переведено их комьюнити. Я вложил свои силы чтобы перевести игру на русский. Буду и дальше работать, надеюсь старания не пропадут даром)Поддержка модов, Последний Рубеж (Битва), Песочница, Выживание, Истории - все это вы сможете увидеть в будущем, и если вы огромный фанат серьезных игр про зомби - вы просто ДОЛЖНЫ приобрести эту игру.

Early Access Review
								This game is brutal. I returned after a long period of not playing and am very satisfied with the changes that are currently in the beta build. The addition of more occupations for your character + perks/debuffs make for some very interesting character builds.With almost no hand holding, you're plonked into a random house in the middle of a map that you'll have no idea how to navigate. With nothing but the clothes on your back and food in your fridge ""plus anything else you're lucky to find"" You set off on your adventure! Looting shops, houses, warehouses, farms, petrol stations all in the hopes you'll find a little more loot to help you survive that extra day.All the while you're battling the hordes of the undead. The sandbox mod allows you to tweak the nasty biters any way you like. Want old school zombies? Sure! Want to try and survive in a scenario like 28 days later? Go for it! ""although not recommended"" You'll fight with whatever you can find. Kitchen knives, bats, axes, planks of wood. There are also firearms, but remember! the zombies react to sounds and a gunshot will likely make all your problems worse. Hordes of zombies migrate at random events that happen in game so don't ever think that large group won't think twice about seeing what tasty morsel hides in your home when a chopper goes overhead.Along with the copious amounts of brains you'll be ejecting from skulls you will also have to contend with the isolation that is the zombie apocalypse. You'll be holed up in a house for days on end, fortifying, all whilst your character becomes bored, lonely and depressed at the thought they're the only one left.If I could give a few tips to anyone new playing, It'd be invest in the future. Read the books and learn how to farm, fish and build. The power shuts off and any fresh food will go mouldy. The water will go and you will have to find other ways to sustain your thirst. So spend time learning how you're going to extend your life without the comforts we all take for granted.Good luck! You're going to need it.			"

								Project Zomboid is a survival game first, and a zombie game second. Surviving requires resource management and good decision making. Food and water are both important, and within the first month the water supply is cut off and power is gone. One day is an hour of play on default settings for reference. Water sources such as sinks will still hold a bit of water after the water supply is gone, but for the most part it's up to the player to provide for themselves at this point. Most food expires, and this requires planning of when to eat what. There are many interesting mechanics that make surviving fun, such as the ability to freeze foods so they last longer, or growing crops and canning them in summer so they can be used in winter.Yet, there is still plenty of fun to be had in this game by rushing hordes of zombies while trying to loot a warehouse with powerful weapons and rare construction materials early on. There is a perk system in place that requires players to give themselves negative traits in order to obtain positive ones. This allows for a variety of playstyles. You can create a loud character that has poor senses and is more likely to be seen by zombies, but is incredibly strong and can tackle large amounts of them at once, or create a weaker character that can sneak around easily and survive in the shadows. The immense character options are coupled with the fact that there is a sandbox mode with a healthy amount of options.Want more zombies? Set the population to very high and watch as they overwhelm you even on the outskirts of town. Don't like how zombies tend to spawn within urban centers? Make them spawn uniformly and you'll find random ones lurking in the woods. The settings also include whether or not to begin with basic supplies, how long it has been since the outbreak began, and how long it will take for the power and water to shut off. There are many more and I encourage anyone who enjoys survival games to pick this one up for themselves and take a look.All of that being said, it is important to note that Project Zomboid is still in early access. There are some bugs around, and in my opinion the interface is still relatively clunky to use. The game takes some getting used to, but has a big payoff in the long run. The developers have improved the interface in recent builds, and have weekly ""Mondoids"" where they keep the community up to date on what's what. Development on the game can feel pretty slow at times, we've been periodically promised NPCs that are fellow survivors for several years but they are still not implemented, for example. If you can handle all of this, then by all means I recommend picking up this game, it's worth the price and more.			"

								A thoroughly enjoyable isometric survival game, set in a zombie apocalypse. As a player, you'll need to hunt for supplies and weapons, to last as long as you can without reprieve.Shops can be broken into and looted, but watch out for burglar alarms.Travel between two towns, visiting interesting locations in the wilderness.Cut down trees for lumber, to build new walls, tools and furniture. Make your own home in the wilds!Walls can be smashed down with sledgehammers.Grow your own crops, or loot what you need from the abandoned stores.Cook food, but don't leave the oven on by mistake!Water supply and electricity cut out after a few days, so make sure you've built rain barrels for water, and scavenged batteries for your torch.Zombies will follow you, sometimes over long distances. They're not afraid to tear down doors and smash windows to get to you.At the moment, NPCs are not yet in the game, but indications from the developer are that they will come soon, and will behave with intelligence and survival instinct.The developers are releasing plenty of updates, despite some very huge setbacks during the development of the project. A truly wonderful effort!			"

								I used to dream about a zombie survival game that was based on the rules of the world we live and breath in. A game where ransacking houses felt real and natural, where locating fresh water was as important as bashing zombie heads, where finding an axe was cause for celebration, and where facing zombies was something that was scary, and never stopped being scary. A game that trusted you to be smart enough to stockpile food to avoid starving to death, and that had the balls to make getting bitten by a zombie something that actually followed well known zombie lore. (IE; you're going to turn into a zombie. No, there is not some magical cure, you're going to die. May I suggest avoid getting bitten by zombies in the first place. What's that you say? That makes the game tense and unpredicatble, because dying means you lose all your character XP? Indeed. Now you're getting it. Surviving a zombie apocolypse in the real world would be tense and unpredictable....)I always knew this imaginary zombie survival game of my dreams would be independently produced. Why? Because AAA game developers are so terrified the average modern gamer will get distracted by something shiny, their version of the game would grant you a ""fish from heaven"" magical spell, simply to balance out the requirment of finding food and having to satisfy a hunger stat. Or they would simply make the hunger stat regenrate if you sat in a corner for a few seconds, making one wonder why its there in the first place...For those not keeping up, (I'm looking at you mainstream console gamer for whom the regenrating hunger stat was created), Project Zomboid is that zombie survival game of my dreams. At least as close as one can possibly get. I absolutely love the fact that the game more or less simulates how well I think I would do in a real zombie apocolypse. That is to say, I one hudnred percent believe I'd die backed into a corner, flailing about with a hammer in a mad panic, and eventually getting too fatigued to fend off the hordes and landing up a zombie snack. (No, you would not chainsaw them into bits and flick-flack out the window into the arms of a hottie with enormous breasts, mainstream console gamer, and no, I don't care how much you try and convince me otherwise. Get a job.) In conclusion; yes I recommend Project Zomboid. And as a final thought; you have not known desperation until you've tried to stab a zombie to death with a spoon, simply for complete lack of other options. Another reason I love this game. I commend the developers, and deeply hope this game sees much success. I'm eager to see how it progresses.			"

								After a horrendous and frightening experience of an overnight zombie raid, my house was in ruins. All food was consumed, crops destroyed, ammo non existent. My weapons damaged, my body aching, my mind lost. I was wounded and in desperate need of medical attention. After rummaging through piles of bodies, I managed to find a dirty bandage. ""I can't use this..."" I said to myself, and after long contemplation and painful thinking I decided against it. ""If I can clean it, I can use it"" I dragged my broken body across half of town, exploring every inch of land in order to find cleaning materials. My last sip of water felt like days ago. I came across a shanty area,  a settlement of plywood, corrugated metal, sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Wildly scavenging through heaps of sh#t, yes! A half empty bottle of bleach.I moved my way to a quiet and not known location, where I was able to sit and gather my breath. Frantically scouting to make sure I was ok, still sat down. I looked up into the sky and dreamed of what life used to be. ""I need this bandage cleaned"", opening up my bag to take out both the bandage and the bleach. ""There is no threat here, take your time"" I wish I had a mouse! I must of double tapped my track pad. With the bandage in my left hand, and the open bottle of bleach in my right, the double tap of the trackpad forced me to consume the bleach. Every last drop.Stories were told of my valiant display of british grit, fighting off the barrage of zombies and ultimately falling to my death through a 16 hour massacre. At least, thats what the stories told. If only they knew the truth of my stupidity. "

Early Access Review
								How will you die?Mostly of lag spikes or hilarious bugs. Have you ever tried to run away from an invincible zombie during a lag spike of more than 1,600 ms? Have you ever entered an empty street just to realize that hundreds of zombies will suddenly appear out of nowhere due to the horrendous performance of this game? Have you ever played on a dead server, the only survivor out there? At some point, you'll start to wonder what will happen when you walk into a burning fire or how many storeys you have to jump down to drop dead immediately. If you're really lucky, you'll meet some hacker who insta-kills you. This is how you will die.This game can be great fun, but it's badly optimized. The offline sandbox campaign is boring as hell due to the fact that more than five years after the game went early access there are still no NPCs to interact with. There were NPCs in the beginning, but the developers decided to remove them until they'd come up with a better AI. Damn, that was years ago, and since then your character is the only survivor out there. You will die of boredom - this is how you will die. Some years ago the developers still had the myth of their stolen laptops which they referred to whenever someone pointed at these shortcoming, but now, years after this event, they should have come up with something substantial. Nope! They've come up with useless radios and nutritional information. That's all. Prepare yourself for some serious ""I am Legend"" one-man-show. How can someone really expect to publish a game without any NPCs and score a hit?What to say about the graphics? They do their job, but they haven't aged very well, given that the game is by all standards pretty old by now. But I can live with that. Funny thing is that someone compared the game's graphics to those of ""Ultima Online"". Well, just think a moment about that.To be honest, the most annoying bugs, such as the invincible zombies, have been dealt with. I've played on several servers, and I haven't met a single one of them, so there are at least some signs that the developers still work on that title. There's also improvement when it comes to hosting games. However, apart from the ongoing changelog that tells us about myriads of tiny changes, there has hardly changed anything over the last years and I've the feeling that there are more negative than positiv things to say about the game.THE ONLINE GAME AKA PLAYING ON DEAD, BUG-RIDDEN SERVERSWhat to say about the online experience? It can be great fun, but have I told you about the extreme lag spikes, the black borders that prevent you from enterring new areas, the constant server problems caused by this game being a total mess? The moment the virtual zombies begin to travel to another zone is sometimes enough to kill a server. One moment you hear a helicopter, see the zombies crawl through town, the next the server is gone forever. I've seen this happen more than once. Optimization is the key, and the developers haven't found it yet. However, despite all these problems, the game can be great fun. But you've to be prepared to face a messy, constantly crashing game and servers that experience severe problems due to bad programming and conflicts.Once I got involved in setting up a public server for the game, and it took us quite some time to get around the worst issues caused by the game, not the server. One of the main problems is the handling of virtual zombies. Most admins haven't even heard of that - at least that was the case when I still played on public servers. It's just a huge mess. In most cases, you probably encounter servers with such extremely noobish server settings that it's definitely no fun playing on them. Have you ever tried playing on a server with no respawn that has been running for more than a year? Try to forage a stone and a piece of wood to craft a spear or an axe that will last for three or four hits before it gets useless. Have you seen those burned down towns on maps that haven't turned off spreading fire? Have you ever tried to reach Giga Mart, the hardware store or the weapon shop in Westpoint just to see that someone had claimed them for a safehouse or built in or round them,which prevents the containers from respawning? Then just say goodbye to the most important places because they're gone forever.Let's face the sad truth. There won't be any NPCs in this game. This game will never run stable. The few servers that are still alive will continue to face severe problems. The only thing that is certain are the lag spikes, the bugs, an entire list of empty servers, and the myriad tiny problems that will finally drive you off.MY RECENT GAMING EXPERIENCEAfter almost a year of absence I gave this game another chance. After all, it can be great fun, as I said. Admittedly, most servers are dead by now. I decided to play on a server called ""Logens World"", simply because I liked the harsh server settings. I had a great time playing alone on this one. There were hardly any other players, so I could concentrate on PvE. With me mostly playing alone, the ping was usually around 54, with only occasional short lags during extensive zombie movements. I met another guy from Switzerland, and we teamed up for some time. In seven hours of gaming we met only one other player on this server, a Korean who was online for approximately five minutes before he left again. Two days later, I met two Russians and helped them as far as I could. I settled next to the docks in Westpoint, built a nice three-storey house near the shore, destroyed the stairs with a sledgehammer and placed two sheet ropes to the enter my floating house. I caught fish and started farming on my roof. Life in the zombie apocalypse was beautiful. A few hours later, I met a hacker/griefer who spawned next to me, took a look at the house I'd been building for the last 8 hours, said, ""Nice house"", set it aflame and burned it down using cheats and spawned a series of wooden palisades to block my entrances. Yeah, great move.Well, I decided to start over on my own game server. The guy from Switzerland came over and we played a bit, but then joining our hosted servers didn't work anymore. By now, we all know that the developers just need some time to deal with those problems: in two or three years this issue will be dealt with, and we'll be able to play again on each other's servers. But right now this means playing alone again, and this is so terribly boring, even if you try to give this game a huge chance.DO I RECOMMEND IT?I've played this game quite a lot. Some of it was fun, much of it got more and more boring, much of it was highly frustrating, and some of it was utterly bad. Was it at least quality gaming time? No. A lot of the time was about checking settings, getting rid of problems or finding a way around the more notorious ones. Some time was about checking the new mods: some of them are really interesting, some of them are good, but the majority of them isn't my cup of tea. In addition, a lot of the gaming experience revolves around repetition: you'll end up checking the selfsame houses over and over again. There'll be parts of the maps, such as the Mall or the Shooting Range, that most players won't ever see. If Steam gave me the option of voting UNDECIDED, I would do so. But faced with only the options to recommend it or not, I've to say that I don't recommend it.			"

And since the demo back in 2011, and the Early Access release back in 2013 (YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY! EARLY ACCESS SINCE 2013!). They've actually removed content. They continually talk about adding animations and such, but for more than one calendar year there has not been any sort of substantial update. Look at the stable logs if you don't believe me. This game has a few hours of entertainment, and then it's done. And the developer has not shown themselves to be capable of producing a finished game. Don't buy it yet. Make them earn the money.

								The devs seem incapable of focusing on one task.A year ago we were promised Creative Mode. Attention then shifted to nutrition systems. A while after that, attention shifted once again to blacksmithing. Then, suddenly attention shifted over to animations. After that, attention shifted to two new maps that nobody asked for.Keep in mind that, with the exception of the two maps, none of those have been added yet as of the time of writing.As of right now, the game itself is lacking. There is virtually no end game. For god knows what reason, the developers added in RNG events that cause hundreds of zombies to swarm to your base to """"fix"""" this issue, meaning that the two winning methods of surviving are A: building a floating base and then quit when you get bored or B: wander around, stay in the shadows, scavenge supplies and then quit when you get bored.I bought this game a year ago. No meaningful additions to the game have been added. Features are promised, highlighted in several Mondoids (the developer's weekly development log), and then dropped entirely.			"

								I bought this game when it first came out, almost exactly three years ago to the day.  While it had its bugs back then, it was a fun game.  Then they added 3d content, and I was amazed at how much better it was.  After that, well, pretty much zero changes.  I'm sure the developers dabble with the code now and then, but overall, don't do much else.  The game updates are few and far between now, and when updates are released, they are very minor.  After three years, this game should have been approaching a finished status.I'd love to see the NPCs that were discussed last year, or two years ago?  I don't even remember now.  In fact, a lot of content was discussed and said to be added soon, but never happened.It's still a fun game to burn a few hours, but if you've played it extensively like myself, it will become repetitive and you won't go back to playing it much.EDIT:  I was just reading that the developers are doing a major overhaul to the game code, which would explain the slow update releases.  If they release a decent update, I will definitely revise my review to reflect that.			"

								this is a fun game. I sometimes get stressed out if there's sounds of zombies nearby... worried they'll get me and I won't fight them off fast enough... I love playing this online. I love gathering food and stuff to my shelter. I sledgehammered the stairs away and use a sheet rope to get up and down. That way it's safe from Zombies. I love this game. I had played it about a year ago and then I got hooked on another game but came back to it recently and it's just as addictive. I love that you can build stuff and increase your skills like carpentry or cooking or whatever. Just an over all great game and playing online is great. There are a lot of nice people to play with (and as always some, not so nice) But over all my online gaming on this game has been overwhelmingly positive. If you have not tried this game, it has a demo so you can check it out.Since my initial review above, I've built part of one base and then build a completely separate base basically by myself. I figured out my new favorite part of this game is building bases. I'm having a blast! By the way if you just start this game, you might want to know you can usually outrun the zombies. (at least on Terminus server). Also the makers of the game are constantly improving  it and there are wonderful Mods for this game.			"

								Download this cool looking game.Decide to play multiplayer because it sounded cool.Join reddits server, 34 members. House I spawned in has already been looted.Find a cool person outside, says they dont know what their doing, I dont either so we follow each other.Find a ♥♥♥♥ ton of loot. Loaded up with enough supplies to survive for weeks, find an abandoned base and explore for fun.Friend goes upstairs, falls offBroken leg, we start searching around for meds. Go onto roof to look for med, fall off and break my leg. Stare into his eyes as we both slowly bleed out.Last thing I see after I die is him taking all of my loot, probably made it out fine.10/10 would die with a stranger I met an hour ago.			"

								People always want to know 1) should I buy this game?  and 2) will I like it?1) Yes.2) Yes.A few things to know before you do though.1) This game is DIFFICULT - some would call it HARDCORE. The reason is that your life is very fragile and everything you're up against isn't. It's like a watermelon against a sledgehammer. Surviving in this game is like real life - one screw up and it's over.2) Whatever 'skill' you choose know that no matter how proficient you get at it - if you level it from skill level 2 up to skill level 7 and you get bit. You can kiss all that progress goodbye.3) When you die, you're dead. It literally makes you start a brand new character so don't get too attached.4) You will die... like a lot5) First several times you play you'll know very little and feel like it. Its easy to get frusturated but stick with it. If you're one to easily give up this game is not for you.6) Multiplayer can be super fun if you can have your own server like we do7) Single player is a totally unique experience to multiplayer but man does it feel good to survive alone building your own shelter and growing your ownfood/catching your own food. It's so satisfying because you know you're on your A game if you make it.Pros-----------------+ Excellent survival engine+ Zombie AI is very impressive but not perfect+ Zombies are kind of creepy but need a few more styles+ Wide array of items+ Excellent character creation (traits mostly)+ Feeling of hopelessness, stress, heart thumping action+ Realistic feeling town and just the right dab of guns/weapons/food/etc.+ Base building is very good and on a grid system - masterful+ Multiplayer with a server is amazing+ Singleplayer very fun and challengingCons--------- Could use NPC's and vehicles because damn some of these trips are LONG- Sometimes zombie AI is TOO good like how do they always know to knock on the doors and not the walls?- Trapping is kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (Ive had minimal success)- Cooking and farming can be kind of tedious but very helpful- Should have a server save state option so we dont get corrupted files from things like a power outage- Items sometimes vanish into the void (mostly when harvesting crops which is SUPER annoying)- Sometimes you get a cheap death like I one time looked in a window and didn't see any zomie so I hopped in and was instantly bitten as the animation to land inside was still going - wtf- When you forage it doesnt show on the screen what you picked up (if anything) can we at least get a quick little pop up that fades away after 2 seconds?Overall this game is excellent and I was pleasantly suprised how good it actually is. I didn't even realize it's in EA it's that polished and good. Impressive. Good work devs! "

What I liked:  The most hard, fun survival game I've ever seen so far  The virtual fear and threat of a horde of zombies  Has a great modding community  The scarity and realistic placement of loot  The fact that this game could stop support now and I would still love the game ( It's feature complete to me, everything else is extra)  The health and inventory system  The immersion this game gives me  An great isometric open world survival with style( when the trend is poor art style and lighting and first person)  I didn't expect me to love this game as much as I did ( love that feeling)What You Need to Know:  Don't let the isometric and pixel graphics fool you, (this game is great, hard, tense and fun)  I've been looking for a complete survival game since DayZ started the trend  I didn't like Don't Starve , or any other survival game up till this game  This game is brutal, you will die, from sickness, broken bones, infection. (You get bit, you are infected)  You have stats which you level up skyrim style ( you can't be good at everything in this game)  You lose your stats and items when you die ( find or kill your dead body to loot the items back)  Geting a server setup is hard and so I can never get a game going with friends ( makes them never wanna play the game)  The fact that this game doesn't promise everything, or is buggy, broken or a clone of every other open world survival game   I play this game mostly solo, can't convince friends to play this game  Crafting is very basic so far, and going to other cities takes a long time  No ingame map, ( you won't know where you are until you learn your surroundings)  I hate the whole trend of early access ( I could write an essay on this topic)  Only other early access game I feel it good right now is Prison Architect ( again it is feature complete to me)  Most early access game suck, but the promise of a great game is what people look forward too ( just look at all the upset people when a dev stops supporting the game)My Score:A++Paid: $15 None of my friends play this game :( Games similar:   Don't Starve "

								I've owned this game for close to three years now.  I've kept up with mondoid updates with baited breath.  I'm always disappointed.  Things that could easily be added post release and are in no way, shape or form a priority for the fans are the ONLY thing they seem to work on.  Meanwhile, something that has been begged for (and promised) since the very beginning is still nowhere in sight.  I still love the base game, but at this point I'd recommend staying clear until the devs actually decide to do some REAL work on it...  Rather than adding calories to potatoe chips.			"

								6 survivors. We built a safe house....no, a safe base near the river in West Point. 3 months of scavenging, killing zombies, farming, fishing, building....it was all very impressive. 24 pistols and 1 shotgun with endless stashed up ammo. All the melee weapons you could want. Raided a pharmacy. We would never need to worry about infections from scratches, or shards of glass stuck in our limbs. The river supplied us with fish galore, the farms with fresh veggies and fruits. Chef Gordon Ramsey cooked great meals.One 4 story tower with a fully loaded bar, a loft and 3rd story fire pit made by carpenter Jesus Christ. It was glorious.Then one slip up. One tiny mistake. Chef Gordon Ramsey causes a small fire in the driveway. Burns down one section of our wall. Jesus is blamed by all for his poor planning. He doesnt take it well. Most of us go on a run. Normal every day sorta run. Jesus stays behind. We get back to find camp fires burning in every bedroom in the house. Jesus laughs. Jesus runs out, on fire, at Chef Gordon Ramsey, whom he blames for the fire and sets him aflame through contact. Chef dies.Jesus runs at me screaming, Detective Harry D'Amour (lvl 5 farming), but I blow off Jesus' head with a shotgun. The base is a total loss. Walls gone. EVERYTHING. Gone. 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								[Note: Believe it or not. My hours played are much higher and I'd say are in high hundreds if not above a thousand as I have played the game mostly off steam]Review Build - Build 33I recommend this game but I will start my review with the cons and not the pros.Cons:- InDev for at least 5 years as of writing this review.I suspect a mayor feature creep being the problem, having read all ""Mondoids"" (Developer Updates) I've seen some features make it in without being mentioned before while the ones that are promised ""soon"" are constantly being delayed. While the explanation is always given I can't help but say that The Developer team has a policy of not promising anything with a release date that they failed to keep that on numerous occasions.Pros:- No DRMA huge pro for me as I hate DRM in all of it's forms, steamworks and having to keep steam client on included, you can play the game without steam client if you so wish. (I bought it before InDev Launched on GOG)- Single Player Zombie SurvivalAnother huge one for me as I'm a very single player oriented gamer. Probably the only zombie survival game in which Single Player is actually enjoyable. Why that is, later. There is multiplayer of course but I can't say much about it as I didn't play it.- ModdingThe game is extremely modable with plenty of great mods that expand the game available already. A huge pro from a gamer like me who likes to mod and play with other mods.- Sandbox ModeI will say, I am not a fan of preset difficulty modes, the game allows you to customize just about all aspects of your game in it's Sandbox mode, zombie lore included (How the infection spreads, zombie intelligence and whether or not they can run is up to you)- Survival ItselfI believe that over the past few builds the game has really became a heaven for those who enjoy survival. All of the options are valid. You can do risky loot runs and live off canned dog food, have a farm, set up traps for small animals or forage for mushrooms and berries. Believe me when I say it, no matter what you like, you'll get it, whether you're an action oriented gamer who likes to bash Z brains in like me or one who prefers to keep in the shadows. Mechanics are there and they work.- GraphicsA game from an isometric perspective that mixes 2D and 3D. It looks a tad worse than Fallout Tactics to be honest (I love that game) but I have found it's style to be the perfect thing for someone like me. I admit that this is very subjective though. If you like isometric graphics games like Fallout 1,2 or Tactics, you'll like this, if you expect CryEngine type of stuff and can't live without it, consider this a BIG con as I know that not liking graphics can seriously kill the enjoyment.- Audio/SoundtrackPZ has recently integrated the FMOD system, the sound quality is good, you can tell where they are coming from and there is plenty of ambient sounds to make the world feel alive. The soundtrack is a masterpiece of zombie genre, I want to buy it now, the guy who composed it really knows his stuff and I believe he designed some of the best music you will hear in a zombie game. Different music will play in-game depending on what is currently happening and it works very well.- CommunityNever saw a better one to be honest and that is all I'll say.- Active DevelopersThe developers provide the community with regular updates* (*read cons) they frequently reply to criticism with well founded arguments and are, in general, very helpful to the community whenether we have any questions.All In All. I truly recommend this game to all fans of Zombie Survival Genre. ESPECIALLY if you're sick of all the FPS/TPS zombie games. This is something fresh for you despite being older than DayZ itself. It is a game crafted by people who wanted a Zombie game before Zombie games were a thing and it shows.Note: Everything I mentioned in this review is In the game as of Build 33. I might update it if something big changes and I will update it after release.			"

								Devs will never end this game's early access. They are milking it to the maximum. Update few minor changes, milk profit for a while as it becomes on the top of the ""recently updated"" steam front page. Then when player base decrease and sales number goes down, they update another very minor change, often from community mod, to repeat their process. By the way, the way they post the changes, it's ridiculous. Other game devs will literally laugh at them how the Indiestone devs try to stretch simple patchnote into freaking 5 page essay.Game has a lot of good potential, but no ETA policy and ""Indie Project takes long time"" excuse they use for 4 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME makes me question the morality of the devs. Stay away. At least until they finish it. It's probably going to take about same time as Duke Nukem Forever dev time. Difference is, this devs are milking the game to the max while DNF bankrupted 3D Realm.

It was released into early acess over three years ago now and like EVERY other review says, little to no work has been done on it.

Early Access Review
								FIRST and perhaps MOST important, TIS is a diamond in the rough and their game is truly a shining example of how early access development should be done. since introducing their project to the steam community they have been extremely productive and informative, posting a weekly devblog to the news feed and offering a public unstable branch that actually shows the progress of said devblogs. just go look for yourself.this is an excellent zombie-survival game with a gritty, nostolgic feel to it. this isnt a heroic blockbuster where you wade through waves of starved zed, gleefully caving in skulls and emptying full mags of ammunition. death itself has an even more insatiable appetite than the undead and you will spend the beginning hours of every playthrough desperately clawing yourself away from its hungry jaws. even when you have become wise to the wasteland it will still easily find ways to commission you into the hordes. several large towns with fully exporable, fully lootable buildings spread out across a (still growing)country-side stuffed to the brim with true-to-the-name, proper zombies will keep you in an inevitably ending struggle to see another day. every element of gameplay is creative, original and skillfully implemented. the inventory is governed by a weight system sprinkled with various containers for your items. zombies are lovingly coded and realized and are a constant danger whether alone in a public restroom or in a ravenous horde in the urban streets or forest. a ""meta-game"" system ensures they dont simply congregate in one area, instead following en-masse random sounds that keep the population shambling all ends of the map. as usual with survival games, essentials such as building, crafting, cooking and hunting/fishing are skills that can be mastered by gaining experience. to top it off, all of this can be done with friends with up to four players on one screen via drop-in/out style, as well as LAN and internet play. and yes, those up to four friends can drop-in/out during LAN and internet play.as with any early access project, its still very much in progress. a few key promised features including NPC survivors and a story/campaign have yet to be realized but this small indie studio has shown they can deliver. it has taken them a long time to get PZ to where it is now and it will probably be quite some time before it will be called complete, but i wholeheartedly recommend you buy this game. keep it in your steam pocket. watch it become a classic.this is how you died 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								[To preface this review, I'd like to start off by saying I've never reviewed a game on Steam nor ever really had the inclination to do so. And I've been playing games on steam (and PC games in general) for a long time. So this game had quite an effect on me for me to write this review in the first place. I should also note that I'm extremely inclined to love anything zombie related, so of course a game like this is going to stand out to me]As much as I absolutely love this game, it isn't for everybody, so I'm going to get the ""bad"" out of the way before my glowing praise, because like most other games it does have it's flaws.THE BAD---------------------------It's still being developed, so it comes with it's own share of bugs and incomplete content. With that being said, none of the bugs that I've run into are really gamebreaking by any means, just minor annoyances or visual stuff. The missing content is also fairly negligable, because it's usually small things. Most of the major content is pretty fleshed out.-A little bit clunky (at first). It will probably feel a little awkward at first, and combat will take a lot of getting used to. But as long as you don't ragequit, and take some time to figure out what works and what doesn't, what used to feel clunky will actually begin to feel fairly smooth.-Lack of a real ""objective"" (other than simply surviving of course, which I suppose in a zombie apocalypse is as good an objective as any. But you know what I mean). As it stands right now, the game is completely sandbox mode, so you have to make your own fun. But the tools provided to you are top notch, so most of the time fun will end up finding you.THE GOOD----------------------   Simply put, this game will make you feel like you're in an episode of the Walking Dead, or playing out your own version of a Romero Movie (you do have the option to customize the zombies' speed and power in sandbox mode). I've been hosting a LAN Hamachi server for my friend and I to play together, and it may possibly be the most fun we've had in any LAN game. The atmosphere is top notch.    This is a game that is filled with incredible moments; say for example, your friend accidently leaving the oven on with salmon cooking inside it and burning down your safehouse, or; huddling in a dark kitchen with only the glow of a lighter to see and sheets covering the windows hoping zombies don't see you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself inside, then the sound of shattering glass and seeing them pour through a window across the room.   The combat is fun and nerve wracking once you get used to the controls, and looting your way through buildings has never been more satisfying. Managing your character's ""moodles"" (think ""The Sims"", little icons that let you know when your character needs something) allows lots of levels of realism, and the unforgiving and brutal combat/medical system makes stealth and zombie avoidance a neccesity; trust me, you do not want to get bitten or scratched. The RPG elements are fairly simple and straightforward, but work well within the game's design. Levelling up your skills is fluid and intuitive.    There's too much to go into, really, you might as well read the wiki page at this point. But let me just say, if you want to play the best Zombie Apocolypse simulator, than look no further than Project Zomboid. "

								THESE ARE THE END TIMES. THERE WAS NO HOPE OF SURVIVAL.THIS IS HOW YOU DIED.These are the first words you see before you're thrust into the world of Project Zomboid, so it would only be fair to tell you the story of how I died. I suppose I'm dying as I tell you this? If so, shut up and read. It'd be rude not to.I woke one morning, in the bathroom, and drank from the shower. Not really sure why, I just felt compelled to. I considered slurping some toilet water, but decided against it and left my bathroom. Not sure why I slept in there, either, but I was still alive. So f**k it, doesn't matter.I looked around my kitchen and decided I could no longer stay. Supplies were limited, and my dwindling resources would only get worse. So, after a quick raid of the cabinets, I was on my way. Armed with only pickles and beef jerky, I crept through the wooded plains of Kansas. Oh yeah, it was in Kansas. I'm going to f**king die in Kansas. Hooray.Every so often I would see herds of zombies (zomboids?) shuffling through the woods or on the city streets, and while one or two would attempt to give chase, they were slow shuffling meatbags that I quickly outpaced. I assume they got bored or just ran into trees, but when I arrived at the Country Market convienience store, I stopped to check the path I had taken. No zombies had followed.F**k it. Time to raid the store.There was nothing in the store except a jar of mayonnaise. It was half eaten.As I stared in confusion at the jar, I heard a voice from outside. ""Hey!"" it called, ""Over here!"" it continued. I looked, surprised to see another human. Hey, the text said this was how -I- died, didn't expect I'd have to share my dying spotlight with some other jerk. He climbed through the broken window of the store and cut his hand open on the glass.I laughed at him, and then shouted in surprise as he'd led a zombie directly into the store, shambling through the window after him. We both fled out of a window opposite the entrance it arrived, where I proceeded to cut my hand on escape. Why did karma always screw me? When we had cleared the zombies, we exchanged. . . something akin to pleasantries. He was a lumberjack, though his name isn't important. This is my story, screw you.We decided to stick together, to find tweezers. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to find tweezers. Instead of tweezers, sick of that word yet?, we found a third person to join our parade of misfortune; Billy Mays.  At least, he kept saying ""BILLY MAYS HERE! WITH..."" before any actual sentence.Good to know the zombie apocalypse happened circa 2008.A short time later, he'd found a home to call our safehouse. It was secluded, mostly free of zombies, and all the windows were boarded; meaning the dead couldn't see in. We'd found our new home. Alas, tragedy struck mere minutes after we settled in.Dexter the Lumberjack wasn't happy. He demanded to know why I would put my food in my bedside cabinet instead of in the fridge. ""It spoils that way!"" he said, ""All this is rotten now!""I munched on a stick of butter while glaring daggers into him. And then I ate a second. He wouldn't stop mouthing off, so while shirtless (oh yeah, Billy Mays had taken his shirt off at some point and was rushing around the town showing off his self-described 'beautiful chest hair') Billy Mays was out. . . I attacked Dexter.Being a lumberjack he was pretty fit, but my sneak attack gave me the upper hand, helping me win the duel in the end. I stood over his dead body, satisfied, as I looted his corpse.I mean this literally. I looted his corpse. I put his body in our fridge, on the top shelf. I didn't want it to rot. He laid right next to my jar of pickles, when I noticed a rotting, dead mouse in his shirt pocket.Waste not, want not, right?I flipped the oven on and tossed the rotting carcass in.  Shirtless Billy Mays returned around this time, and I asked him to get a Leek from the fridge to help with the meal. For some reason he screamed and called me ""disgusting"" as he stormed out of the house. He left the fridge door open.Seriously, what'd I do?The smell of the cooked rat meat was delicious, I can't describe anything like it. By the time I pulled the baking tray out of the oven, I was salivating at the taste. Without hesitation, I bit into the charred fur. And then I took another bite. I ate it all in one sitting; organs, spine, fur and all, though I feel this angered a passerby who happened to barge in, shouting obscenities at me. His name was. . . eh. . . I don't know. I think he was Dexter's brother.We broke out in a fight, where neither of us would give in. This was my land, he'd have to earn it. We both died.Choking and sputtering as I bled out, I wasn't sure if I was laying in my blood or his. Shirtless Billy Mays must have heard the cries of battle, as he returned one final time to ease me in to the next life.""You guys are both f**king idiots.""			"

								This review is based off of Version 34.28 of Project Zomboid.Project Zomboid is my favorite zombie survival game of all time. No other game combines the tense struggle for survival with immersive zombie mechanics the way Project Zomboid does!Strengths* Crafting is intuitive and useful. * Character creation is extremely deep and flexible, follows a Whitewolf perk/weakness system. Many skills and abilities allow for a great deal of replayability.* Zombies just don’t spawn on top of you like most zombie games. They move around based off of what they hear, see, smell, and they group up in an immersive way that no other game does.* Zombification - Losing is fun! Every time you step outside your safehouse, there is a chance you will die. Making every moment of the game extremely tense and enjoyable.Weaknesses* The inventory and crafting interface can be a bit clunky at times, especially when cooking larger meals.I've been playing Project Zomboid for years now, and it is a game I always come back to. Every additional content patch keeps making this game better and better!

Get it. Stop what you're doing and throw money at it.Project Zomboid ticks all the boxes for a complex but enjoyable apocalypse survival game. Beating up hordes of your reanimated neighbours barely scratches the surface.There's no ending so to speak, which gives it limitless replayability - you dictate the story of how your character dies. You might survive three days or six months, you might starve to death, your safehouse might be demolished by a horde, or you might venture into a cupboard and never return. The game does progressively get harder and admittedly has a fairly steep learning curve, but manages to stay enjoyable throughout. You'll quickly find a balance between hoarding all the items that you find and scavenging too little, or relying too heavily on supplies that won't last forever such as an electricity and water supply.A complex system of emotions (moodles) influenced constantly and in realtime by your immediate environment and character's wellbeing govern all aspects of your survival, like stress, boredom, stamina, pain and panic. Magazines and books are just as essential to your wellbeing as food and water. Moreover even something as mundane as maintaining a proper sleeping pattern during the apocalypse to make sure you aren't caught out after sundown on your journey home, or keeping your character warm or cool during the varying seasons to make sure they don't become ill - should this be the case though, you'll find getting lots of sleep along with a stockpile of food, books and magazines comes in handy while your character stays at home to recover.It's not uncommon to have to abandon safehouses and retreat to a backup location due to gunshots and helicopters attracting too many zombies to deal with, quickly grabbing as many essential supplies as you can in the hope they'll last long enough for you to fortify your backup safehouse on the other side of town. The key skill is being prepared for whatever the game may throw at you.It's all well and good having stockpiles of essentials and a fortified house to live, but in the end all it takes is one bite or scratch to become infected. And the game won't tell you you're infected, oh no, you'll have to diagnose it yourself. The usual cure is a swig of bleach, an overdose on sleeping pills or a good two or three storey fall.These are the end times.There was no hope of survival.This is how you died. "

								It's a great game, for a while. You really feel the tenseness of going out on scavenging runs, the fear that you'll go to sleep and wake up with someone eating you, the struggle to maintain both mental/emotional needs just as much as the physical ones, and you'll have the ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you when you stumble across zombie hordes (Or vice versa). But seriously guys, I bought this game waaaay back since before it was on Steam (Something like 2010? It's also why I have very few hours on Steam), and I remember that the development promises  were the exact same things . Like, NPC's and trading were a big thing, and other than a different inventory management system, nothing notable has changed about the game since then. I really wanted to give this a thumbs up, but I'd not reccommend hopping on this ghost ship.			"

								More of a quick recap/story of what happened today than a review. TL;DR. Project Zomboid is a fun experience with a lot of depth and realism. -Set up in Twiggy's Bar.-manage to get a CRAPTON of loot. (food, tools, guns, ammo etc.)-level up my skills.-kill at least 200+ zombies (with several Frying Pans)-fortifies Twiggy's Bar, making it a fortress -Helicopter flies overhead like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attracts a horde of zeds.-dispatches them and lures the rest away with gunfire (it was ABSOLUTELY amazing)-gets enough wood planks to build a wall around the enterance-*sees my character is 'Peckish' *-""Ok I'll make some.... uhh.. OH OH bacon and eggs.-uses campfire. ( why would i use a microwave for B&E)-whilst cooking bacon & eggs, *gets set on fire*- *PANICS (at the disco :D ) AND SCREAMS LIKE A GIRL*-bandages in time, status: Terminal damage. ""whut does that mean""- ""eh im fine.""-*Character Dies*- I stare at my monitor and Cry10/campfire would fail at bacon and eggs again			"

								This is a real zombie apocalypse simulation game and you or a admin of a server can make the zombies real slow or fast so you wont have to complain about the zombies being too slow or too fast and they decay over time and there is just sooo much to this game and more is always being added, online can sometimes be a little dull if you cant find loot but i like to play on roleplay servers and its almost like being in the walking dead, and now they added a feature to view a server list and if you can find the right servers it could be a blast with a group and its even fun if you know what your doing if you play alone since loot will be way more common than online so you could build some cool ♥♥♥♥ from scratch or off another building and pitch up a tent to sleep and i read the top negetive review and on that reguard you can find everything for constuction you would ever need at warehouses and mccoy logging company and the asylum in bedford which at the state of the game you would have to download, but if you like zombie apocalypse games and maybe even roleplay for online its a great game that doesent  have many flaws the only thing i would add immediately would be to be able to lock your base so people cant just break in or something so your base is protected because online you could get ♥♥♥♥ed over by raiders. which is why i would also reccomend playing single player which i only just recently started playing but i got my 400+ hours off of multiplayer. and if you do get the game there is no map in game but all you have to do is shift tab and either google search project zomboid map or just go to this link http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ West Point is the one to the right and muldraugh is the one to the left Good luck if anyone gets it and wants to play online you can also add me! Ps. this game will eventually have a even bigger huge open world with big servers and cars and npc's and and its going to ba a amazing game. which it already is. the multiplayer just needs a little bti of patching but eventually when this game is complete it will most certainly be the most realistic zombie apocalypse simulator.

								Project Zomboid is an intersting production. You become a lone survivour, in zombie-dominated world. Your duty? Stay alive as long as you can. Sounds simple, but in-game you will see it is not. At the beggining you have to create yourself a survivour. Game offers a few customisation options, such as name, hair, and skin colour - not much, but game is still in early acces. Then you pick a profession, with a few aviable at the moment. Each of them have bonus or two, like fireman has bonus to axe usage, policeman better shooting ect. Then you can get some more traits, but each of them comes with a value, with starting value of 0. So you need to pick some bad traits as unlucky or fat, to get some good ones. When you finally end up on the map, you will find yourself in some building, picked randomly from all around the map (there are 2 maps to choose at the moment). Its a good idea to avoid fighting, as even the smalles scratch can be deadly. The best idea to start? Find yourself a house. It will be your safe place. When you find one big enough, secure it - put sheets in the windows, make sure there are no zombies inside, and then... then you can live there. Then you will need to look for food in other houses - non persistant such as chips and canned soups are a great find, while persistant ones are good at the beggining - because electricity will be turned off after some time. With electricyty you lose fridge, so your pesistant food can be gone anytime. Same with water - water bottles are great thing to store, because water can be turned off anytime. Then - survive. You can't win - even the loading screen shows: This is how you died.While starting a game you can change a lot of things - from amount and strength of zombies to frequency of finding food and weapons. Which means - you can have difficulity as you want - from walk in the park to necessity to fight for barest scrap of progress.As for me, even though it's an early acces game, Project Zomboid can give a lot of entertainment. Finding a first gun, figuring out how to drink and so on can be really satisfying. Although price can seem to be a bit high, its a solid piece of work. "

								DISCLAIMER: Game is in Early Access. I'm sure every single one of my concerns will be addressed in time. This Review was posted June 6th, 2016. This review is based upon a version of the game without user generated content such as mods or maps.I do not regret buying this game at all. I like it for what it is. But I do feel there's a bit too much left to add before I'd really give it a proper recommendation. While my experience is mostly positive, I still need to give it a ""Not Recommended"" for reasons I'll outline below. But I'll also discuss the game's strengths, so please keep reading my unbiased assessment, since maybe you'll walk away with a positive impression. Please be aware that ""not recommended"" does not mean it's bad, I'm just not able to go ""Yes, buy it right now!""For starters, what IS there is good. My concerns stem completely from what isn't there. The maps are decently sized with plenty of danger to avoid (I once got lost in the woods for a whole day since I was desperately trying to avoid a horde that was tailing me) and I really like the fact that Water and Electricity are finite; they are either cut off after a period of time, or begin cut off, depending on your game mode of choice. The controls, while awkward at first (I was playing without a proper mouse for a bit, using my Laptop's little touch pad, which made things like holding Right Click while tapping Left click and still moving the mouse around problematic) are functional, and any complaints I'd have about them (such as wishing there was an option to be able to keep continuously walking in a chosen direction without holding the key down for those awkward hand cramp moments while you have a horde to escape) are merely nitpicks.There's plenty of variety in character creation that add a wildly varying experience every time. There's a wide array of perks and penalties to choose from, on a point-based system. To take more benefits, you need more setbacks, allowing a truly customizeable character. Do you want to be able to carry more, but get hungry faster? Do you want to move more slowly in exchange for making less noise? It's impossible to make a character who's simply ""too good"" since every benefit needs to be balanced out by a drawback, and it just makes every character you play that much more unique.There's also a ton of options in gameplay. Do you use your nails to make a weapon deadlier, or to barricade doors to a safe house? Do you risk sleeping when there's visibly zombies outside, or do you try to thin them out despite being exhausted and suffering reduced awareness? Do you run away from a group of 6 zombies and risk attracting even more, or do you stand and fight, despite the fact that it looks bad for you? Every passing moment is another calculated risk. And that is a good thing.My issues largely come from things that seem like common sense, but are lacking. For example, I had a character lost in the middle of nowhere since he was chased by a horde and got lost. He was suffering from high levels of exertion (can lead to a heart attack, he was no longer able to run at all, can be helped by taking a break at a chair or bed) and exhaustion (again, can be helped by sleeping at a chair or bed.) There was no zombies around at all (I went over 10 RL minutes without encountering one) yet there was no option to rest since there was no chair or bed present. Why can't you just sit down or even sneak in a nap on the grass, for example? My only option was to find my way back into a defensible house somewhere, kill any zombies already inside it, and use their bed. Similarly, my first character met their end due to a small scratch, since I didn't realize small scratches don't clot and require bandages, or else you eventually bleed out. That just seems like something they'll change later.I also doubt I'd have been able to learn much about the game if not for a friend I was able to ask questions. The tutorial, while clever and effective at teaching the absolute basics (and had a sense of humor,) doesn't even tackle the absolute basics of things like barricading windows (I'm almost ashamed it took me so long to figure out) or moving furniture. It's entirely possible (and even probable) that these were features added later after the tutorial was finalized, but it may have still been a good idea to teach the player how to do these things, either via a second, ""Advanced"" tutorial, or even simple tooltips.All in all, Project Zomboid provides the groundwork of a good game. I'm sure it will be great once it is done. I do enjoy it as it is, for what it is. But in it's current state, I can't give it a glowing recommendation. If what I said sounds appealing, then by all means, get it. But be advised that it's not done, and the areas that need work can be a little frustrating.			"

								I have to agree with the other negative reviews, this game has been early access and unfinished for way too long.  I love the idea behind it, I really love the simplistic graphics, but I've been waiting way longer than what I consider acceptable for a reasonably polished experience. I used to recommend this game to all of my friends.  Now I recommend you pass this up as a new purchase until (or if) it becomes an actual complete game and they live up to any of the promises and features they've been advertising for years now. P.S.  My play time isn't an accurate representation of how much time I've spent in this game.  I think I've bought it twice, once outside of steam long ago where my time wasn't counted here.			"

								Project Zomboid, for me, is the indie survival game success story. In a genre crowded by cheap money grabs and abandoned failures, Project Zomboid has come through as one of my all time favourite games. The Dev's post a weekly blog listing updates in progress and other useful info and the modding community is very much alive. This game has an amazing visual style, a beautiful soundtrack and brilliant sounds. All combine to create a fantastic, immersive and downright depressing atmosphere. I'd say it's 100% worth your money, it's challenging yet fun and manages to really make you care for the little guy you've created who is eventually going to die here. Edit: Highly recommend you nominate this for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"" Catagory in the steam awards.			"

								Project Zomboid. This game is about surviving in a zombie apocalypse in rural Kentucky, and you are tasked with doing it alone, or with a friend in the very rare PC local multiplayer. I would mention the online multiplayer, but this game requires fast reactions in order to stay alive, and I can't find a server with a decent ping to ""save my life"" as it were. This game has many realistic elements about it, such as exertion, injury that halts ALL progress, panic as a game mechanic, zombies hearing your footsteps and following noise, sight, and smell, and perhaps my favourite touch of realism, the inability to see all around you at once. You need to rely solely on your senses in order to gauge the number of zombies currently breaking down your door, and surrounding your base, there's no minimap with radar, you just need to run out and hope for the best. Another great element of this game is that it is permadeath, which in case you are a dunce, means that when you die, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. In sandbox (Which I heartily recommend over survival, as you can tweak the settings), after you die, you respawn in another random location in your spawn town, and have to work your isometric ♥♥♥ off to get back to your base, and rebuild your skills. One large issue with the game right now (which will in fact be fixed), is that the world is rather lonely. There are currently no other NPC's to hang about with. The biggest flaw of the game is that once you have nailed the perfect farming cycle, got all the guns, and fortified yourself to the point that a nuke couldn't dislodge you, there's nothing left to do! You're done at that point! I mean, if you set the zombies to never respawn, I guess you could clear out all of the zombies in the game, but that accomplishes nothing at the end of the day! Some might say that you could explore the vast map, and look for all the best items, but you don't really need to. If you use the PZ crash map like I did, finding your way around is no longer a challenge! Now I know that I shouldn't have used the map, but I thought it made the game more realistic, I mean, I know my city very well, I know where things are, and even if I didn't I could simply raid a gas station and get a map! So, overall, this game is worth dumping your time into. It's a great zombie survival game, and I personally think that it is underrated. I am still super amped to have vehicles and NPC's but that's not happening for a while.GET THIS GAME!-8.7/10			"

								Firstly, a tl;dr review:Get it, and play it. Your first couple of runs might not feel very fun or make much sense, and you may feel this game is lacking content. But keep playing, and you'll understand what this game is all about. If you're one of those people who can't appreciate a good soundtrack, an immersive experience, and patient gameplay, stick to your H1Z1/CoD.9/10 overall. Brilliant, not overpriced, with active developers, mod support, and there's even local/online multiplayer. Can't go wrong with this. It's just sheer good-ness.Anyway. Onto a REAL review.Project Zomboid is one of the few games that actually makes me feel on edge whilst I'm playing. The game expresses how you ARE going to die, no matter what. And it's true. You WILL die. One scratch from a zombie can get infected, killing you irreversibly. 'Surely that's too powerful', you may be thinking, but no. This game stresses for you to skillfully outmanouver and sneak past zombies instead of killing them just because you can, or for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty 'XP'. Weapons are effective, and zombies are easy to kill, true... but one misclick is all it takes for your life to be over.And you know why it's not even frustrating when you die? Because the game told you that you were going to die. You knew this moment would come. I like to randomly generate a character, and 'live their story' if you like, trying to guide them through this unforgiving world as long as you can.When it comes to crafting, it takes effort to get the knowledge to actually craft things. As it should be. The building systems in other Early Access games are fun, aye, but they don't make much sense. Let's take 7 Days to Die, for example. 7dtd is a brilliant game, don't get me wrong - but Project Zomboid is more fun in terms of IMMERSION and REALISM.And there's one small feature in the game that I really love. In one of the soundtrack songs, there's the sound of a clock ticking in the background. That clock ticking signifies your time left to live before you die. Such a simple feature keeps you on edge, and keeps you as alert as a meerkat as you stroll around with your trusty butter knife.The only gripe I have is that I'd like to see some more/better animations on the player model. The combat system could be a little better too, as I often find myself 'charging' attacks, but I'm not even sure if charging my attacks matters or not most of the time.Regardless of those, this game is brilliance, created by innovative, clever, and active developers. It's fun, engaging, and a wonderful way to pass a few hours by. Mods are awesome with it, too.A must buy for zombie game lovers. 9/10.			"

								Great atmosphere and excellent soundtrack.  The feeling of creeping dread (should that be the creeping dead) as you do your best to stay alive is amazing.  The commonplace town setting and ordinariness of the world is surreal when being chased by 100 zombies.  Highly recommended ** Sadly this has turned out to be  yet another 'Perpetual Alpha' game.    I remember 3 years ago thinking how great this game will be when features such as vehicles, a creative/sandbox mode, fellow AI controlled survivors etc are added.  The game is still without any of these features. I've been checking the updates here for the past 2 years and have not seen any compelling new gameplay feature to make me want to play the game again. Instead the developers have spent ages on adding things such as 'better animations' and 'VOIP'.  To Indie Stone (PZ Developers): The animations were good enough  3 years ago.  I don't play PZ for the visuals, I play it for gameplay depth, simulation aspects and atmosphere.   VOIP  just seems to be a quick and easy way to try to reduce the complaints of emptiness/isolation in the game world.   The real way to solve the feeling of emptiness would, of course, be to add multiplayer and/or non-player-characters.So focus on the strengths of your game.  If I want visuals, animations and multiplayer, there are plenty of full 3D zombie games that do this far better than PZ ever will.  However none (very few) of them offer anywhere near the world detail, simulation and atmosphere that PZ does.    Oh, and finally, please take the game out of Early Access.  It's getting embarrassing after 5 years.  Since when does releasing a game mean that development cannot continue? Terraria, for example, shows how happy players are when new features are added for free to a 'released' game., even if they come 2 years later.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first review on Steam, even though I've been a member for 7 years... THAT'S why you should give this game a try. ;-)I'm a fan of builder games and zombies, so when I saw a zombie game where I can build, I had to have it. I wasn't sure I would care as much for the gameplay, but it definitely gets addicting. I spent my first few tries in an easymode sandbox and still managed to die. The graphics actually suit me great, since I'm an old-school gamer and prefer it more simpler than newer games today have. The action is pretty much the same no matter what you do, but the way it goes down differs. You could lose your focus and walk into a bathroom without paying attention and a zombie will lunge at you from behind the door. You could turn a corner and walk right into a herd. You could be bashing a zombie in the head with a shovel and think you're winning, but a zombie out of your line of sight comes up from behind and you're now infected. I once survived for 3 months and had stocked up on everything to outlive a lifespan, and then fell from a roof I was building and died anyways. Why do I keep restarting after such heartbreak? It must be a good game!I am excited for more updates on this game. We definitely could use more to build, more items throughout, and my most requested is different maps to explore. I'd love to not only have more maps to choose from, but maps that edge to another map.			"

								First of all, I also own the DRM-free non-steam version so don't mind the meagre 9h.This game is good, it's one of the rare survival game where you're actually tense when everything is going down the drain.It doesn't take good graphics to feel the desperation of a person with no food left and a broken weapon, who hear the moaning of the dead outside their barricaded windows increasing in quantity and loudness. It doesn't take text-boxes to feel the loneliness of a survivor who hasn't seen any living being for days/weeks/months.Why no thumbs up then?Because it's not enough to get a taste of the most promising meal of the year if the cooks abandon their ingredients on the table never to finish said meal, slowly getting stale somewhere near the turned-off oven.Seriously, with size and frequency between updates makes me wonder if there is more than one intern working on this game, it's basically abandoned or at least one man away from that.This game will never leaver Early Access I'm afraid.So yeah, thumbs down.Keep in mind that I like this game though, it was worth my money and I had plenty of fun, but I simply cannot give a thumbs up in all good faith to unprofessional devs who stop developing an unfinished game because they already got our money.I will modify my review if they ever resurrect themselves and finally start doing they job again of course.

								This game will not blow your mind with it's graphics or it's awesome multiplayer, that's for sure.HOWEVER...When it comes to survival, Project Zomboid is the BEST you can get. In no other game is survival so meticulous and so well thought out. You've seen hunger and thirst meters before you say? Sleep depravation is nothing new? Sickness? Exposure? Well, you've never seen it done RIGHT until you play Project Zomboid.PZ lets you try to survive in a Zombie Apocalypse and is even so kind as to let you choose the rules for your game. How do you get infected? Do zombies run, shamble or walk? How much do they see or smell? How long will you have power and water? How common is loot? And many other quirks that allow you to play how YOU want to play.The map is HUGE and since the game is so mod friendly, you'll never have to worry about growing tired of it. While now there aren't many other maps out there, there are a few and there will be more. Crafting, professions, day and night, seasons, building... all there to help you survive.Vehicles and NPCs... on the works. Soonish.This is the story of how you bought the best Zombie game ever made.			"

Early Access Review
								[Build 36 commentary, Feb. 9 - 2017]So... It's time to update this review I reckon. Six builds and two years after my first comment on this game, I return to it again. So... What's changed?Well, since my last visit, there's come a few new skillsets, electricity for those interested in making and breaking radio devices, as well as metalworking, which is currently nothing more than a fancier way to build/fortify your base, but opens up a great potential for future updates.There's also been a few traps developed that are meant to kill or distract zombies rather than catch wildlife, mostly bombs. The zombies have also been tampered with so that they don't simply stand idly by wherever they happen to turn; but congregate into small clusters which move around from time to time, which makes running around in the streets more hazardous than before.Some mod support has also been added, for those of you who prefer to improve this game yourselves with more or less realistic additions....I'm not gonna lie, not very much has changed as far as gameplay goes. Respawning zombies means that there's always going to be some manner of threat if you go outside, but in the end... most of the changes seem to only try and hold off on that boredom moodlet affecting both the character and the player.I realise that in my last review, which you can read below if you like, I was being very generous with the developers and praising them like they were the next Notch. I still have a lot of respect for them and their ambitions, but... I'll have to admit that their standing with me isn't quite as high anymore, simply because any significant changes they've made are not great enough to make this game as entertaining as it could and should be. They've introduced a few good changes, like more realistic zombie behavior, but most of it is just too subtle to make a difference in what is essencially the same problem this game has had from the start: Hoarding and waiting.And just to get it out of the way: NPCs are really hyped and would likely make a huge impact on gameplay. But while everyone wants it to happen as quickly as possible, remember this: The only thing worse than no NPCs are broken NPCs. Left for Dead, anyone?But make no mistake! I wouldn't have put in almost 1000 hours (as I'm writing this review) into this game if it was bad. This is a good game, although many will agree with me that it suffers from a dragged out development process filled with a lot of redundancies, and gameplay that can get stale quicker than your unconserved vegetables if you're not playing multiplayer. It's the big problem with any game that focus too much on realism: They forget that they're meant to be games, not outright simulators.With all that said... I still recommend this game. Yes, it's likely not gonna be finished by the next year, and yes it can wear itself out once you know what you're doing. But for all its flaws, there's a lot to see and do in Project Zomboid and there's gonna be even more in the future. So whether you're like me and prefer to play these things on your own, or you wanna play around with friends or even strangers (you masochist) in multiplayer, I think you're gonna find a lot of enjoyment in this.And as always, remember: Don't drink the bleach![Build 30 commentary, Feb. 18 - 2015]Ahh, this game... So many complex feelings, so little time! Well, for starters: This certainly isn't currently a game for everyone.Yes, it's quite playable and the amount of bugs is kept at a minimum, the developers are dedicated and keep in constant touch and the community is quite excellent at snapping up the details as they keep pouring out. So yes, this game IS going to be finished, one way or another. And as far as I'm concerned, it's going to be grand!This game is dedicated to creating realistic gameplay, so you'll have to contend with much more than zombies to survive. There are currently no human NPCs, but just trying to keep yourself alive is a challenge as you have to manage hunger, thirst, disease, fear, various kinds of wounds, (damn you broken glass!) and even boredom if you can get that far.I'm afraid, however, that boredom isn't simply a modlet, it can also affect the player. The main problem with this game is poor pacing.It's quite nerve-tingling, trying to sneak around without being overwhelmed by the undead horde and get bitten, resulting in slow, unavoidable permadeath. You look for tools, supplies and weapons to stay alive and defend yourself. How you do this is up to you, though some strategies are more likely to succeed than others. With some careful scavenging you can even cut down trees to barricade your house, or even build your own if that's more your style. You can grow crops, fish, trap small animals and generally get by well in the apocalypse. You can even learn to build rain catchers. And if everything else fails: Flee to the woods and forage for nuts and berries, sticks and stones. There's always an option for survival, but there's no zombrex...And from what I've heard (and experienced) all of this means that players usually end up barricading themselves, stockpiling a huge amount of resources, set up some water catchers, start a farm and just rest into infinity... or get bored really quickly and go out hunting zombies, get overwhelmed and/or bitten, end of story. So yes, the pacing herein is far from perfect...But the developers are very aware of this flaw, and are working on it with about the same vigour as with their human NPCs. So worry not dear gamers. This game is far from complete, yet it already presents you with a surprisingly engaging survival scenario. And if you're a survivalistic hoarder like myself, then I think you'll understand exactly what makes me hopeful for the future of both this game, and anything else these brilliant developers will create in the future.Also, I don't care how desperate you get: Don't drink that bleach! Just don't do it!			"

								It's pretty complicated game, guys. Like some real hardcore zombie survival stuff right here.You get bitten or just scraped the arm, while getting though a broken glass? Well, too bad. You are probably going to bleed to death. Good thing that you can rip your shirt off and make an improvised bandage. Bad thing, though... It's that it's not sterile and you are probably going to get it infected and die anyway. You are used to gun down every zombies you see? Well... Not here. As, weapons are rare and ammo is scarse. So, you'll probably be playing most part of the game with a plank sparkled with some nails most time of the game, peeking zombies one by one and keeping distance... Or dying to a horde, failing to peek zombies one by one. So yeah... You'll be dying. A lot. For all kinds of reasons. From zombie bite, to desperate player, killing you over some pills to get rid of common cold. If you are looking for hardcore zombies survival game, you are looking at one. 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is insanely well designed content-wise. Do not let the ""Early Access"" fool you; this game is so immense in features that it actually feels finished.This game is like a storyless Fallout with its intense depth, woo-hooless Sims with its building and crafting, tacticless Jagged Alliance with its coop gameplay, and missionless Syndicate with its art style.What is awesome:- Well, first of all, it gave one of the best Co-Op experiences till now. The glasses breaking, zombies walking in, the sense of pitch black when it's midnight, the desperation to get to safety, the ""omg the glass just broke"" feeling, the ""this door is locked man, we have to find another exit, I lure them into this room and close the door from behind, you find another door"" type of conversations... It's fun.- The content! So much to do. So much to craft. So many things to use as weapons. Every item you find that is lootlable is somehow usable. Every single thing can be used somewhere somehow. There is no ""garbage loot"" (except for a few stuff which don't have functionality attached to them yet, such as some pieces of clothing).- The ""apocalypse"" feel: Yes, they nailed it. You walk into a motel, just to find some doors open, blood everywhere, with two zombies shuffling in the bathroom when you open the door. The hoard of zombies that shuffle around the streets. The hordes filling the room at midnight when accidently a gun goes off.What the game needs:- Currently the only things that I've seen missing are the sprites (backpacks on the back or carried as secondary), unique art for some hand-held items (rolling pin looks like and is handled like a baseball bat), some animations (water drinking animations) and character-related stuff to add variation (more hairstyles) and so forth.- Instead of basic texturized lawns and such, the developers could go for rather more sophisticated ""environment design sprites"" for some locations, which would be static, hand-drawn images for backgrounds. The way it's done in the Fallout games, Wasteland 1-2 and the new Torment game (Tides of Numenera). Sure, mapmaking is dead easy right now probably using an incredibly easy-to-use tool that adds blocks, paints roads, etc., but still...- The game could also benefit more from character creation and customization options. Sure; the trait system is fine, but somewhat lacking in content. There are only 5 pre-selectable professions, and about 12 or so traits, half of them being negative and the other positive. So it doesn't always give a unique combination for each character created.- Better UI overall. The in-game inventory UI is fine, interactivity is good, but may need ""quick switch"" buttons so that we don't have to sift through the huge inventory to find the damn rolling pin.Last thoughts:Considering that driving, vehicles and more cities/towns will be added to the game in the future, the current level of depth in such a short period of time (despite everything the developers have gone through), I can positively believe that any promised feature will be delivered by the developers.It will definitely not be for people who like isometric games, but if you can get past that prejudice, you can unlock the full potential of Project Zomboid.

								Very great game. Perfect simulation of how they would act(as if I would know). I am writing this review right after losing.So I decide to tell you ""how I died"".I woke up in a house. The house i would later die in, the house was a two story,empty house probably for sale.knowing that there will be no food, water, or weapons/supplies I left the house to find somewhere to get my supplies.  I am walking,very slowly, to the next door house. Me being stupid i tripped over my foot and attracted the attention of the near by zombie. I ran faster than ever to the house next door. Running in the house i had went through my whole list of what i should and shouldn't keep to be most efficient... I still picked up everything.  I had found a knife, a fork, canned food, and a bottle of bleach. Me being depressed and paranoid i was compensating on wether i take the bleach and drink it, or use it to clean my water. A zombie had walked in and scratched me while i was thinking about that. I stopped thinking, got out my knife, and stabbed it until it was dead. It fell over, so i stomped its head until it had no head. I had scratch but not a big scratch, so i tore a piece of my clothes and wrapped it around me wound.  I went to another house, without attracting attention, it was a two story, clean, house the family must have been alive longer than the others. luckily i found all the supplies i needed. I found 2 aid kits, an axe, and some planks. I got all the materials out of it to sanitise my wound so i don't get infected or feel pain at the worst moments. there had been left over food in the house. For a few days i had been making plans, organizing, and living like i would before the apocolypse.  I went back to the house I had woke up in to start building walls, and more space to keep future supplies organized. My arm had went numb and I wasn't acting normal. Seeing anything that looked like a person made me want to attack them.That is when i realized... I am turning into a zombie. I had learned that even a scratch will get me infected, and that I didnt get cloth on my arm in time to stop it. the first aid kit wouldn't have helped due to the amount of time without the sanitary circumstances. That is how i died... and it was a nice life, but i could've...done better.8/10 IGN too little water			"

								If you're looking for the zombie game that focuses on surviving and not going in guns blazing this is the perfect game for you. The game is very blunt and lets you know right when you start up a game that you WILL eventually die. There is no cure waiting for you, no military evac post taking you to some cruise ship. It's just you and the undead.  Right now NPC's aren't implemented which makes you feel like the last person on earth, but the game is still a blast. Recently they added an overhaul to healing and instead of just slapping on a medkit or the likes you have to disinfect and bandage wounds (or remove bullets or glass). In my opinion this is the most realistic zombie game to date. The sounds are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. With the coming features promised the game will get even better. Multiplayer is implemented so hop on and have fun with others.I'd give it an 8.5/10 Easily a 10/10 when the game is finished.			"

Well you could say im a little bit of a graphics Wh@#%... That I thought there is no way in hell I would play this game. To old school!!! There's just no way... Well the story goes like this.     My alienware 18x had to be sent off for a repair and I had to break out my old laptop. Was looking for a game that was'nt as graphics intensive. So my search began. Looked at tons of games, but I have really been into survival games the last year or so. The pickings are slim as I own most of them. All of them disappointments by the way ( in more than one way for most ).I seen Project Zomboid and just kept passing it over. There's no way I would enjoy Zomboid. So was kinda eyeing Miscreated which had just come out, but while it looks ok . Seems like it just released way to early with not enough to offer. I could'nt bring myself to buy it though. To many others are stuck in this same state ( that I own) for me to commit to purchasing.     Well then I clicked on Project Zomboid (negative thoughts running through my mind). Read about the game. Scrolled down to reviews and started reading some( almost 6k positive and under 400 negative ).. Well hell that says alot right there. Most zombie survival games are about 1/2 and 1/2 with pos/neg reviews. So I wnt to youtube and started watching reviews on PZ. Took me about 2hrs to commit to buying PZ. Mind you I was still pretty darn sure I would'nt like it, but with so many positive reviews and positive community behind it. I figured I would give it a try.    I must say boy was I wrong. Just like minecraft this game proves graphics aren't everything. This game has really blown me away. Most complete and satisfying zombie survival to date for me ( hands down ). I can't say enough about PZ. Im still shocked that Im enjoying this game this much..If your on the fence just buy it. If your like me and thought no way? Just buy it... But wait there'ssssss Moooooore!!!!!!! This games not done yet. They still have alot to add, and the direction they are going sounds amazing. This game is only going to get better people. Long story short. Just Buy The D@%$ Game.....P.S: to those 370 Negative Reviewers WTH did you play the same game I did =p			"

								After reinstalling this game after more than a year of not playing and seeing zero significant changes (AGAIN), I gotta write this as a warning. This game is dead in the water as far as I'm concerned. 3 possibilities. 1. Develpment continues at this pace. In which case this game may be done in 10 years...2. Development stops completely. I've seen this pattern before, and this seems most likely. Probably culminating in the release of an unfinished product and a lot of angry people that have been holding their breath for 6 years. 3. Development suddenly surges, the game gets everything it promised in a reasonable time frame. Now, why would anyone assume this is likely given the mountain of evedence and history to the contrary?

								Great game! in Beta and there is a ton of great content. Yes, it has bugs and issues, but again it's in Beta. Probably the best zombie survival game I have ever played. Hunger and thirst play a major part in the game as well many other factors. Zombies are fun to kill and very challenging at times. Crafting is fairly in depth and should get better with time. There is no multiplyer as of yet but that is something that is planning on being released. When raiding houses or any building for supplies you never know what to expect with is awesome. The place could be clear or you could hop through a window, meet 3 zombies get bit and die.Overall great game with loads of potential.			"

								Awesome zombie survival indie game. It's early release now but already oozes potential and will no doubt get much better as time goes on. It's a permadeath survival game with many mechanics such as weather, exposure, moodlets, cooking, scavenging, infection, positive/negative trait tradeoffs, enormous map to explore, electricity/water supplies, crafting and a bunch of other stuff. It's also pitched at the ideal price point for this game imo.			"

								I've been very interested in this game for a long while. It was shaping up to be the zombie survival game I've always wanted. After playing it for the first time, I fell in love. It had the right amount of depth and realism needed to really make it special. You had to deal with all the struggles of surviving in a zombie outbreak, from not getting eaten alive by the zombies themselves to depression. The game also has a good amount of difficulty, even if the game is easy to learn and master after multiple playthroughs. Surviving for a skilled player becomes trivial. That's where the NPCs come in though, to spice up the playthrough. And that's the reason why I am not able to recommend this game, unfortunately. I understand the NPCs the devs had planned were very ambitious (probably too ambitious for a small team) and need time to get right. I also understand that the devs have went through development hell, and that's also part of the reason for NPCs not being close to finished. However, it's been about 6 years since I started following this game, and I'm beginning to give up hope of ever seeing NPCs in this game anytime in the near future. For me, NPCs are a big component of this game, and not having them just makes the game seem hollow. Sure, you have all this depth to this survival experience, but it's really hard to have the motivation to survive if you have nothing to survive for. I feel like NPCs are what would take this game and really turn it into something special. Unfortunately, the devs have decided not to reveal anything about NPCs until they are in their final phases of development. While I understand why they are doing this, it is causing many people who follow this game (me included) to lose hope of ever seeing NPCs in the game. However, there is multiplayer. If you are the type of player who loves multiplayer survival games, then go ahead and pick this game up. It works very well from what I've played of it. However, I personally am a singleplayer fan, and so NPCs are what makes or breaks this game for me. Unfortunately, until NPCs are added (or we get any news about it in the upcoming months) I cannot recommend this game for anyone who isn't wanting to play multiplayer. While it is fun for a bit, the singleplayer will get old rather quickly. My biggest fear is that they will start to focus exclusively on multiplayer rather than NPCs. I really hope this is not the case, as I've always wanted a good singleplayer zombie survival experience.			"

								Project Zomboid is interesting, and I recommend it, but I'm not sure I can recommend it to everyone.The basic idea of the game is that it's a simulator that tries to accurately simulate surviving the zombie apocalypse. In this regard it is uncomprimising, going as far as prioritizing realistic(As realistic as you can be with a zombie apocalypse scenario, anyway) and immersive mechanics over stuff that is actually, y'know, strictly about making the game fun to play. This results in a lot of features that are pretty cool in concept, but can end up being frustrating in the context of the game itself, with its sort of clunky strategic top-down gameplay. Here are some examples of this:-Enemy variety, currently there's just human zombies. No special zombies, no animal zombies, just human zombies with varying degrees of speed and strength. This can get dull and, coupled with the next feature mentioned in this list, makes guns kind of not worth using since melee weapons deal with everything pretty well.-Anything that makes loud noise attracts zombies, as does any kind of noise in general. No using the gun you spent ages looking for, it's more dangerous than useful.-The game has a large featureset for building but building also means hauling around heavy objects that put you at max encumbrance, meaning a lot of trips to and from the trees you're harvesting for wood.-Skills level slowly, progression can take what could be called a ""Realistic"" amount of simulated time with it being possible to survive for months and years worth of ingame time.-Zombie infection. This is the big one, being infected slowly but surely kills you and can result from one bite.Now, all this isn't to say that the game isn't fun to play - it is, but it's the sort of game that appeals more to people who like slow, strategic survival gameplay and anyone who wants a zombie apocalypse sim that prioritizes attention to detail over all else and features possibly the most comprehensive persistent open world used in a zombie or survival game to date. Anyone expecting an actiony/arcadey zombie survival game will end up disappointed.The only thing I can objectively count as a negative is that melee targeting on corpses will occasionally not work, and I've had a lot of characters ended by having a zombie I'm trying to stomp on stand up inside them and instantly deliver a bite that has something like a 90% infection rate. Be wary of that!I rate this game 3.5 out of 5 in its current state.			"

								I got into playing this game because my dad did, and when ever he would talk about it i thought that ""man that game sounds bad, how could my dad possibly play it all day, every day?"" Finally I grew a pair and watched my dad play Project Zomboid. I got hooked and I asked my dad ""yo dad can I play with you?"" and he said ""HELLS YEAH!"" and It took me a few minutes to get used to the controles and I was hooked. I wanted the game my self, But I have absolutely no money so my dad did this amazing thing that lets me play his version of it on my computer and now almost like clockwork I get on Steam and play Project Zomboid right after i get done with my homework and after my cat nap. and i play it until it is time for me to go to bed. With only bathroom breaks and breaks for dinner or snacks.I would highly recommend this game to anyone I mean ANYONE who like Sims, because it is basecly Sims but you have to survive, kill zombies (or walkers what ever you want to call the walking dead) and try to survive as long as you possibly can. There are lots of places to explore, they have Malls, 7-11 (but of cource they aren't called that in the game because thats copyright), houses (LOTS and LOTS of houses, you got two story houses one story houses also you have trailer parks ((Now you can call the zombies, trailer trash Zombies, they even act like trailer trash and are pains in the butt.))) The one thing you have to be careful about is the Alarms on the houses or stores because they sometimes attract a few zombies and sometimes they attract a whole hoard of zombies (It is really Freaking hard to kill zombies when you are surrounded and are trying to kill 30 of them because unlike trying to kill just 4 or 5 of them which you can just attack and run a few feet away and attack again, you cannot do that with 30 of them because they are all coming at you and if they bite you, you're dead because the bite could get infected if left unattended (the bad thing is that when you die and turn into a zombie you cannot play as the zombie.) another fun thing to do is to get drunk. (its as if you were to get drunk in real life, you cant walk straight. you have terrible aim, and any other thing that you know about getting drunk they got it (except the part where some people who get drunk can't shut up, your person doesn't say anything, Its like if you were to get your friend drunk and duck tape there mouth so they cant say anything.) Before you even start the game you can pick traits that you would like to have (Good and Bad) a really good trait that I always get is Claustraphobic because it is amazing. If you want to kill zombies all the time I would recommend that you get thick skinned. You get to name your character and even get to sorta choose what he or she is wearing and pick a hair style that you like.So if you want to play a game that is Like the Sims and you like killing zombies you need to get and play this game (because I know some of you will get the game and not play it ((it would be a Waist of a perfectly good game))			"

								I think I will finally give this game a review, I have been playing this game for a long time now, I cannot give it a thumbs up yet do to the fact it has taken so long in development, I understand that it is a small team, but for real, the lack of adding content should not be this slow even for those that take part in IWBUMS. I read an article yesterday where the devs said ""We’re starting to plan out our final march toward 1.0, which we’re hoping will be within the late first quarter of 2015, possibly creeping into Q2,” and we are nowhere near that in any way shape or form this was from 680 DAY'S AGO. Screw the Naysayers who say this game is not worth it, because it is , the game play, the idea, the graphics are all great, the game is fun, but it is unfinished. The DEV's have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of people that are assisting finding bugs with the whole IWBUMS, so I ask why nip pick at the content you have and try and make it perfect, the whole point of early access is to push the content, let people find the bugs, and you fix them and assist with development.   Every Monday I am disappointed I want content because I really love playing this game, I have a game where I have lived on my own for almost a year now, but it is getting boring, even with the tiny bit of updates they have added. At some point you need to listen to the masses and give them what they want, and sorry to say it but people want NPC's, transportation, and quest just to name a few. I mean it a game, push what you have and let us break it, let us play it. When there is a massive update to the game and you have goals and NPC's I will change review to thumbs up. Until then I would say do not expect anything to change any time soon.			"

								What can I say?  This game's interface looks so simplistic by today's standards, and yet the Indie Stone team has managed to possibly create one of the best post-apocalyptic zombie survival games in existence to date.In a sea of games set in the rapidly-becoming-trite-and-humdrum End Of The World By Way Of Zombies scenarios, this one outshines them all.  Yes, even in its alpha stage.In the sandbox game, you create your character and are greeted with the cheery messages telling you, basically, that you're *going* to die.  There's no rescue coming, the end isn't just nigh, it's done come and gone.  You're on your own.  Your goal is basically just to survive as long as you can.  And die you will.  Many, many times, at least unti you get the hang of the game's mechanics and how to avoid becoming some poor deceased fast food worker's lunch.  Barricade windows and doors, erect walls, keep yourself fed and watered, and don't let your character get bored and depressed.  Flee town and start a farm to live off the land, or hole up in an abandoned warehouse and periodically raid the surrounding buildings for supplies, all while avoiding the relentless horde which believably reacts to sight, sound, and smell.For those of you used to games like Left 4 Dead, taking on a horde of fifty zombies with a shotgun is one of the worst things you can do in this game.  The noise brings every zombie in a five mile radius bearing down on you, and your ammo supply is typically very limited.  Even one zombie hiding in that corner you forgot to check is a threat.  Whoa, there was one in the tall grass you didn't see, and he wasn't dead.  Now he's gnawing on your ankle.  Whoops, is that a bite?  Welp.  You're infected.  Expect to live another couple of days in game before turning.  Or you could just chug that bottle of bleach you found in the bathroom earlier to end it now...In short, this game delivers one of the most intense and gripping presentations of the zombie apocalypse I've seen in a video game yet.  Pessimistic and gritty, and incredibly addicting, even without the option of mowing down hundreds of cannon fodder corpses.  I've probably logged more than 150 hours in this game in total, and I still can't get enough.The best part is that the development team is still working hard, cranking out more and more updates, polishing features, ironing out the bugs, and keeping their players informed about what's to come.  This game is well, WELL worth the $15 they're asking for.			"

								I believe Steam Early Access ruined this game.Why?Because it has been 5+ years, and the game is still unfinished, if anything, EA has made the developers work on the game slower.""Ayyy look at all dis money we gettin', let us continue to promise ♥♥♥♥ to keep interest up.""I'm not a game developer, I don't know jack ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to coding, but seriously guys, you're not working on a Ultra 3D environments AAA game here.I have heard some bad ♥♥♥♥ about Indie Stone too, I ain't gonna mention much about it, because I might get banned for even talking about it..oh I already did, oh well.They are not good at taking critizism, just one thing.Do what you guys want, the game was fun about 7-8 years ago or whatever when it were in Alpha, I honestly don't remember when I bought it, I just remember that is was ages ago.My most sincere recommendation, wait for the game to get finished.Now once it is, wait another few years, because I just KNOW that they will bring the game out of EA, and then pretend that the game is done, while adding ""bug fixes"" and ""content updates"".Yes, I AM telling you to stay away from this game.But I am also saying do what you want.Just don't buy it.Do whatever you want.Except buy it.This is not the Zombie Survival game you are looking for. *magic hand motion*			"

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is a refreshing gem in the survival game genre.When I bought this game in 2011, long before steam greenlight, I stumbled upon this game on YouTube.It was far from what you have seen before, the closest thing to it at the time was minecraft.The developers humble about their little project.Back then the map was tiny, weapons did not exist in the quantity they do now, the food system we have now did not exist, multiplayer was a massive requested feature but was thought to never happen, there was no progression system the graphics were odd, you get the idea it was not a big game.Now, after 5 years a lot has changed, it has become quite a survival game.Since the steam review section consists mainly out of overused memes, people complaining about their PC not being able to handle the games and people ranting with 1000 hours that the game sucks I will post more of an introduction than a review. I will of course say what is good and what is missing but I will focus on it more in detail than a short review would.At the bottom I will sum everything up with a TL;DRWhat makes the game good?Its combat system:Overall the combat system is satisfying.You don't feel too strong or too weak. Your character feels like he is hitting bodies made out of bone and flesh, not bodies made out of papiermâché or not rocks like in other games.There are three different types of combat:
BluntBladeRagedBlunt consists out of bats, spiked bats and sledgehammersBlade consists out of Knives and AxesRanged consists out of Pistols, Shotguns and RiflesIf enemies get too close (hugging close) an axe won't do much damage a knife however will. A blunt weapon is efficient as long as the enemy is in reach however, it won't do as much damage as a close ranged knife or an axe.Guns do good amount of damage if the enemy is at the right distance. If the enemy gets in melee range it won't be nearly as accurate as if he is a few meters away.Axes have a sweet spot where the blade contacts with the enemy where they will be the most efficient. If you swing too much your character won't hit as hard.Mood and Needs:Your character of course does not stroll through the zombie apocalypse like it's nothing, under all those pixels he also had emotions and needs which this game wants to deliver to you. Your character can feel a variety of things which affect his combat and health.Your character can feel pain, sadness, nausea, panic, sadness, boredom, hunger and thirst, exhaustion, tiredness and temperature.All these affect you somehow, pain and panic for example can reduce your accuracy with weapons, if you are in great pain you won't be able to sleep.Hunger and thirst obviously will kill you if they get to great.Boredom and Sadness don't do ♥♥♥♥ but change the appearance of the world (it becomes darker), in the future however they will play a bigger role.Nausea makes you recover less if injured or if you get really sick by eating that month old lasagne then you may die.Exhaustion makes you a slow weakling.Tiredness reduces your awareness and ultimately makes you collapse on the street if it gets too bad.Your character can defeat zombies, that means he is also able to overcome his emotions. here are some examples.If you are in great pain you can take pain killers.If you are bored you can go outside, mom will be proud or get drunk dad will be proud . He can also read or something.If you are tired you can drink a coffee, you can also use the ancient chinese trading secret method of sleeping.If you are thirsty you can drink out of the toilet bowel, and so on.Your character also adapts over time, he is less prone to panic the longer he is around zombies and is not so emotionally impacted after seeing corpses all day.What about progression and stats?Project Zomboid lets your character develope over his lifetime and you get to already influence your character's skills and talents while you are creating him.While creating your character, you can chose his pre-apocalypse profession and his traits, the higher the benefits of these professions the less points you can spend on other traits.There are many traits and professions so I will only give one example.You want your character to be able to build objects that can actually stand? Then you can pick carpender, this gives your character more experience in carpentry allowing him to build more complex objects right off the bat.If your character does something often, he will gain more experience and gain level, this can improve how efficient your character with the knife on the field, or in the kitchen and much more.How much can you control in the environment? Your character can farm, build, and scavenge.If you don't want to starve then you need to plant food, if you don't want to get killed by a horde then you need to be able to build sturdy houses and if you want tools you need to scavenge for rocks to build tools.There are many differnt crops that you get to plant, you need to plow the soil, water them regularly and make sure no one steps on them.For building there are many different structures to chose from, the things you build become more sturdy the more expereience you have. This can been seen not just by their hitpoints but also visually.Challenge:Project Zomboid is a game that is challenging for new players but once you get the hang of it, it gets pretty easy. After a month of playing the electricity and water supply will turn off because the power plant will get over run. This forces the player to find a well in the middle of nowhere to obtain more water or to drink out of every toilet bowel in the city. Since there is no power you can not refrigerate anymore, meaning you will have plant food yourself. There is no greater goal to accomplish but not dying which truly makes this game a survival game, this can get boring over time.There are things to still be added:A much requested feature are NPC, they once were in the game (around 2012) however the developers found that they simply were not smart enough, so they removed them. Since then they have been working on them and other projects so they won't blow ♥♥♥ once they are in the game, people simply have to be patient.Other things like generators a nutricion system is coming too, so don't you dare think that the developers have become lazy. The fact that these guys are still dedicated to this game after such a long time (this being their first project) is very comforting to know. They are also remaking the visuals and combat system for the third time to make it even better, you can check their YouTube channel for some footage of that. They always have new ideas and mods can also improve on the experience. (Here is my favorit one as an example)There are things I can not mention because of the character limit on steam, like the map editor for example.TL;DR:Project Zomboid is a game with a great atmosphere. With a satisfying combat system, needs and moods, alongside a trait and experience system and a great soundtrack, it succeeds at delivering an entertaining experience.The game still has not reached full replay value since you are all alone but if you buy a copy with a friend it will definitely last you a lot of hours, don't let that shy you away however since even alone this game will deliver.Since patches come regularly with the developers listening and interacting with the community on their forum I can only recommend this as an early access.

								Day 1 My first in-game day was spent wandering around and trying to figure out the controls. I picked up some food and a baseball bat and ran around smashing windows, climbing inside people's houses and looting. After caving in a few Z-heads I was told I was thirsty. I drank some water from a toilet and all was well. I was then told I was hungry. Searching in a house I found a ""TV Dinner"", which sounded perfect. I walked over and put it in the oven. While I was waiting for it to cook I read a book. A short time later I came over to the oven only to find I had burnt my TV dinner. The game told me I would get depressed and unhappy should I eat it. I did. I was instantly overwhelmed with depression and told I was tired. I went to sleep on the couch. Day 2 The next morning I awoke in an unhappy mood. I was playing about with the controls and somehow managed to accelerate time at an alarming rate. After smashing some keys I finally got it back to normal. My character was hungry, thirsty, bored, depressed and tired now. O goodie. I found a steak and slung it in the oven to cook. I was not going to let this meal burn, so I stood there watching it cook. The instant it was finished I grabbed it and scoffed the whole thing. As is tradition, I washed it down with some toilet water. I was told my character was going to collapse (presumably because he had been awake for about 2 days solid due to the time accelerating-issue). I curled up on the sofa and went to sleep. Day 4? I woke up in the middle of the night and could not see a thing. I thought it best I continue with my book in the pitch black, so began reading for a bit. Morning came and I was hungry and thirsty. I searched around the neighbourhood for supplies and came across a packet of cigarettes and some peanut butter. I ate the cigarettes and the peanut butter and sipped some more toilet water. I also found a backpack and various other supplies. I went on a journey north. My mood seemed to change as I smashed Z after Z' head in. My depression lifted and I found new vigour. As the day went on I looted a liquor shop for crisps and ice-cream and broke into a farm house to steal a hammer and nails. ....that's pretty much how my game went so far.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

								When I decided to look at the store page for this game, I was genuinely surprised to see a seemingly unending cascade of negative reviews. On one hand, I can see things from their perspective, and I can see why these people ultimately do not recommend this game. However, I'd like to address claims made by these people, validating some and disproving others. This review is aimed at people on the fence about purchasing this game.In its current state, this game is great fun. I've had experiences on this game that one could not get anywhere else. Granted, these experiences were only possible due to the multiplayer experience. Experiences such as building whole communities that were genuinely life-like, and on the other hand, watching them inevitably collapse. This game has far more depth than most games of this genre. It is not without its problems, but I will touch on those later.A lot of people are claiming this game has not changed in the last 4-5 years. This is the most myopic claim I see people make, so I'd like to address this one first. This game has indeed changed a lot. Some of these changes seem quite small, but have had large impact on the game. Some examples of how this game has changed are as follows:Revamped medical/health system.Revamped skills, traits, and character progression.Addition of skills such as foraging, trapping, fishing, metalworking, etc.Addition of skills such as aiming, accuracy, etc. All of which increase as your character survives.Addition of a nutrition system.Addition of player-made traps such as nail traps, bombs, etc. (Significant impact in multiplayer.)Added professions such as engineer, electrician, metalworker, etc. (In tandem with added skills.)Greatly improved horde migration and zombie spawning.Revamped UI and inventory system.Multiplayer optimization and voice support. (Significant impact in multiplayer.)Improved cooking system. (Ability to bake bread and learn recipes.)World building through radio and TV broadcasts. (Players are able to broadcast through radio in multiplayer.)UX improvements pulled from the forum suggestions thread. (Such as highlighted containers when looting them.)Added world decay and seasons. (Vines creep up the walls of housing, road decay, nature slowly taking over, etc.)Modding support.Greatly improved sound engine and ambienceSandbox options that allow the player to customize their apocalypse experience.All of these changes have made the game feel more complete and wholesome. The singleplayer audience would understandably leave this game to age in their library. Without the diversity of human interaction, as frustrating as it may be at times, I do not think this game would live. The experiences you can have that will make this game worth far more than its asking price are simply not possible without multiplayer, and to be honest, not even with the inclusion of promised NPCs. The NPCs many are asking for would be considered wonderfully ahead of their time, provided they make release. To call the devs lazy is another narrowminded insult, as the devs share their progress with the community on a weekly basis. I see many call these mondoids ""useless,"" and then these same people will accuse the devs of being too lazy to work on the game, even though what the devs are working on and what their progress is has just been disclosed.However, these negative reviews are not all entirely wrong. Development progress is rather slow. However, you have to understand that this game started off as a one-man project. It is impressive for how far it has come, though it has a way to go before meeting its rather large ambitions.It is important to keep in mind that the updates The Indie Stone releases are very polished and go through weeks of playtesting to ensure highest quality once it hits the main branch. Even bugfixes go through this playtesting stage to ensure fixes do not create more problems. It is evident the devs do genuinely care about their game because of the amount of polish each update goes through.The heavy amount of negative reviews is worrying because not only are they rather hasty in their analysis, but in addition, they lead the would-be player to assume the game is in a failing, bug-ridden, and unenjoyable state.In its current state, the game is far from unenjoyable. If you pick this game up, especially if on sale, and hop onto a server, whether it be your own or a larger public one, you will find that this game meets expectations for its asking price of a mere $15.I've been a radio host, a member of a rebellion in a community, been surrounded in a building by a de-facto police force, been a lone wolf, a bartender, a member of a cannibalistic faction, a double-agent, taken part in defending a player-made town from a horde, been kidnapped and forced to fight to the death with planks and frying pans, been robbed, robbed others, hid in a closet while a serial killer murdered men just outside my door, overheard conversations not meant for my ears, been spied on, found bases hidden in the woods, ran trade routes, etc.I do recommend purchasing this game. At the very least, keep your eye on this one for when it releases animations and other updates.			"

								I wish I could recommend this game as it was and still is a good concept and the execution isn't done that bad at all. Combat is a little clunky at times but the survival aspects are well done in my opinion and are fairly in-depth. With a slew of status effects derived from environemtal conditions to emotional factors such as anxiety, fear and depression, just to name a few, there is quite a varried platter of outcomes for each players death and it makes for a pretty neat replayability factor since the survival is intended to be very difficult. However through all the many years I've had this title development has been slugish at best and now it seems as though the developers have lost motivation to get a finished product to the many backers that enjoyed their concept. Seriously around 7 years in early access and this is all you have to offer? I could accept the lack of progess if there were low amounts of sales but honestly this game has sold quite decently, at least well enough to warrant hiring a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ employees to get your product FINISHED. These guys are so unprofessional they are just now starting to deliver on features they promised all the way back in 2015! If that doesn't scream incompitence I don't know what does. Save your money and don't invest in this concept, because that's all it is at this point. There is not enough gameplay elements to keep you interested for very long and even with multiplayer the lack of activities to carry out make for a bland experience. I hope to see this game make some sort of progress towards a final release. Maybe I'll check back in another 7 years to see if it's done yet :)			"

								I'm a huge fan of true survival games, like don't starve. where it's hard to survive and, if possible at all, even harder to thrive. During the winter sale I was looking for a new survival game to play, and this always proves to be a difficult task because there are so many fake survival games, games that with enough grinding you can easily thrive.So I decided to give project zomboid a try, and the game positively surprised me.It is a really hard game where if you be careful enough, you'll be able to survive, but a minor screw up can and will kill you. Wasn't prepared for that zombie in the bathroom of a house you thought was empty? He can scratch you or bite you, giving you a high chance of zombification, an illness with no cure in the game. Yes, you a zombie manages to scratch or bite you, there's a big chance that the game over timer will start ticking.And even if you isolate yourself from the huge amounts of zombie in the forested areas of the huge (HUGE) map, you'll still will have to deal with food and water. Food can be preserved for more time in fridges, but guess what? After a random amount of days, the power will be cut out. You can drink water from sinks and toilets, but just like the power, water will also be cut out after a random amount of days.The character creation is fantastic as well, and the trait system reminds me of old fallout games. You have good and bad traits that give you negative and positive points, respectively. You can only start the game if you have 0 or more points so you'll need to balance your character accordingly.And it has multiplayer! I had loads of fun playing with two people, scavenging the city for supplies, reinforcing a place to call home...And finally, another thing that really surprised me was the amount of zombies in the game. Depending on your luck and area in the game, you can stumble upon hordes and hordes of zombies. This feels just like the walking dead, and in fact it's one of the games that feels most like the series, apart from the telltale's ones, of course.This game is still in early access and it's loads of fun. I can't even think of how it will look and play when it's done.			"

								I am not usually a big fan of zombie survival games but this game is awesome! There is a heavy focus on not just surviving against the zombies, but against hunger/depression/disease/etc as well. And don't let the graphics dissuade you. This games is addictive. If you are into fancy HD graphics and stuff, go somewhere else. But you won't find a game that has that and is this immersive and strategic in managing your resources while still fighting to survive. Great game!			"

								Project Zomboid is a game that repeatedly puts you in danger until the point where you get yourself set up in a ""House of vauge saftey"" where you would start to line your building with meger means of defence until you can build enough that you start to belive you can survive the appocolypse, and this is what I call ""Survival Hubris"" kicks in and you start getting greedy and careless planning out routes that to your younger self of only a few hours would find rash and ""unliveable"" but because of all of the close brushes with the undead where you have remained unscathed you decide that it is in fact a good idea to go to the police station only a few blocks from your safehouse with the idea of grabbing all the ammo and flipping off a few zeds and while holding out your most fallic of fingers a zombie will sneeze on it ever so gently that you become ill and hide in your safehouse until your eyes slide out your ♥♥♥♥ and you die, Project Zomboid is a game that rakes you in the face until you love it, it's true that you need to spend a few months getting over the hole that this game has torn in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll be well inclined to jump onto it bare ♥♥♥♥♥ again in the future. 10/10 will get careless again			"

								Hands down the best zombie survival game i have ever seen.The map is still under progress, but it's already huge with two major towns , and many factories / hidden places.The zombies are really well coded, and everything is taken into account : the noise you make, if you are visible through a window, if they see light inside a building, ect...Also, your character can only see what's in front of him, you thought you'd have a nice, aerial view of every danger around ? Nope.The variety of items that can be found is huge, it makes the game very realistic, and scavenging all the more interesting.The weapon system is made in a way that you can't kill many zombies easily, so it's vital to establish strategies like catching the attention of zombies to get them away from your shelter, and loose them by running between trees.The graphics are great, the game is light and will run on most computers.This game is everything DayZ (and many other similar games) should have been, and it keeps getting better with every update, thanks to the awesome Devs.Did i forget to mention it ? This game is very hard. You're going to die. Quickly.			"

Early Access Review
								I quickly discovered something important about Project Zomboid - I'm not very good.  Spinning to face a zombie, I recalled my son's reaction when I beat a guy one-on-one in a shootout in WolfET.  He looked at my dead opponent and said ""thank you for sucking"".I bring this up because I can set Sandbox Mode to ease me into harder and harder levels.  Nobody's gona watch me on YouTube if I'd been recording my playthroughs (I haven't been)(you're welcome), but poor little Joey Fatone has a pretty good base set up, and his much tougher brother Fred Fatone is working on his own.  I'm learning the system, and having a ball.Most guys will play PZ like it's Dwarf Fortress (""Losing is Fun!"") which is great, but it's your call.  There's a deep and satisfying skill system, but that's poorly suited to die-in-a-week scenarios.  So you make an important choice when you start the game, entirely apart from which Fatone brother to play and what skills he has.  Sandbox can be adjusted to encourage learning a lot, Survival, well, not so much unless you're adept.  I've seen enough playthroughs to convince me that very, very few guys, and I don't mean old ones like me, will bother much with most skills if they know that living a month is unlikely.   The game has not yet reached a point, however, where an effective base will be fun for very long, at least not your second or third one.  If you make yourself safe and reasonably self-sustaining, you've won, and it's probably time for a new Fatone.But, the game lets you pick what style you want.  Anyone remotely interested in the genre, basically anyone interested enough to be reading this, should enjoy the game.  Just don't expect to live forever, you're Joey Fatone, not Justin Timberlake.

								I played a lot of zombieslasher/ survival games ( Left 4 dead, Resident Evil, 7 days to die, dying light, ...) so Project Zomboid seemed to be a good choice. It is supposed to fill the gap between crafting games and survival games but (in my opinion) fails in some important aspects.After a fun character creation (profession, many ridicolous attributes to choose from: deaf, obese ...) and a difficulty choice you spawn in your apartment in an undead infested world. You explore a giant world with towns and forrests all the while defending yourself against zombies and the elements of nature. There is no hope of survival! (and thats the problem)This is one of those games you think should be great but once you actually try it out, its just lackluster and a waste of time. Here is why: Fighting System You kill endless hordes of undead which all behave the same (some slower or faster but thats it) and look pretty similar after some time. This might be ""classic zombie behaviour"" but has to be counteracted by engaging and fun combat mechanics. Its simply not fun to right click, then hold the attack until the zombie is in reach and release the mouse button. The zombie either stumbles and falls over or you have to walk backwards and repeat. Once its down simply stomp it to death.This is fun  for like a hundred zombies and becomes a chore afterwards.I dont mind killing zombie hordes after hordes in any other zombie game but somehow this game sucked the fun out of it. Even worse that the whole map is crawling with zombies and you have to waste many real life hours to clear an area. But then you wont meet a damn zombie there for a loong time since they only respawn when you leave area for a longer period of time.Not even the guns can salvage the complete lack of zombie-slaying fun since they are hard to come by (good) but utterly useless since they alarm every zombie around. They are also clunky and require a high shooting skill to hit anything even in close proximity. You also have no real way of aiming with a crosshair, only general pointing and praying for a hit. Variation There are multiple weapons in this game: Pencils, knifes, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, pistol and lots more.BUT they mostly look literally the same (a lot of melee weapons look like the baseball bat) and handle pretty similar in combat. Crafting seems exciting since you have they choice between hundreds of recipes (even generators which can power lamps or a fridge). But the amount of stuff you have to find until you can craft these things is huge and can take a long time of wandering around the map searching for random loot. The result is simply not worth the grind. The UI makes handling you inventory quite annoying and needs a serious overhaul.Long term goal/ motivationThe main reason i cant recommend this is the complete lack of motivation to actually survive. You gonna die anyway so why even hoard supplies or farm endlessly? L4d has saferooms and some kind of escape in the unknown. 7 days to die has huge building projects to undertake (also kind of pointless but still). Resident Evil, Dying Light and many other zombie games use a story line to keep the player engaged.Project Zomboid has nothing but building youself a poor mans fort and play farmer till you get bored to death. Of course you can still have a lot of fun but simply imagining a story in your head but why take this from the devs shoulders? There is mainly one thing which would boost the stale gameplay: NPCs combined with some long term goal ( cure, Escape or whatever). This brings us to: Development PaceThis game is in development for about 5 years and gets updates every few weeks but doesnt progress anymore. The recently addet TVs and radios dont even have sound! They just repeat the same written lines like in retro games (sounds in fallout 2 for example).The developer essays are interesting to read at first but get annoying very soon. If there happens a major update which actually implements some kind of content apart from wandering the map, killing samey zombies and looting endless containers i will gladly update my review.Until then i cannot recommend this game at all.

								The only thing I can say is stupid or lame about this game is that it has ""Project"" in the official title. However, this game is a masterpiece in the open world survival genre, pitting you against mankind's greatest foe. Care to take a guess? The answer is not zombies. It's your own bodily functions. The easy to avoid zombies start to look a little more dangerous with each bit of your health slowly disappearing over time, whether you're spiraling into insanity, or catching the common cold, or growing bored and wet. And you thought hunger and thirst were bad enough.To further add onto the awesome, Zomboid has a functioning split-screen mode as well as a working online mutliplayer that came as quite a shock to a number of players who never expected it to see the light of day. Among that, it features a micromanageable difficulty in which you can alter anything from playing with a mass of zombies or completely alone (which is oddly terrifying), to altering how much loot you have, what kind of weather you'll see, infection conditions, and even modify zombie AI. And then you get a lot of mod functionality from allowing gameplay changes to custom professions. Even at Early Access, Project Zomboid is already working on a solid (and a little buggy) foundation, and is definitely worth checking out.			"

								TL:DR for people who just want the quick and silly reviewsI convinced my friend to eat a roasted cockroach and then watched him succumb to disease. 10/10, would make my friends eat roaches again.Now, with that out of the way, Project Zomboid is a zombie survival game which has been in steady development for the last six or so years. It takes place in the town of Muldraugh Kentucky and the surrounding areas of Knox County. (Fun fact, the scene in which the villians  men are marching up a street with a tank towards Fort Knox in the James Bond film ""Gold Finger"" was shot in Muldraugh.) Over the course of it's development, Project Zomboid has suffered some outstanding set backs. Paypal and Google freezing Indie Stones accounts, Piracy of the game early in it's development, and the theft of a large amount of code stored on a pair of laptops. Despite all that, Project Zomboid is still here, and it has come a hell of a long way. Gameplay involves scavanging supplies from the houses belonging to your ex neighbors, fortifying a house to hold off the steadily increasing number of zombies, and generally trying to set up some kind of long term survival. Zombies have infectious bites/scratches, which is an issue I have with the game. When you get bit or scratched, you might as well just quit. No point in continuing to play a doomed character. Fortunately, the sandbox mode allows you to turn the infection off, or tweak the gameplay and zombies in many other ways. The game also features basic crafting and construction, which allow you to make a few small utility items, or build very simple structures. Cooking is a good source of fun, especially when you are playing with friends. The best part is making rat soup and making your friends eat it. The game also features a fair bit of random variable when it comes to the zombies. Noises of any kind usually attract them, including the ambient noises you hear around you as you explore. A major source of game ending noise are burgler alarms and helicopters. The burgler alarm triggers sometimes when you break into a house, the noise it makes can be heard for miles and will attract every single zombie within that area of effect. They will descend upon the house and rip it apart searching for the source of the noise, not to mention you if you are fool enough to hang around said house. The other source, helicopters, have a large range of noise and if they come by while you are outside, they will follow you around. Imagine a news helicopter trying to get footage of an unfortunate survivor, unaware that their presence is dooming him/her. Other noises such as gunshots, barking dogs, screaming people, serve the same purposes but to a lesser extent. The ambiant noises occur once, and basically just move zombies in a shortish range towards the sounds origin point. It also serves as a bit of atmosphere. Speaking of screaming people, NPC are planned. You can go to the community hub and see as everyone demands and complains ceaselessly about the lack of NPC's. Some of them even know that zomboid DID have NPC's once. They were horrifyingly buggy and were removed to be worked on at a later date. For now, the game is perfectly playable as is, if a little empty. If you want to fill that world out a bit, make it seems a bit less empty...You can play Zomboid with your friends. The new easy co-op is out as of 5/9/2016 and I am deeply thankful that it is. Hosting multiplayer with friends has gone was a horrifying hassle of opening and forewarding ports, running external server programs, and friends issues with relayed tunneling. It is now a simple, streamlined, click-and-go system. Thanks Indie stone, and thanks to General Arcade for helping them get it worked out. The new co-op multiplayer is great. You can even allocate how much ram you want for the server from inside the game. It is really easy to use, and thanks to it, I can force my friends to eat rat based meals and roasted cockroaches.

								Today I got utterly ♥♥♥♥-faced on Chardonnay, fell off a roof, got trapped in a toilet by several zombies after my baseball bat broke because I was too drunk to kill them, got thirsty and had to drink toilet water and then fought my way out by stabbing them to death with a spoon. When I got home I discovered my broccoli patch had rotted. Just another day in Zomboid land.To qualify this a little; I have no real interest in zombies (either in games, film or tv) and don't much care for survival games, even less so early access. Took a punt on this after Steam threw it up randomly in my recommended list (I think because I play Alien: Isolation) and I read a few reviews. PZ manages that rare thing of being a pretty hardcore, serious game which should be quite depressing in many ways but somehow manages to also provide deeply satisfying moments of hilarity and 'how the hell did I get out of that?' gameplay. It throws you in at the deepend and resolutely refuses to offer you a hand, let alone a life vest. You will die, often and when you least expect it. You will only have yourself to blame, or the git who put a burglar alarm on their house. I'd recommend reading as little as possible by way of guides and wikis and just going at it, the sense of bewilderment and confusion and the resultant satisfaction from figuring stuff out is part of the fun. Lastly, the devs seem very active in the community and there are great looking updates on the horizon. This game is shaping up to be a bit of a cult classic.			"

Early Access Review
								I've owned this game for quite some time and am only now really getting in to it.  When I first played this game I was getting killed just about every day and thought 'meh'.  I started again recently and instead of playing 'gung ho' style(sing it with me) I have been taking my time, reading tutorials, tips and crafting guides when I get stuck.I've tried Survival and Sandbox and much prefer the sandbox version of the game(I don't die as quickly).  The thing I love about this game?  If I die my body becomes a zombie, I then can create a new character and can go and kill that zombie and get all my stuff back.  Any structure I created is there for that new character, hell even down to  keeping a journal, die, pick up the old journal and continue the journal as a new character has some weird satisfaction. This game is not for the 'half an hour at a time player', not to say you cant play that way, but it's best played if you have about 3 hours or more to spend at a time.  The map is large, I didn't realize just how large this map was till running from point A to B trying to find the user created maps I added.Graphics are not what this games about but they do the job.Customization before a sandbox game begins gives you just about everything you could think of to tweak it to your own liking.I have left 7DTD to play this game, and I absolutely believed that it couldn't get better than 7DTD, time will tell!

								This is one of those early access games that got bogged down with the small things, which I check back in on occasionally to see if it has remembered the bigger picture. It doe not seem to have yet, though don't get me wrong since I feel as if I at one point got my value out of playing it. Progress in the game just feels as if it got slowed down reworking over and over systems that had already been completed. Then there is the issue I have that the game still shows a lot of art from when it used to be sprite based when it is now model based, which I think the most painful thing about that transition was how unappealing the user interface is now compared to the old one. If you really want to pick up this title, I would wait until it is out of devepoment because of how radically things can change from update to update.			"

								This is how you died.The entirety of the game is how you died. There is a mystery as to why the zombie outbreak occurred, and you might even find some answers before you die. Ultimately though, Project Zomboid does not represent an against-all-odds struggle where you overcome the undead. Instead, after dying, every subsequent playthrough just lets you survive a little longer, do a little better, and  learn a little more.Death can come in many, many ways. You have to manage needs, similar to The Sims . You need to eat, sleep, and even need to rest your legs if you're running around too much . You aren't able to see meters that indicate your exact state, but moodlets will appear to let you know exactly what your character is thinking or feeling at any given time. Injuries are common, so if you're scratched or bitten by a zombie, you better tend to them quickly.The town is populated by other survivors and looters, some just as desperate as you. Everyone is  scared by the thousands of zombies roaming the city, and a looter just might find you and put a shotgun round in your chest as he takes your food and other supplies. Scripted events like this will keep you on your toes, but with every failure comes the chance to prepare a little better for next time.The zombies themselves are the slow and lumbering kind. You can fairly easily outrun them, but they are legion, and don't easily forget. They are attracted by blood and noise, and all it takes is a single mistake to advertise your location to the horde. You've never had to think in so many different directions and cover your butt in so many different ways before. As a result, every moment is exciting because you never know what lurks around the corner and whether you missed that one thing that will give away your position. Getting into a routine and locking down your safehouse will be just as important as finding food and scavenging for weapons.Crafting is also a large part of Project Zomboid. At the moment, your character already ""knows"" the recipes needed to create objects to help him: combining a can opener, a can of soup, and a pot results in a big pot of edible soup, for example. Cooking will eventually be part of the game as well, adding another layer of complexity to basic survival; after all, you don't want to be suffering from food poisoning due to eating undercooked meat if you're being chased down by zombies.Overall, well worth a buy. It's easy to see that Project Zomboid has potential and lots of merits. Recommended "

Early Access Review
								I have been looking for a zombie survival game for years- a good one. Something I could play for awhile, something that wouldn't leave me feeling like there could be 'more'a. I remeber the first time I heard of H1Z1, and DayZ- they both sounded amazing. Looking at screenshots, how could I not be impressed?How naive. If you really look around for any zombie apocalypse games, those two names are bound to come up, and with them, their history of major, major disappointment. A couple days ago, I was looking through my Steam Queue, and Project Zomboid happened to pop up. Watching the video, I was intrigued. Yeah, the graphics weren't photorealistic, but then again, when did they ever have to be? When I looked towards the reviews and comments, I was estatic, and could only hope it measured up.It totally did.I've only played a few hours as of this review, but I'm absolutely hooked. In its current state, it is completely playable, and worth its $14.99 price tag. Pros- Realistic survival simulationDeath comes swift and quick for those who don't pay enough attention. From basic survival needs like food and water, the game goes beyond and even throws in challenges in other forms. Staying out in the rain might get you sick, and if you don't take care of that, you might be visiting the Grim Reaper pretty soon. You can be cold, scratched, bitten, and you can bleed, and feel nausea and so much more. Honestly, you get screwed over pretty quick- Good UINot much to say. It's got clean menus, and useful graphics. - Good PersonalizationDo you love zombie games? Do you still suck at killing them? No worries. This game has quite a few different play styles, each one taking place at a different time in the apocalypse. The Initial Infection (a non-canon play for those of us who suck at the games we love), The First Week (where things start to pick up, and those zombies really start to pay closer attention to you), Six Months Later (the name says it all, but you better know how to get water for yourself...), and the last mode, Survival, where you see how long it takes you to die. The first three modes even have more difficulty options within them, so you really get to pick what type of game you want to play.-  The fact that this is only Early AccessThis game feels full, alive (or, uh, undead?), and pretty complet minus some bugs here or there. The fact that this game will only get better is really exciting! Cons - Melee/ selection dificultiesBy no means rendering the game unplayable, but melee is always the way I go. This could just be my game, but I occasionally have issues with fighting zombies. I'll be aimed right on them, but whatever weapon I'm beating them with will move right through them. Moving around a bit usually helps this, but it can be an ocasional annoyance.-  Cooking is burdensome Not something that is super problematic, but still worth mentioning. Some players have found cooking to be a hit and miss problem without the help of the wikia or other guides. Recipes, unless you know them, can leave you confused on what you can and can't cook. Yeah, you can make soup. But, no, you can't make bowls of cereal and milk (which I know from my own tragic expirience). Conclusion or tl;dr The problems in Project Zomboid are very minimal, and are not enough to turn a player away from the game. What you get with this a really fun game that you can play for hours on end. Whether you want to build a fort, or leech off existing houses, live in a Zombie-filled city, or a blank country side, you're in charge of your own tragic and inevitable death.It's fifteen bucks of sign-me-the-♥♥♥♥-up. If you wanna see how you'd fair in the zombie apocalypse, here's your game Pluss the mascot is a raccoon. A cute raccoon. Who doesn't love trash pandas?  "

It's been in EA for very long but one of what should've been a very important and prioritised feature is still not implemented. When viewed in perspective of the amount of time in development, it is rather difficult to justify.Doubtlessly, it is fun in it's depressing, terrifying and lonely way, as evidenced by the number of hours I've sunk into it.

Find out shortly afterwards that chopping down the trees was unecessary.Revel in the wonders of modern engineering, learning to truly appreciate a fridge and a faucet.Revil in the absence of modern engineering, learning to prioritize canned goods and to farm, fish and hunt.Wander around your safe house, organizing things with your friends whilst shirtless in a homoerotic episode of hoarders.Level up your character for hours, making them faster, stronger and more versatile.Level up your patience when you forget to check a corner and get bitten, and slowly come to terms with the inevitable.Remember to remove your pants before death.

I started up the game and was greated by a mess of tabs and menus. After sorting it out I began to play the game with default features. I immediatley found the things I needed for the rest of my playthrough. 67 canned soup and beans, a plethora of weapons and ammo, all the medical supplies that I could find, a saw and hammer with 9 boxes of nails, and a large hiking bag I found on a corpse. I was all set. I found a storage warehouse and barricaded every window and a perimeter fence around the 20 block area of it. I made a large farm that provides me with more tomatoes and potatoes I can eat. I wound up forgetting about the zombies for day 22-34 and was shocked to see a shambler inside of a zippos pizzarea. I was almost longing for a  way to attract the snackers, walkers, biters, ect to my base.The over all experience was so-so. I have high hopes for this game in the future. hopefully I wont have to settle on burning houses with dead rats in the oven.			"

								This game is pretty awesome.I bought this game after i've seen some gameplay of it and i got hooked right away. Don't let the not-so-good graphics fool u, because even though this game is currently an early access game, u can still do veeery, very much in this game. U can build your own house, harvest your own plants, there is always something for you to do.Sure, there are some bugs, but i have played this game for quite a while and never came across a bug that couldn't be solved with simply restarting the game.Also, this is one of the games that takes Zombies ""seriously"" in a sense that you can have awesome gear and awesome loot, it still only takes a scratch or a bite to turn you into a Zombie, which basically means that you'r gonna be game over soon.If you like difficult, but fun survival games, you should definitely give this game a try.And on another note, this game has one of the best communities you can imagine and it is easy to get ahold of the developers, as well.

								At first glance this game looks relatively simplistic, a simple art style in a sandbox zombie game. But this game has incredible depth. Managing your various states whether you are hungry or thirsty, in a state of panic or anger, wet or overheated, encumbered, sleepy, sick and much much more.This game is tough, the procedural generation makes each play through unique and can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You might load into a house with an axe and a pistol or you could be heading out armed with a spoon or fork and this is what makes this game great.Each game feels like a real survivors story, you are not a hero, you are just trying to stay alive as long as you can before meeting your untimely demise.I am excited for future development of this game and the new features promised look to improve this great game even further. As for the bad, my only current complaint is the multiplayer system. Hosting a server is a nightmare to do and a server tool or using steam would greatly improve this issue aside from that I am enjoying the game and hope they create a better multiplayer option soon.

								From all the zombie survival games I have ever played, this one hits most aspects I hoped for the genre. The goal of the game is simple, you must get from being a survivor to a rebuilder of a one-man society. You are on a time limit as the utilities will soon shut down within weeks, so you must quickly locate your pernament base and fortify it, then start building a garden and several rain catcher barrels to produce food and water. Melee weapons are more important than firearms, and fire can cause a little more destruction than necessary. The zombies, of course, can see, hear, and smell you, so cover up the windows and stick to the shadows and downwind to avoid detection. Remember that a single bite or scratch, even if it is disinfected and bandaged, will strike you ill and kill you no matter what, so don't be cocky and decide to take on an entire herd unless you have a stronghold to take shelter for your dramatic final stand.The goal for me is always the same. Once the game is started, I quickly go out and search for a suitable shelter or stay in the one I have spawned in. Then I shelter-in-place, you know, cover up all the windows and such. I take inventory of my food, then one everything is situated, I go out into the industrial areas of the map to locate three things: An axe, a saw, a hammer, and lots of nails. The idea is to get an axe to chop down the many confiers that grow in the game world, then use the saw to turn them into wooden planks, then use those planks to build walls, doors, and all sorts of useful furniture to hold your important gear. Once the structure of the base is established, I started fixing up a garden. Sometimes I have to move dirt around, usually up on the roof where I don't have to worry about zombies trampling on my crops. I also build my kitchen outdoors, using a campfire as a stove. With the power and water lines being finite resources, it is imperative to get your self-sufficient base established as soon as possible.If you are wondering there are vehicles in this game, then the answer is no, there is no planes, trains, and automobiles in Project Zomboid. Your own two feet is your way in moving around the map. Due to the nature of the game engine, I do not expect to find vehicles in this game anytime soon.			"

								Found an abandoned house in the forest after marching through the rain for what seemed like hours. The warmth of the fire from the stone helped me calm my nerves as the moans of the undead could be heard not far from where I was. I checked the cabinets for food. No luck. I checked the fridge. Nothing. There had to be something in this place. If the dead didn't get to me, starvation would. Finally, after searching the entire house, I found a bag of chips underneath the couch in the living room. They were the best stale chips I've had in what felt like days. For the very first time, I felt like everything was going to be alright, until I noticed the curtains in the living room window were still open, and the undead had spotted me. Their moans attracted more of them as they began to surround the house, smashing through the windows. Me, with my trust crowbar ran into the bathroom, fearing that this was the end. I closed the door behind me and frankly searched for a way out. Panic settled in as the realization that I had no way out with the undead banging at the bathroom door sank in.I didn't survive 20 minutes after starting the game. 10 out of 10.For a game that's only in Early Access and has come this far makes me proud to play it. This is truly what an Early Access release should look like. It can only go up from here.			"

								The moment you begin to relax in this game is the moment you will make a silly mistake and nine times out of ten end up dead, or homeless. Don’t let the graphics fool you! This game is right up there with the best of them in terms of Zombie Survival! One of my top five Zombie Survival games of all time.Helpful Link: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/I need Zomboid buddies so if you are in NZ or AUS, add me and lets die together!			"

								From all the zombie survival games I have ever played, this one hits most aspects I hoped for the genre. The goal of the game is simple, you must get from being a survivor to a rebuilder of a one-man society. You are on a time limit as the utilities will soon shut down within weeks, so you must quickly locate your pernament base and fortify it, then start building a garden and several rain catcher barrels to produce food and water. Melee weapons are more important than firearms, and fire can cause a little more destruction than necessary. The zombies, of course, can see, hear, and smell you, so cover up the windows and stick to the shadows and downwind to avoid detection. Remember that a single bite or scratch, even if it is disinfected and bandaged, will strike you ill and kill you no matter what, so don't be cocky and decide to take on an entire herd unless you have a stronghold to take shelter for your dramatic final stand.The goal for me is always the same. Once the game is started, I quickly go out and search for a suitable shelter or stay in the one I have spawned in. Then I shelter-in-place, you know, cover up all the windows and such. I take inventory of my food, then one everything is situated, I go out into the industrial areas of the map to locate three things: An axe, a saw, a hammer, and lots of nails. The idea is to get an axe to chop down the many confiers that grow in the game world, then use the saw to turn them into wooden planks, then use those planks to build walls, doors, and all sorts of useful furniture to hold your important gear. Once the structure of the base is established, I started fixing up a garden. Sometimes I have to move dirt around, usually up on the roof where I don't have to worry about zombies trampling on my crops. I also build my kitchen outdoors, using a campfire as a stove. With the power and water lines being finite resources, it is imperative to get your self-sufficient base established as soon as possible.If you are wondering there are vehicles in this game, then the answer is no, there is no planes, trains, and automobiles in Project Zomboid. Your own two feet is your way in moving around the map. Due to the nature of the game engine, I do not expect to find vehicles in this game anytime soon.			"

								Brilliant zombie game. Blends survival, (real survival) action, simulation, RPG mechanics and of course, zombies. While the zombie genre has been over used to death, (just like that pun) this game really brings something fresh. The greatest aspect is the certainty that you WILL DIE. The real question is when. GraphicsThe graphics are pleasing for me, the style mixes really well and nothing ever sticks out of place except bugs in the art and lighting. The developers are costantly working on this though.MapThe map is set out realisticly and has many locations including lumber yards, farms, wilderness, houses, shops, motels, and more. It is important to mention here that the world is NOT procedurally generated. I think this is good because it makes the world feel far more real and considering how big the developers plan the world to be - it's not going to be a problem.GameplayIf you love survival games, this game will be perfect for you. You can play heaps of different ways and even allows for the ""run and gun"" tactics which will definitly lead to an untimely end. The developers do stress that if you want to survive long term, you must stay down, sneak around zombies and avoid running - for one scratch could mean zombification. You must keep healthy, scavenge supplies, eat, drink, craft, explore, barricade and heaps more. Keep in mind these are slow zombies, and is tailored for a Romero audience. While you can play sandbox mode and set the zombies to sprinters, this is extremley challenging due to all the other factors you have to survive too,PlannedThere are many planned features, including multiplayer, vehicles, an even larger map, hunting and far far more. I suggest you check the forums for planned features.GripesThe only major gripes I have with this game in its current state is the occasional graphical glitches which can really take you out of the game. Another gripe is the UI glitches. They have recently given their UI an overhaul, and while the new inventory system is amazing, some of the pop up menu's look glitchy.VerdictThis game has the potential to be incredible, even in its current state I could sink hours into it (and have), my lack of game time on my profile is due to me backing this game back in 2011 and I have played many hours of the non-steam version. So, if you love survival zombie games and have a solid zombie apocalypse plan that you want to put into action, this is the game for you.			"

								If you're tired of the tag ""Survival"" on Games not living up to their definition, look no more. This is a survival game in the truest definition of the word. With the settings on singleplayer you're able to hone the game exactly to your liking from zombie density to loot rarity all the way down to infection mortality time. A really deep (yet not very upfront) crafting system, a pretty solid building system with other nice features such as cooking recipes (found a frying pan? have some steak and some vegetables? how about a stirfry to raise your mood and get rid of that boredom)The character system is a nice break down as well, you can see exactly where you're injured and take action directly from there whether it be switching bandages, or applying disinfectant directly to a wound. The dev's really take into consideration what the players are suggesting and try to implement ideas the best as possible, it's truly what an early access game should be.There are flaws though, an awkward camera and movement system that takes some getting used to, there's very few tooltips to explain what items can be used for. The game is not very user friendly, you have to do quite a bit of researching either on the Wiki or by trial-and-error, but all in all... it's a real solid early access and besides The Long Dark one of the only TRUE survival games out there.UPDATE: June 2015The expiremental branch is really coming along and the devs continue to deliver on their promises, still one of (if not the) best early access games on Steam.TL:DR -- Very deep survival game, camera takes some getting used to, highly recommended.

								Sure, I've played 855 hours over the course of at least 2 years. Don't let that number sell you on the game. Every single run I've ever done always ends in some stupid random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can't be negotiated by skill or luck. You're just infected, dead, and you get frustrated. Even with mods giving me the ability to wear armor I still run into terrible game mechanics that kill me every time. Zombies get stuck on doors even when you're yelling at them for one. Finally, this game will never have NPCs like it should have months ago. Can't recomend it like it is.			"

Early Access Review
								Игру заприметил еще на старте разработки. Подкупающей была тематика (ещё не заезженная на тот момент), пиксель-арт и, конечно же – изометрия. На данный момент это стильный и действительно интересный симулятор выживания на фоне зомби-апокалипсиса. И вовсе не только лишь потому, что изометрия и пиксельная графика. Игра обладает определенным шармом и без этого. Хотя бы на уровне своих возможностей. Будучи небольшой по размерам и миниатюрной в исполнении, игра оставляет за собой многие новинки из Early Access (далее по тексту EA).В большинстве игр подобной тематики вы оказываетесь в декорациях, которые служат подстилкой для массированного PVP, где, в общем и целом, кроме него заниматься нечем. Мало кто прорабатывает «изнанку мира» (англ. background). В PZ подноготная рядом. Есть два небольших городка где-то в американской глубинке, фермы, поселки и леса. Существует даже карта на манер Google-карт созданная каким-то умельцем. Она позволят оценить размах умирающего мира. Здесь умирает всё, в том числе и вы. Это история где рано или поздно будет поставлена трагическая точка. За регулярными вылазками в город в поисках медикаментов, продуктов и необходимых для выживания вещей (да-да, даже медицинскому пинцету найдется здесь дело) вы краем глаза замечаете, что и город меняется. Происходит отключение от глобальной системы энергоснабжения, постепенно прекращает свою работу трубопровод, подававший в населенные пункты воду. Еда в холодильниках портиться, и вы уже вряд ли сможете порадоваться хорошо прожаренной отбивной. Города подвергаются армейской зачистке, не сулящей вам ничего хорошего, да и ходячих с каждым днем становится всё больше. Если совместить естественное умирание города с набегами других выживших, то картинка порой становится и вовсе унылой. Вместо богатства, ожидающего мародера посетившего брошенное место, вам часто приходиться довольствоваться каким-то мелочами. Нож для масла в качестве оружия, женская блузка вместо свитера, мусорный пакет или школьный ранец вместо хорошей сумки. собранный вручную топор, что развалится после нескольких ударов. Аутентичность на этом не заканчивается - забудете выключить газ на кухне (пока он еще остался в баллонах) и ваш дом превратиться в пепелище. С тех пор как появился мультиплеер игра ещё больше расцвела. Помимо PVP серверов существуют PVE сервера и даже «ролевые». Попав туда, вы придерживаетесь канвы повествования. Вы больше не Ваня или Джон зашедшие покрошить других игроков. Теперь вы вполне реальный персонаж, переговаривающийся с другими выжившими по радио, помогающий другим выжить. Отыгрыш сбивает людей в группы, чтобы противостоять ходячим вместе. Богатство игровых ситуаций описать трудно. Ровно как и богатство способов умереть.Разбил окно, полез в закрытый дом, разодрался в кровь влезая в него, впоследствии умер от заражения. Отравился плохой едой, отлеживался в каком-то доме, оказался в осаде - умер, будучи съеденным, заживо. Попал в засаду, был ранен, убежал, нашел какой-то дом полный алкоголя. Долго пил и радовался жизни. Выздоровел. Вышел наружу и столкнулся с ордой. Долго удирал от нее, забаррикадировался в каком-то отеле, затем спрыгнул с крыши второго этажа, сломал бедро, отполз в местный туалет и там умер. Всё это проза PZ дня. А ведь есть романы, поэзия. Всё это у вас будет, и каждый ваш опыт от игровой сессии будет разным.Хотите быть фермером и уйти от этого кошмара – это возможно. Хотите быть скавенджером и войти в историю маленького мира как лучший сборщик всякой всячины – не воспрещается. Хотите стать торгашом, по прозвищу Консерва-Боб, собрав всевозможные консервы и затем устроить магазин – да пожалуйста.  Хотите прослыть самым жестоким «убийцей на западе» доступно и это. Вы можете быть кем угодно, и прожить свой конец как угодно. Какой путь вы бы не выбрали - он будет оригинальным. Вас может погубить что угодно. К примеру, осколки стекла, застрявшие в руке, когда вы разбили стекло очередного дома. Спасти вас, впрочем, тоже может что угодно. Меня спасли грибы и дождевые черви. Серьезно. Их тоже можно есть. Правда от такой пищи наступает депрессия.Определенно – маленькая жемчужина, которая со временем станет настоящим жемчужным ожерельем или колье. Не поддержать такую игру будет неверным решением. Сейчас она, до сих пор в EA, до сих пор развивается, до сих пор дарит каждой своей сессией что-то новое.			"

								Once upon a time this was a wonderful game. You'd spawn in a random house in a huge map, scavenge the immediate area, spend a few in game months building a giant fortified compound before eventually getting bored, and then close out a wonderful experience with a glorious firearm rampage through the town center.The last few updates took the wind out of the sails. Carpentry skills were rebalanced in such a way that fortified compound building requires the player to grind out way more walls and barricades than any decent sized compound would need just to build up the skill to put a scavenged door in. Game difficulty is either face rollingly easy or wake up to a sea of zombies on your porch every morning annoying with no sweet spot.Firearms aren't fun and don't even function as a panic button. Accuracy sucks at low levels and takes ages to skill up, shotguns can only take out 3 zombies max and that's only likely when firing into a huge crowd, and each shot fired will bring in zombies crazy quick and from long distances. Any situation where discharging a firearm seems like a good idea is a situation already lost.Cars and NPCs will supposedly be implemented at some point (when they're done!) But for now, it just seems as if the game is being balanced for features that don't exist yet and it's not as fun as it once was.			"

								Created a character which to me looked very good for a survival... His only flaw was that he is deaf... He was a war veteran so he lost his hearings there perhaps... He was very lucky tho...Day 1: Ive found sheets and clothing which i riped into bandages that will come in handy. Found food, water, tools and even some books and weapons to keep me safe. I thought i was safe. Day 2: Ive scavenged some houses just across the street. During my scavanging i let my guard down and got suprised by three zombies but thanks to my bat i was able to defend myself. I was bleeding but thankfuly it was just a scratch (""Tis but a scratch!"") and thanks to my preparations i was ready for this and immadiately bandaged myself and i was able to keep the injury clean.Day 3: Ive found a store! It had lots of fresh food in it!Day 4: Ive found another big house. ""why not check it out?"" i said to myself confidently. It seemed abandoned... No zombies in sight. ""great!"" i thought to myself. But it wasnt abandoned... As soon as i let my guard down i got attacked. I was able to defend myself... But it was too late... I got bitten... ""oh no please god no!""... I didnt want to get turned into one of them... I tried looking for bleach to end it but there was no luck... I remembered i have some bottles of alcohol in my fridge... On my way home i started feeling very sick... I was certain im infected. I got home and drank all the bottles of alcohol... I was very drunk and then... I died. 10/10 would turn into drunk zombie again.Here is also a video on how to survive simply because i can and i want that youtube cash

								A real solid survival game that unfortunately ends up falling a bit short due to the huge and arguably broken random factor. Surviving your first couple of days is easy since food is borderline abundant in every house along with water being a common commodity at every tap, toilet and bathtub. Eventually, however, these resources will dwindle, not only by the human consumption but due to the basic services shutting down.Electricity and the Waterworks will abruptly be cut off after some time, leaving any fridge-dependant foods to be almost instantly spoiled, leaving you very dependant on rare canned foods, chips and other conserverd commodities which will run out real fast depending on your character. ""Just create a farm!"" you say? Fantastic Idea! Just one flaw: You need to find a shovel/trowel and plant seeds. While seeds are rather common, trowel/shovels are not. I have spent countless of hours, killing hundreds of zombies to clear out a big piece of farm-land just to spend even more time searching dumbly for seemingly common tools In order to have any kind of chance to survive. And even then, surviving for any seriously long amount of time won't be possible because your sources of water will run dry faster than you can say ""Kebab"" as any and all plantations require gigantic sources of water that will need to be hauled back and forth by you, consuming very large amounts of time for little to no actual food seeing how the watering of plants doesn't last for more than half a day or so.But that Isn't even your biggest issue. The method of getting these supplies of water will be unavailable eventually as the city's water works off will turn off. ""Just go to a lake!"" you say? Nope. No lakes, no rivers and no oceans. Only the very rare 1-2 wells per map which are waaaay outside the actual playing zone/spawn and the only real other way to create a sustainable, although random way of water income is to create rain collection barrels. You'll need Nails, a hammer, a garbage plastic bag and some planks for that.Doesn't sound too bad, right? Wrong. To create planks, you need wooden logs. To create wooden logs, you need to chop down trees... Which you essentially need an Axe for. An even moreso rare item than Trowels and nowhere does this get more annoying than when you search through countless workshops in hope for an axe and Instead get a Saw! ""Cut down trees with that""! You say? Nope. Can't do that. You NEED an axe to produce any significant quantities, which comedically enough, has an ingame model of a fireaxe out of all things. No common house-hold hatchets, no making your own improvised axe, no machete or other blunt cutting weapons. You need. An Axe. To produce ANY significant amount of logs. Sure, you can get a good laugh and chop down trees by using a fork If you want to humiliate the already embarassingly stupid sense of logic programmed by the devs but that will take over 200 swings (literally and figuratively slapping a wet blanket up against a tree) but If you're playing said survival game with the promise of It being realistic, it better damn iron out the assigning of item usages and a more realistic loot palette, preferrably designed by someone who doesn't live on an deserted island in the pacific.And as I also described earlier, In one of my playthroughs, I cleared out a huge farmland that had a gigantic harvest of Wheat/Corn in the middle of it, which I couldn't pick. No big deal there, would have been overpowered. Now what I did get frustrated on was another smaller piece of farm land, with fences around it and the ground already being dug up neatly. I cleared the remaining zombies before i eagerly grabbed my seeds and the dozens of water-filled Gardening Spray Cans I found earlier in Workshops/storages and ran out in the dug-up mounds of dirt, standing there like an idiot for minutes on end, trying to figure out just how the game wanted me to put my seeds into the ground before trying all possible combinations, visiting the game wiki and getting a big ""F*ck you"" finger up in my face on how you NEED a TROWEL/SHOVEL to drop seeds from your hands and into the loose dirt.Adding on a 25+ digit of the previously 40+ houses I searched before reaching the farm, I still ended up with not finding an axe. Not finding a trowel. Not finding a shovel. Nothing. Just more nails, some glue, duct tape and a saw, endlessly taunting me In the face on just what I could have done at my small farmstead in the forest at this point Instead of running around like a complete and utter jackass, struggling to find a specific bent piece of metal so I can put down some seeds on an already processed piece of soil Instead of using my hands, other tools such as hammers that have plowing capacities with the tail, a shoe, an empty soup can, a spoon or my hands. But no, that wouldn't be according to the game logic of this ""Simulator"". Simply put, If you run to a nearby Workshop and don't get a Shovel/Trowel, a Fireaxe and a Saw, your playthrough already has been signed It's death warrant by none other than the developers.And as I said, Project Zomboid is by all means, a solid game that I also happen to enjoy much personally. but If you look at the on-going 3-4+ years of development time and the current state It is in, one is fair to call it a pile of f*cking rubbish as mods made by lone people in their spare time develop features into this game so much faster than a team of 6 (discluding dozens of associates) fully paid professionals, It's downright frikking embarassing, especially considering the game Is not even 3d, so as of right now, I will unfortunately recommend everyone to avoid this title right now until the developers take the energy they do on advertising updates or explaining why they screwed up on delivering these updates in time and put that effort into making said, promised updates.I would however, recommend to buy It on a sale.UPDATE: The developers have gone out of their way to fùck the reputation of this title up even more by spending MASSIVE amounts of manpower to integrate user mods into the base game. Yes, that's right. This company that has now been slamming a hammer non-stop for 5+ years on this game has now resorted to spending company time to do less of the sorely needed actual development on the game to force-feed it user made modifications that ANYONE could use at ANY TIME with ANY VERSION of the game OUT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL prior to this. And to make matters even worse, they have also gone out of their way to start quoting positive Steam user reviews on the store page and have the actual review be consistent of ""lol gud geym ei playd a bunhc 10/10 xd"" and rightfully so, the reviews they linked have about 25% out of 100% user approval for being retárded.And of course as I recommended to get this game on a sale following my negative review of the game, there has been next to none of them from what I can only presume is only an act of good old fashioned cócky greed at the devs end as Steam now allows any studio to instantly put their products on sale, leaving no marketing excuse as to why not.Avoid this turd like the plague.

Or because of ""no cars no NPC's""... but sorry guys, those are the most complicated features, and the entire team is not capable of working on them, so they will be the last to come. The game has around 11 devs, and their content output has been consistant. Once you get used to the controls of this game, it will be the most authentic feeling zombie simulator out there. You'll do supply runs, you'll be scared as hordes get ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you'll struggle to figure out how to cure all the medical problems that can arise in this game.

								This game is easily one of the most addicting I've ever played. Despite some of the major, teeth-grinding glitches, it is very fun.  The game description is essentially what it says; it's a zombie apocalypse simulator. If you loot a house, it's gonna stay empty. If you die with loads of loot at your safehouse, it's going to stay there until your new guy can find it again. The game also adds a great challenge to its survival aspect. It's not like traditional zombie games like Dead Rising where you can kill 500 zombies within five minutes. I get nervous when I'm up against more than two. You know how in the movies when a character is bitten, and then they turn? That's exactly what happens in Project Zomboid. One bite is all it takes for you to lose the character you've spent the last couple of hours leveling up.Despite the many, many bugs in this game, it's a great idea and it provides endless hours of fun, scavenging and zombie-slaying!8.5/10			"

								UPDATE!Well They have added so much more content since I reviewed this we even have Multiplayer! (like Minecraft with dedicated servers but none the less multiplayer!) I'd like to see NPC's soon so I'll be happy when we get other survivors... as for now though.. New Rating - 10/10 YAY! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I once said after spending so much money on Zombie Games and getting no fun that I would never buy a zombie game again, that my zombie game was not out there and no one would probably develop a full hardcore survival game based around zombies... I was wrongI first played this about 2 years ago maybe even 3 and it was on an odd little website inthe dark reaches of the internet and al lthat was available was a linear tutorial. I had to make certain choices during said tutorial to see how long I could survive... naturally I murdered my GF in cold blood as she could not fight back due to I Think a broken leg but I'm not sure... I finally died when I set house on fire cooking (yes that can happen!) After seeing this pop up on steam I decided to give it a buy.. I mean the tutorial was worth it even if I HATE Linear games and well I was pleasantly surprised. The game now has 3 modes including Sandbox where you can choose every single option including what type of zombies you want... naturally I wen't for classic.I survived for a whole hour and that's when I shut it off... I moved on to a mode that was not ulike COD zombies but built within the Project Zomboid engine... it played out very much like the horde mode on Gears of War and it was something I enjoyed most as it allowed me to paly it for 10 minutes at a time!If you are looking for a true action Zomibe survival game then buy this now! I'm giving it a 9/10 but only because its still in development...I'll be sure to upgrade that later on should they turn it into something spectacular.I'm also hoping for Multiplayer soon... Co-Op would be a nice feature and one that would work on so many levels!			"

								Honestly, I love this game. I don't review often, but this is my perspective:The crafting and base building are very well done. Cooking, using tools, building walls, farming, it's all there. I love the retro look, too. There are little details that make it enjoyable - while still being difficult, making it that much more rewarding when you finally gain all the tools necessary to make your impenetrable base. The game comes at you in waves, changing the gameplay.First, you start off going house to house, gaining basic supplies, able to cook/collect food fairly easily due to electricity still being on. Eventually, you find a few useful tools, barricade a few windows and doors, and you've got a house you feel safe in with a nice little stash of emergency supplies. Eventually, you need to run further and further from your home base. Then, the electricity goes off. That's when it gets interesting. You need to craft barrels to collect rain water. You no longer leave your house with little planning: instead of easily being able to cook raw food in ovens, or finding still fresh food in fridges, or drinking water from sinks, you need water bottles, food, weaponry, and supplies for unexpected stays. When it rains, you best stay indoors. When it gets dark, or you get tired, you need to find safety. You'll need to carry around rags to cover windows to avoid being seen, food and items to keep your character sane. Medical supplies to heal wounds.You'll die often at first, and while it's punishing, your new character can eventually find your old base, and at times, if you're lucky, even your old re-animated corpse. Still, tip: ditch your stuff when you get infected and just go out with a blaze of glory. The game needs more polish, but the game breaking bugs in almost EVERY other Early Access aren't there. I enjoyed the game thoroughly. I just wish there was more to do. That's what vehicles and NPCs are being created for. I am very excited to go back to this game for NPCs. The developers and extremely dedicated. But I really, really want the extra layer of NPC interaction, HOPEFULLY leading to allies that can stay in your base, do boring tasks like farming, and even go out scavenging with you.I highly recommend this game, and I think it's worth a purchase right now. It's one of those gems in Steam. "

								Buy this game. I've had it for over a year now and now that it's on steam the game has inproved so much and has so much potential. If you like TRUE survival games and zombies. This game even in it's current state is well worth the money in my opinion. The inventory system is a little funky and hard to get used to but it has gotten better over time but that's my biggest complaint about the game ..also to add you WILL DIE IN THIS GAME so if you get mad at dying this game is not for you. But its a survival game its not suppose to be easy!			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: This is a review I wrote for an Australian computer and technology forum, figured I would post it on here as well, as I think extremely highly of this game. This review isn't exactly written in the style of your standard steam reviews, but it outlines some of the gameplay mechanics and other things in that game make it one of the more enjoyable titles around at the moment, due in part to the multiplayer that is now part of the game.Over the last several years, I've eagerly been watching this game grow and evolve, once in a while I would download the latest build and test it out. Everything was very promising. Here I had a game that offered a True Zombie Apocalypse ""Simulator"", a game where there is no real goal other than to survive, this was well before games like Day Z started popping up too.Project Zomboid is much different however, first of all the game uses an isometric viewing angle, secondly it tries to ""simulate"" everything. From cooking, to building to reading books. There are literally hundreds of different items in the game, majority of them have a use. Canned soup can be consumed, but only if you have a can opener, access to a fire or stove and a pot to cook it in. Books can be read to increase your skills in things like fishing, carpentry or farming. All of this takes ""time"" to do. Your character can be affected by dozens of different things, go out in the rain, you get wet, stay wet for too long, you can get sick. If you're wet, you can change your clothes or dry off with a towel. If you get sick, you can find painkillers and other meds to help you get over it. Get scared by too many zombies and cant find any survivors and your character can start to become panicky and depressed. This is just scratching the surface of what can be done in the game though. The world is persistent, this means you can barricade houses, as long as you have a hammer, nails and some planks, you can cover open windows with sheets so the Zs cant see you inside. Weapons can be repaired with things like Duct Tape or glue, weapons can be modified (not sure how many at this stage have mods) ie. getting a baseball bat and hammering some nails to make it a ""nailed baseball bat"". You can build doors, doorframes, walls, floors, stairs etc. and essentially build your own fortress, or connect several houses together with wooden walls being used as passageways, so you are safe from the Zs when going between houses. The Zs themselves are quite cool as well, if you play Sandbox or multiplayer mode, you are able to change several different things about the zombies to make them easier or harder, this allows you to customise the Zs to be similar to the ones from your favourite movies (fast, slow, blind/deaf etc) Zombies also give chase, depending on their memory settings, you can lose them just by getting a certain distance away, or you may have to lead them on a merry chase through houses and the bush to make them lose your scent and successfully escape. Combat is fairly standard, however it works great is very satisfying if you get your timing right. There are guns in the game, but majority of the time you will opt for melee weapons, guns will attract zombies, to the point where you can inadvertently attract a horde of 30+ zombies. It makes for some great gameplay and very tense moments. On top of all of this, the game now has multiplayer, at the moment it is join by IP only, so no proper server browser, but once you make/find a server to play in, you will find that the world is persistent, items don't respawn, neither do zombies, zombies will often wander around and may eventually occupying an area that you have previously cleared, but overall this means you can essentially clear out an area and be safe from Zombie Hordes, as they won't respawn once you kill them. This all comes together to create the most enjoyable Co-op experience I have had in as long as I can remember. For $15 on steam, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you still love zombie games, you may find that despite how the game is presented (look at it on the steam store, first reaction is usually that it graphically looks quite dated) it is one of the most feature rich and amazing Zombie Survival games on the market. There is far more that I could list about this great game, but I suggest if it sounds interesting enough from my explanation above, take the plunge and see how you like it. There is also a demo available  which is still quite indicative of what you can expect should you decide to purchase the full game. Seriously guys, get on it.			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, I originally found this game quite bland. My fondest memory was spawning in the house, finding and drinking bleach, walking out of the house and then falling over dead. I didn't play it too much after that.BUT, they recently unleashed online test to the public, at which point my friend immediately set up a server for us and we were away on our adventure. As I am typing this, we have been playing for a solid 3 hours, many notable moments being burning down several houses, barricaded a warehouse, and having friends go out scavenging for supplies while I cooked at home. This is the game that many zombie survival games tried to be (Such as DayZ, which contrary to popular belief was developed long after this game was started). This game gets all of the feels that a zombie survival game should. Instead of immediately searching for weapons to kill zombies with, you always have thoughts in the back of your head as to: Will we have enough food? Will we have time to cook some good food to keep everyone from getting depressed? Did I turn the stove off?While playing, our favorite thought was having a server that would be able to run 200 players at the same time. Think of the communities that would start with the fact that you can build walls and even houses from scratch, and with the proper tools you can tear down other houses for supplies. Needless to say, I have never been more excited for the future of a single game until now. I feel that anyone who likes tense survival with friends should play this game. This game is, as all 4 of us agreed, is DayZ done right.TL:DR DayZ but not rushed, with similar ideas of Fallout and The Sims.			"

								Its a geat game with a brilliant community and a excellent dev team. This game is one of my favourite games of all time. But what does PZ bring to the table? PZ brings a fun yet dramatic system into the game where as if you die. You DIE. No second chances. You are dead. This in itself is pretty upsetting when you create a character who has live maybe a year in game (If you can make it that far) and dies like a hero. It has a fairly decent multiplayer which I do not recommend playing until maybe a patch but is up to you. And has a GREAT art style (I'm a sucka for pixles.)So should you get PZ? Yes. It is what other zombie games want to be and is ever improving.This is a zombie game even for the most hardcore.			"

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is one of those games that have great potential. The community of the game is great and the developers are very active. I have been following this game for a very long time now. I believe I bought this game in 2011 before it came out via Early Access on Steam. Every Monday the Developers update their blog telling us what's new in their development and sometimes showing us videos of what's new. Anyways, down to the gameplay. Now obviously, this game is in Early Access. But, some bugs are quite hard to find in the stable branch. So the game is very much playable. When you first start out playing this game you will probably die much faster than veteran players(unless you're me). But, after awhile you will learn how things work and be able to build a safehouse and even have yourself an efficient farm without having much fear of the zeds trying to kill you. There is also multiplayer! Sadly though, the multiplayer is a bit buggy in a few ways(mostly the zeds). But it is very much playable.Project Zomboid is a very good game even being Early Access. The developers are active and the community is great. There is much planned for it, and it definitely deserves the try.			"

Early Access Review
								I've bought this game back when it was in Pre-Alpha, and even back then I didn't regret buying, even though back then there was hardly anything to do. But hell, I loved the game back then, and I still do, if it comes to any zombie survival games - this is it. None other game recreates such tactical thinking, such fear of dying as this game does, every step you make you think about the consequences, you think about where you should set your base, and what to do to protect it best, but what made this game even better was for me was the addition of MP, I've waited since alpha for the game to have Multiplayer added to the game, and I always felt like it would change the game completely, and hell, it did. Multiplayer, especially with friends, added this serious survival feel I didn't feel ever before in a game, not in DayZ, nor Rust, nor any multiplayer survival game. You care for your friend in-game, you don't want them to get injured, or worse - bitten, but you also don't want them standing, doing nothing. As a good example, I'd like to share this survivor's story:We all assigned roles to what we'll do, one would take care of the food, another would secure the area of zombies, every once in a while we'd send out people to look for supplies, it was amazing, however, while we grew bigger, we needed better supplies, as well as some shotguns, so we decided to go to West Point, we left our home behind, hoping that we'd come back to it still being in shape...Well, at least most of it.  On the way there one of our friend's condition was getting worse - if we wouldn't find medication, he probably wouldn't make it. On the way there, we tactically dealt with zombies, or sneaked through them,  when the odds were too high, I'd fire a couple of rounds to distract a crowd of zombies, we'd get supplies at a drive-by diner and kept going, but unless we hurried - our friend wasn't going to make it, and sadly, he didn't, and it meant more than in any game, and that, is what I'd call a true survival experience. You cared that your friend died, with that one less man, not only do your possibilities go down, but so do your chances go down, every bullet you take, took and will take will make an impact, and a brilliant idea done poorly will cause the death of your team, and this is what I love about the game. While playing it, I felt like I was in some weird mix between The Last Of Us, The Walking Dead and something like Fallout, as amazing as it might be...However, I really think that there should be more of a 'leveling' system, since, even though you do have a bunch of skills to level, if you die, you quickly shake it off, I hope that the devs add something that would make you more attached to your character than you are now.Project Zomboid is packed with features and things to do and a lot of places to go to, there are a ton of items, and a ton of items to craft, but some currently don't have any use, as mentioned, this game is still fairly early in the development, some features that aren't in the game may be fairly important to survival, for example, a generator, that you'll need to get electricity from when the power runs out, luckily water barrels are buildable, so you won't dehydrate when you run out of water. But those are some things to keep in mind.The game is very stable right now, there are a few bugs, which is to be expected, considering the game isn't finished, but I'd recommend this game to anyway, since this game is made purely from passion and talent, and it has to be one of my favourite survival singleplayer games, and one of the best (if not the best) of survival multiplayer games, and it ain't even finished yet!

								I have played this game offline for over 100 hours. Listen, all these zombie games do something right. Zomboid, does a lot of things right, but if they aren't what you're looking for, you may not like this game.This game Is NOT a FPS death match with enough gun types to overthrow a small slavic nation. This is a game about a random, everyday Kentuckian that got caught up in the zombie appocolypse. If you like zombies and you like serious, intense survival, this game is for you.As it is right now, this game offers challenges that will frustrate you and keep you on your toes. There is the threat of Zombie Hordes, sickness, starvation and making that one freaking mistake that makes you start over. Play this game if you want a true challenge and actually feel like you accomplished something when you survive a few months. But what really makes this game worth buying is the potential it has.The map is already huge and they are going to make it even bigger. They are going to add Metro Louisville into the game map which will be incredible.The crafting system keeps getting better and they are adding more and more customization.NPCs and Cars are coming at some point and will take this game to cult-classic type levels on par with Crusader Kings 2 but for zombies. Buy this game. Be patient. Learn2Play and enjoy! Even if you buy it now and wait till NPCs come out, it will be worth it. Potentially one of the greatest games in it's niche even as it stands now.

								Excellent game with tons of replayability. 10/10It has a bit of a learning curve, but after your first few deaths you should be able to make it to about 2 weeks of survival and grow from there. Once you learn how to survive you will feel pretty devastated when you inevitably die due to the amount of time and care that is invested in your character.NPCs are planned to be released in the future and that will really bring the game together.The Dev Team is the best I've had experience with. They are very active on their forums at theindiestone.com and interact with the members there. More importantly they listen to what the community has to say and make adjustments to the game based off that.			"

								     One of the best zombie survival games I have  ever played. The game has some major performance issues and an immense amount of bugs but keep in mind this game is still fairly new. The player must survive for as long as he can by looting houses and not being killed by zombies. After a while the electricity and the water will go out so it is up to you to solve that resource problem. If you do happen to buy this game and you get a black screen upon loading a new character right click the game in steam and go to: Properties -> set launch options -> and type ""-safemode"", or you could also try the compatibility mode option upon launching the game!

								I very much recommend this game for anyone who:a) Likes tense, realistic zombie games;b) Wants a game that feels more like a movie (i.e. Dawn of the Dead) than dynasty warriors (i.e. Dead Rising);c) Doesn't mind a game being unpolished (e.g. currently no NPCs in the build I am playing).The game is extremely compelling, even if a little thin on the ground for content.  You must grit your teeth and carve out some space for your character to call 'home'.  Barricade the doors, shut the curtains, create a sheet rope to access the second floor window.  Then get building your perimeter wall and planting your crops.  Don't forget rain collectors.  Now you have the basics of survival, you can make forays into the dangers of the city, staying in cleared out houses along the way and making sure to attract as little attention as possible.This game has the potential to leave a huge, huge indent on future zombie games, probably the same way DayZ has already done.  When NPCs and multiplayer are added (especially LAN which would be incredible), this could become the FTL of the zombie genre.Considering I have got 30 hours of fun from this game, I would say that it's definitely worth £5.  In terms of £10, it's your choice: either wait until the game is a little more advanced and REALLY get your value, or jump in and support the developers early on and enjoy running around a town full of 4500 zombies with no NPCs.Right now I would rate this game a compelling 7/10 but it has the potential to hit 9 or 10/10.For reference here is how I rate other non-arcade zombie games:Resident Evil 4: 9/10TellTale Games The Walking Dead: 8.5/10Left 4 Dead: 8.5/10Resident Evil 2 or 1: 8.5/10Left 4 Dead 2: 7.5/10Dead Island: 7/10Dead Rising: 7/10The Last of Us: 7/10DayZ (currently): 6/10 (with the potential to be much higher)Dead Rising 2: 5/10As you can see I have left a space at the top for 9.5 and 10/10.  Reason being there has never actually been a zombie game that lives up to the tension, excitement and cloying exigency for survival that permeates the finest zombie movies.Project Zomboid does have a chance to reach that level or somewhere near it.  The fact that the merest scratch can but not necessarily will turn you eventually into a zombie is a welcome change to the superhero melee murder spree that many other zombie games offer.  The fact that you can die of hunger, thirst, regular disease and being soaked to the bone by freezing rain adds tension.  Your crops can die of diseases, a horde of zombies can shamble up to your safehouse and lay siege to it.  Firing your gun attracts three times as many zombies as you originally intended to engage.So there you have my take on this charming, albeit incomplete, little game.			"

								Good game that is updated regularlly and incorperates player mods into the actually full game. It is good to have a different type of Zombie game then the norm. It is pretty hardcore. You can really change the zombies to either slow movers low damage like Dead Rising or you can have fast, 28 days/weeks later I Am Legend zombies. Play your way, be a nomad, or take over a building as a base, or make a campsite in the woods away from the zombies.			"

They keep the gammers informed with mondoid posts every monday which is nice. I like to scan my library and see whats new. A lot of the time there is something new on this game. I would recommend this game to folks who dont need amazing graphics to be impressed. Because that the only thing it doesent have.			"

								What can I say about Project Zomboid ?  I love this game.It's hard to survive in the zombie apocalypse but everything starts to make sense and you start to feel comfortable.You gather food supplies and barricade a house, your skills are building up.Everything is fine, then you're checking a house and you casually open a bathroom door and go in without looking and . .  There's three zombies in there that munch or your arm before you can get away.You put a ripped sheet on it to stop the bleeding but it get's infected because the bandage wasn't disinfected.Over 2 days you get weaker and weaker and then you die.This is just one of the many deaths I've had in this game.If you buy this game, your character will die too and that's the fun !It's not about whether you die or not, it's about what you did while you were alive.

								Good at first lots of cool things when it was first released but its old news now, the only thing that will save this game for me is npcs. stop messing around with backpacks and stuff and get in content which will make the game fun and lots of replay.Thing is when this game first game out i admit there wasnt much out there to stand in its way. But now so many years later the whole zombie thing has been done and redone by many others. This is how it will go when u play the game and why it needs npcs.1. start the game pick a server that isnt password protected or isnt running 100s of mods.2.spend 40 mins picking your stats and gender.3.join a game.4. Say hello to server, get no response get killed.5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times at least.6.You look at clock ****  need to sleep and you relise you have not really played the game.7.Decide to play single player but its boring as its just you.8.Go onto forums you read they are putting in npcs you get happy you think i cant wait to start my colony.9. 2 years have past and you have forgotton all about this game since u have been playing others.10. after so long you think they must have put in npcs by now, you check to find they have updated backpacks.well this is my story.

								This game is floating somewhere between dead and alive. Enough happens to make you believe the devs isn't gone... But the game isn't getting anywhere.Each new update (Which are months apart) is either bug fixes or useless features no one was asking for. Meanwhile, the stuff people want has either no ETA or is promised in the next update... Which turns out to be ""bug fixes or useless features no one was asking for.""Just as a sidenote, I bought this game before it hit Steam. I don't remember when that was, but the EA release on Steam was 2013. 3-4 years and my 14 hours is mainly to boot the game to see what has changed... Turned out nothing much.			"

								Development? Yeah, it's slow. It's also early access. By buying, you're acknowledging that it may never be finished. I did. I like to think that I got my $15 worth, and will get more than that with every update, regardless of the time it takes the team to get the updates out. I have the utmost respect for the devs, putting up with all the crap a lot of folks are putting them through in terms of how long updates take. By now, if I were TIS, I'd go the route of, say, Interstellar Marines and just leave everyone in the dark to shut most of them up so I could work. But, instead each week they put on their gloves and get ready for the **** that gets slung their way because they choose to keep us in the loop.Now that I'm done with that, on to gameplay.Even in its current state, in the off chance of zombacaylpse, I've learned a lot from PZ. Stockpile water in anything that can hold water. Turns out the people that keep the water running stop going to work after the world ends. Keep some books and toys handy (the toys may be part of the Hydrocraft mod, I'm not sure). Boredom is nobody's friend. Stockpile food, obviously. Non-perishables don't grow on trees, unfortunately, and besides, you're gonna cut all the trees down to make walls and other things. Perishables perish shortly after the power shuts off, too. Learn how to grow food. It's a marketable skill during the end of the world.And when the animations update arrives, you're probably going to want several changes of clothes rather than wearing that one sweat shirt and that one t-shirt for the rest of your life. Blood stains and all.I think it's worthy of the ""something in my eye"" award because you will get attached to your character and all the progress you make with him or her. You'll have killed lord knows how many deadoes, and then, when you least expect it, the sound of your flesh being torn open by a rotting hand or a decayed jaw. You suddenly aren't long for the world. You spent so long trying to ride out the storm, only to become a part of it. You think back to the first one you killed, then the first building you cleared. Staring in horror at that first house you saw boarded up, filled with rotters trying to break out and devour your flesh. Fast forward to the lights going out, or the water shutting off, and wondering How will I survive now? and finding a way. And for however long you kept finding a way, beating in heads, looting the homes of the deceased, fortifying your home (whatever or where-ever it may be). And now you flash forward to just a moment ago, as Rodney Rot-Face there just took a bite out of your arm. You are not long for the world now, and with this realization, and perhaps a tear in your eye, you can decide to hole up and wait to die, or you can take revenge on the world that did this to you.Be lovely, I'm out, dropping the mic!

								i bought the license to play this game and 7 days to die on the same week. Project zomboid is seriously behind in its development. ive tried lasting as long as possible but find myself doing the same thing everytime. yeah sure you can farm, craft, survive and kill zombies but to what end? what am i staying alive all this time for? i have no goal to reach. instead we are expected to die and start again to do the same thing over and over again. the games graphics are good as they are but need a bit of tweaking on the animations. what the game truely needs is NPC's a bit of story to the world and visable backpacks for crying out loud. i havent played this game in a year and i recently tried it out again to find there is nothing changed despite teasers months ago about a new animation update. do the developers work part time or somehting because 8 hours a day 46 hours a week for 3 years for a game that hasnt got anything done in months sounds like someones not their job lol			"

								Project Zomboid is hands down my favourite sandbox survival simulator, primarily because you can tell the devs are just hardcore genre fans. The atmosphere of doom looming really brings out a horror game. It's like the game is telling you in advance: you will fail.Atmosphere is great.Updates are actively coming, so the game is not stagnant. Community is healthy and engaged, the devs are actively engaged with their players.The game itself really fits the old control style I personally like. Some would call it dated for not using 50 shortcut keys for everything, but I happen to like the mouse driven context menu interface.Music is superb. Setting is superb, and generic enough to craft any roleplay scenario the admin desires. What's best - the multiplayer option to run a dedicated server.Great job, Indie Stone!			"

								It's allmost two different games one after the other - there's the first month or so (in-game time) where you can roam around all the zombie-fied districts, splatting brains, exploring & just finding what you need to survive from the wreckage. But the the water supplies stop working & all the food you find is starting to spoil... unless you start growing / catching it yourself out in the wilderness.  And the map is insanely big, like almost unbelievably big. I'd ventured so far out from the starting city that I thought it was just gonna be repeating trees & grass from now until some unpassable mountain / river  hid the end of the map, so I looked up where I was online..  and I was pretty much in the middle of the map, had only travelled about 10% of the width in total			"

								No real easy multiplayer options yet, unless you join neglected servers.  They exist, and it is possible to host a server, but awkward for a computer novice.  BUT, a very fun adventure that captures the essence of isolation, desperation, and determination inherent in a survival experience.  The fact that there are zombies just gives a backdrop.  A lot of little details that leave you with a robust and lovingly-crafted world to explore.  This game has medications such as beta-blockers, sleeping aids, painkillers, and even vitamins.  Name another game with that.Also, there seems to be a lot of active development and mod content from the community.  I'm not certain how much longer the challenge of existing will keep me occupied in a single player experience, but I can certainly envision this game's development will bring me back periodically to enjoy the new content.Would buy again.

It is however not without its fair share of missing features and bugs at the moment. Dont let the talk of mplay mislead you, it has been in the works forever and as someone who has been with the game since early alpha, i dont see that happening anytime soon. It is fun and imo well worth the 15$ price. Its no State of Decay and comparing the two is like comparing strawberrys and candy bars. Both are yummy, but there is a big difference.###UPDATE###Mplayer has been implemented and it is indeed a fun romp. A bit buggy at the moment, but with time all the quirks will be worked out.			"

								Not abandonware, but I bought this in early 2014.   3 years later (2017), still in early access, with no sign of completeness in sight.   Keep that in mind when you consider purchasing this.  I enjoyed the game when I played it, but the development process seems to be suffering a lack of direction and a solid plan.  I would recommend buying a more complete title and waiting for signs that the project will finish or at least reach a solid state.			"

								Trekked through the wilderness for a day or so to find the shopping mall, severe exhaustion & fatigue set in as I ran out of fresh food to eat, ate some raw chicken and had to use my trousers to bandage a wound. Got steadily more sick & exhausted until I eventually reached my destination, which was of course crawling with zombies. Staggered in to the cineplex, the first unlocked door I came to, no beds or couches for me to sleep on... I eventually died of exhaustion in my underwear in the corner of a projector room.10/10			"

								interesting enough wandering around the gameworld finding the one window to a house or shop to get in silently then loot the place.fun enough when you're finding knifes for the silent instant neckstab takedown on zombies.boring when you're kiting 10 or so zombies hitting them constantly with an axe with none of them ever dying.I've enjoyed it but really you need to invest alot of time into the game to get enjoyment out of it and even then its like a steady drip of minor fun until you get a minor scratch and become infected and the so and so amount of hours you put into that character looting shops,houses and the undead goes up in your face.if there was a middle yes/no option i'd be picking it but really i've never acutally left the game happy just sort of ......meh ok that was project zomboid			"

								Alt-tabbed to look up some crafting instructions. Logged back in to find I'd starved to death. My cabbage farm shall live on for all eternity. 10/10.In all seriousness, this is a really solid game. Don't let the retro graphics or early access fool you - yes, it has it's bugs, it's flaws and a lot of content still to come, but you can easily pour hours into this game, especially in coop. The attention to detail around the perk system, base-building, sound travelling, etc. is a sign this developer knows what they're doing and it's a really nice example of a zombie-survival game taking a slightly different tack from the rest of the pack.

								I feel like this is one of the only zombie survival games with actual active developers. They keep the community up to date and release updates consistently. I also feel like they can do way more with the game/engine as well. As for gameplay, it's fun at first, but some things can get stale after a while. This will force you to play differently and explore your options. As of now, you can make a base, farm crops, and fish. Water and electricity will shut down after a period of time, forcing you to rely on yourself for resources. Fighting zombies is fun, yet very risky. All it takes is one scratch or bite to become infected. I thought the multiplayer had potential, but I wasn't a huge fan of the execution. Joining a server for the first time can be difficult depending on what kind of server it is. There isn't a lot of food, and chances are enough time has passed for water and electricity to be nonexistent. I think this game shines most with singleplayer and co-op, and the addition of promised npcs will make it twice as much fun. Definitely a good game for the price. If you put it down for a while, you'll probably come back to 2 or 3 updates to explore.			"

								I mean how long can one hold up their expectations for something?We are nearly at the 6 year mark since the game was very first released to backers. And since then it's been the slowest crawl towards seemingly untainable goals I've ever seen on Early Access.Re-inventing the wheel of their own system more than once. Which most likely didn't help things like NPCs is still not ready, or even for them to be able to give a rough idea of when it will come to life. I fear that at this point, they aren't satisfied with the way the NPC they can use are working, so they are holding it off hoping to come up with a miracle solution, which might never come.And to this day, I think that when pressed on the NPC issue they will say ""It will be released when it is finished"". So this isn't eliminating the idea that it could very well be in another 6 years.I can leave development updates for months, see years, and when I come back, I see marginal improvements, and development on skills. But we added foraging & salvaging! Great, just a huge laundry list behind a game like Cataclysm Dark Days ahead. Some of these additions are expected, so to see them being waved as carrots, is preposterous.The inventory system is horrendous, and for a game like this you'd need it to be tip top. Yet, it's still stuck in this wire frame floating menus.Don't be quick to poke at the hours played, the vast majority of play time was from direct executables from the earlier days.			"

								Aside from being one of the most open-ended zombie apocalypse simulators in gaming, this masterpiece is nothing short of amazing.Right off the bat - is the game challenging? You are encouraged to use the game's tools to tailor-make your own version of the apocalypse, editing zed rules, environment weather and loot rates. Does everyone reanimate with the zed disease? Do the zombies in your apocalypse break whatever is in their way, or will they only attempt to infiltrate if they are chasing a noise? Are the zombies never ending, or is there a set population spread out across Kentucky?Once you have set your parameters you are dropped in as the stock character you have set up, choosing from a wide variety of previous jobs and traits, each with their own effect and skill boosts (this gets even juicier with multiplayer as you will be playing with people with different abilities and central skills).Your build can range from a burger flipper with an iron-gut and thick skin to a brave firefighter with additional first-aid skills to a desensitized war veteran with an eagle eye.Once you spawn in, you will be in what was presumably your home with randomly generated loot. You have the keys to the place, but are not forced to live there. What will you do? Will you take what's in the kitchen and live off of whatever meal you can throw together until you need to leave? Will you take everything you can with you as you search for a better place to live? Will you leave the stove on and burn your house down with you in it? This is Project Zomboid, and this is the story of how you died.Aside from being a fun and challenging game to play on your own or with friends, Project Zomboid is pretty good for seeing how well you could potentially take care of yourself in a situation where society's rules are out of the window. Compare your current life to how your story began in Project Zomboid. Did you always have somebody who could cook for you? Did you not bother to learn anything about basic carpentry? What skills do you have? You are only yourself, and you can't do everything great (or even good enough) off the bat. So what will you do? Either way, you will have to learn new things. But what skills do you plan on using? Do you have a friend you can work with who can help take a load off? Are you going to be on the run solo until you can predict the dangers you may run into?If you can micromanage your character to ensure that you can maintain a healthy diet with no health complications or depression months past the power dies, odds are you are doing something right in your plan. And if you are at that point and are surviving off of worms and anti-depressants, you must really hate yourself.From camping under the stars to camping on the roof, the options for staying alive are endless. Do what suits you best. You may not be a carpentry/electrical based character. Maybe you are a park ranger? Use your herbology knowledge to forage for medical herbs, and set up camp somewhere deep in the woods. Not so good with the outdoors, but are even better than most with a baseball bat and are in the shape of your life? Maybe living on the move or in a safer suburban area could do you good. Great with a hammer, but not so great at fighting zombies? Construct a perimeter and use your skills to maintain it.And again, I can not stress how much better this game gets on multiplayer. Having a group of friends with different central skills and profession benefits will create it's own dynamic and let you fully experience everything the game has to offer.			"

								Ok so let's do some math here, 760k units sold. Currently the flat price is 15 dollars. At release it might have been cheaper. Just to make the numbers nicer, let's reduce the price to 10 dollars, and the units to 700k and they still made 7 MILLION DOLLARS. Even if we take out 2 million or whatever the deal is with steam, it's more than enough to hire full time worker at 80k+ a year and still have money left over? I just cannot fathom that this game has been in early release for what? 4 years soon. No animations, no NPCs and plenty of gliches to be had and missing content. I guess since the bulk of the money was already made from the people who actually wanted to play the game. People who actually wanted to help and see the game grow gave money up to buy and play it, whilst the developers run off with their money. Insane. It just feels like 2012-2013 was the game a bunch of these indie developers made these zombies survival games and released unfinished games as early access, made their money and dropped the project because how much more money would they be making if the game was finished?Just think Day-Z as an example, sold at 35 dollars  but it's l;iterally a ♥♥♥♥♥ier looking arma 2/3 with even ♥♥♥♥♥ier looking zombies and AI. lmao			"

Early Access Review
								I normally hate zombie survival games, but I love this one. The devs are working hard to improve the gameplay, and update often enough. Most importantly, for those of you who are looking to opt in during early access, the game is not only playable, but very fun. While not feature complete, it could be released as is and be a perfectly solid, complete game. This is an example of early access done right.As for the specifics of why this game is worth a buy (at any stage of its development), it has a lot going for it in terms of gameplay. It feels desperate, and it's tough as nails, but you never feel like you got screwed randomly. You're in control of how much risk you take on in your endeavors, and with increased risk comes greater reward. Scavenging in a mall may be far more lucrative than in a trailer park, but there are far more zombies in a mall, for instance.It's unlike other survival games in that it isn't all about endlessly spamming crafting, though crafting does play a vital role. It's not like other zombie games in that the zombies are actually what made zombies cool 25-30 years ago (as opposed to lame and played out in 2015). They're terrifying in numbers, but are a total joke individually. That said, a moment of negligence could end your life. You won't regret buying this, and now that Steam offers easy refunds, why not give it a go? It's potentially a classic in the genre. You'd be cheating yourself if you passed this up.			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR;Possibly most complex zombie survival out there, despite it's granularity I cannot recommend it without few warnings.First, it has been in Early Acces for like what? 3 years? Development come to nearly a stop. For the other reasons, read on.Review:Project Zomboid is complex zombie postapolacyptic survival game. Name 'dwarf fortress' can come to a mind for quite a few reasons. Reason one - number of small things and items and map size.Reason two - never ending development and bugsGameplay in this game is very uneven and under designed. You start as a survivor in one of the locations on a VERY large map. From there on, you have to cloth yourself, eat, drink, creaft weapons and kill zombies. Sounds good? After all who woudn't like good old zombie killing and survival combo?The problems however can break even the greatest enthusiasm.So let's name them.Starting new game - there is no real tutorial, except for very basic movement. Worse, sandbox settings are so uneven, that it beggets belief. On weak setting zombie takes 4 hits of crowbar. On normal, 12. How much it takes on strong?Numbers of zombies on survival setting is so huge, you will constantly bump into groups of 10-20 zombies.On basic perception settings they will spot you on sight. On basic speed setting they will keep following you everywhere. There is no story line to follow. Except some gibberish new feed on TV. No notes to be found (there is even a mod that adds them!). No NPCs to save and care for. Absolutelly no point in doing anything no reason for you to keep going. No achievements. Not even a sense of achievement, if you manage to put up a decent base.But lets back to ur zombies, mkay? Oh and I see that Random Event just spawned a horde after us?Now, maybe it's time to fight back? There are no real weapons to craft. What you find is usually crap, best of weapons being axe, which is also critical to crafting. And items do wear out!Guns - they miss most of the time, and draw more zombies. Swinging your axe at them will get you swarmed or will eat your stamina and get you swarmed.There are little traps, bombs, etc.Worse is that on hardcore setting you can't just shot your gun. You have to load, rack it, aim and shoot. I believe that complexity is welcome, but there are reasons why in games you do certain things by yourself automaticaly.So maybe let's build a base to put up a wall between us and zombies. Suprise - you can't. Once you level up carpentry so that you actually can, you discover that cutting trees exhausts you after 3 trees. And they overburden you. And you have to carry them to the place where you build and drop them on the ground. Only to discover, ground level has capacity limit(whaat?) to a maximum 5 wood logs per tile.And once you build the wall you suddenly discover zombies will simply swarm it and keep bashing it untill it breaks.There are no stone walls to build, no steel reinforced barricades, only wooden crap that lasts few minutes against the zombies. There is not real base building. No real sense of reward after tremendous work it takes to fortify anything. Mkay, but perhaps we can craft something otherwise usefull?No, despite having tons of crap. You can't attach a knife to the mop and make a spear. You can't upgrade your pistol with a stock to make it more accurate, put a flashlight on it to see in the dark etc. Predefined mods are very few.Top line craftable weapon is spiked baseball.Something else maybe? Like what? Radio, that doesn't reach anywhere? To add insult to injury, Inventory management is troubling, at least. There are very few slots to put anything in, two hands, chest, legs, boots, backpack slot. Nothing else. No careful arming and protecting youself. FFS damn wound system points to more slots than you can actually equip something to!Ok, so the basic game is bland and pointless. Maybe mods will help?Yes, there are certain mods that do improve the game. For example burning corpses in the fire mod. Or different book colours to help you tell them apart. Or perhaps more zombie loot - finally they carry something more than just clothes. But some mods add things that are completelly pointless. Biggest one, called Hydrocraft, allows you to establish an entire  industry. But ask yourself this:In zombie survival game, wouldn't you like to be able to craft solar panels to heat water and cook food rather than build a mine and cast tin ingots?Perhaps you would like to make a solid spear instead of bronze halebard?What about putting leather wraps around your legs and arms, rather than cast steel morning star?You see. Adding few hundred recipes that are useless unless playing with people in multiplier, which isn't working quite good, doesn't help. Knowing all the above you have to make a hard decision wheter to support a game from Early Access limbo with your money. After 55h hours of my gameplay I feel like I have achieved completely nothing. Make sure you will not make the same mistake.Edit:Also, keep in mind. Devs were seen arguing with negative reviewers in steam comment section. I sh!t you not!			"

								The zombie survival genre. A wasteland full of FPS games that all go similar ways. it all feels like some mish-mash of minecraft and a unique idea or two. Then theres project zomboid... a stand-out title that doesn't use those crappy ""WE'RE DEAD NOW THATS WHY WE CAN RUN REALLY F*CKING FAST NOW"" mentality. this is classic, george romero style zombies, they aren't a simple annoyance, that in hordes are dangerous. One encouter with a zombie could mean the end of years of hardwork and gameplay. Even though it has a static map, every game seems diffrent. are you gonna spawn in a house with a good weapon? Do you have to tread the streets welding a measly spoon as your weapon of choice? Rember Zomboid does NOT play around, from the start the game makes sure you know it ain't screwin aroundAll I want you to take out of this review is that Zomboid is an amazing survival game that really does ask the question, will you survive the zombie apocalapse?Also these devs are f*cking awesome, I always play on the opt-in builds and I rarely notice a bug. Do note, this game is not going to be done any time soon. Though that is to be expected with a four man team.			"

								I bought this game way back in Xmas 2013. While it had potential it was a visually ugly, buggy experience.Fast forward nearly two years and I returned after reading about the new visual engine and changes to the default Survival mode. Now I think it's one of the best early access games around (since Kerbal left the EA stable).Anyway you live in Knox County (an absolutely massive map btw) which has a couple of substantial towns, out of town mega-mall (go there if you want to die) and many other out of the way locales.I really can't be bothered writing any more here. Just trust me (how could you not!) that this is a beast of a game with many levels of gameplay (medicine, crafting, cooking etc..) to keep you interested. Game can be played as pure roguelike by creating a new world each time you die, or - what I do - roguelite by having the next character spawn in the pre-existing world and recovering your old safe house and inventory.The downside to playing the same world with a new toon is that by then you will be a month or two into the apocalypse. What this means is NO ELECTRICITY, NO WATER, MANY FOODSTUFF SPOILED and an expanded Zombie population.Just try the game, or wait till it leaves early access. Either way it doesn't bother me because I don't know you and if I did, I probably wouldn't like you enough to be steam friends and travel the world in MP together. Don't be sad about that, you'll find ""FUN"" in this game even without me.			"

								i love this game i do think you should watch some youtube videos to see if its your type of game. at first glance the graphics might turn you off, but stick with it the game and crafting and survival aspect is more then in depth enough that you dont even notice. even without mods like hydrocraft there are so many building and crafting options to survive. i also like the costum sandbox options you can even pick the zombie build ( how fast they move, how strong, even how zombification is transmitted or not transmitted, also how long you have before you turn) i love zombie games i have so many and this one is a new fav this is a true zombie SURVIVAL game, by that i mean your worst enemy in this game isnt always the zombies. its the rain making you wet and get sick, or its not having food orwater when the water and power go off. or its that cut you got breaking into a house to loot. there are many many moodlet bubbles in this gaem that add a sense of realism to the game. the maps are pre set meaning they are Not random, usually i dont like this as you get to used to the map and the game replayability is lessened but this map is so huge it would take me hours in real time to make it across this map even longer if you count having to stop to eat and drink and rest so the fixed map you will have trouble getting bored of. and if you do there are several additional maps in the workshop that just add small towns right to the existing map expanding on it. there is so much to offer with this game that from what i see anyways doesnt have alot of glitches that i have experienced. there are so many ways to play this game. stay in town and be a looter or move out to the more wooded areas and start a farm. saying that id like to say im super impressed with the farming system that offers things like different water requirments for different plants, fertilizer even making mildew or other plant cures to care for your farm. the stat and lvling system is a hard grind unless you find books to read to give you xp multipliers but i love the hunting for books or magazines that have new recipies i havent found yet. this game is a good option for those who love their zombie games but want a more realistic apocalyse then a shoot 'em up zombie game like left for dead (also awesome fyi)the building reminds me of the sims sort of the looting hmm like dead island or dying light in terms of lots of junk items or less used items but there is so much content this is really a game worth some attention even if the first glance reminded me of a game id played in the 80s or early 90s this game definatly did more then impress me as this is my first review i felt compelled to make. for an early access game this game is heading down the right path to be a very successful game. the developers appear to be attentive and care about feed back and concerns from the players. if your thinking about it try the demo you may want to play the demo a few times as you play as a bitten character so you have 2-3 in game days to play but it will give you a short idea of the rough game play though the demo doesnt really give the game justice it really helped me make my choice to buy this game. the online multiplayer function is also makes this game even better, i enjoy playing this game with others the servers make the game even more realistic. as you can go it alone or find a group or partner to survive and thrive with. on the other side on a pvp server you can do the same or just be a bandit or form a gang and kill other survivors to get their gear the choice is yours in Project ZomboidNovember, 27, 2016I have to say this game continues to improve and the relationship with the customers and the modding community is excellent there are so many mods for this game you can really make it a very personalized zombie survival experience...how will you die?

								tl;dr - The devs said that they would add lots of stuff, but we never got it. After a while, the community made a few of those features as mods. Don't get me wrong, I love(d) playing this game. It's very realistic and fun to play. In short, it's a 2D DayZ. But that's not what I want to talk about right now. Project Zombiod has been in development hell for several years. Back in 2014 or 15' (and maybe even late 2013), the developers said stuff about NPCs, a map editor, moving furniture, and vehicles, just to name some. It's 2017 now, and the Steam community are doing a better job at updating the game then the devs. Over the past few years, people made vehicles, NPCs, and movable furniture mods after months and months of absolutely nothing. The COMMUNITY should be getting the credit. Project Zombiod is a textbook example of what can become of Steam Early Access games. In conclusion, I like this game a lot. But it feels as if the devs have been lying to us. I find it really disappointing that the community of people who love this game contribute more to PZ than the developers. If you don't care about the promised features, then try the demo. Buyer beware.			"

								The developers are TERRIBLE.The developers once promised back in build 30 that cars and NPCs are being added in either build 32 or 33. Guess what, that was totally ignored and covered over. Yet here we are in build 35 that was just released, it had no major changes except for worthless radio/tv subtitles and bugfixes that no one noticed. Also, don't expect the developers to listen to your feedback. If you say anything negative about this game on the forums, expect yourself banned from all PZ discussions. This game will be in alpha stage for another 3 years, just watch...			"

								Please do not buy this game, do not waste your money on it. It's sad that after all this time I had to jump on the ""hate train"" but devs are just full of ♥♥♥♥ and lies at this point. With all those promises about the ""BIG NPCS UPDATE"" or the ""CARS UPDATE"", and those promises we're made about 4 years ago, sadly everytime you ask the devs things like ""Where are thr NPCS"" they will always say the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over ""Everything at it's time"". Ok, look, this game is dead, but devs just try to hide it, first of all I gotta say that I uninstalled this game for about 10 months and a couple of days ago I decided to play it again, I thought it would be cool to see some progress. but guess what? It's still the same ♥♥♥♥ it was 4 ♥♥♥♥ing years ago.It has come to the point where they just make an update to hide the fact that they just abandoned the game, updates like""Uh hey whats up, uuhhh, we added a blue tshirt and a muffin, so, uh, yeah, we have been working so hard at the studio on these last updates so, see you son"" Long story short, GAME IS STILL THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ IT WAS YEARS AGO AND IT WILL STILL BE THE SAME FOR ANOTHER DECADE, do not buy this game.

Early Access Review
								Far too long for far too little..fancy talk every week from the devs isn't gonna make it worth a buy, as the game has been in early access for about 4 years now and, in my opinion, other than small minimal changes it has barely changed from the first year.With the devs constantly teasing new content *cough* animations *cough* and weekly blogs about what's coming up, you may think this game is still fresh and fun, but don't be fooled, as the progress is damm slow and the playerbase is nearly dead with an avarage of 500 players at max.Overall, a fun game, but it lacks of what it promises, it needs a lot more work into it, melee feels clunky as hell and the progress is far too slow, I mean, it's taking them 4 year to make a damm backpack visible on your character..The devs are still teasing with upcoming stuff soon though, I might update this review when that ""content"" finally arrives.

								Always wary of early access games but took the chance on this one and very glad that I did. Great game with simple controls but complex mechanics. Much more than meets the eye and every play through is as good as the last.Being continually updated and developed too.. very good as it as atm but greatness is on the horizon.Pros+ Detailed large world to explore.+ Zombies!+ Many different professions and skills+ Many ways to die+ Many ways to survive ;)+ Trapping, Fishing, Cooking, CarpentryCons- Still a few weapon/item sprites to be added- No vehicles or NPC's yet but being worked on.

Early Access Review
								Probably the best example of appropriate direction for a zombie apocalypse survival game.  Bleak and ominous, emphasized by the game's beautiful musical soundtrack.  Loss of character for failure helps drive a sense of permanence and weight to the world, a trait decidely lacking in most other titles.However, the environments are largely bland and uninteresting.  The basic mechanics are relatively easy to master, and the game offers no escalation in challenge.  The UI is clunky at best, often feeling needlessly cumbersome.  It attempts to employ RPG elements in the way of independently leveling skills, but then perplexingly ties them back to a master level.Fun for a bit, but quickly runs out of things to show.			"

								This game is addicting, but not really any more fun than most browser games. Infact most of the game is watching the loading bar over your characters head. This game is mostly about trying to maintain your sanity while patently waiting for your character to individually move 200 between bags or towingback and fourth carrying three planks at a time. Honestly I can't even keep up with what little progress this game makes. I'm pretty sure they spend more time making the blog posts for the updates than actually working on the game.  I want to like this game and want to support it, but it has been way to long sense any sizable update. Don't worry though, everything is coming soon...			"

								Highly recommend this game, it just keeps getting better and more complex! This has to be one of the best survival sims available. You start with just the clothes on your back and whatever knowledge your previous profession had. Find a weapon, secure supplies, build a base... however you want. Grow vegetables. Make soup. Die. Start over, try to beat your old survival time. The map is huge and just getting bigger. Active and friendly developers, this game really does have it all. Join a server and survive with your friends or go it solo yourself!Try it yourself! There is a demo!			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game roughly 5 years ago at a time when there actually was NPCs; dysfunctional, unintelligible NPCs but still. This was a time before it was even on Steam and I had to get grandfathered into the Steam download.I was hooked on the potential but soon after the NPCs were yanked and have not been seen again. They had an extremely ambitious scope for what they were planning to do with NPCs; something they referred to as a meta-game which simulated thousands of NPC interactions outside the players own experience. They promised a lot. After well over 5 years of development I cant help but feel cheated.Unfortunately, the only feedback I can give at this time is that the development team, which consists of several people, is atrocious. Every now and then I re-install the game only to find a game that is nowhere near finished with an incredible amount of bloat in several areas causing a strange imbalance. The maps are huge, numerous and lifeless. The amount of objects, especially food, is extroardinary. The team has a habit of investing months of time in something arbitrary that doesnt appear to focus on finishing the project. The combat and UI are having trouble finding their identity. The game doesn't really play well with either a joystick or a keyboard/mouse as the inventory system and combat dont complement each other fluidly.Over the years, I have carefully observed the progress of the game so far and let me tell you if those years are any indication for the pace at which they work, we will be waiting another 5-10 years before they add NPCs and finish the game. Ironically, the amount of updates on their website is consistent in the form of what they call ""Mondoids"" and often times pretty lengthy despite there not being much progress. In their defense, I will say that the game is actually really fun for a minute and light years ahead of many indie projects, but the lack of any structure quickly dissolves the game into boredom. Im beginning to feel as if the team cashed out and are putting minimal effort to maintain the status quo.Im going to recommend that you dont purchase until they provide a finished product.			"

								I don't remember exactly when I first bought this game (long before it arrived on Steam), but it was at least 7 years ago.Very little seems to have changed since then. They spent two years working on a whole new game engine and map tools, which perhaps was of long term benefit, but what have they done in the other 5 years? Added some crafting and farming (fair enough, good), multiplayer (could have waited in favour of other stuff), redid interfaces, stats and other minor stuff.If you buy the game, you will get some enjoyment out of it for a while. You'll enjoy exploring the town, breaking in to various buildings and searching for useful stuff to help you survive, dodging or fighting off zombies along the way. You'll enjoy trying to build your zombie proof home.And then you'll get bored of it. The developers might keep you interested in how the development is going with their weekly essays on how awesome the game is going to be once they add the extra features that they've been working on for the last X years, but even that will wear thin sooner or later.If you're bored and want a distraction for a little while, then perhaps buy this and play it until you get bored again. But don't buy it based on promised content or improvements 'cos it'll be years away, if it arrives at all.Edit: For those questioning my time frame. I moved house about 5 years ago, and I played Zomboid at least a year or two before that, back when it was using Java (before the change of game code/engine, as stated above). Long before Steam EA (as stated above), so don't bother quoting that at me.Plenty of other games just as complex have been fully developed on EA and released in that time, so the argument ""development takes time"", yes it does. But for someone who has been following this game on and off for so long, this is just getting silly.Give it a couple more years, we'll see if you're still as zealous then.			"

								REALLY awesome game! Only really got into it and loved it because of the multiplayer function being added. DO NOT let the graphics steer you away! The graphics are way better in the game than the video/pics give credit for. I'm a stickler for graphics and this was way better than what I thought it would be. The whole crafting system is pretty cool and definitely really fun considering the fact that this is still an early access game. Multiplayer is super fun and the concept of farming, carpentry, and other skills like leveling up sprinting and stuff is really cool. Definitely worth the $15 tag!			"

Early Access Review
								I had heard a lot about this game on Reddit, and it eventuallly sparked enough of my interest to make this the very first early-access/alpha/beta game I have purchased on steam. I have stayed up until 6am playing this.If you like isometric, survival/crafting, zombie, adventure, rpg games, then you will absolutely love Project Zomboid!For an isometric game, the aesthetics are fantastic! The detail put into the environment is great, and the building/wall camera vision style will switch automatically, allowing you to always see your character (think Sims style) - unless, of course, you are being swarmed by zombies. There is also a great field of vision mechanic where you can only see in a cone radius in front of your character - so you can turn around to see a zombie standing right next to you (this game has prompted many screams from me lol). The music is perfect for the inensity of the game, of every single moment where it can be your last.The controls can take a little bit of getting used to, especially considering that you have multiple menus to deal with (ex: inventory, character stats). You have the option of keeping the menus locked open, making looting much faster if you can handle the space each menu takes up on the screen. There is a lot you can do in PZ, and it is highly recommended that you keep the unofficial map handy for quick reference. The game allows you to choose your profession, which will grant skills like higher resistance to zombie bites and scratches. You can also balance perks and negative skills, making the game more interesting. The custom mode provides a way to test out the game, allowing you to select the frequency of encountering zombies, their overall stats, how long until the electricity and water supply run out (yes, this is a critical element of the game), etc. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I recommend you start of here, just so you can better understand what you need to do without the pressure of dying at a moment's notice.The learning curve and difficulty of this game is moderate, however, I would consider survival mode (how the game is meant to be played) to be fairly hard. You will start off at in a random house, with only the clothes on your back. From here, you can loot supplies, hopefully finding some sort of bag item - which you can wear on your back, increasing your carrying capacity. Securing food and water is essential. Any container objects like bowls or bottles can be used to hold water from the sink, and this is critical to remember because the water supply will eventually run out. Perishable food will rot when not refrigerated.You increase in proficiencies as you do certain things - for example, whever you sneak around zombies you will gain points in nimblness, sneaking, etc. When you attain enough xp points, you will be able to ""master"" the first level of a ""completed"" skill. So, if I have cooked enough meals to fill my first block on the skill menu (level 1), and have a level up point, I can select the skill, mastering it and improving the quality of things that I cook. You will not be able to fill higher level skill blocks until you first master the lowest tier - this prevents you from just cooking for the entire game since you have to be mastering each level as you progress. Reading specialty books also provides a bonus multiplier to the respective skill, and there are different books for both skills, and their respective levels (ex: carpentry for begineers vs. advanced carpentry). While you play, you will have to balance your needs, eating, sleeping, and staying hydrated. You can also get bored if you are inactive, and becoming unhappy is also a possibility (leads to depression). There are items you can take to help with these needs (like beta pills, antidepressants, reading newspapers, etc), and you can also take sleeping pills to allow you to go to bed (you cannot keep sleeping unless your character is actually tired) - this is very useful for trying to settle sleeping patterns into a rhythm where you are sleeping during night time and awake in time to maximize the daylight visibility. The crafting is not too complex, you will need to find an axe and chop down trees for logs, then convert them into wood. Crafting a rain collector is a priority - with successfully finding an area to plant/farm as a close second. I have played this game a lot, and there was one time when I had spent 3 hours securing a base and building nice walls around it. I even had set up a farm and rain barrel, with pretty decent skills leveled up already. While looting a nearby house, I opened a window, but the alarm went off. Being overconfident in my abilities, I went in anyway, thinking I would be able to loot and leave before the house was stormed by zombies. While looting the upstairs rooms, I heard the door break open. I quickly run down and spot zombies rushing in through the front door. I try the back door, but zombies are piling in from a broken window next to the fridge. Panicking, I run upstairs, loot a shirt, tear it into sheet rope, and fashion a climbable rope on the second-level window. I slide down, but zombies are surrounding the house, and I have no way out. I hop over a broken window on the first floor and attempt to juke through the zombie horde. I take a scratch, and immediately see that I am about to die. I try to drop my bag, but it is too late. I have joined the dead.I stare at the screen for a good 2 minutes, sigh sadly, then load up a new game.I love this game.If you load a save where you have died, everything you have done will remain intact, so securing and transforming a safehouse will not be wasted. You can even find your corpse walking around if you are lucky. The mod support is not as extensive as say, Space Engineers or Starbound, however, there is a lot of potential for great user-made content. The developers, unlock Starbound, are also very active, releasing builds at good intervals. Be warned, however, not to invest to much in your saves, as you may not be able to transfer over your saves to newer builds when they are released.If you are interested at all, give this game a try. For an early-access game, it is quite impressive and very well-done.Highly recommend!			"

								REALLY awesome game! Only really got into it and loved it because of the multiplayer function being added. DO NOT let the graphics steer you away! The graphics are way better in the game than the video/pics give credit for. I'm a stickler for graphics and this was way better than what I thought it would be. The whole crafting system is pretty cool and definitely really fun considering the fact that this is still an early access game. Multiplayer is super fun and the concept of farming, carpentry, and other skills like leveling up sprinting and stuff is really cool. Definitely worth the $15 tag!			"

								A far cry from what the game once was in the demo, Build 27 shows the potential this game has.  From killing the town's former inhabitants to building a life for your character whether single player or multiplayer, the game events keep you on the edge of your seat.Being one of the few isometric games I own, it is a definite keeper and worth the $15 is currently goes for.

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is one of those few gems that is released every 5-7 years, where should I begin this review? Let's start with the concept of the game. The whole idea of PZ is to survive as long as possible, there are no objectives,  no end goal, just survive. Now this may sound easy, but in a world full of zombies constantly out to get whatever they smell/hear/see this can become rather challenging. We all know what zombies are and do, they are dead corpses that were reanimated by some sort of virus or disease and now out to infect everything in sight. And if you're an avid zombie hunter, then this game may sound like just another game with zombies in it, it's not.Let's get to the actual gameplay elements;Crafting: You can literally build what ever type of base you want, now this is by far one of the coolest features, you can wall off entire city blocks if you wanted to. (that would require quite a bit of resources though, I'll get to that in a minute) You can build doors, floors, walls, bars, stairs, and light posts among other things. You can craft weapons, or repair ones you've broken, you can add modifications to said weapons too! Got a baseball bat, some nails, and a hammer? Create a spiked baseball bat that deals pretty significant damage and does it in style too. Barricading: This should probably go in the crafting section, but whatever. Barricading is something most of us zombie hunters have wanted to do for some time now, and sure some zombie games do have it, but Project Zomboid executes it brilliantly, the resources required for barricading are pretty rare depending on how lucky you are and what type of settings you selected before you started your game. (only in Sandbox mode can you select said options) You can barricade windows and doors, which not only helps keep the creeping zeds at bay, but also makes it so they can't see you through said windows, which is really cool. (you can also put sheets up to block outsiders from looking into your safehouse)Scavenging: This has been a part of modern zombie games for quite some time now, however this game does do one of the more realistic approches to it, food that you scavenge must be kept in a fridge or else it will spoil and make you sick if you attempt to eat it. Items that you need for crafting/barricading are pretty rare and thus valuable when found. You really need to pick and choose only the stuff you'll need at that moment when scavenging because you can only carry so much before becoming over encumbered, and don't forget you can always come back for whatever you can not bring with you at that time. There is another cool option about this, you can carry two bags with you at a time (this would require you to equip one bag in the secondary slot, and a big/normal, hiking/school bag equiped on your back) which gives you plenty of more space along with weight reductions applied from the bag(s) you have equiped at the time.Moodles: These are moodlets that pop up every now and then to tell you what your character is feeling/thinking, think The Sims, it's just like that. These can range anywhere from being tired, to getting cold, you'll want to keep a close eye on these. Most are not that important, however they're are some that do require your attention and you'll want to be on the lookout for such as, exhaustion, starving, getting sick, getting cold, getting wet, (when it rains) bleeding, and being in pain. A couple tips. 1) You'll want to avoid going out looting/killing during a storm because you'll get wet and will have an increased chance of becoming sick which could be the death of you if you don't take things easy. (killing zombies, running) 2) Lay down every now and then, you're not superman, your character needs sleep just as much as you do. 3) Make sure to always carry bandages/bandaids on you, in case you need to break open a window or patch up a wound, these are a necessity.Skills: This is a really fun feature in the game, you will develope skills according to how you play overtime. Do you like sneaking around avoiding the undead masses? Or do you like running in swinging hand over foot? either way will get you XP in these skills, which in time will unlock skill points that you can assign to your favorite most used abilities. Remember though, this is not carried over to multiple characters, if your character dies, all the abilities you've unlocked die with them.Farming: This is a pretty cool feature, it requires quite a few resources that may or may not be tricky to find depending on where you are and what options you've chose before starting the game. I'm not too experienced in this aspect as of the time of this review, however I do know that it is a great food source after the power/water has went out. You can grow your own crops inside your safe zone, or where ever, it really doesn't matter as long as you have the right materials you need, you can start your own little Farmville. (without being bombarded with 53,721 requests from people you barely know. I'm looking at you, Facebook)Distracting: You can distract the zombies with a few different methods, distracting a group of zombies could end up saving your life for another day. If you've got some gasoline handy and a few matches/lighter you could light up a near by house distracting the horde of undead while you easily sneak by and loot the otherwise damn near impossible house/building with ease. If you're playing with a friend(s) you can distract zombies while your friend goes in and loots the place dry by shouting at them, this will make your life a little bit harder though depending on how many of them there actually are, and Vice versa. Alams in houses can provide a quick distraction, if you're quick enough that is. Break a window or force it open in certain homes and you'll hear an alarm buzz for about 20-30 seconds, if you're quick enough to get out you can easily evade the on coming hordes making it easier to loot the outer area around the house you just sounded off, however this could very well be the end of your life if you get caught up in an oncoming group of zeds.Weapons: As with most zombie games, this game is based on melee/close quarter combat, there are guns available, however they're pretty rare, most are found in the cities and or gun stores, but of course those areas are hard to get to and loot without proper means, meaning you'll be doing most of your killing with a good ol' baseball bat/crowbar/golfclub, which is by no means a bad choice. (well except maybe the golfclub, you'd be better off fighting them with a toothbrush) The baseball bat has pretty decent durability, and is great against zombies, you can kill most zeds with a couple blows from a baseball bat, same with the crowbar, the better more rarer melee weapons such as the Axe and Sledgehammer are great too, however they're mostly located in the city areas, consider yourself lucky if you find one in the suburbs. Guns are great for clearing out areas, just make sure that you have enough ammo on you, because once you pull that trigger, it's on, that's like a dinnerbell to the infected.Be SMART: This game is heavily focused on realism, this isn't a game where you're an overpowered solider that cannot be killed, you can and probably will be killed quite a bit starting out. Only RUN when needed. Don't be a glutton and eat everything in sight, you may need that for another day. If you think it's a bad idea, then it is, and you shouldn't do it. And one last thing, STAY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AT ALL TIMES.Those are the main features of the game as of 4/20/2014 (Yea I know what day it is har har har)I'd like to add in that you will NEED to think before you act if you want to survive efficiently, this game is about your experience in the zombie apocalypse, what would you do in this situation if it actually happened? That's up to you, however, don't be careless, or else you will not survive for long.			"

""These are the end-timesThere was no hope of survivalThis is how you died""Every time I start up the game and see those words I get chills.  Project Zomboid is an isometric view survival zombie game. It involves managing hunger/thirst, mood, physical well being, zombies, and figuring out how to live once the power and water shuts off.  You can tell by my hours spent in game I LOVE it!ProsA very unique game.  I have never played anything like it. Every time I play this game I want to watch The Walking Dead. Every time I watch The Walking Dead I want to play this game.  It is a custom built game engine that is THE zombie survival game I always wanted.Updates are meaningful and consistent.  Every time an update comes out I know I am in for a treat.  You can test the update before it is part of the official steam release, but I only did that once. When they release it the update is very stable with only very minor bugs.There is a sense of desperation. As you character gets panicked and tired and you are far from your safe house the tension goes up.  When you finally use that gun you know you will be overwhelmed by a horde because of the noise.  Scavenging has never been so fun.Multiplayer adds a great way to play with friends or join a server for  more competitive play.Modding is supported. Players are starting to make really cool custom maps and interesting mods.It is just fun.ConsOnce you clear out an area, establish you house, create a few rain barrels, and start farming, the game looses lots of tension. Zombies don't spawn after you kill so many. The engine redistributes zombies by in game events that are limited to gun fire and helicopter noises, but in practice they don't bring that many after you truly cleared your area and the surrounding area.  In one game I no longer feel I am in threat of dying.The early history of the game has a pretty bad black eye involving loosing all their work because they didn't back it up and their laptops were stolen.  TotalBiscuit still referenced it recently when he talked about it in his breakdown of the daily summer sales.Finale ThoughtsBuild 27 (the current stable build as I write this) advances the game to the point I can finally wholeheartedly recommend it.  Even if they never do another update, the game is fun enough and unique enough to establish itself as a worthy game at full price.There is a challenge mode, multiplayer, and mods. Even if you get to the point of feeling safe (like I do now), I can always start new or jump on my online server with friends, join a public server, or try the challenge mode.   I am going to see how long my current guy can last. So far 700+ zombies killed and over 2 months alive! woot!!BUT...it is not going to stop updating anytime soon. The most anticipated update is NPCs. They used to be in the game, but they rebuilt under the hood stuff so they can introduce them with a sadistic AI. It will open up a higher degree of tension and give modders great tools to work with.The UI is slated to be updated, crafting and skills keep getting tweaked (as they should be), and minor bugs are getting ironed out. The map is expanding, items and recipes are increasing, and new features are still being implemented.  I believe they are even working on a system to better redistribute zombies or keep them spawning. I hope so anyway.  I thought I read that they intend to add more zombie spawning options-multiplayer servers particularly need that option as they cuurently depend on the admin manually spawning zombies.As of now admins can also do a soft reset that respawns zombies and loot, turns back on power and water while restarting the clock to their shutdown, but the soft reset keeps player crafted buildings intact.It will be better if automated zombie spawning is implemented or zombie spawning scripts can be utilized.The company has more then atoned for their early days and are a shining example of being persistent and overcoming very real mistakes and making a better product for it.  Don't be fooled by old reviews or info.This is the golden age to get the game. Full price is still cheap. The current full price is worth it. The Indie Stone has enough of a track record and community involvement to feel confident this great game will only get better. Don't pass this one up!NPCs, vehicles, and hunting are just around the corner, as well as the official release.The music and sound effects are very immersive.			"

This game has so many elements including farming, protecting oneself and tending to injuries. There are traits that impact your game experience and zombies that are a threat but possible to take down in small groups (even multiple zombies!).This has made its way to the top of my favorite game list and is helping me so much in coping with real life stress and whatnot.

								I'm going to be blunt, there currently is no zombie survival game that can come even near to the quality of Project Zomboid. Even if its still in Alpha. There just isn't. The AAA Walking Dead FPS was a flop, DayZ is a deathmatch, Infestation is a joke, I can keep going you get the picture. Set aside your grudge against pixel grafix because if you like survival, and you like zombies, then you will miss out a true gem. This is an experience DayZ can't provide by miles, and I doubd any 3D game will in the following few years. If you're still on the edge check out Robbaz on Youtube, or Eckyman, they have rather nice 'Lets Play' vids.			"

I HIGHLY encourage anyone interested in the game to check out its website for more information about its future plans (more specifically, their metagame and NPCS).

								In short: The most massive and accurate zombie-apocalypse simulator that i know of, but rough around the edges and not quite finished.This game features a very diverse and rich pool of mechanics and allows you to play as you like to.You'll experience very intense situations but also quiet and boring periods, where nothing really happens, but the DEVs are working on NPCs (hopefully) which will stirr the whole mix up a bit (and you can play multiplayer if singleplayer is too calm for your taste).If you like role-play-games, sims and zombies, get it!Negative Stuff:-Fighting and movement feels disconnected, you don't get quite the feedback on visibility, hits and damage, etc. which is mostly because the animations and other visuals-related-stuff isn't done yet. Feels like you're not really in control, especially with movement and concealment, your character cannot lay down, hide or peek around corners.-Lack of real gameplay content; The game has a massive map with lots of great art and a huge number of zombies, but you can only survive and build/farm. After some time everything is settled and nothing substancial happens anymore. The DEVs are trying their best to address that but i don't see any fortune there without human NPCs. And just randomly sending hordes to your savehouse is stupid too, it seems fake and unfair.			"

								So I've gone through a few zombie games, the ones where you can update weapons like you are an engineer, where you can fight like a soldier, survive like Bear Grylls and are basically as inhumane and courageous as one of Daenerys' unsullied.  But I have always wanted to play a true zombie survival game and when I heard about Project Zomboid I decided to give it a go. Needless to say I died on my first day by stumbling in a hoard and thinking that with my flimsy butter knife I would kill them all. I died.. but I was excited. I realized that it's a different type of game, one where survival of the fittest is the phrase of the day. So like any excited person, after dying a few times I decided to check out youtube videos, improve and learn and then I gave it another go. It is an amazing game and I am proud to say I've survived 3 weeks already, I have an axe, a saw, lots of needles and a loooot of AMBITION. However, if you do decide to play this game just remember: ""This is how you're going to die!""			"

								This game is really really outstanding.This is the realism at its finest.I really appreciate that the developpers going on to do an awesome work to make this game better and better.I will support you, guys. I will never be tired of this game, mainly in the future updates.Pros : - Realism, detailed sandboxes settings, Multiplayer.Cons : - We need vehicles or bycicles I dont know, but we are really slow because of that ! On the highway, damn, it took me 20 minutes !! ^^			"

								Let me start off this review by saying this; These game devs, are not like all the others. They care about their game, AND their community. They listen to what you have to say, and take it into great consideration. THAT BEING SAID; their update progress is slow. When they do update the game however, hardly anything is broken.The game as it stands, is very very enjoyable; with a great community. Gameplay can change at a moments notice, as you are sorting through your bag, a zombie could take a bite out of your neck, yikes! Project Zomboid makes you feel afraid. It doesn't hold your hand, it tells you ""This is how you die."". And they're not wrong. You will die. Exploring buildings and looting can be great fun, as you get into tight situations with the undead. When you do manage to scratch out an existance in the game, it's a great feeling. Until the undead come crashing through your door...I'd rate this game right now at a 7.5/10Only because it's still in beta, or alpha or whatever. Updates are slow, but good when they release. "

								While concept is interesting, this game lacks purpose and gets boring after 30 minutes of playing.  Playing it felt like a terrible waste of time, as nothing was accomplished whatsoever, and unless the developers do something to add some kind of an objective to the game, this game will continue to be nothing more than an interesting concept.

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is one of the most unique zombie games ever made. It asks the question ""In the zombie apocalypse, How will you survive, and what will be the cause of your demise?"" This is a game that, if all its planned features are added, will rival other zombie survival horror games such as DayZ or 7 Days to Die. In the event you do not know the full extent of what they are looking to add, this includes an in depth survivor system that will allow you to join or start your own enclave of survivors, then supply them with the means to protect your new home. They also plan to add hostile NPC's because everyone knows in the event of the zombie apocalypse, their is nothing to stop a group of people from coming to your home and robbing everything you used to own, then shooting you and putting an end to your shortlived life in the Project Zomboid world. Did I mention that one day these muggers may not be NPC's, but entire bands of other players? No? Thats one of this games planned features as well.With all this being said, and there are still hundreds of more things to come, Project Zomboid is a game worth getting now, and a game worth the wait for later. I will recollect some of my expereinces to all who read this so you may furthur understand how this game is the zombie game we have all been waiting for.This story begins as it is my first time playing, my charactar is wearing a sweater and a little moodlet pops up on the side showing that it makes him a little warm, and so I swap the sweater with a vest and start to loot the rest of the house I had spawned in. After a long day of looting my charactar becomes hungry, thirsty and tired. After taking care of his Food and Water needs, I put him to bed. However in the middle of the night, two gunshots ring off close to the house, and while there are no NPC's yet, it still put me under the impression that someone was outside my house. The gunshots almost immediatly woke me up, and after waking up I heard a very distinct set of moans, and it is obvious to anyone that the gunshot drew a couple of the undead. However I did not grasp the danger of this situation until I stepped outside to a full on Horde. Only one of them noticed me as I bolted back inside and I hatched a plan. I would draw the horde in, then attempt to burn down the house. After coming up with this Idea I kept in mind this house had 6 exits, 4 including the windows around the house, and the 2 doors on opposite ends. I shoved a bunch of food and maybe some things not meant for the oven- into the oven, and turned it on. Over time electricity and plumbing turn off in this game but for now I was fortunate that it had not. After this I drew a large chunk of the horde into my home once the kitchen set ablaze. I didn't stop to see if it worked, I just simply ran on and on, putting as much distance between me and that horde as possible.I beleive that story to be best to show off how diverse the system of Project Zomboid is, with the appropriatly named ""Sinister Ai"" the game will generate random events such as house alarms for when you break into the window in an attempt to loot the place, or as you saw, random enviromental sounds such as jets, helicopters, gunshots and alarms that will draw or lead away hordes. Overall the pros of this game leave your screen and roll outside your house, yet the cons do as well. While this game is a great colaboration of everything any zombie fan has ever wanted in a zombie game, it still doesnt have ALL the features and it still is in Early Access, which means there will be a LOT of bugs, but if you can get past this you will get a game that will truly give you a fresh expereince every time.

Early Access Review
								THE Zombie Survival game.From one playthough, I can already see that Project Zomboid is just unforgiving, rewarding your impatience with a group of zombies pounding on the door of a closet that you desperately tried to hide yourself in whilst you crafted a molotov cocktail on the spot so you could burn down your entire house, taking as many zombies as you could with you.Seriously, though. If you happen to accidentally take a wrong turn or make a noise too loud, you can end up being bitten, and as soon as you're bitten, you genuinely die. Being bitten will actually progress into zombification (if that's the word). You've gotta choose your own safehouse, build your own defenses and scavenge for food yourself. The game does nothing for you except choose a spawn location. After that, the world is your metaphorical oyster!Just one violent, dark, flesh-eating oyster... Let's stick with that.			"

								This game is fun, but it can and most likely will get really repetitive after a few hours. My biggest issue with this game is how slow it takes you to get from point A to point B. I mean god if you want to go to that mall or other town you'll actually have to spend a good hour or two maybe more irl just to get there. This game is in dire need of transportation, like cars or bikes. Seriously, I think this is the only zombie game I played that has zero broken down cars or working cars in it. If you are going to make a huge map like this, it needs a way to get around faster.			"

Project Zomboid Video Review! Project Zomboid-An isometric sandbox zombie survival game by The Indie Stone. In my humble opinion, one of the best survival games to date especially considering that there are a lot of zombie/survival games. I haven’t reviewed an early access title before, but, I wanted to do my part, however small, to help out The Indie Stone and make people aware of this amazing game, this studio has done amazing work despite all their troubles and I think that that’s really admirable, I won’t go into detail but, if you’re curious I would suggest researching on the net to find out more.  *PC*This game is only on PC. The options for the game are befitting of a PC, the game itself isn’t a major powerhouse so much older systems should have no problem running the game, and currently you can play with a controller (with split-screen co-op!) A very good PC game.  *PLOT*There is no story to speak of at the time of this review, there are however, plans to bring a story mode to the finished game, sandbox is all you’ll find. You do however have a lot of options for your sandbox game, going so far as to decided how long the apocalypse has been going on for (with gameplay changes, more on that later),the game simply starts by putting you inside a house with the crazy world outside.  *STYLE*This game is isometric (top-down view) with art style that reminds me of Commands 2 Men of Courage, it’s got great detail and a very fitting look, I like this type of realistic style because, the proportions of the character to the world makes sense and, the world itself is very realistic with buildings and houses that look more modern. I do wish there were more style differences with clothes, weapons and zombies (especially as time goes on) but, what’s here is still pretty good (plus the game is mod-able) and there is always more being added. The music in this game can be very moody and fitting, this is my own personal taste but, I personally dislike the music with the parts of the middle eastern music (seems like a lot of zombie games have it strangely enough), it’s not that I dislike the genre in general, but, the game has this music that makes it feel very somber, sometimes peaceful, sometimes depressing, and it really gets me into the game, however, when that music starts in (and the women makes the ‘chanting’ noise) I get completely ripped out of it, it’s very jarring in my opinion, I think the game would be better with a focus on atmospheric music similar to that of Fallout or Wasteland 2 even, again it’s a personal preference of mine but, the style and feel of this game just doesn’t seem fitting with that type of music. Still a great style overall, I really enjoy isometric games as I feel you can get a lot more out of it visually and that especially works well with Project Zomboid.  *GAMEPLAY* Project Zomboid is perhaps one of the most realisticgames I have ever played and I don’t use that term often in association with video games. The game rewards you for very logical thinking, more so than in most video games (not to say video games need logic to be fun, but, referring to Payday 2, logically you shouldn’t be able to answer pagers period, much less four) as such this game is all about survival. Besides taking care of the basics, you’ll need to keep your character healthy and sane, really the only thing missing is your characters don’t have to shower, or, go to the bathroom, everything else is pretty much there, the first aid system is pretty involved too, I climbed through a broken window, had to take out glass shards with tweezers, disinfect the cuts, and when the bandages got too bloody, had to replace them and clean the old ones. The other part of what adds to the realism is the length of time, you have great control over your settings of the world and can make it match up with the real world if you so wish, either way, in-game healing isn’t instant, if you break a bone you’re looking at a few weeks in-game before its healed, suffering from the negative affect all the while. Farming also takes months to yield any results, and that’s assuming your planets don’t get trampled by zombies or die of disease and you’re watering them regularly. As time progresses eventually, the running water and power that are available in the houses (or not depending on your options) will turn off, you’ll need to plan ahead for these and if you don’t it’ll be a slow painful death.  *COMBAT*Combat is pretty simple, you have your choice of melee weapons, guns and throwing weapons (like the classic Molotov-cocktail), you ready your weapon, point in a direction and swing/shoot. The longer you ready your weapon, the better the accuracy, and when zombies get close you can shove them away (some may even fall over) and either make a run for it or bash their brains in. Goes without saying that loud noises attracts more zombies and, fire spreads so be careful. You can also sneak past zombies. Combat does take its toll on your character, it’s enjoyable if simple, hopefully more weapons and toys are added to make going out with a bang more of a literal option.  *VERDICT*If you enjoy survival games or zombie games, you’ll love this game, this is the most realistic game I’ve played. Honestly, even if you don’t this is the type of game that is so good it might get you into a genre you’ve never tried before. Its co-op and local split screen, so if you’ve got a passive interest I highly encourage you to check it out, maybe get a friend to play with you, it can and is a lot of fun. And it’s priced at $14.99 USD and I see it on sale often, it’s well worth the asking price. Thank you The Indie Stone for an amazing game!  TL/DRA zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, they’ve hit some rough patches, but, have still created one of the best survival games to date which is still only in early access. There is a ton of stuff planned for the future, but, what is here is a great game, it’s rewarding in all the right ways, makes you feel awesome for being smart and playing like a real survivalist. Its co-op and local split-screen, and the regular price is $14.99 USD which is a steal for this amazing game. If you’ve ever had any interest I highly encourage you to take a hard look and really consider grabbing this game, it simply deserves to be played and I get excited for the day it finally sees a full release.  Thanks for the amazing experience  The Indie Stone!

Early Access Review
								I will echo all the prior statements: The developers are slower than hell, the moderation (censor police) will scream or outright ban you out of their forums for any sort of criticism, and the severe ADD that has infected the feature-creep invested, broken promise loving, half baked feature giving team behind this game is second to none.To give you some perspective I was playing Rogue Survivor and Survival Crisis Z, not to mention flash games, in early 2011. Someone mentioned PZ to me and I backed them before their first demo was even out -- an outrageous idea at the time, but common now. What initially came to fruition was a polished and focused tech demo with a good art style, simple animations and aesthetic, and clunky but functional inventory system.I fired Build 34b up this week and I can say with assurance that almost nothing has changed. The art style has shifted to a pseudo-realistic stop motion, with a useless zoom feature and glitchy lighting. Running from house to house, room to room, fighting back awful controls and the exact same terrible inventory/looting system was a chore. The netcode is Direct Connect IP/Serverbox, with no dedicated servers or IP to IP hosting -- which makes no use of Steamworks.Combat is downright impossible with static repeating animations (or none at all) with each subsequent hit. Weapons break too frequently and are too rare, there are still no NPC's 5 years later. To close my review do not bother supporting Indie Stone, for I truly believe that high profile robbery that transpired years ago was the death of the ""real"" project zomboid. What we have now is an expensive tech demo.			"

								This game takes the Zombie Survival formula and takes it so many steps further, in the best of ways. I recommend this to anyone who remembers the good ol' days before the Walking Dead made everyone a zombie fan. It's about as realistic as it gets to an actual zombie apocalypse, starting you off well after the infected have largely inherited the Earth. You have tons of options, and can even customize the type of zombies that would populate your world. Even while still in Early Access its a incredible game.			"

Early Access Review
								Don't let the outdated poisitve fool you, it's a facade of what used to be. Pretty depressing. There's only a few games out there these days that really utilize early access to strive. Starbound was a prime example, the game hits early access, the developers keep on a rampant grind, and then the game is released. Top of the line, A++ quality game.Zomboid was going to be my second on the list. The early access was amazing, I was playing with friends, having a great time, coming back every now and then when big updates would come up, but always waiting for specific promised features. I know it's early access, that's why I gave them years on years to add them, and it didn't bother me. However after a while, it became clear to me that the development team had changed.I'd say from 2 years back now, the development hit a halt. Vehicles have only been remotely announced recently, but for years were in the silent. The promised NPCs / Bandits were rarely mentioned again, and the building system was still as buggy as day one. But through all of the bugs, And then the weekly/monthly news releases and dev blogs would come out. ANIMATIONS. That's it. No feature updates, no vehicles, no multiplayer tweaks, rarely any potent bug fixes, and no AI. What was their latest update? Animations.""We redid the animation system""""New animations coming out""""We've been working on animations for months""""These new animation tweaks are golden""2 years. They had 2 years of money and development, and the only progress we were seeing - was on animations. The game, admiteddly, didn't have the smoothest animations - so I get why they would want to overhaul them in preperation for a full release. 2 Years though? Really?And then every other dev blog had an excuse for these animations.""We have a new team helping us out""""Here's our new animator""""We encountered some bugs""It was all nonsensical excuses to deliberately extend the moneygrab before they'd abandon the project. And it's clear that was the direction they were going in.The biggest factor to take in right here, is that out of all of the updates in the past 2 years - you won't notice a majority of them. The bugs never affected anyone, half of the QoL fixes weren't needed, and the interface updates were honestly worse. If you update a game over 2 years and people can't notice the changes, it is a clear sign that priority needs to change.If you are wondering why a game with ""very positive reviews"" has extremely negative reviews suddenly, it is because this is a practically ABANDONED GAME. If you like it for the stage it's in now, then by all means buy it. However if you expect vehicles, AI, or reliable multiplayer changes - DON'T BUY THIS. You will not see those updates during your play time. It will take atleast another 1-2 years to maybe see these? But by then I am convinced the team will have abandoned the project.Sadly, as much as I was rooting for this to not be ""another stereotypical abandoned early access project"", it is. It's just that. Just like every other early access money grab. And it's a shame, because it was such a good game. It was turning out to be an isometric DayZ and it was AWESOME. But now it's just a joke. A wasteland of abandoned code and failed promises.Save your money and invest it into some other completed games or upcoming projects. Find a more reliable team to put your hope into. This team will take your money and run with it. Don't trust them, or any of the developer blogs they release. They will lie to their customers - no hesitation. And if you speak out against them, they will do whatever they can to silence you, hide your posts, and mask your thoughts.Don't fall for this scam. Please.			"

								Fun game, but it's taking way too long for the developers to push updates. What is here is remarkably fun for a survival game, but, like any survival game, it gets old quickly. If you like survival games and aren't afraid of buying a game that will probably never be finished, I'd say go for it.Wait for 1.0, which will be along shortly before the corona of the dying sun reaches earth's atmosphere.

Early Access Review
								I originally had recommended this game, but I feel that I am unable to anymore. As people have pointed out, the updates have come to almost a complete halt. The devs get very angry when anyone points out that their updates are rather uncommon, and protest that they're doing their best to get everything out, which I don't doubt, but the delayed updates are pretty tiresome.As well, the game has become much more centred around multiplayer than anything else, with the latest patch being entirely based around multiplayer, save the two maps which are both multi and singleplayer.

								Ran over to the mall near westpoint and thought i could ropleplay as the guys from dawn of the dead, ended up only seeing three stores before 30+ zombies broke through the glass after i started killing zeds in the food court with my pistol i had scavenged that had only 5 rounds which led me up the escalators to hide in a clothing store living off  two juicy watermelons. After i ate the melons i said screw it and grabbed my kitchen knife (which seems over powered to me) and started one shot killing zeds by slicing them in the head untill it broke and i got severly gangbanged10/10 would roleplay again			"

Early Access Review
								This game.. I don't really know where to start.Do note this is a very short and straight to the point review. When i got it.	The game was enjoyable, i loved the survivalness. The maps seem very well done. At this point i was enjoying the game and would recommend it. After a while	I started to notice the developers were very slow on there updates which i had no problem with. However after some time they kept repeating the same thing.Animations over and over. I thought they were done. But that's not the only thing. They don't seem to put out a lot of content. (And yes im aware the developer team is small. And like i said i understand for the slowness. )So then i decided i wanted to make a map and which i did it is called South Wuxburg or West Wuxburg. It was pretty good to me and people seem to enjoy it. Until one day.  Bugs and how they handle it. (mini rant)I have found many bugs and glitches with this game and it's getting very annoying. And yes im aware this is a EARLY access game but it's been out for over 2 years now. However it broke my workshop item once, And now there is a bug that has completely broken my world editor i use to edit my items. i reinstalled and everything..Before that i had another issue with the editor. I put in a report and got nothing and still nothing of the date of this review.I put that bug report in  October 3rd 2016, It's November 21st. No one has bothered to look it at or even message me about it. There was also a few other bug reports that are there. No one has responsed.I'm just showing how they don't seem to pay attection to bug reports. I Don't hate this game for this it's just very annoying and frustrating and the only way to get them to see this is to make a review. OVERALLGet this game if you like zombie survival games, You will enjoy the mutiplayer (if that don't bug out like it sometimes for me). This game is pretty enjoyable even at 66.4 hours. You can build, Fight, Barrcade and do a bunch of other stuff like crafting.  However be prepared for bugs and to know that the developers might not respond to your bug report. (for a while) Co-op can be extremely fun when the port forwarding works (and it's not my issue). There's lots of modifers to change out how you want the world to be. Make it easy, make it hard, Make it extremely hard. Customize your person. Use the workshop and download many cool mods and maps. Do note  i do not hate these developers and i love there game.	Also, i thought we were getting creative mode. It has gone slient in the blog posts they do. Other then that. Have fun playing this game if you do get it and hopefully this review has helped you.I am however not recommending this game since i am very tired of being forgottion and the bad support. Also Thanks for breaking the map editor.			"

Early Access Review
Everyone saying this game sucks or is dying or will never get completed because we don't have NPCs/Vehicles/Animations yet will always find something to complain about. Those things will get implemented and then they'll be screaming something new.I don't even remember when I picked up this game, but I figured my love for it is pretty set-in-stone so a review couldn't hurt. I am a die-hard zombie fan, so hearing zombie survival on a scale like Zomboid instantly pulled me in. Everything the Devs are trying to bring keep me here more. This game is a gem, and it should be looked at as such.The gameplay is phenomenal, but remember this is just my opinion. The experience is heightened with headphones to really pull you in to the world, but without it still remains a tense and exciting environment. The subtle fade of the smooth atmospheric music which dynamically changes with your setting really helps, be it surrounded by deadly zeds and hearing frantic violins or on a roof cooking over a campfire to a soft piano. I've found myself so immersed in the setting many times that I have to mentally step back and remember I'm playing a game.March 11th, 2017The main issue with current development is highly anticipated features are taking extra time to roll out after being teased not too long ago. Vehicles are getting good, promising attention at current time of writing. No sight of NPCs yet, but animations seem two shakes away from completion. My thought is animations and vehicles will have release dates around each other if not the same time, but that is probably best-case scenario.Pros- Immersive, well-designed world with developing storyline and random finds- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time)- Complex building/crafting/cooking systems -- Build your survival base, or fortify existing structures. New metalworking has been added for increased defensive structures. Count your calories to maintain a healty diet in a dying world. (:- Character specialization -- Be a chef, lumberjack, thief, or more! Varying attribute points are given to really tweak your character's performance.Neutrals- Clunky combat -- Anything other than melee is questionable to me with low skills, and even that sometimes gets odd. (*see footnote for expansion on this)- I personally don't find the UI to be a nuisance, but I can understand players disliking it.- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time)- I'll keep this one neutral as it bounces back and forth, but things can get arduous fast. Fortifying can turn into luring a horde away from base. Luring a horde away can turn into getting lost/hurt/off track. Simple things like going to get some food downstairs and now you've got a shattered shin. You'll understand when you play.Cons- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time, and has). This is what holds up a lot of people from enjoying what you have, and instead focusing on what you don't have. Early development is going to be a rollercoaster, and things will get halted for reasons that won't always get explained clearly if at all. You have to understand this if you wish to assist in early development. I believe in this title, and I believe it could grow to be a massively entertaining experience for a lot of people.- There is a slight lack-of-life to the world (no pun intended). No abandoned vehicles littering the roads, not much in the way of saying ""there was an outbreak and panic ensued"" other than TV or radio broadcasts during initial infection. Devs are working on introducing more world-clutter like this, but more important features take the front seat.I could write an even longer post and say so much more but you should really just experience it for yourself.(*In all my hours of playing, I haven't played with the guns too much other than shotguns and pistols. I have no clue how the aiming and reloading skills work at high skill levels because I've never gotten there myself.)March 28th, 2017Reading over some other helpful reviews and I was reminded how old this Early Access is. Correct, but you must remember that we are not playing the same exact version we used to play. They reworked the entire system a year or so ago. Hell, they even increased the resolution of textures. If the game isn't fun to you as-is, it won't be fun to you when the damned NPCs/Anims/Vehicles get added because you won't enjoy the CORE game.We've got active updates on two of the three long-awaited mechanics and people are still flailing about, damning Zomboid to development hell. Vehicles are being polished, and Animations are pretty much complete, what else do you want? You want it on a silver platter, immediately. Don't choose Early Access if you can't wait patiently.			"

								Best value you can get. This game is amazing and has recently added multiplayer. This game is updated almost every week and is made by devs who are really passionate about the genre. Project Zomboid is a Zombie Survival game where you must not only fight zombies but you must also fight off starvation, illness, depression and more. You can camp out, farm your own crops. Light buildings on fire. Make friends, make enemies. Has good gameplay and the game is always getting better every week.I HIGHLY recommend this game. It's amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review:For a game that's premise is over-saturated, Project Zomboid stands unique and fresh compared to it's peers. Project Zomboid isn't your typical zombie game nor your typical survival horror game. Project Zomboid is more of a simulator than an RPG. When playing, you'll get frustrated so many times before actually getting the hang of everything as for PZ is a roguelike, once your survivor dies, he/she is dead forever. No matter how far your progress or big your fortress. Many of which mistakes you'll make is mostly because you got too over your head, or just plain stupidity. But once you get how the game goes, you'll surely live to see another day, maybe months.To fully enjoy the game, one must stop looking at this game as a survival RPG, and more of a survival sim. With the word simulator being said, this means managing, scheduling and farming. Think of it as a mash-up of The Sims + Farmville + Old-School Zombies. You gather supplies and build a base of operations where you can store your supplies and gear or maybe start a farm for food supplies. You can also choose to be a nomad and move from place to place.Moreover on being a simulator, you have to take care of your survivors needs, hunger, boredom and health should be taken care of and maintained well regularly. You can't just sit all day and wait. As you build your base, the game adds a Farmville + Tower Defense vibe to it. Make sure though you don't go gathering supplies at night as it gets pretty dark and dangerous. With this scheduling is also important, make sure you make a to-do list for the day, patience pays in this game, some areas are so infested that you have to postpone your scheduled scanveging trip. Everything is important in this game, make sure to gather everything for maybe in the future you may need it. For an Early Access Game, Project Zomboid is already filled with hours and hours of fun gameplay, as everything in the main gameplay is there, surviving, scavenging, building. It is announced and on paper though that NPC's will be added to give the game a more immersive feel and dynamic events. I personally am looking forward for the NPC's, imagine with the amount of different kinds of gameplay all mashed together in one added with NPC's and dynamic events all together can put this game into another way crazier level.I totally recommend this game for everyone, especially for people who are up for a challenge.

								Project Zomboid is Incredibly fun!! If you want to experience a Zombie Apocalypse from the comfort of your own home, then this is the game for you! The Isometric style graphcs give the game a unique style and with great realism, Music, Multiplayer and an awesome mascot (Spiffo The Raccoon), this game is hard not to want tp play.If You havent heard of this game before and are curious as to what its about, then i fully recomend you get the game! Pleas be aware though, this game is still in active development and in purchasing the game you are willing to put up with bugs and glitches.Also if you are worried about future updates and the dreaded thought of having to pay each time an update is released, have no fear as all upcoming updates are free once the game is purchased meaning that you will get the finished game too (When it is released of course)So yeah, I cannot reccomend this game any more than I already have. It's definitely worth the buy and so I strongly urge that you try it out!!! =D			"

								A masterful take on the overused Zombie Apocalypse setting, this sandbox RPG breathes fresh life into a familar situation.The game is a labour of love from British studio The Indie Stone, as anyone who's followed the trials and tribulations of this game's development can tell you.(Google it if unsure. RockPaperShotgun had good coverage of it as well, it's quite the dramatic saga)Still in Early Access at time of posting this (8th Nov 2013) the game is already well polished and feature-laden. Don't be mistaken into thinking that just because it's still being developed that this is only half a game.There isn't much more that can be said about PZ without you actually playing it, but as luck would have it, there is a demo of this title also available directly through Steam so stop reading this, and go play Project Zomboid.Whether you end up buying the game is, obviously entirely up to you, but I think I know what you'll decide.Enjoy.. I do. :D			"

								One of the best zombie games I have played.  Despite some short comings (which they are still working on) this game is just fanstastic! ProsRealism without going over the top like some zombie games.Combat is really enjoyable once you get the hang of it.Why more fun with friends and can PVP.Can play sandox and customize from rather easy zombies to ""true zombies"" as they call it.Can do cool stuff like use a rope (or make one from sheet) to climb out a window if the house gets flooded with zombies.One of the best inventory system ever. (IMO) MIght take a bit getting used to but just make sense in terms of reaslism.ConsBecoming sick from zombie bite or sratch can be OP at times (like after 25 days and like 700 zombie kills one just scratches me and its game over.)  but as I pointed out you can changed that in sandbox if you dont like it.Missing stuff like cars (imo)Lack of other things to do such as more crafting like modding weapons more then just nailed bat and sawed off. Lack of firearm types (only pistol, shutgun, and varrmint rifle at the moment) I would like to see a couple types of each and even assault rifles SMGs, sniper rifles, you know. No in game map (like I cant find a map of my local area map at every gas station or store) but you can find one online. Most of the stuff in Cons are all stuff that very well will be fixed by full release, but as of now they are cons.  All in all I give this a 8 out of 10 which is damn good considering its still ""early access"".			"

								The game is an excellent simulator for anybody who doesn't mind a bit of hardcore permadeath. If you die in this game, it's game over. No second chances, no revivals. Straight back to the main menu. The game does a very good job of handling the things you would feel in a zombie apocolypse. Stress, Lack of sleep, Pain, Panic, the full monty. It uses a rather unique ""Moodles"" system. It has different tiers of emotions that you go through, for instance anxiety, onto stress, onto extreme stress, onto terrified. The game has it's problems. For example they use both a number system and a moodles system and it gets confusing. I don't mind the moodles system, in fact I admire the originality but I would say make the number stats system visible too.On the whole I really appreciate the game, it has brilliant developers, posting the oh-so amazing mondoids and with a sense of humor anyone'd die for.  Keep up the good work, dev team if you're reading this, and if you're thinking of buying the game, I say go for it as long as you don't mind a bit of hardcore. It has LOADS to do to keep you busy and theres constantly new features as well as the option to go back to the previous build. The price is great too, it's nice and compact and the animation is pretty darn good. Thanks for reading, Ickleslimer.			"

								This is possibly the best experience you will have with a post-apocalyspe genre. This game has so many features in its early version. There are hundreds of different items and foods. Tools, weapons, and materials can be used to create entire buildings up to several stories tall. There is a simple crafting system allowing you to use improvised weapons and tools as well. Carpentry, farming and cooking all of in-depth systems and recipes to get what you want and need to survive more successfully than your predecessors. You can get trapped on the second story of a building and be trapped by a ravenous horde controlling the first floor. You can choose to risk your health and life to jump out the window and make your dashing escape with or without injury...or you can rip off the curtains and tie them into a rope stable enough to lower yourself down and out of the infested building. Scavenging a local house you can open a closet to find a zombie who then rushes you and sinks his teeth into your neck. Even if you destroy him and survive you only have mere hours, possibly days before you turn. All this and more is in this game currently but don't be fooled. This is NOT a complete and perfect game. Several in-game items have no purpose even when they look useful and several items and weapons have placeholder icons or textures. Planned and promised features are aplenty such as vehicles and NPCs. This is a small developement team and will take its time making this game even greater than it already is turning out to be, be patient and you'll get a survival experience like no other.			"

								Has potential, but is a bit unforgiving with fiddly controls at the moment. There's also graphical slowdowns, but that's to be expected from an un-optimised alpha.Currently it feels like a game that needs you to play whilst having the wiki open on another screen. It's unclear as to how cooking works for example, and systems overall rely on an awful lot of trial and error, something you don't really have a lot of time for.Controls are also a bit awkward at the moment too, feeling unresponsive and arbitrary.But the potential is huge. I don't think there's a zombie survival sim out there with as much depth as this one's attempting.			"

								A zombie survival game that truly simulates a real zombie apocalypse without being mundane like other games. Pros-Hunger and thirst system that is deeper than most (Calories and fats)-Smart AI-Meaningful updates-Weekly Devblogs -Working multiplayer-Big variety of foods-Intricate food system-Deep character creation-Nice soundtrack-World is filled with lots of things to interact with (Trees to harvest for wood, foraging in the forest for berries, etc.)-Lots of things to do (Barricade safehouse, kill zombies to reduce the risk of an attack)Cons-Some items don't have a dedicated model, but they are already working on it for the next update-No npcs yet, since they would complete the game. (They are also working on this as well)-No cars yet (This as well)Overall this is my all time favorite zombie game. This game actually gives you loads of choices on how to survive. You actually need to secure a safehouse and then make sure zombies or bandits can't break in. You actually need to make sure your food is in a safe place or else it will rot. There are lots of things that relate to real life which is what makes this game so fun.			"

								This is a great game, especially considering that its still in Alpha!  There are still a lot of bugs and it runs slowly and crashes at times but it is reletively playable in it's current state. As long as you are prepared to cope with these I'd deffinitely recommend buying this game in Alpha or at least trying out the demo if you're unsure.Some areas I hope they work on or prioritise in future releases/fixes;- Improve controls and sneaking machanic (currently sneaking doesn't seem to work well).  It would be great to be able to hide as well (maybe in some containers like bins or wardrobes).- It would be nice to see even more weapons, features and items you can create in later releases.- While most of the music is excellent I also hope they remove the tracks with the woman wailing over the top (it just doesn't suit the game well.  The instrumental tracks are far better!).  - It would also be nice if they allowed you to turn the permadeath mode on/off in the options.- Improve speed of the game (sounds like this i currently in planning)- Add the ability to fix aging weapons- More explanation of the current ailments (although currently this can be found on their wiki - search google for 'Moodles')- I look forward to NPC additions and I hope you can use them for fighting or carrying more items.- Add items like carts you could build to transport lots of items long distances (i.e. if movig out to a country retreat).- Improve the perk system.  It'd be nice to add a few positive perks without having to add negative ones (a lot of which are quite severely impacting).			"

								First, try the demo. Did you like it? If so, then I suggest you consider the following things about Project Zomboid:1. This game is an ""Early Access Game"" that is under development and is not a finished product.2. Many parts of the game (survivors, fire, parts of the map) are a part of that unfinished product.3. The game is playable, but overall, does not offer much in the way of varied play style and things to do within the PZ world.4. The devs are promising that multiplayer will one day be a factor of gameplay, but it IS NOT currently in the game.5. This is a very, very bare bones sandbox, zombie survival game, but it is still enjoyable and playable!			"

								Another Early Access game, not finished, but well on it's way! I've been playing this about a while now, and honestly can't wait for this to be finished. Feeling similar to a Sims game(but doesn't play like it), your character has needs and wants that you must satisfy, along-side survival of the Zombie hordes. Also love the crafting system and having the ability to build up a nice fort. Co-op and Multi-player has been added, which will make this even MORE entertaining, imo! It's cheap and really fairly deep. Grab it if you can! Grab it on sale, if you see it, it's well worth the asking price! Plus.. MODS!!			"

								I don't normally review games, but Project Zomboid is an exceptional game. Even in it's early stages, the amount of things do to  in order to survive is incredible. It pay attention to things most games miss like the power or water cutting off. The Dev's are very vocal on the forums and are quick to respond to bugs etc. They are friendly and easy to approach if you have an idea or question. The multiplayer, even at this stage is incredibly fun as a group of you work together to try and salvage tins of food and make a stand in the bleak apocalypse. Get this game and get your friends to get it too.EDITSince my last review this game has come along leaps and bounds. The aiming system has had an overhaul, making the shooting on the game more sensible and feeling right for the kind of game it is. The stamina system has been implemented so you can no longer run cross map without even breaking a sweat. Now you have to decided whether you have the energy to take those 10 zombies blocking your way, or try to get past them. The medical system has been implemented, meaning even climbing through a broken window could leave you injured. The variety of injuries and appropriate treatments has added an extra depth to the game, which is always welcome. Falling from heights now causes fractures, limiting movement speed until a splint is on the wound and a few days of rest have passed. (Hope you have a lot of skill books to pass the time!)The erosion feature means that after a certain time has passed, the world will change. Roots and weeds will sprout through the highway, football fields will start to grow small trees, and the buildings you loot will become cracked and weatherworn. Combine this with an ever expanding map, new skills for survival such as Trapping, Foraging and a way to preserve certain foods, and the much anticipated NPC's (no ETA's!)In short, this game remains one of the best I have played in a very long time, and i have spent many many more hours than my steam profile shows. Whenever the chance arises, i buy a copy of this game for my friends and they get immediately sucked into the game. Buy a copy, or buy a 4 pack, dish a few out to your friends, and try to start a colony in the apocalypse that is Project Zomboid.			"

								This will be a bit long, so just bear with me.A truly great game. Rather unique and open-world. There are hardly any restrictions in the game, although you might want to keep your head clear of such reckless thoughts in this survival game, or else you'll likely get killed early-on. The longest I've survived was 11 days, which I still feel quite swell of. As others have said, PZ isn't just an average zombie game that gives you a shot-gun and has you blowing zombie brains all over with no actual back-story (Did I mention that?), it's an excellent zombie game that gives you choices and has your heart pacing to run from that monger zombie pack... That's every-where. I also have another unique thing to say.YOU CAN OPEN EVERY SINGLE DOOR IN THE GAME! VERY few games have this ability. Skyrim, Oblivion, Minecraft... And PZ are the only games I've ever seen like this. GTA 5/4/3/2/1, Watch Dogs, Brink, and a bunch of other still-cool games haven't implemented this. Not only can you open every door in the game, but you can barricade every door in the game, break down every door in the game, and look through every door in the game (As long as it has a window.)ALSO! Another unique feature! The entire damn thing is pre-loaded! While you're waiting a possibly grueling 5-10 minutes, you don't realize that you dun have to wait for any more loading! Well, except for a second or two as the map loads. No long pauses between frikkin' opening doors, no quick loads between 6-week-long ship rides, PZ never loads again (Save for the occasional quick map load.) I've never seen these two, simultaneously, oh wait Minecraft. Never mind.Now, lemme cover some of the ""features"" this game says it has.Sandbox zombie survival game. ---- No lie here. You can do a very many of things that allow this to be true. Check.Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep the lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the windows. ---- Lol yup. They didn't just implement a quick attention system where, if you come with-in a certain range, they 'see' you. No matter what. If you're sneaking, zombies will likely not detect you if they're more than 3 meters away. If you sneak up on a zombie trying to burglarize a posh house and steal it's meaty, succulent, intelligient riches, it won't likely notice you until you're fondling it, if you have the Graceful ability. Check.Vast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location) for you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out Blindcoder’s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ ---- Well, maybe. I haven't explored all coners of either map, although it didn't take long before I hit the ocean, and couldn't swim. NOOOO!!! Now I'll never earn my Blue Ribbon for Best Swimmer! Bah. No check.Use tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You can even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing wood and scavenging supplies. ---- Yes. Check, check, check, check, check, oh wait, really? Check. Scavenging for supplies is simply *Italicize*Essential with a capital ""E""*italicize* during the early part of the game. Later on, you can grow your own crops, but it'll likely take a little while before you can successfully build/find a secure, efficient, and sufficient garden/farm. If you don't, you'll die with-in the first hour. Check.Deal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness while trying to survive. ---- I have actually encountered all of these during my play time. And, I may be speaking out of my ♥♥♥♥, but they seemed to have an excellent system of seeing your character's needs. Say they've been damaged. You/They don't know exactly how much damage they've taken, nerve bundle for muscle tissue (Which is ridiculous. Do you know exactly how many veins/arteries have been punctured when you're shot in the arm? Yes? Well you too.), but you have an icon that gives you a generalization of how much they have. Not too precise, not too broad. Check.Day turns to night. The electricity falters. Hordes migrate. Winter draws in. Society is in freefall. Day turns to night with-in a reasonable time allotation (You can alter this in Sandbox mode.) I haven't actually first-handedly experienced the electricity being cut off, but then again, I've only survived for eleven days at max.  Hordes migrate. I dunno, maybe. Winter draws in. Again, only eleven days. Society is in free-fall. Aye. Possibly check, not sure.Farming, trapping, fishing, carpentry, character customization, skills and perks that develop based on what you do in-game. Check. 'Nuff said.Hundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems. Correct. They will group with each other in close packs if you accumulate enough. And if you have moderate-sized pack even, don't run. Hide. You can't run, but you can hide. (See what I did there?) Now trust me, you want a rather large sized house, break in through the window, lock your-self in the top floor, stay quiet for a good day, and hope for the best. Check.Proper zombies that don’t run. (Unless you tell them to in the sandbox menu). Check. You can alter the speed of the zombies in Sandbox mode, but normally they max their speed out at a solid jog.A ton of amazing atmospheric music tracks by the prodigy that is Zach Beever. Ohmigosh, yas. Zach made tracks that can make you scared, sad, bad-♥♥♥, excited, and maybe even... Happy?(?) I dunno, but check.Instant action ‘Last Stand’ mode, on top of our Sandbox and Survival mode. I dunno, haven't played Last Stand.Full, open and powerful Lua modding support. I'll just say ""Check"" for now.Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers. Yes. Check. Multiple player-created servers, but they seem to be a bit of a pain to enter.Over-all, horribly great game. It's addictive, yet it's the kind of addiction that you love to hate. In the right way. Also, another thing. You can-not save in the game. Well, when you log off, your progress is saved, but if you die, you die. You have to start all over again. 'Course, you can spawn a brand-new character near your last character's death place.9/10.Although, I still do have a few suggestions.1. In Sandbox mode, you should certainly be able to modify your character far beyond just the Survival perk pick. You should be able to alter their speed, strength, biological defenses, physcial defenses, mental defenses, and their ability to survive with/with-out certain things/mental states.2. You should be able to add as many survivors as wished in Sand-box mode.3. I kind of think the perk pick in Survivl should be a bit more lenient.4. This game should become big. Like, WoW-big.			"

Its from a bird's eye perspective, you can only see what's in front of you such as… if there is a zombie in front of you and you turnaround the zombie disappears until you look at it again. Its a hard game to get a hold of, there is no tutorial to tell you how to fight or do anything. There is no way you can “win” the game on the loading screen it tells you “This Is How You Die.” The only this in the game are zombies and you. They are close to finishing the NPC. When they add them I will start playing again but for now its gotten a little boring but I still recommend this game if you want a hard game to play. BUY THIS			"

								Project Zomboid is Incredibly fun!! If you want to experience a Zombie Apocalypse from the comfort of your own home, then this is the game for you! The Isometric style graphcs give the game a unique style and with great realism, Music, Multiplayer and an awesome mascot (Spiffo The Raccoon), this game is hard not to want tp play.If You havent heard of this game before and are curious as to what its about, then i fully recomend you get the game! Pleas be aware though, this game is still in active development and in purchasing the game you are willing to put up with bugs and glitches.Also if you are worried about future updates and the dreaded thought of having to pay each time an update is released, have no fear as all upcoming updates are free once the game is purchased meaning that you will get the finished game too (When it is released of course)So yeah, I cannot reccomend this game any more than I already have. It's definitely worth the buy and so I strongly urge that you try it out!!! =D			"

When they add them I will start playing again but for now its gotten a little boring but I still recommend this game if you want a hard game to play. BUY THIS			"

								This game is fun even for being in early access. Where this game really shines is with the multiplayer in the state its in right now the MP is a little hard for new people to figure out. With that aside what made me pick up the game is it reminded me of old school games like Roller Coaster tycoon with is asymmetric art style. witch is my favorite video game art style. Its from a bird's eye perspective, you can only see what's in front of you such as… if there is a zombie in front of you and you turnaround the zombie disappears until you look at it again. Its a hard game to get a hold of, there is no tutorial to tell you how to fight or do anything. There is no way you can “win” the game on the loading screen it tells you “This Is How You Die.” The only this in the game are zombies and you. They are close to finishing the NPC.

								Zombie apocalypse survival sim at it's finest. The game is still in early acces but every addition to it has been nothing but amazing. You have to scavenge around abandoned buildings for supplies to survive off and if you decide to, build your own fort in the midst of the zombie apocalypse. Incredibly immersive with its wound and crafting system that allow you to build things like spiked baseball bats and sawn-off shotguns. Despite it not really being a horror game exactly it still manages to get a good jump out of you when you're investigating houses and some zombie decided to hide in a corner you can't see it. The community of developers does an incredible job of rolling out updates and keeping the fanbase informed and there's even a modding communiy. Just get this game.			"

Early Access Review
								This will be a bit long, so just bear with me.A truly great game. Rather unique and open-world. There are hardly any restrictions in the game, although you might want to keep your head clear of such reckless thoughts in this survival game, or else you'll likely get killed early-on. The longest I've survived was 11 days, which I still feel quite swell of. As others have said, PZ isn't just an average zombie game that gives you a shot-gun and has you blowing zombie brains all over with no actual back-story (Did I mention that?), it's an excellent zombie game that gives you choices and has your heart pacing to run from that monger zombie pack... That's every-where. I also have another unique thing to say.YOU CAN OPEN EVERY SINGLE DOOR IN THE GAME! VERY few games have this ability. Skyrim, Oblivion, Minecraft... And PZ are the only games I've ever seen like this. GTA 5/4/3/2/1, Watch Dogs, Brink, and a bunch of other still-cool games haven't implemented this. Not only can you open every door in the game, but you can barricade every door in the game, break down every door in the game, and look through every door in the game (As long as it has a window.)ALSO! Another unique feature! The entire damn thing is pre-loaded! While you're waiting a possibly grueling 5-10 minutes, you don't realize that you dun have to wait for any more loading! Well, except for a second or two as the map loads. No long pauses between frikkin' opening doors, no quick loads between 6-week-long ship rides, PZ never loads again (Save for the occasional quick map load.) I've never seen these two, simultaneously, oh wait Minecraft. Never mind.Now, lemme cover some of the ""features"" this game says it has.Sandbox zombie survival game. ---- No lie here. You can do a very many of things that allow this to be true. Check.Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep the lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the windows. ---- Lol yup. They didn't just implement a quick attention system where, if you come with-in a certain range, they 'see' you. No matter what. If you're sneaking, zombies will likely not detect you if they're more than 3 meters away. If you sneak up on a zombie trying to burglarize a posh house and steal it's meaty, succulent, intelligient riches, it won't likely notice you until you're fondling it, if you have the Graceful ability. Check.Vast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location) for you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out Blindcoder’s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ ---- Well, maybe. I haven't explored all coners of either map, although it didn't take long before I hit the ocean, and couldn't swim. NOOOO!!! Now I'll never earn my Blue Ribbon for Best Swimmer! Bah. No check.Use tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You can even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing wood and scavenging supplies. ---- Yes. Check, check, check, check, check, oh wait, really? Check. Scavenging for supplies is simply *Italicize*Essential with a capital ""E""*italicize* during the early part of the game. Later on, you can grow your own crops, but it'll likely take a little while before you can successfully build/find a secure, efficient, and sufficient garden/farm. If you don't, you'll die with-in the first hour. Check.Deal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness while trying to survive. ---- I have actually encountered all of these during my play time. And, I may be speaking out of my ♥♥♥♥, but they seemed to have an excellent system of seeing your character's needs. Say they've been damaged. You/They don't know exactly how much damage they've taken, nerve bundle for muscle tissue (Which is ridiculous. Do you know exactly how many veins/arteries have been punctured when you're shot in the arm? Yes? Well you too.), but you have an icon that gives you a generalization of how much they have. Not too precise, not too broad. Check.Day turns to night. The electricity falters. Hordes migrate. Winter draws in. Society is in freefall. Day turns to night with-in a reasonable time allotation (You can alter this in Sandbox mode.) I haven't actually first-handedly experienced the electricity being cut off, but then again, I've only survived for eleven days at max.  Hordes migrate. I dunno, maybe. Winter draws in. Again, only eleven days. Society is in free-fall. Aye. Possibly check, not sure.Farming, trapping, fishing, carpentry, character customization, skills and perks that develop based on what you do in-game. Check. 'Nuff said.Hundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems. Correct. They will group with each other in close packs if you accumulate enough. And if you have moderate-sized pack even, don't run. Hide. You can't run, but you can hide. (See what I did there?) Now trust me, you want a rather large sized house, break in through the window, lock your-self in the top floor, stay quiet for a good day, and hope for the best. Check.Proper zombies that don’t run. (Unless you tell them to in the sandbox menu). Check. You can alter the speed of the zombies in Sandbox mode, but normally they max their speed out at a solid jog.A ton of amazing atmospheric music tracks by the prodigy that is Zach Beever. Ohmigosh, yas. Zach made tracks that can make you scared, sad, bad-♥♥♥, excited, and maybe even... Happy?(?) I dunno, but check.Instant action ‘Last Stand’ mode, on top of our Sandbox and Survival mode. I dunno, haven't played Last Stand.Full, open and powerful Lua modding support. I'll just say ""Check"" for now.Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers. Yes. Check. Multiple player-created servers, but they seem to be a bit of a pain to enter.Over-all, horribly great game. It's addictive, yet it's the kind of addiction that you love to hate. In the right way. Also, another thing. You can-not save in the game. Well, when you log off, your progress is saved, but if you die, you die. You have to start all over again. 'Course, you can spawn a brand-new character near your last character's death place.9/10.Although, I still do have a few suggestions.1. In Sandbox mode, you should certainly be able to modify your character far beyond just the Survival perk pick. You should be able to alter their speed, strength, biological defenses, physcial defenses, mental defenses, and their ability to survive with/with-out certain things/mental states.2. You should be able to add as many survivors as wished in Sand-box mode.3. I kind of think the perk pick in Survivl should be a bit more lenient.4. This game should become big. Like, WoW-big.			"

								This is by far one of my most favorite games to date! It blends the minutia of management of supplies with the frantic running, scavenging and fighting of a great action game.  It has fun, believable crafting and RPG elements, with the ability to really customize your experience. You can modify the difficulty in various ways from rarity of spawns, type or speed of zombies, what kind of weather, how long the day is, etc.  Also, this game is amazingly fun and easy to modify. As a modder myself, I can attest, with a little trial and error you can get the hang of the lua coding fairly easily. The modding and forum community is over at the Indie Stone forums is fantastic, there are incredible mods already (some of which the dev have fully implemented in the game like the Erosion mod). On that same note, the Devs are responsive and willing to take and respond to criticism/suggestions. Also, there are weekly progress updates so you don't have to worry about the game being abandoned by the devs.So, moral of the story, BUY THIS GAME. I have played many other zombie games (which I loved) like Left 4 Dead, State of Decay, etc. but this one tops the list by a long shot.			"

								Great game, very in depth and no serious gamebreaking bugs encountered so far, game also saves 99% of the time if it does crash so its unlikely that you will lose progress. Generally a very good and challenging game. Main criticism would be the lack of use for some items and general little balances need doing here and there. But that is to be expected with the game being in alpha stages of development, with splitscreen and multiplayer, planned to be added in the future, this game will be amazing.			"

								It is no secret that these days games' graphic and phisics.. a lot of stuffs are great. But this game reminds me of a time when I first played nethack, the original of dungeon crawl, I noticed that instead of worse graphic I could do a lot of things in the game. Also Project Zomboid is. You have to find food, water, house to live. Actually, this game is not easy! But you will really feel attract in this game! I think that there are a lot of things other games are missing but this game has. The most important thing is that the making process of this game is not finished. I can not wait :-).

								Amazing game. If u liked the feel of the old school Ultima Online...Its like that...with zombies. lolLots of Depth. Tons to do ( or more like worry bout) Infections, water, medical problems, food, bandits, supplies, shelter, and oh ya... Zombies.Multiplayer is a blast. Base Building is fun!Zombies hide in houses and behind doors and in bathrooms. So u gotta clear a house throughly before bedding down! Nerve Wracking. Worth every penny. The developers are eager and involved. They release patches almost weekly.Vehicles are planned very soon and so are intelligent AI NPCS!Only con I have about the game is the night time in houses are verrrry dark ( like they should be ) But I just wish they had a gamma or brightness slider.Game is kinda intimidating at first because of the meticulousness of the controls and abilities. The developers are really sticklers for the details! (which i like ) But that also means theres a bit of learning curve to over come first. I suggest maybe watching youtube videos / tutorials to help get started. But after you learn the keys....Its no problem!BUY IT!			"

								We all come across a game which seems promising but once you purchase it, its the complete different. Sometimes we purchase games that are fun, but after hours of playing you loose your feel for the game. We sometimes purchase games that are hard to run without a beefy computer. Those are some of the most painful ways a passionate gamer experiences more than just once. If you do read the reviews and do your research on that game then you might feel comfident that the game is worth the purchase and you hope it won't get dry after the first week of owning the game. If you're reading this review, congratulations!PROJECT ZOMBOIDThis game is very unique from the millions of apocalyptic games. First of all its a simulator, There aren't a lot of great simulators for the apocalypse. Well most of them aren't still in EARLY development, Most of them are released as they are and don't update as frequently and have new content, but Project Zomboid does. New patches release adding new mechanics, bug fixes, customization, and so much more thats just one of the greatest aspects of Project Zomboid.Once you launch Project Zomboid you're greeted with an amazing soundtrack. If you don't believe me launch it for yourself! At the main menu you're shown these catigories "" Mods, Survival, Sandbox, Laststand "" and in the background it shows a heartwarming illustration of what appears to be a man hugging his sick wife. In these catigories you can play Survival, Sandbox or Laststand.SURVIVAL. In survival you get to choose the two maps created so far, make your character and traits your character has and what their career was before the apocalypse struck.SANDBOX. In sandbox you get the choice to make the world how you'd like it to be. You can change the way zombies see, hear, and smell. You can change how often loot spawns, the season you start in, how long the water and electricity will shut off etc. . . LASTSTAND. In laststand you instantly spawn in a house with a crate carrying weapons to defend yourself. You takedown the hordes until they break in and take you down. There is a timer so you can see how long you survived which makes it fun to challenge yourself or brag to your friends!For the price Project Zomboid is right now I would call it a steal! 15 US dollars for a game as it is now plus all the updates and patches coming, this Indie game could definitly go for more. You can't beat the fact it goes on sale every now and then for even less!This is how you died.PROJECT ZOMBOID			"

Early Access Review
								Opinion:Its a great game if you are the fan of a zombie survival genre. It has a steep learning curve which will get you killed in your early lives playing it. You ever wanted to setup a base at a Gas Station - now you can. You can establish a base anywhere from a self built hut in the forest to a diner off the freeway, some buildings of course are more practical for survival (houses,motels etc). Just remember you need a place with multiple exits and thats has the basic survival aspects. The game itself looks exremely good it doesn't need good graphics I personally feel that it would ruin the atmosphere. But the lighting and the vision effect is a nice touch to deepen the atmosphere. I'd say its a must buy - but TRY THE DEMO.As for multiplayer, its a great experience if you team up with friends. You have to learn how to cope when everywhere you loot has already been scavenged. I remember raiding a house with a kitchen knife and finding a group of dead people on the second floor in a closet. They were loaded with supplies - I just got lucky but Multiplayer doesn't summarise the game up in hole as its mostly a single player game and regardless on which mode you play on you'll always find it tense!Survival is key as you can make a character very skilled only to die from something as silly as eating off meat. So try to establish a base and get non perishable food at first, eat all the perishables early on. Try to get a farm setup and a water source, as you'll need it once the Water + Electricity runs out which is random (unless your in sandbox).Edit,Got a lot better recently with more content and more playability. Animations soon which'll change the gameplay completely.			"

								Very worthy game for the price it currently holds, which you never know could end up increasing when the early acess stage is completed. Why do this? first, watch the first video explaining the elements of the game, Now. This game goes very deep when it comes to way to survive and die. You can die by many accounts, the most common being eaten by a zombie. However there are ways to survive out in the wild with hunting and camping ( as stated in the video ) they are not lying! it is all possible for only $15 and they could increase the price if they really wanted to. Try the demo and put a little bit of thought in to it. the rest is up to you.			"

								Probably one of the best survival games I've played, period. I've played it since the early days on Desura, and it's grown immensely since then. It's also one of a small number of Early Access games I'll actually endorse playing in an unfinished state.Yeah, it's another zombie game, but it's explored routes that other zombie survival games have barely even considered. Sleep, hunger, and thirst are something you have to watch for obviously, yes, but at the same time there's also fear, pain, depression, boredom, sickness, even temperature is taken into consideration. And everything will affect your character in some way.It has one of the most comprehensive damage systems I've ever seen. Rather than just ""You've taken damage! Don't let your health hit 0!"", there's more to it than that. Scratches, bites, fractures, burns, infections, and bleeding can occur in all of your limbs, requiring you to take appropriate action to treat. One time I had to barricade myself in a room to perform extensive treatment; I had a deep wound in my arm from climbing in through a broken window, complete with a glass shard stuck in my character's arm. I had to remove the glass shard with tweezers, disinfect the wound, stitch it, bandage it, and keep an eye on it in case the bandage became dirty. And while it wasn't necessary, I sterilized the bandage while I was at it. Healing is something that takes place over time- unlike other games where you heal instantaneously, you'll only get better if you take care of your injuries and rest. They can even become infected if you don't take proper care of them. It's a level of realism that I've legitimately never seen in another game, and I appreciate that they took the time to implement it.One thing I like is that zombies are actually a threat in this game; one or two might not be so bad if you're properly armed, but a horde busting down a door when you're in a tight hallway is beyond horrifying. You can't just be a super zombie slayer like Tallahassee from Zombieland or any character from The Walking Dead; you have to be careful, observant, and patient. Busting through a door without any regard to what may be on the other side could be harmless... or you could walk straight into a dozen zombies that have already swarmed you before you can react. And once a group of zombies has you, you're done for. GG. Been nice knowing you.Most of all though, Project Zomboid understands what it means to be a survival game. While there is multiplayer as well as single player, it's not just a PvP manhunt disguised as a surival game like DayZ. PvP does exist, but even if you are in multiplayer, more often than not you have other concerns as opposed to hunting down other players for their food (though it is possible.) It places PvE first and foremost- it's you against the world, and the world is full of dead things. And depression, and the lack of food, and houses with alarms to alert said dead things, and uncertainty, and many other things out to ruin your day and get you killed. PvP is merely an additional feature in multiplayer, and far from required.There's so many things I could go into about this game and why it's one of the best survival games out there. Best suggestion I can give is to play it for yourself. If you're a fan of survival games, this is probably one of the most intense survival games you'll find- good enough to rival Don't Starve [Together], and that's saying something, as Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on Steam.

PvP is merely an additional feature in multiplayer, and far from required.There's so many things I could go into about this game and why it's one of the best survival games out there. Best suggestion I can give is to play it for yourself. If you're a fan of survival games, this is probably one of the most intense survival games you'll find- good enough to rival Don't Starve [Together], and that's saying something, as Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on Steam.

								This game will show you an infinitely possible world in an unforgiving way that makes everything you do dangerous regardless of how long you've been alive.TL;DR: 9/10 - Best zombie survival sim out there today.Zomboid is the type of game that might take a little bit of getting used to if you haven't played something like pokemon. IT will get even harder to get used to if you haven't thought about survival situations in your life. The day I realized I loved Zomboid is when I decided to try and craft something, without knowing the recipe, a molotov cocktail. I drank a bottle of whiskey, and ripped up a sheet, I then tried pouring a bottle of whiskey on the sheet, it didn't work. A couple of game days later I came across a gas can, I substituted the whiskey for gas, and 'lo and behold a molotov was created. These are the kind of possibilities that will keep you coming back forever. Everything makes sense.There are no shortage of ""oh ♥♥♥♥ I better drink some bleach because I'm about to turn in to a zombie"" moments, or ""The house is filled with zombies, I'm stuck in a second floor bedroom, I'm going to have to risk breaking my legs jumping out the 2nd story window"". The zombies are dangerous, they can and will kill you in some of the most miserable ways. Sometimes it is as simple as looking through the window before you break in to a house to prevent a surprise attack from a hole filled friend. Shooting a gun is always dangerous and rarely can you take on a horde on your own, oh yeah this game is multiplayer too...With so much content it is hard to believe a game beyond early access and with things like NPC's (really well done) and offline co-op on the way, there is an exciting future to zomboid.

								So I played this game from a family-shared account  becuase the name cought my eye. but then i couldno stop not becuase it had terribly innovative gameplay or becuase it was realistic (its not but thats okay) but becuase the audio was bueatyful it was so perfect for the game like for example suppose you were puttering about in your safehouse there would be no audio but if you turned around and there was a zombie it would make a startleing sound so as to make a OH MY GOSH type panic effect  and then if you then ran from that zombie and started searching a random house for a wepon while it started to break down your door it would play this really dramatic music(witch fits the mood perfectley) then suppose it broke down the door it would transiton the music(to a more urgent type tune) so perfectley that you dont lose any of that inital OH MY GOSH panic effect effect. All of this is done so well that the game sterts to transmit the emotion of the game.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS DONE SO WELL EVER.I also really like the system for makeing your charcter the way the starting buffs/debuffs is really good and it is really big and well drawn out map(espicaly for a handmade map)			"

Simply put, the best survival game out there!If you opt into the IWBUMS you get very frequent updates, the current build in testing has a damn huge changelist with dozens of community-suggestions.One of the Devs is now improving the MP-administration a great deal, so many new possibilities like seeing the traits and skills of players. More and more stuff is added to the MP currently, PvP zones and what not.Great modding-support and a well working multiplayer with dedicated server support! It recently got a completely new look which makes it even more stunning.Awesome game!			"

								Have you ever seen the Walking Dead? Most of you have. Let me say, if you think you could survive better than some of the characters in the walking dead, this game is your challenge. You have to fight numerous zombies, I have yet to have a save where i have not killed one zombie. You have to scavenge through the city trying to be unoticed the mass amounts of hordes of zombies and find what little food there is left. Eventually the zombies will find your safehouse, so you need to make defenses. you need to barricade your windows, build walls, and maybe build more rooms and crates for storage. eventually, the city will run out of food, so you need to either get the supplies to go fishing, or trap mice and rats and make a campfire to cook them. This game is the real deal. This will test your survivability. This is your chance to prove you can do it. This is the end.---OLD REVIEW:If you like zombie games, and games that require a little bit of strategy and skill, this is the game for you. at first when i saw this game, and i admit, i thought it was stupid. My best friend had showed it to me, and my first thoughts were that its stupid. i watched him play it anyway because i like to give games a chance. as i saw all of the techniques he used, it started to change my mind a little bit.  then i saw that in this game, you can barricade windows, build walls and barrels to collect rain in for when the water goes out, and saw that you can even farm food and cook food like steak, chicken, and meat patties, my opinion completley changed. This, is probably the most realistic zombie game that i have ever seen and/or played. this game will very soonly have multiplayer and NPC's. I have played this for 25 hrs. on steam record and i am not even close to bored with it. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME.-UPDATE 12/7/2014i've had this game for almost a year now, and i am still very happy with my purchase. this game is slow paced, and i took about a 4 month break from it because i got some other games that i was interested in, and to be honest, i got bored of this game. after a few updates had come out for the game, including a multiplayer update, (which i play on public servers a lot) and some graphic changes, including 3D models that look amazing, FPS optimization, and the ability to see if things are in shelves (which sounds like nothing, but before everything looked empty even if you had like 24 items on it) i came back to this game yesterday, and put about 15 hours into it since. This game is very fun, especially if you get a nice safehouse running with reinforced walls and such. well, thanks for reading my review, if you have any questions, let me know by commenting, and i will do my best to respond ASAP! Have a good day, and i hope that if you choose to purchase this game, you get many hours out of it!			"

Early Access Review
								I originally reviewed this game back in 2013, but the current state of reviews for it, have irritated me to no end. So, I have decided to update my review. Project Zomboid, is perhaps the single game that does 'zombie survival' right. It has atmosphere, character and most importantly, a dedicated team behind it. The survival aspect, your character needs to eat, drink and sleep. Deal with depression, boredom, panic and illness. All of this is on top of the obvious, dealing with the zombies. Whilst nearly everything in this game is customisable, from number of zombies, to their cognition, hearing and sight, to experience rate, custom maps and even how fruitful farming or foraging can be. The game has several presets, for different levels of gamers. With 'Survival' being the accepted norm. In this mode, zombie mortality rate is at something along the lines of 96% mortality rate from bites, and 25% from scratches. Now, this is only magnified, by the fact you can have literally hundreds, if not thousands of zombies on screen at once, should you have the settings set to do so. This game forces you to learn how to play and survive. It's not a casual 'I'll run around with a shotgun and take out hundreds of zombies at a time'. This is a survival game, truly. Without mods, your character starts as an 'average joe'. With no specific skill set, unless a career has been chosen. This game has one of the most well done trait/perk systems I have seen, since the original Fallout games. This gives a rich and rewarding feeling, to have survived long enough to learn how to build and operate machinery, houses and farms. It also gives a much larger sense of profound loss, when you finally succumb to anything in the world. From lack of food, to fever, to the hundreds of zombies that are attracted to sound and sight. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, I love it, and 90% of the reviews agree with me. You can't go wrong with this game.This brings me nicely on to my next point, please don't be put off by the other recent reviews, slating the dev team behind this for 'slow updates'. They have gotten more abuse than I can comprehend, from this angle. They have continued to update and support this game to the best of their ability, for years. The dev team consists of only six people, up from four in previous years. In this time, they have updated the graphics - twice, adding in 3D models whereas it was a game consisting of sprites (Still an option you can revert to, in the game settings.) and then they quietly worked on double definition models, behind the scenes. They are currently working on an animation system, which has taken a while, granted, but will magnify the gameplay threefold. This game, is more than worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favour, and buy this amazing game, you really can't go wrong. TL;DR, This game is amazing. Buy it.			"

								Hey everyone... I'm a big fan of zombies and I heard about Project Zomboid on a website and it sounded really appealing to me. I figured after finding it on Steam I'd try out the demo.... after dodging some zombies , opening the door to a gun shop and being confronted with the first zombie I ever fought I was hooked... Since then I`ve bought the game and played it the last couple of days, and it`s amazing.... the zombies can be avoided if you remain unseen and unheard but if one sees you its best to fight him rather than run because although you can out-run them, you``ll have a horde following you if you do....There`s so much you can do in the game that I haven`t done yet, I plan on collecting supplies and building a base in the woods away from the city eventually... My only advice is to keep playing this game, practise different techniques until you find what works best for you, and if you find it too hard play it in Sandbox mode which allows you to set up the setting to low population zombies (which still is a lot), Etc.This game has so much to offer, you can honestly feel the experience of survival in this zombie apacolypse, and its not even the finished result yet, in my opinion it`s definitely stable enough to play, has multiplayer option and one day will have a lot more than it does now including hunting, driving and looting cars, etc.If you`re thinking about buying this game play the demo, and if you`re intrigued, buy it while it`s still early access, it`ll be worth a lot more in the future... its a good deal, you get updated everytime they add something even after buying the game, and it runs on low requirements computers as long as it has a decent graphics card, 1-2 gb ram and the hard drive space required, I definitely recommend it.

Early Access Review
								UPDATED: 29/06/14I've come back to this game again recently after taking a 6-month break or so (I find this is the best way to enjoy Early Access games) and I feel like it's improved markedly since my last review.Project Zomboid is best described as 'DayZ meets classic Fallout' - if that's something that appeals to you (and it should!), then I can recommend this game wholeheartedly. In previous incarnations, the game was undeniably promising but very rough round the edges, meaning the absorbing battle against the environment and the monsters that inhabit it was punctuated with jarring bugs and glitches like falling through stairs, walking straight through walls and so on.Many of the more troublesome gremlins have been zapped, and while there are still a few that pop up from time to time, the game is a lot less likely to do something utterly bizarre, and a lot more likely to kill you with cold, hard logic and survival elements.The developers have handled the release fairly well, providing steady and worthwhile updates whilst continuing to listen to their community and prioritising the issues that matter most to the fans (stability and the addition of multiplayer). This has resulted in a game that I feel a lot more players would consider 'truly' playable and could sink many hours into, even in its current state.There IS still a long way to go - NPCs seem like they're still a way off, and it's odd to see entire towns almost perfectly modelled, but without a single car in sight - wrecked or otherwise. These things will no doubt be sorted in time - the developers have proven over the past 12 months on Steam that they are happy to take their time working on things until they're ready rather than risking adding things too early and bringing in a host of bugs and issues.Overall:Fun?: YesAny Game-Breaking Issues?: Not really game-breaking, but it's not finished.Worth the Price of Admission?: Yes. ============================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:First things first - I've been playing Project Zomboid since I first learned about it on Steam Greenlight way back when it was one of the flagship titles, so obviously the game-time in Steam doesn't really reflect that. Just for disclosure there. :)Anyway, onto the game, and the first question you're going to want to know is 'is it worth it?'And annoyingly, it's kind of difficult to answer right now. Let's get this out of the way right now - in its CURRENT STATE, Zomboid is bug-riddled and missing many key features. If you're buying it right now (November 2013), you need to understand that this is absolutely an Alpha - entire chunks of the game simply aren't there right now, in particular NPCs.It's also clunky to control, has a learning curve that's almost Dwarf Fortress-esque in its steepness, and occasionally difficult to navigate.But the one thing that keeps me coming back and that convinced me to part with my money in the first place is the potential. It's not the 'War Z' potential where the devs are making grand promises with absolutely no idea how on earth they're going to keep them - the basics are in there: the map is freaking enormous, and it's gloriously detailed. The zombie behaviour is excellent - individually they're not a threat, but make a loud noise or stumble into a horde and you're in a whole WORLD of trouble. The parts of the game that are complete show an attention to detail and that little spark of inspiration that give the player confidence that whatever's being promised/worked on is going to arrive, and when it does, it'll be awesome.So to conclude, although it's often banded about these days, it's more true than most in the case of Project Zomboid - when you hand over your £9.99 (or regional equivalent, I guess!), you're buying the game it's GOING to be, not the game it is right now. If you're not convinced that this is a gamble worth taking, you might be better off waiting six months for the game to take a little more shape, but you should be aware that the price will likely creep up again slightly, as the developers have confirmed that they want to reward early adopters by offering it to them for less than 'full price', whatever that may end up being.Fun to Play?: YesAny Gamebreaking issues?: LotsWorth the admission price?: Depends on your patience.

								Project Zomboid: The true meaning of Zombie Survival. For WAY too long, companies has been making Zombie Shooters, and calling them Zombie ""Survival"" games. DayZ might be TRYING to bring the Zombie Survival up from the grave (Zombie pun, not intended) But the zombies...Well, they arent really a threat.Project Zomboid is something COMEPLETELY different though. In this game (Still in ""early"" development) You don't need to just make sure that you eat and drink. In this you need to make sure you: Don't get infected, Have a safe house, don't get robbed by other survivors (WIP), Don't get addicted to stuff like Cigarettes and Alchohol and MUCH much more.This game has a very interesting Combat system. I like it alot, but I still think it could be improved a little. For example, when ""Sneaking"" you need to hold down the same button as you need to when you get ready to attack. Therefore, I have many times accidentally swung at a door, instead of opening it.All in all, Its a GREAT game. Go check out the demo. 8/10			"

								The openended nature of this game makes it special. You can use the sandbox feature to create the zombie survival mode of your choice. Want to slowly build a fortress to keep back George Romero style hordes then you can. If you'd rather create d shortsighted, morbidly obese character and see how many seconds you can last against a rush of 28 days later zeds then that's also an option. The gameplay is solid. The ""early access"" tag conceals the fact that there's already a strong game here. The developers are active and committed and seem to be happy to let the community influence the direction that this game develops. PZ is good. Has potential to be great			"

								This game, which is inspired by max brooks book is really enjoyable in singleplayer, but in co-op with 3 friends it shows its flaws. For early acces, the game is deep and exciting but on the other hand it has few bugs as a movement of zombies (they sometimes stop and freeze around obstacles) and gunshots (which triggers zombie migration) goes in loops from time to time. Game itself contains everything what you can expect from this genre: making a shelter, scavenging supplies, battling a huge numbers of zombies and progress of your character. I´m really looking forward to next updates which adds more content and make the game even better. And a little advice for newbies: when you find a shotgun, never shoot with it near any city (it´s suicide).			"

Confusing, I know, but despite my recommendation I do think that the game is a very fun game.The gameplay is very realistic and tense and you can really get into the role of your character. Being chased down by zombies and having to manage food, be careful you don't make noise, build up a relatively safe space if you choose to.. These things are really fun and deliver on that zombie survival fantasy. The skill system is another mechanic that I liked the sound of, but due to my limited experience with that I don't want to talk about it too much since I feel that I haven't used it enough to actually say whether it is a good addition or not. What I'm saying is, however, that if you come to this game looking for a realistic and customizable zombie survival game, that's what you're going to get. There's no smoke and mirrors here.Despite my hours, I played this a lot before it was actually on steam so I do know what I'm talking about. I really like this game but my problem is that. as others have said, after years and years of waiting, very little of substance has been added to the game. Believe me, I played this game back when it had much worse graphics, and honestly I felt like it had more going on back then. There's newer and better features, but it's weird. The game just felt like more was happening AROUND you, whereas now it feels woefully dead, and that wasn't a pun.I could only recommend this game to newcomers if they think that they could get a lot of time out of this or the multiplayer, but until they get a move on and actually begin to add something of substance such as NPCs or a campaign to follow, you'll just eventually find yourself getting bored once you've done everything, and doing everything won't take very long once you get the hang of the mechanics. Now, the problem is - and I'm going to be honest and unbiased as much as I can -  the developers share very little about the additions i talked about above. They outright refuse to mention NPCs, but the reaon that they have done this is that the community would complain whenever they were mentioned about how they weren't done yet. I can sympathize with this, as I have also made far smaller projects, usually for only a few people, and people complaining that things aren't done is not only upsetting but at times outright demotivating. I respect their decision to not talk about NPCs until they are close to release, but this decision has, unfortunately, meant that anyone following the game and hoping that one day the money they invested into the game at the very start will eventually result in something that they can continue playing because, as I said, once you've done everything... despite the game being very fun, there's just nothing to keep you playing.In short: Would I recommend this game in its current state? No, but it is a GOOD game. Will I recommend this game in the future? Almost certainly, provided that the features that were promised years ago do come out. And I still hold hope that they eventually will. If and when they do deliver on those features, I will update this review after I feel that I have played the game for long enough to accurately judge the game. I am only posting THIS review to inform potential buyers of what they are going to receive if they buy RIGHT NOW. If you don't like the game as it is now, don't buy it hoping that it will get better. I honestly can't tell you that it will after how long i've waited.			"

								Even though this game is in early access, it's very good in terms of what it has and what it's improving on. You are guaranteed to die in this game, but you're gonna have the time of your life doing it. You can survive by looting houses, growing your own food, building a base... this game has it all, and it's in the process of adding vehicles, NPC survivors, and more. Can't wait to see what you come up with next, Indie Stone.Now, I have to get back to being a silverware ninja. 10/10			"

								This game, which is inspired by max brooks book is really enjoyable in singleplayer, but in co-op with 3 friends it shows its flaws. For early acces, the game is deep and exciting but on the other hand it has few bugs as a movement of zombies (they sometimes stop and freeze around obstacles) and gunshots (which triggers zombie migration) goes in loops from time to time. Game itself contains everything what you can expect from this genre: making a shelter, scavenging supplies, battling a huge numbers of zombies and progress of your character. I´m really looking forward to next updates which adds more content and make the game even better. And a little advice for newbies: when you find a shotgun, never shoot with it near any city (it´s suicide).			"

								While I could say how sprawling the ambition of the developers are and how good their work is so far, i'm just going to let some other reviewer talk about it, I mean really it's been a year or two, someone is bound to already have done it. But for the words by me, I suggest buying it at a later date, assuming that the pirates didn't drain the developers wallet dry. The game was just recently upgraded with a server browsing list and some mod support, so it's definitly more ripe and shinier than what it first started out. But if you're impatient, by all means, buy it! You'll be supporting the devs and it'll keep'em working.			"

Early Access Review
								Me and my girlfriend.She died three times in our last run, the third time, it was my fault.She had been in the bed for a week or so, recovering from a fever that fell upon her after she was scratched while scavenging. While watering her farm, I left the oven unattended, and it started a fire, quickly burning all our supplies, the house, me, her, and our hearts. I kept telling her she was going to make it, she burned alive in the end.This next run though, we started off great. We found a digital watch so now we can tell what time it is without looking at the sun, we found and moved a generator for when the electricity is cut off, and we have learned how to capitalize on our strengths and weaknesses. We know food will eventually run out, so we are trying to find fertilizer for the farm. On our latest scavenge, I asked if we could go past the Electronics Store, she agreed. We're usually a bit more vigilant, and we have an escape route etc, yet this time, after dodging a ton of zombies just to get to the store, when the alarm went off, we had no plan, and we just ran inside. We quickly checked for a way out on the other side, but that whole room was covered with windows, and the zombies are coming from every direction. With the siren still ringing, we dove into a bathroom in a hallway, knowing we will at least have enough water if the zombies 'decide' to siege us. On that note, we both have an apple and we can share one bowl of rice and vegetables. She wields a battered baseball bat, I'm wielding a worn out golfclub. This doesn't look good.- GAME PAUSED -She has to go to sleep irl. She says it is a good moment for a cliffhanger.Me and my girlfriend. 10/10			"

								I've followed the progress of this game for roughly two years now and I must say I LOVE this game. When I was a kid I literally dreamed about having a game like this and now I do. Yes, there have been some set backs in it's progress along the way but even in Early Access this game is AMAZING and the developers are still adding features. HUGE map, great crafting system, hundreds of buildings to fortify and make your own as well as plenty Zed to kill and burn. This game isn't just hands down my favorite indie game, it's one of my favorite games of all time. I recommend this game to anyone who loves base-building, city-looting, zombie-killing fun. 11/10 Would accidently burn down the school again			"

								I play this game mostly co-op with my brother, his wife and our friend. Sitting in the basement on the couch playing zomboid is a wonderful experience. Probably one of the best on steam right now for couch co-op. Even though it still has some fleshing out that will be done, what is there is incredible. The game has had constant updates since I first started playing over 2 years ago on desura. The developers communicate with the community, and give awesome updates on upcoming plans and features every monday in the mondoid blog.Can not recommend the game more to people who are looking for a different kind of zombie game.

								So... I've played this game for an entire weekend.Its not fun.It's not even close to realistic.You will rarely feel a sense of accomplishment.Yes, you're going to die.  Pretty much the zombie virus killed all the strongest and from what I can tell, no matter what career path you choose, you were the WORST at it... oh yeah, and you're one of the last alive, so you're really one of the weakest humans... ever.If you're looking for a hard game, this definitely is difficult, but it's difficult like probabilities and statistics are hard.  It's not exciting, it's zombie apocalypse for masochists version of Minecraft, at best.  At worst, it's a slow, boring slog through hordes of zombies.I'm going to give it some more chance... but mostly because I just kinda want to finish building as close to a ""fortress"" home as I can and max out all skills, if possible.

Until lagging zombies magically ate him. Good times. The game is great, but not without its bugs. The problem now is the same problems that everyone else is complainging about. Progress is at a stand still. I don't want some stupid nutrition systms I want the AI you promised me 2 years ago. There's so much they promise to add and literally almost none of it has been implemented. I'll change my review when I see good change.			"

								i bought this game in freshman year of highschool and eargerly awaited the reveal of npcs. Im now in my senior year and still nothing. actually you arent even allowed to mention npcs on the forms because apparently the developers get mad and wont work on it for a little amount of time. the developpment is so slow. the game is good dont get me wrong but after a while youll be so bored youll question while you bought it. The game is so messed up on terms of placement like the tile system is what im taking about where you have to click on a tile to use the items in it that sometimes i would have incomplete houses because i couldnt select it. Just dont buy the game. maybe it will get the developers to understand that they shouldnt take 6 years to get it done and give us a little update every 4 months. and im saying 6 years because before it was on steam it was on desuara. and if you think im kidding about any of this then buy the game and see how long it takes for them to release an update. all those little update things below the game are just them talking about what theyre doing but it will take months or even years before they realese npcs or cars or even new guns or new pixels.  you cant wear armor in the game, you cant see your backpack. theres only two versions of shirts. vest or sweater.

								One of the best survival games out there. It's a fantastic game as-is and definitely worth the price, and yet the potential of this game is vast. Don't be deterred by the dated graphics of project zomboid. What it lacks in graphic definition it easily makes up for in gameplay and content. In fact I consider the simple graphics a boon to the game, giving ease for developers and modders to add droves of great content.The only thing that would make this more realistic is a Crapped Your Pants! moodlet, which I assure you would be the first one that would actually happen to me.

								Project Zomboid is a realistic, isometric sandbox survival game. In other words: A kick-♥♥♥, different twist on Zombie Survival that pitches you against zombies from the top of your tower, firing you shotgun and screaming bad Arnold quotes...The game is set in the 1980s, in 2 Kentucky towns and a fictional suburb complete with an eerily silent prison!Start by creating your character; you can build their skills and weaknesses and choose their profession. You could be a badass veteran who can't read, a handy carpenter, or a firefighter who smokes like a chimney! The possibilities are endless!Use your tools to make a nice fort, complete with a stolen generator, log walls tied by dead zombie clothes and some fairly shoddy looking metal walls. Soon, your water and electricity will run out. You will need to farm and forage to survive, and deal with the hordes that await you...			"

Why becauses its potential, concept and polishs are overshadowed by its extramily slow developement that has left the game in aboring state. The game boils down to secure a safe house stack up food and then camp they is nothing to force you to explore or even leave your house. This is probably the only review im ever going to write because I really like the game and hope to see changes in its development. Maybe i will delete this review when surviors are added in 2020			"

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid, What can I say.. I love it!This game was made to answer 1 and only 1 question, ""What would you do in a zombie apocalyps""Youve spoken about this to your friends, asked the question and you always seem to be alive..But what would really happen. Well the answer is simple, Play this game and figure it out.In Project Zomboid your an average Joe thrown into the thick of a zombie take over, Survices are gone, Water and Power are only temporary, Food gets scarce.Project zomboid looks like a bad game at first glance but the beautiy of this game is jot in her looks, but her brain.The depth and detail put into this game is truly beautiful in itself eg. If you get cut on a peice of glass and your bleeding, you need to get the glass out if there is any lodged inside, disinfect it if you can, bandage it if you have some and if you dont, better rip your pants into rags and wrap it up or youll attract zombies and bleed out.Its a lot of fun to play alone and even more with a friend, and im not just saying that too, multiplayer is the best thing to happen in this game, it gets a lot harder and more enjoyable with someone else tagging along in local split screen and online.Plus for the price of the game its one of if not thee best game to get for your money and the devs are great guys and girls, there a small group but they have been dedicted to this game for a long time and regularly update the game and recently has steam workshop.So please. Cuddle your spiffo doll and eat a whole water melon because this game is hardcore as heck, if that suits your taste, you wont be dissapointed.			"

								I bought this game a long long time ago, Originally builds was released consistently but now there is nothing but pointless crap added to the game. As many reviewers have stated its a waste of money and pretty much been abandoned. My advice, keep your money and save it for state of decay 2 or look elsewhere depending on your tastes. I'd get a refund if i could but its too late for me. don't join me in regret of purchasing empty promises.Its developers like these that damage our trust in other developers whom are actually giving it 110% into other games.Expect to see in abandonware before long. don't say i didn't warn you.

Early Access Review
								I was agoraphobic, so I decided that staying inside the house was my best option for survival. There was plenty of food, clothes, things to barricade the windows with, etc.. but good things don't last forever. All it took was one zombie to call the others. I ran upstairs as I heard the windows shattering behind me. I panicked and ran into the bathroom where I knew there was a window, but they found me. I could see them surrounding my house in herds. I didn't have much of a choice when they started to beat down the bathroom door, so I opened the window and jumped into the crowd. With a broken leg and the rain drenching my clothes, I limped away...			"

Early Access Review
								I would compare Project Zomboid to another early access game: Day Z. Most people negative reviews say Zomboid is taking to long to get good updates but I must disagree. I tried it more than a year ago and I didn't enjoy it. It seemed too complicated, graphics looked kinda lame to me. I was in Day Z's hype. But Day Z is failing to improve as a game in general. They add items and broken mechanics every update. Zombies are still glitched and annoying and all that kill on sight got me bored.Zomboid, on the other hand, has developed a lot. It has a lot more immersion, zombies are quite smart - they see you, hear you and can smell if you're bleeding - and you can custom your experience to your liking in sandbox mode. I'm still not into multiplayer mode, still discovering its mechanics and I can tell you this game is HUGE. By the time I'm done with the vanilla, theres a gigantic mod to discover (Hydrocraft).Three weeks ago I tried Zomboid again and after half an hour of gameplay I decided to buy it. I can tell you, its worth every single cent of its price. Its a very complex game and one of the best things is building a safehouse just to find out its not as safe as you thought - then you have to drive away hordes of zombies away from the city. This is priceless.			"

Early Access Review
								I always have Project Zomboid installed on my PC to remind me that this game is not yet finished, but as so many have mentioned the development is slow and unpromising. Having a small development team is not an excuse since you can always hire more developers, if the player base is wanting more out of the game and are giving negative reviews, the team should recognize the facts and speed things up whatever the cost.Also, the updates they put out are mediocure at best, nothing that actuallly changes the ALPHA gameplay and we all nod and agrees that stuff added belongs in the ALPHA gameplay. The thing is that we need actual solid updates that bring people back, not just the average ALPHA update that people look at and nods and think ""Its still not finished""You guys have a great game that has many potentials, that is why gamers are coming back to your site to check updates and progress. If it was a bad game no one would come back. Please make PROGRESS and lets bring those people back.			"

Early Access Review
								First game: Couldn't figure out the controls to fight the zombies, got eaten right away.Second game:  Figured out how to fight but had to be on the run for 24 hours straight.  Hungry and exhausted, I was cornered and eaten.Third game:  Started getting the hang of things, killing zombies and setting up a safehouse.  Got into a fight with too many at a time, got bitten.  Managed to escape and limped back to my house, only to bleed out in my bedroom.Fourth game:  Spawned in a perfect, fenced in house at the edge of town and have been staying alive for almost a month now.  I've killed hundreds of zombies, fled from hordes drawn by a helicopter, and I've started learning carpentry to build more walls.  I've got to learn how to farm, but I don't know if I have enough time until winter.  To be continued.10/10 would recommend.			"

								This is a game that i found myself recomending to everyone i know. Now as of May 2016 the game has easy server hosting and multiplayer, that in my opinion make the game incredible. The game has the ability to create some amazing stories and tension, the knowing of the changing seasons an harsh winter along with all the zombies and other things like health, stress, hapiness and thirst provide a very rewarding system of play.

Early Access Review
								Gotta tell you, I really don't recommend this game at all unless you plan on taking advantage of the workshop.Character creation was pretty cool and in-depth but the rest of the game... not really appealing, and honestly really boring. I did like the health and damage system though it gets really stupid. like really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. For example, everything needs to be bandaged or else you steadily lose health. This applies to everything, even minor injuries. Got a ""scratch"" well if you don't bandage it you will slowly lose health, possibly get it infected, and then die if you do anything. All on the same day. Have a bleeding scratch? Well that's going to bleed you out because this game is realistic. Wait... realistic??? How is that realistic whatsoever? How do you bleed out from a ""scratch"" given you don't have a clotting disorder? It makes no sense that minor injuries can kill you or drain your health. Where is the logic and reasoning behind this?Don't get me started on fires. I don't even know why it's implemented when it's broken. I mean that as in pretty much everything catches on fire. If you forget to turn the stove off, well eventually it's going to burn and start a fire... however there's a good chance it will keep spreading and spreading, even over concrete and the roads.So far, their progress updates have been an endless stream of excuses for not having animations done--which is also their excuse for not having more content out. It's ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic, their fanbase deserves better than this. Instead they receive a long obnoxious list of reasons why they can't* get animations working.*Correction* do their job right... although honestly this game isn't laggy and it's EAUntil they actually do finish animations, I would recommend that you not fund these developers... unless of course you plan on using the workshop mods. Content-wise, this game's development is going too slow atm.			"

Early Access Review
								A zombie survival game with base building and bar nursing, BUT unlike most of the offering this one has some legs. Zomboid is a game where the zombies are THE threat, not a PVP game in a zombie location. It’s single player modes are the core of the game, with online play as an viable option. A large and expanding / improving map, a realistic medical mechanic, and some really interesting systems which no other game has. The one thing i love about Zomboid is the number of options you have to customize the game, want fast zombies which run in small groups or large hordes of sluggish walkers. Weapons everywhere or should finding a golf club be the difference between life and death. The game is solid and is being updated ,although slowly, yes there are many works in progress which people are demanding but it’s still a great game in its current state.If nothing else put it on your wishlist.

Early Access Review
								Listen to me, I've spent 88 hours in this game. The best way to describe the state of this game is with this short story (that is well known in the software development world):The monster and his shoesImagine you are an ugly monster and you are preparing for a party. You hava a very nice pair of shoes. You spend a lot of time cleaning and making your shoes look even more amazing, you go to the party and everyone runs away from you. - ""The next party will be better"" you say, and then you start to work on your shoes again... ignoring the fact that you are a big scaring ♥♥♥♥ing monster.-- end of short story --Analogy whit this gameThe monster: - super slow development pipeline- NPCs (long promised) - Vehicles (long promised)- broken multiplayer (needs a ton of work, bug fixes, features to even start to make sense)The shoes  (things that were already good enough or totally unnecessary):- nutrition system (really?)- metal crafting- ultra detailed over complicated health system- painting stuff (what the actual ♥♥♥♥)- communication with in game devices (solving a problem that is already solved by external better voip apps)- the list is really big ...For that reason I think the team behind this project lacks knowledge on basic software development principles, like prioritize work that delivers real value not nice-to-have small stuff.Stay away from this game until they start to deliver value with consistency.

Early Access Review
								So far this has been a very interesting game.There is things that should have been included, like npc/ other survivors. Bandits/ gangs. Vehicles that can be torched, looted/driven. If the right person sees the possibilites in this game, then he/she will be famous. Already there is so much things you can do in this game, and thanks to the bright minds in the modding community the list of doable things keeps growing everyday.I usually never buy a ""early access"" game, i dont like and i dont need the frustration, buuut i read this game was well worth owing it in its current state. Yes they were right, never before has it been so delightful to smash the empty head of my ever nagging neighbour. Everyday for ten years he has been around my door with his Jehovas witness propaganda when im watchin tv and having a beer. But yesterday i finally managed to get even, i grabbed the frying pan his wife gave me for christmas decades ago and smashed his head clean off his shoulders, The jebus propaganda flew everywhere, the walls were sprayed with blood. I went outside, noone to see, and noone yelling at me. Good! When i now walk down the street, everyone bow for me. Could it be because i am so nice and good and clean? Maybe- or could it be because i am carrying a bloody axe over my shoulder? Probably..This game is worth supporting, i only hope more additions keep coming. We want to see well detailed fires, crumbling buildings. Explosives- and drivable cars you can run over people or into structures. Now if you all excuse me, i have an appointment with some empty skulls drooling on my doorstepHave fun children And remember what your dad always told you every night when you were  a kid:  ""Always keep you axe sharp and clean my son""			"

 Project Zomboid	 Pros: + Zombies+ Open World+ Updates+ Tons Of Looting+ Weapons+ Crafting, Building, Farming+ Mods+ Realistic. Food Expires. Health and Injures.+ Multiplayer Cons: - Complex, as in the way you do some of the things in the game are not like most games.- Inventory Management Review Have you ever watched a zombie movie and said ""If I was in a zombie apocalypse I would survive."" Well, time to put you to the test in Project Zomboid. You choose how you look and your skills and are placed in a world where the zombie apocalypse just happened (or has happened 6 months ago). You search houses for food, water, and anything that can be used to defend yourself. Build up your safe house as hordes of zombies wander around your world. Gather enough clean water to survive before the water and power shuts off. You are always on edge with this game, never knowing when a zombie is going to be around the next corner. This game is not for everyone though. It's quite complex and may be frustrating for a lot of people. If you like zombies and if you're dedicated enough to learn this game then you just found your dream game. Personally I am not a huge fan of the graphic style even though I knew it was going to be kind of retro style. If this game was mixed with The Long Dark then I would love it, but it's still a solid game. I can't wait for the final product! Suggested on sale. My First Multiplayer Experience Story I played Project Zomboid for about 25 hours and I felt ready to go to multiplayer for the first time. So I spawned into the world and started to search houses for items. Everything was already well looted and I couldn't find a single useful thing. I couldn't find a good weapon so I took a stick just in case. Sometime later a person who was well geared but had no pants on came up to me. The man said to me, ""Okay listen, I don't have time for this. I just got blood on my pants when I killed a zombie so I need your pants."" I said, ''No. Just take one from a house or something."" For it was my pants that I did not want to give away. The man said, ""No, I want your pants. It's blue and I haven't seen blue pants in a long time."" The man then pulled a gun on me, which I instantly started to run away. I didn't get far as I was shot from behind and fell to the ground. As I was bleeding to death, the man took my pants and put them on and as he walked away he said ""Should have given me your pants."" The moral of the story is when someone tells you to give them your pants... you do it.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

								No maps to find where you are or to find one another, No means to link your party together. No way to protect your base properly with traps and such. These are my biggest complaints, the rest of the game is quite good. I hope to change my review once these things change in the game.You would think with all the ease of online access now a days in games setting up a multiplayer game that this game would follow suit. This game is unnecessarily complicated just to play online with friends if you get it to work at all!			"
