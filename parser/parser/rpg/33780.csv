												A shorter and less developed game than the original, but still a wonderful play experience.  I would love a Drakensang 3, much like a Neverwinter Nights 3, but I doubt either would ever happen.			"

												This was a disappointment for me, too many repetitions. The same, space used over and over again. Clearly a sign of the developer upcoming bankruptcy, and the grasping for straws.			"

												There are three games Drakensang River of Time, Dark Eye and the add-on for River of Time - Phileasson's Secret.  A great RPG with lots of quests and choices on character creation and advancement.  Lots of hours of good play as well.			"

												Played this title a few years back at a friends house and decided to get it for myself since it was part of a bundle,and started playing it once more. Yes it's a older title and the graphics still hold up to the test of time and very enjoyable to play.			"

												Great expansion pack to a very underrated game. If  you liked Neverwinter nights 2 or the first Drakensang, please check this one out. Already gone thru these games once, about to play them again years later, if you want an old school style rpg pick this while it is on sale!For me this Darkensang series is one of the most underrated rpg series over the last while, very good for fans of old school style rpgs and don't mind a game not holding you're hand all the time. Some well written characters and lots of roleplaying to be had!			"
