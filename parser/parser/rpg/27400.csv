												When you play this game, all your Call of Dudebro friends will ask you why you're playing a game about high school girls. They might even make some sort of lolicon joke. This is because they are boys and you are a man. A man can play a game about high school girls without feeling his masculinity is threatened.			"

												It's really cool and interesting talking with people like in the 1920's. I don't know how accurate it is -but it's fun.The game has charm but overall I can't really recommend it unless it's on a really good sale and you don't care about the following cons:First off to navigate the map you need to put your mouse to the edge of it and wait while it scrolls to the appropriate area.This quickly gets tedious since it would be very easy to make the arrow keys or something scroll the map without you having to mouse over everytime. It's a needlessly slow process.The second con and the biggest is that the game is mostly luck based. You have stats you can increase but you will soon realize that sometimes the only reason you lost - was because of luck. You can win with the worst stats and you can lose with the best.The minigames themselves are a bit fun though.			"

												This game is quite interesting, and definitely unique. I'd classify it as a RPG/adventure game in the style of an old board game where encounters are settled with mini-games. You recruit a plucky gang of rebellious teen girls and work to unravel the town's big conspiracy. You talk to people to learn info and complete story-driven goals, perhaps convincing them with a mini-game. The prohibition-era setting is pretty neat. The mechanics are pretty fun, although the pacing's pretty slow. The flirting game confused me for some time, though.The story is quite long. There are many sub-plots that each take some time to complete. For the most part, the story is light-hearted and fun, but it takes a really dark, unexpected turn at the end. There are multiple endings, but getting the better ones is very difficult.Adventure fans will probably enjoy it. RPG fans, maybe. It's not for everyone, but not a bad way to spend a few dollars. $10 is probably a little too much, but I'd get it at $5.			"

												This is one of the most unique (and addictive and fun) games I have played. The mixture of minigames, rpg party building, and board game layout are fun, but what makes it most fascinating is the roaring twenties theme and the strong, humourous, surprisingly dark narrative. This is a really well written game.I also give it lots of points for a diverse and female-centred cast; I actually can't think of another game in which you can play a wheelchair using teenage social queen.I recommend this wholeheartedly for anyone looking for a game that really does something creative and different, and does so with great theming and fun gameplay. 9.5/10.

												While it sets uncommonly and interestingly in 1920s pre-Women's Rights era at a high school, playing the game itself feels like a chore as every choice you make has you either delving deeping into a shifty and overindulged plot by playing repeatitive card games that feel more luck-oriented than skill-oriented, or borderline-level-grinding your characters (via the same repeatitve card games). After about three hours, it felt more like I was watching a snooty teenage love story set in Victorian Era rather than actually playing a game and enjoying it.			"

												Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble - Oh noesBelieve it or not this is an RPG - a hillarious vintage board game with unique mechanics and a role-playing soul, to be exact/more vague. Set in the early 20th century, you control a group of high school girls trying to solve a mystery murder, which leads them to uncover a darker secret involving the whole city. The skills you invest in are Rebellion, Glamour, Savvy and Popularity. You level up by using those in appropriate 'mini games', which always involve interacting with the townsfolk.Both writing and the art are superb. While exploring it for 15 hours or so, I encountered some weird things - a talking pony, a split personality, a desk serving as a policeman, a ghost hired to scare unwanted visitors... The story got more ridiculous, more interesting and more serious as I progressed. By the end it felt like Doctor Who, catching you off-guard with messed up revelations & profound thoughts, right in the middle of the laugh. Let's just say I understood why it got banned by Big Fish Games.If this got you interested at all, try it - a tad repetitive mini games don't detract from this one of a kind experience!V e r d i c t : GREAT, with some room for improvement			"

												-NOT- recommended. I was curious about the 80/100 Meta score and grabbed this for 2$ on the 75% sale. First this is not a video game, more like a table game poorly adapted to the screen. The resolution is tiny (800x600?) with no option to resize it, the board screen is so tiny that you spend your time scrolling around endlessly looking for objectives, and hell the characters are not even modeled, you see them as pawns exactly like on a table game.But all of that could have been forgotten if the gameplay or story were solid. The story is boring, a bunch of girls get into accidents at school that look like sabotage and mainly you will be investigating who did it. Second the gameplay is poor, divided into 4 repetitive, childich minigames of -NO- strategic or tactical depth.Bottom line, I don't know how it got such a high meta score. Stay away from this game.

												This is a 1920's mystery game set around a small American town and a group of 4 rebellious young high school girls. The gameplay is based around 4 minigames, at which winning or losing has consequences for the story and conversations you encounter. The story begins simply, but soon after branches off into multiple concurrent threads that all weave into a massive conspiracy controlling the town. You will do things like investigate a series of accidents involving shoddy mail-order products, try to get a talking horse elected mayor, and play cards with a ghost. By the end, the story has dropped most of its silly elements and a kind of horror borne of only slightly exaggerated early-20th century morality begins to make itself evident, and you have the choice of accepting it or rebelling. While I wouldn't call it a very ambiguous moral choice, it does provide alternate endings and interesting conversations.Gameplay wise, it got a bit boring after a while, and there was very little consequences to losing at minigames because you could save before encounters and reload saves if you failed. The minigames are fine, but winning at them always had a level of randomness to it that make replaying segments you lost, where there were multiple minigames in a row you couldn't save in between, kind of frustrating. There is a sort of RPG aspect here, where the girls have stats that apply to different minigames and they could be leveled up with repeated playing of the minigames. However, no matter how high my stats got, I never felt significantly advantaged when it came to the minigames, above what I would normally have had just from knowing how to play them well. The things that kept me playing were the storylines and the charming personalities of the characters. I legitimately wanted my girls to succeed in their adventures and was concerned for them when they got in trouble or were in danger. If this were a pure point and click adventure, or even a visual novel, and minimized or lessened the minigame elements in favor of using and levelling the stats in a different way, I felt I would have enjoyed the game even more, but for what it is I had fun and will play it again one day. I give this title a solid 7/10, a great effort from this developer with a really unique storytelling style.			"

												The game functions like a boardgame with 4 primary areas; the high school, downtown, the dells and the outskirts. Each area has a series of ""points of interest"" where you can interact with the characters of the game by clicking on the corresponding silver icon (for example: during the school hours, clicking on the math classroom will interact with your math teacher).You control a gang of four girls, each with a starting strenght and weakness. The stats are Popularity, Glamour, Rebellion and Savvy. The point of the stats is to aid you in different mini-games which are required to force information out of a character. Since there are only five mini-games (taunt, expose, fib, gambit and flirt) the game does get very repetive quickly, but the story does you keep engaged in the game. The story starts out small, you investigate a series of accidents caused by defective goods from Weehawken. But it soon escalates into hanging, a massive conspiracy and an unfortunate maintenance man who happens to be in the midst of it all.			"

												An unusual game that is resfreshing. Too few game designer use creativity in their design. It's always cloning each other's ideas. But these guys have come up with an original game idea and successfully delivered a good design too.I have nothing bad to say about this game aside from no replayability. It's tough to beat the first time you play, so it might take you a while to finish and that is good since there is no point of playing it a second time. Oh, and the game takes 24 megs on your HD, that's a really great thing especially if you have limited bandwidtLove the simple interface, it is clean and direct, you don't have thirty sub-menus or other inconveniences like that.If you can get it at 5$ or less, well worth it if you are looking for something new and small.

												I kind of love this game but can't really articulate why.Maybe it's the writing. Or the theme, the idea of this posse of girls causing and skirting trouble in the 1920s. It calls me back to reading about Encyclopedia Brown and Sally Kimball when I was a kid -- it's got that sorta feel to it, but you know, as a game. Well, as a boardgame, with tokens in room locations to indicate encounters. You basically play one of five mini-games to promote your agenda -- they tend to be luck-based but most of them have some small bit of skill involved. Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor. I mean, you recruit other girls to join your gang (complete with a ""queen""), and then, each girl can have a boy in tow to use as an expendable tool, if need be. You're trying to get things done, while constrained by these 1920 gender roles, heh.Oh, to note: It's older, so the window/resolution is low and you have to edge scroll. That's the one con.			"

												I sadly have to give this game a very mild recommendation against playing, and a 5/10.The board game scenario was pretty ingenious, the storyline interesting and compelling, the 1920's setting both fun and unique, and the RPG party building a nice little touch.  But the mini-games that comprise the bulk of the gameplay, while mildly fun on their own, quickly became tedious and even mind-numbingly boring.  On top of that, the storyline kind of takes a cliff dive by the end of the game, taking the RPG party building elements with it.  I struggled along with the game as it became more and more tedious, hoping to simply complete the storyline... but the end of the game finished in such an abrupt and non-fulfilling way that it made me regret the hours I'd spent wasting my time with the game in the first place.  If only the gameplay had been more varied, and the ingenuity that began the game's storylines carried through to the end, this would have been a charming little game worth maybe a 7-8/10.			"

												BAD: The ending was very unsatisfying. I feel like it was rather rushed and the little epilogue blurbs were disappointing (at least the ones I saw).Also, it was somewhat irritating that the Fib game is based entirely on probability for your opponent's hand, but otherwise, I quite enjoyed the four mini-games.GOOD: Other than the randomization on the Fib game, the mechanics were fun. The story was engaging, that oscillated between silly and menacing. Given some of the atmosphere of the game, I thought that it was going to take a different direction near the end - like the town was revealed to be a Stepfordesque last remnants of civilization or retro self-contained arcology in a dystopian future. But it didn't and I thought that was a missed opportunity.Also, because I'm a sap, my favourite part was when you finally can successfully flirt with Detective Friendly and jokingly get ""engaged"" to him.Overall, it was fun, so I would recommend it to people who like these quirky little adventure games.

												I'm a sucker for distinct period style, wit, and puzzles. This game gives me all three and then some. I feel like the title and subject matter might turn off the male gamer, but they're missing out. The first time I failed a flirt attempt and got the ""He's too much!"" screen, I cackled!I think maybe the price point of the game is a LITTLE high. And I would love to see a HD version of this game. Actually, I'd love to see a physical boardgame of this game produced - not sure how that would work, logistically. But it would be fun as hell to play this with people! What's especially commendable is the variety of races/body types/personalities in this game. It's very rare to see that and a breath of fresh air!My only grievance with this game is that some of the ""expose"" puzzles aren't random (and considering you're trying to piece together a mystery, they SHOULDNT be random) - so sometimes its a matter of having a good memory vs actually solving the puzzle.It's simple, addictive, charming, and keeps you on your toes.

												This game is nothing like I've ever played. It focuses on you and your posse uncovering a mystery as well as tidbits that have happened/are happening in town. In order to progress the game, there are mini games you play with people that if you win, will draw the truth out of them and add a piece of the puzzle for understanding. If you lose, you suffer the consequence like decreased reputation or losing one of your gals from the posse. I am enthralled with this game. It's a little repetitious sure but the story outweighs that for me 10 times over. Pick it up and immerse yourself in a world of high school queen bees in the 1920's. :)			"

 I Tried	This is one of the more boring games I've played in a while all you do is walk around a school with some great controls thumbs up for them... while trying to gain favors, ways to insult, girls and so on. The game is build like a board game and there is a lot of this game that could be really good and it has some good ideas but the execution is just not there. The idea of creating your own 1920's girl gang is fairly fun and i like the idea but all you do is walk around playing some boring mini- games that grows old really fast. The story is also a little boring in my opinion and i didn't really like it since it didn't catch my attention or hook me into the whole situation. The graphics is of course made to look old but the game itself is also fairly old which explains why it is what it is and why the dimensions is so bad. This is not worth the high price it has, not anywhere near it. But if you're really into 1920's girl squads go for it, otherwise don't bother. "

There are like 20 other women, all equally stuck-up, and proud to be a a snob. The point of this game is to find your friends in the school. Again like Clue, except instead of solving a murder, you're competing to be the world's biggest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You also can recruit other women into your so called ""gang"" But all they want to talk about is how their clothes or talking bad about other women. (Like real women, am I right guys?)  When recruiting other women, they taunt you, and to survive this attack, you have to click on the correct snappy comeback. Oh did I forget to mention that this game is all point and click? No Steam Overlay, only plays in 800x600			"

												I went into this game unsure- it seemed like it might not have enough content, but I had $20 to blow and was ready to take the risk for a really stand out game. The concept seemed really interesting, and I liked the idea of a diverse cast of high school girls. I actually don't really want to write a bad review of this game because, there's a lot of potential. I hope the creators continue, fine tune the art of the mini-game, and go on to create characters with greater depth and the player can actually feel an interest in. But for $20 it's a big disappointment. The minigames are really boring and that's basically they're all you'll be doing. I think it may have built up to more interesting storylines, but I was too bored to continue. The art, considering there's so little of it, is really sub-par. There is also way too little strategy and long term planning in this game so I felt like I was meandering around. I felt the 20s era felt inauthentic and too based on stereotypes and slang- perhaps if the characters had a little more depth or backstory it would feel truer to the period. If you want a truly awesome dark, involving detective game involving high school girls I would recommend Black Closet. It's by Hanako games, and though it is planned for Steam release soon (the creator is fine tuning it) it is currently available through their website.  Of if you simply like the fun of a brightly colored teen girl unraveling a mystery in a dangerous setting (and possibly dying horribly) you'll love Hanako's Long Live the Queen on Steam. And no, I'm not affiliated in anyway with Hanako. I just love their games and their nuanced portrayal of girls.			"

												This game just plain sucks. It's a board game style, frivilous tween expose, for girls interested in the intricacies of the 1920's social heirarchy. Of which I am not! You will find yourself playing the same cards very quickly and knowing all the responses. It's repetative, uniteresting, and all together a mess of a game.

												The story has an undeniable charm to it, the atmosphere is quite refreshing.Unfortunately the mini-games are too limited and repetitive to have any long term interest, a shame since the scenario itself is really well written.I don't entirely disrecommend it for everyone. You might want to get it for your kids as it's a bit reminiscent of those children detective novels, good reading practice and definitely no violent content in there.As a game though, it just gets a bit too dry to recommend, especially the fact that it will only work in a 640x480 window, and whilst the 2D art is passable, the layout, interface, lack of animation, and overall presentation look way too amateurish, almost like this game was made with power point...

												I progressed through the game, and did well, but I have no idea why.  The gameplay is confusing in that I couldn't tell how my actions affected the outcome, if at all. Many of the ""quests"" can only be played one way, so there's no challenge, risk, or fun. I clicked what it told me to click, and the game chugged along while I watched.  It's not a short game, but you can move through it far too quickly. Rounds fly by because there's nothing to the gameplay. The artwork is nice, but again there's not much to it. There aren't many locations in the game to view (mostly since it's kind of a board game). It's a purely point-and-click game where the things you click don't matter much. Point-and-click games should have to work harder on story, but the story here is empty, and doesn't matter. This might be a good game for young kids, or people who don't play video games. It's impossible to lose, and easy to play. Way too easy for most, I'd say. Finally, I paid under $5 for this game.  The full price of over $20 is shocking. Defintely not worth that price. There isn't enough here to make it worth the $5.			"

												Ok a game like Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble by title alone should tell you that this is not a title that will have universal appeal, and true to form the game does have a couple of interesting ideas on top of unfortunately repetitive and ultimately uninteresting mini-games.  Although the concept of an old style board game is fairly clever, the 1920's speakeasy music begins to grate after an hour or so of gameplay, and it is very unfortunate that the entire gameboard is not visible at all times, requiring a scrolling of the mouse to see and reveal objectives.  The character art is interesting and fairly well done but overall this game simply lacks the interesting core play that would encourage me to pick it up again.  Combined with a lack of both Steam Overlay and no widescreen support, I would recommend my friends pass on this game.			"

												Bought this during a steam deal, but I had admittedly wanted to try it out for a while, being that it looked like an all right card game and seemed amusing enough to enjoy.The plus side is that it's based during the feminst period and during a school situation, and any bf's the girls (your cards) gain act as shields and nothing more. No emotional ties, and once you lose a game against someone they take the beating and hit the road. Well, I found it funny.Anyway, there is a main story to this; and depending on how good you are at the card games here, the quicker and easier you'll find it to get information out of people. The girls all have different personalities, so it's vital you mix and match to battle other students, teachers, and others alike. A really good game if you've got time to waste and have a thing for playing cards.			"

												What the... Adventure game? RPG? Board game? Sims like? Tabletop game? Dice game? I have no clue what this is... Maybe a mix of all these genres? Whatever it is it's fun... Really... Graphics are old school, washed out old style and the music fits so perfectly that it makes most other games soundtrack stand out like a sore thumb, like Biometal on the SuperNES...Grab it, you won't regret it...

												Games shouldn't feel tedious after only a few minutes of play. Mini games based on Taunting others just feels icky.			"

												Not a very fun or interesting game. You play on a board game with school classmates and faculty members as people you ""meet"" in the game. Point of the game is to beat them all in ""mini-games"".Most of the mini-games seem to rely on luck, while others are mind-numbingly too easy. None are amusing to play and after the 10th round of ""fill in the blank"" you get bored with it and wish it was a REAL board game that you could throw across the room.Worth getting for the amusing title ONLY...not much else.

												Terrible. It's like a cardgame with no 'game' parts. and no other players. I'm not really sure what this game is tring to accomplish, but it's not very interesting.			"
