Force Prep 
Community Created Artwork for Interstellar Marines
By: SeaAxe (cx3907)

			Setting off to another camp for a secondary course. What a wonderful Xmas gift. (Sarcasm)		


'Quick' & simple review:Pros: Dedicated developers, even if progress on the game is slow. (For goodness' sake, it's a small indie studio!) Plus great community managers! Generally mature, close-knit, and wonderful community. (I must warn you, a few black sheeps exist.) Intentionally challenging game mechanics: (devs are aiming for realism) No HUD crosshairs,  real weapon recoil,  hearing impairment after taking damage (with disabled HUD until you recover),  dynamic character breathing (which affects gun wobble),  limited movement speed and hampered jumping,  no checkpoints/save system in campaign/co-op (aka. permadeath, 'cuz it's hardcore),  long respawn time in PvP to force the players to be vigilant, (you can never be too careful in this game) fair & balanced PvP (for now, SMG and rifle are available, and NO KILLSTREAK BONUS, HA!),  bots are literally robots who can flank you, snipe you a mile away, and make you wish you are wearing adult diapers on harder difficulties. Innovative game mechanics:  First-person simulation (no floating hands, no viewmodels, full first-person body is rendered where FP camera resides... and that helmet faceplate you see in first-person? Yep it's a real in-game, in-environment model too)wtf, the HUD too?,  dynamic crouch & cover system,  changing  environments and game states. Dynamic maps! (This deserves repetition!)(Laugh as a wall rises to block your opponent off, or ragequit when a ninja jumps on you.) Awesome audio & visuals! (Provided that your hardware can take it and max out all the settings, and it's in Unity.)Hear the water splatter around you at different places (on the ground, on your helmet, on the roof...)Watch how the water splatters on your visor (hint: slowly look up and down... if you bought this game)""...help..."" (Officially denied by the devs & CM)Check out the lighting!...and maybe many more fine details that are too damn obscure that you must pay attention to actually notice.  Tense atmosphere in both campaign/co-op and PvP.(Your flashlight may or may not be your best friend.)Cons: It's Steam Early Access. (not really a bad thing, but I guess some people don't like the notion of buying an incomplete game.) It's hungry for hardware, and not Mac/Linux-friendly ('cuz OpenGL and Unity).On my iMac: 30-60fps main menu, 15-30fps in PvP, drops to 1-5fps on NeuroGen Incident (biggest map in the game)*turn off beamsync*: OVER 90... yeah... until NGI, it drops to 5fpsSwitch to Bootcamp Windows 7: 40-100fps main menu, cool 30fps in PvP, 20-30fps on NGI... not bad.*switch from DirectX to OpenGL*: screw this... OpenGL & Unity hate each other.Machine: Intel i5 2.5GHz, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB, 8 GB RAM Plenty of bugs to stomp (which I actually enjoy, but then, again…)I mean, check out the pinned post I'm keeping (or I had been keeping) in the Steam Discussions page. It's friggin' long...)Seriously. The list, although unofficial, is longer than this puny review. The official buglist is much longer.(""...where the **** is the keycard?!"" ""HOLY CRAP I AM FALLING THROUGH THE MAP!""that kind of thing. But a marine keeps his cool, no?)Server rollback has yet to be coded & implemented. (keyword: yet)Client-server feedback latency may vary for different people.If your opponent/robot manage to shoot you in the head before you can even react, blame lag. Small multiplayer population + surplus servers + high ping (in my area)Perfectly good money wasted on empty servers, IMO. No landsharks, yet.Devs are so perfectionist that they want to perfect the AI code before introducing the sharks... *hype dies out* Spoiler: Not in space, yet. (The NeuroGen Incident is a reenactment underground.)Thus, in the current state of this game:Recommended For: Gamers looking for a highly balanced and tactical FPS. Gamers looking for thrills with replay value, and tired of mediocre jumpscares. (Advice: Never play on Easy mode. It kills the atmosphere.)But this is not meant to be a horror game. It's... uhm... a test! Live by the game tagline: In space, your friends can hear you scream.Not Recommended For: Gamers used to and prefer mainstream FPS, like CS, CoD, BF etc. People who don't like buggy and incomplete indie games. Gamers who set the same high expectations like they do with heavily funded games by big publishers....which I can totally understand. This review is meant to help your research.Conclusion:All you have to decide is WILL YOU BELIEVE? "

								This game as it is right now is very good and I highly recommend it, especially if you like Insurgency and System Shock 2.However, there have been a lot of misinformation being spread about this game and it's developer's, so i'll make this as short and sweet as possible:1. The IDEA of Interstellar Marines began in 2005, not the actual development.2. They launched a failed kickstarter in 2009 and recieved NO money as a result.3. That was AFTER they filed for bankruptcy due to the economic slump at the time.4. This game has been in early access since 2013, not longer, as others have said.5. The reason for the slow progress (so far) is that they literally have a handful of people working on the game, and they have so little money that they are basically working on this game for free.6. The devs are NOT abusive. If anything, they break their backs to ensure the satisfaction of their consumers.So, if you like what you see, buy it. It'll only get better from there, and it has a dedicated community. If you're holding off because it's in Early Access, at least keep an eye on it.They don't say ""For the love of the game"" because it sounds nice. They say it because they mean it.I hope this clears a few things up.EDIT: If you want the source, it's here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/864972399686185189/ "

								I always hated those people who gave up supporting the devs of Interstellar Marines and began calling the game vaporware. Game development takes time and it's not that easy, so I found it extremely annoying when someone had the audacity to blame the developers for not producing enough content. Now I'm going to join the same group. After getting my hopes up for a game that in my opinion had a vast amount of potential, there just hasn't been enough progress to make me believe in to the game anymore. After 5-6 years of supporting the devs and being generally a fan of the whole concept, I will give up on this. I am growing too old for this, figuratively and literally speaking. "

Early Access Review
								Guys, I have been waiting for this game for almost 10 years. I've supported the development by purchasing the spearhead version of the game before it was on steam and afterwards I bought it again on steam to support further. I've purchased several bagdes of support from their website and even bought some of the company shares that were on sale a few years ago. I've seen this game go through many different development stages. The game simply is not what it had been advertised as back in 2006, or maybe it was 2005. I am not sure but at any rate I do not expect it to deliver anymore. There are people who are happy with the current state of the game and I'm glad it gets support. However, as someone who has been waiting for this game since it was first announced I believe there are some things that have not been delivered. I do not expect a game that has been in develoment for this long to be the same game that it was announced as and frankly from what I've played so far that expectation might be correct. I do not recommend this game to anyone, and before you decide to buy it I would like you to be aware that this game has been in develoment almost as long as Duke Nukem Forever and that you should look into it more before you decide that you truly want it.

								The problem with this game is not that the developers are inexperienced and bad at what they do, it's the fact that they are low on money, and the community has been very negative about them being slow.  They try their hardest to communicate with their community; they have a great game already made, here.  They're trying their absolute hardest, but they just don't have the money to do it.  I do recommend this game, highly.  It has a fun and unique co-op experience, fun PvP, skins (no Microtransactions), singleplayer missions, multiple types of missions.  They aren't giving up, but without these funds, they're progressing slowly.This video tells you everything you need to know, really.

Early Access Review
								YESSS! Another GRAND update!!! This time the changes include ultra realistic, highly tactical, extremely accurate, high quality, high fiedlity, high definition, revolutionary, ground braking, one of a kind FALLING DAMAGE! Also this update includes.... NOTHING ELSE!SO HAVE FUN DEAR PLAYERS, AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING US RIP YOU OFF!Earlier reviews below.___________________________________________________________________________________So, more than a month has passed since I originally reviewed IM. A new update is out, so, I installed the game to check out if there has been any progress. (The description of the update states, that this time, the only changes are a switch to Unity 5, and some crappy map was re-added to coop, probably for the 647th time, so I didn't hold my breath...) I quickly went through NGI to assess the situation. Sadly, there is nothing good to report.No visible progress at all. One thing that did catch my attention though, was that 30 seconds after I started the level, I fell through the floor for no apperant reason... Great start (But, what else is new, right?). I restarted the level, and played a bit more. It was the first time I played this game in six months.I will now list the changes I've noticed: The voice and lines of the computer in NGI changed a bit, my guns and suit changed collor, there is a small fatigue percentage in the bottom right of the screen and a ""Hell week"" button has been added to the main menu. That's it. These are the changes made to the game during six months of development... Can't wait to try the game in another six months, and find that the fatigue percentage moved to the top left of the screen, and that two maps that were removed from coop in the last update, were returned (As usual...).The part I liked the most about this, is in the description of the update: ""The next step we want to do is improve performance even more with Speedtree and boost the graphics even more with physically based shaders, global illumination, linear lighting and deferred rendering 2.0.""YAY! The next update will be as useless as this one!The original review is below.___________________________________________________________________________________I like this game, I really do. Why won't I recommend it then? Let me explain.Currently, the game is in decent shape, with nice gameplay, nice graphics, a reasonable amount of content for the price. The problem is, the developers say it will have so much more. The ""vision"" of IM is quite grand, and it would be great if it actually happened. I just doubt it will happen... I mean, the progress is waaay too slow. Updates are few and far between (once every two-three monts), and when an update does comes out, new features are almost non-existant. Even many of the bug fixes that are stated as fixed on the changelog, are actually not fixed. It's like ""This update, we are going to release the sprinting and fatigue system! In three months we will fix the broken sprinting and fatigue system! Three months after that, we will impliment our super advanced crouching system! AND, don't forget that after six more months we will add a flash light! Our game is uber-tactical with ultra advanced and realistic (unimplimented) skin system! Land sharks are just around the corner (and have been for the last year or so)! And of course, stay tuned, because we are going to take this game (advertised as a mainly SP/COOP game) and add a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP survival mode that no one wants, instead of focusing on the campaign or on adding more guns!""They advertise their crouching and sprinting systems as ""realistic"", ""advanced"" and ""revolutionary"", and yet I do not see how they are different from any other FPS... And this is what gets to me. This dishonesty on the part of the developers.If they would advertise the game as it is, and not throw in things they will get around to in about ten years, I would recommend it. It is pretty enjoyable as it is. But seeing as the developers are dishonest, and insist on misleading the players, I will not recommend this game!			"

Early Access Review
								Last time I put it bluntly, but because there are morons on this review page that thumbs down negative reviews (I'm sure  now we're at 3 years in Steam EA, they feel really smart), I'll go ahead and give my review a little more content. With more sodium. When I first picked up Interstellar Marines, I was hooked instantly. I thought that there was no limit, and the devs fueled that feeling with vlogs showing things to be genuinely stoked for. The idea felt fresh in a genre where literally every avenue has been explored -- be it by big game industries or indie developers -- and that nothing came as a surprise. I waited for that polish to the game, and even ended up buying 5 other copies for friends to play with me and help the game grow. ""So why did you stop, why are you giving this game a bad review?""Because these devs are slower than the skeleton crew updating DayZ Standalone. Three years in Steam EA -- with plenty more behind that -- and what do they have to show for it? A few 'missions' and tweaks that should be done after you put in content needed to call this a game. I've seen game demos more complete than this. I'm not sure if it's program regulations or your character just enjoys it, but you walk around like you have a giant metal rod up your♥♥♥♥♥ It's clearly not beyond the dev team's capabilities to make a working movement animation or make the characters look convincing, just look at the robots running around. Speaking of robots, aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t multiplayer system they have in the game (try getting into a Hell Week lobby), did you know that they are the ONLY enemies you have in the entire game? After the initial fear of the unknown wears off, be prepared to delve into the dark with these bots either shooting at you or flailing their arms out you with some scream along the lines of ""HOOOOUURRRRGH"". Three years of development, and they haven't been able to ship out a single mission past 'training simulations' for the real threats in space. I know a handful of people that -- given three years only -- would be AGES ahead of what this team has brought us in updates that provide no real useful content at all. We got a PVP/E game mode now. Whooptee ♥♥♥♥ing doo. Maybe that was their message behind this game. That there was no alien threat and therefore we all look dumb, waiting to encounter alien lifeforms, weapons in hand. That's what I'm going to hope, because other than an overprice, sick, twisted prank, this game only stands as a pillar in reasons I don't EVER want to put money towards another game with an EA tag on it again.Thanks devs for betraying our trust, breaking promises and dreams, and adding into the phobia of investing into an EA that becomes a waste of cash.

								I bought this game in 2010. It's almost 2017 now and it's still just as Early Access as it ever was. The content trickles in and is lackluster at best. There are many other games available that have more content, are more fun to play and are free. I feel like I was duped by a snake oil salesmen. Promised features and content still yet to be seen 7 years later.Avoid this and don't waste your money*Edit*To those comenting on my time played, I have played this game for hours before it was available on steam. As I said, I had this game back in 2010, it has only been on steam since 2013.			"

								This game has been in development for more than 6 years now, and it doesn't seem that the end is anywhere in sight.This is becoming a sort of pyramid scheme, where people who already bought the game recommend it to others just to keep the development going. :-/The developer has recently started releasing monthly updates, but those updates are mostly void of real content; they include only minor changes like tweaking the weapon recoil, or changing the HUD display font.The developer ignores any questions about the release date, and doesn't reveal anything about the single-player campaign, saying that its a surprise, or that everything's a ""means to an end"", or something vague of that sort.My guess is, sadly, that the money will run out before the game will ever be finished. I therefore would not recommend anyone buy this game in its 'early access' from.			"

								This is without a doubt the longest game development I have ever seen. Over 10 years of waiting for a game that was never made. Since the release on Steam early access (over 3 years ago), there has been absolutely zero content related to the main reason people bought the game, the single player. Everything that's been released so far is bland multiplayer, and even more bland co-op. The maps are limited, the content is limited, and I couldn't be more disappointed after waiting for so long. Back in 2008 I had hopes that this game would set the standard for Indie developers, but as of May 2016, Zero Point Software have decided to find a publisher and pretty much go back on everything they've been telling us for years. I lost faith in Interstellar Marines a long time ago, but consider this review a warning. You will be disappointed.PS: If I have to read ""For the love of the game"" one more time, I'll probably put my faith in Activision. At least they release finished games.			"

								I played Slender without jumping. I played Amesia without flinching. I sat through Five Nights at Freddies and only jumped once.But this game regularly makes me actually scream, and flinch badly enough I can't aim properly. I can't place exactly what does it, or why it does it so well, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥does it ever. The noises the bots make, the way they lunge for you, the absolutely jawdropping immersion. This game isn't billed as a horror, and in reality, it shouldn't be. You play a fully armored, trained Marine, with unlimited ammo, flashlights, lasers, and the most advanced weapons in the entire armed forces. It couldn't be a survival horror, or even really a horror at this rate.What it is is a very tense, tight, amazing shooter. Controls are absolutely tight (With the exception of stairwalking) weapons feel good, the lighting is top notch, and the sound is literally eargasmic. Everything combines to make a game that takes a badass fighter, and makes them seem like a very human fighter. The Marines say nothing, but you feel like you're actually there, fighting in their boots, sweating around the grips of their weapons. It's barely alpha even now, with many features missing and planned, and many bugs and issues.And yet, it's still the best first person shooter I've played. It may not be the funnest, nor the fastest, nor even the most well polished. But it's a true first person experience, injecting you into the game in a way that I've wished for in many others.			"

 Many Say this game is dead.  Forever in Dev hell. Eternal Early Access. And maybe so, but not truly dead. Please read my entire review to understand what I mean.The game mechanics are fantastic. There are so many elements to the game that make it a challenge. Versatile and ever changing environments in the middle of a battle. Is something that AAA games do not put a lot of effort into.It has both single player and multiplayer. To enjoy playing with well developed AI to fight.. They are even developed to scare the player tremendously, The bots really get my heart pumping.This game was on a hype train for a while (back in 2013 and 2014), But there are an issue. The team of devs are no longer together. Only The lead dev is working on the game, with a few out of country Volunteers. The game is still developing, but there isn't the man power to get this game going. The one developer calls this game ""His Dream"" and will spend as much time he has to make this game the best he can. Truly, this game has amazing concepts and features. But there isn't a whole lot of content at hand. If any of you trully want to see this game succeed, then go to ""Zero Point Software's"" Website and apply to work on the game. I'll put a link at the bottem. Though it says jobs, Don't expect to be paid. Like the dev said, he has a few ""volunteers"" working for him, and the game fel off the hype train. But anyone has any skills in creating games, programming, ideas, mechanics, assets creating, etc... Then join him, and help him finish his dream and a very potentially great game for everyone else. :DZPS Apply Site: http://www.zeropointsoft.com/jobs.php "

Real darkness. Clever flashlight usage needed. Scary.Bots. Real bots. Scary.Controls. Good controls. Holding a key holds, 'hitting' a key toggles crouch, aim, flashlight, laser. Hold time determines jump hight. Inventive, user-friendly.Teamwork. Needed. Do not reload at the same time. Cover all angles. Assign roles.

Early Access Review
								This is an user friendly game review/in game useer manual for Interstellar marines xDDDDDInterstellar Marines, is an first person shooter game (FPS)It is yet only in the early-access stage wich means that this game may, or may not be finished. But as it seems like right now the devs will continue this game. The first impression of this game when i first saw the video that plays when you first start up the game was great. the game has great overall graphics and suits pretty much all computers (within limitations) you do not need to have an super computer to play this game and it gives good fps.In the begining you will start straight on the training course to get used to the controls.then you are on your'e own. you can choose to play either single player (story mode/campaign) or you can jump over to co-op or versus mode. but first off im gonna talk about single player:Single player means that you play versus the computer, (also called bots/Ai's)The bots in this game are well made, they seem to be ""artificial intelligent"" they detect you easier when you stand/run than they do when you crouch and move slowly.In game you will also have the options to equip lights (F), laser aim on your gun (G) or supressor (Q) when you use laser and the flashlight in game be carefull,\ because other players in game can see the laser and the flashlight (bots too)they detect you a lot more faster when you have laser and flashlight enabled. If you do not use the sound supressor on your gun, then be adviced. within a few seconds you will hear tons of robots stomping in the ground and coming sprinting towards you and ready to bash your skull in with their fists :)the envoirment in the game is mostly dark/foggy so it is hard to spot enemies as well as it is hard to stay hidden if you will have to use your flashlight. this is why i often like strobing the flashlight for few moments as it can be mistaken to be lights in game that flimmers.The thing with this game is that there are not very many guns. wich makes this game more focused on how actually skilled you are isntead of all the gear.some peopels like it. some peoples dont. the physics in the game are great. movement are well balanced as well as the gravity, in this game you do not have a bar that shows your stamina. but you still have it. so dont be sprinting around like a maniac. because this will affect how well you can aim when youre standing still as you will soon start to breathe like you have held your breath for 5 mina haha.in game you can comunicate with different players. both with text and with voice chat. voice (V) chat is more prefered as the text does not show up before you open the ""text menu"" where you writes your messages, so they do not pop up on your screen automatically.If you like to change graphics settings or general game settings and key bindings, then there is an fair ammount of options to use. and the game has a good compability to most screens. wich is quite good as i am using an 50"" tv while i play. wich can be troubling in many games.Also, every single bullet you fire in this game counts. the STATS menu will show you absolutely everything, and by saying this i mean absolutely EVERYTHINGyou can see how many bullets you have shot, how many kills, how many deaths, kill/death ratio, wich body part you have hit the most. and how many times you have hit the different body parts counted per bullet.so theres lot of room for competition with your friends about the best stats.it is also displaying what your favourite weapon is.The in game controls are easy to maneuver and is easy to get used to.If you want to play online either in co-op or in versus battles there are plenty of servers in different locations so you can use the filters to browse for servers that is filling your recuirements of ping, difficulty, game mode and so on.If you have any questions or any issues or maby even a bug report then you can just contact the devs via twitter, facebook or the steam game forum page, they are really fast at responding. and they are also really friendly.i have already reported in a few bugs that aint a big deal and they responded within 20 minutes.GG DEVS AND KEEP IT UP!so i give the support area an 10/10 points just for that.One of the biggest thigns about this game is that even it is a futuristic/sci-fi game it is still really realistic wich means things work out in the game as it would in real life, as an example: laser aim. in many games they make the laser beams a solid red beam that is highly visiblie to all players. but i real life you would not be able to see the laser beam unless theres some dust particles in the air. the more dust particles in the air, the more visiblie the beam gets.and in the game. it is just slightly visiblie as it is under normal circumstances in real life.the flashlight is dynamic light. it fades over distance and lights up the room like a real flashlight. it is not a static/flat light.BEAUTIFUL!when you run, your character starts breathing more heavily. and starts to run slower.if you get injured. your vision will become blurry and you will have an hard time to see your surroundings until you recover.in the interview of the devs they say they wanted to create this game as realistic as possiblie for sci-fi games. and they did it pretty well!in general this game is a whole lot of fun and really exciting and it is a great game and personally i have high expectations for this game as it got such big potentional to become something big and if you like fps games. then this is the game for you. in general i give this game an 8/10 points.reason i do not give it 10/10 is because of there is a few bugs, but im pretty sure this will be fixed pretty soon.the campaign does not have much of an ""story"" but this is just what i like with games.the multiplayer part is 10/10but as i said earlier. this is still an early access game. so it is not done yet and it will improove over time. it is a good buy and i do recommend this game.this is one of the best FPS multiplayer games made in a really long time.Lock'n load. and prepare for having some real fun !(i have  made an in game video wich i will post up here pretty soon)and ps: excuse my english grammar, im not from an english speaking country ;)heres my video reviev in game:

								If you look at the hours I have put into this game that is pre alpha, you will see that I am continuously and thoroughly enjoying this game as it develops. I am eager to finally play the finished version no matter if it is still some time away. This game has taken me through a variety of emotions from fear, frustration, elation, and more. All of these things make it fun and challenging. It takes some time to get used to, because of some of the pre alpha anomalies.  It is like a new pair of shoes. They look good, but when you try them on, they don't fit at first. After wearing them for a while they feel great and become your favorite. Some people have problems getting used to the game, or have issues getting it running on their hardware. Just stepping over to the community with these problems and you will find a very enthusiastic and supportive dev group and player base that offer up loads of support to get you through the rough patch. This game has the makings of a great single player horror FPS, and a great multiplayer competitive shooter. Add in the ability to do multiplayer co-op, and it becomes an epic game. It has a fine balance between frantic shooter and tactical shooter. As I see the story plans unfold, I suspect I will be enveloped by an epic single player story when it is finished.As long as this game stays on the current heading, it will become a classic that everyone will remember. I have so much fun with this game that I bought it for all my closest gaming buddies.If you buy it based on this review, I only hope that you enjoy it as much as I do, or meet me on the server and let me help you work those new shoes in until they are comfortable.

								This game is agressivley fair. The balance of the maps is remarkable, and the perioding changes in lighting and atmosphere really help to shake up the playing field and ensure that a team doesn't win simply by virtue of being ""on a roll"". Everyone uses the same gun, and that gun has a red-dot sight, laser pointer, and flashlight. The gun is satisfying to use and kills with relative ease. From the very beginning, I felt like I had a fair chance against anyone, and not once have I ever experienced the all-to-faimilar rage feeling of being killed in what feels like an ""unfair"" way, be it camping, quick-scoping, or improbable longshots.That being said, the game feels very slow. Movement is slower than you would expect, and my character feels sluggish overall. The feeling of awkwardness disspiates quickly, but is there nonetheless.The graphics are nothing stellar, but they are certainly pleasant and adequate. The blackness of night and the glow of the lights are beatiful, but the snow feels very cheaply done and could use some improvement. The gun is a fairly generic SMG/Assault Rifle hybrid. Player models can open their helmets but still look like generic SWAT Team members.In conclusion, the game is fun and enjoyable. Well worth $15 (or $7.50 from the Humble Store). Expect to get at least a few fun hours out of it, and hopefully a lot more as the game develops and gets more content.PS- Playing at night is probably the best experience in the game. There is a finesse to the strategy of when to use/not use your flashlight, and it feels appropriatley tense and exciting. Many ninja opportunities are present.PPS- You cannot jump or crouch, which is sort of odd, but not particularly annoying, at least for me.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an excellent example of how early access can be a cruel world for us customers; I love the concept, but I find the product to be lacking. Sure, you could say ""Well of course the product is lacking - it's early alpha!"" but there comes a point where that ship sails and you're stuck with dreams and promises.Maybe they are still working on the bigger picture - the 'game' they pitched to me when I payed for my early access copy. Who knows? At the rate that updates are pushed out, that light at the end of the tunnel seems to never get any closer.The game in its current state is good. Just good; Your time in I.M. will consist of tension-filled SWAT style room searching and clearing, fighting robots in dark rooms and eerie spaces. The tension I.M. creates in these moments is fantastic. On more than one occasion I found myself frozen with panic, even when playing with friends in co-op, desperately trying to listen out for the direction at which a hissing robot would approach. This gets old quickly however when you've played the same mission twice or more, encountering the same dull colours I.M. seems to have in abundance. Everything looks like it's... placeholder, to be blunt; perhaps the drab, grey scenery is an artistic style choice made by the developers, and perhaps it does not appeal to my particular taste - my point is, everything looks strangely bland, as if rushed and put together as placeholder textures. Being early access, I would expect this to be standard practice for a game's aesthetics in its early stages, but when does it end? When will this be worked on? Take away the lighting and everything's just.... flat grey. It's strange that this is the case after all this time of development (some say two years).Robots are your sworn enemy in this game. Do not be mislead; there are no aliens or 'land sharks' to shoot in I.M. in its current state. The entirety of this early access game has been constructed as a 'training' simulation for when you take on the real threat. This sounds great, but.... must we really put up with 'training' for years upon years until actual meaningful gameplay comes our way? Where is this alien threat the developers speak of? When do we get to experience their beautiful vision for a game, huh? It's not there, do not expect it to be included should you buy I.M. early access.The hours that I've put into this game are not impressive. Certainly not. Despite this I feel as if I've begun to stretch my enjoyment out of this game to its breaking point (actually, I might never get the chance, as I'll tell you); No one's playing this game any more. I bought I.M. for the promise of excellent co-op gameplay - it did not disapoint, at least for my first few play throughs. Sadly, servers are now empty. This alone should be reason enough to not invest your money. Too much time has passed and not enough has happened to retain the community's interest in playing I.M..I love the concept of this early access game. Usually that should be enough to get me to give a thumbs-up for early access, but I can't, not in this case. I honestly feel like you'll be wasting your money. I.M. is moving so very slowly that I'm sure it's just not a priority for the developers any more, and will never be finished, even to a barely acceptable level.The most recent update is titled.... ""Update 21: Falling Damage"". This just about sums it up. Is this even noteworthy? In the update notes, yes, but it speaks volumes of just how slowly this game is moving.My faith in Interstellar Marines is wavering. I cannot recommend this early access game. I'm disapointed. This concept for a game is great - but that's all it still is, mostly just a concept, a promise yet to be fulfilled. "

								I can't believe I'm going out of my way to not recommend this game instead of just leaving, but I feel like it's important for players to know.Don't board this sinking ship.It's been almost nothing but groundwork, tweaks, fixes and QOL additions for nearly two years, excluding 'Hell Week' which is a survival game mode which spiced up core gameplay a little bit but left the rest of the game collecting dust. If you discount that, there's been few reasons for players to re-visit the game for more than a mission/match or two before leaving again, as content additions are so incredibly tiny. Yeah, sure, implementing systems like stamina and falling damage are important for a game, but after two long years of additions like this, there's still a bland and simple core gameplay across all game modes. No new weapons, enemies or gear that changes gameplay itself. Just more slow cautious gameplay with two and a half weapons.Players both old and new have expressed their concerns to the devs on what they're prioritising work on, only to be brushed aside pretty quickly by typical PR talk and the fanboys that agree with it. ""We need to lay all the groundwork before we can invest in other content,"" is the popular go-to for anyone bringing their priorities into question. But after two years of just groundwork, they're still refusing to add tangible content like weapons to keep players actually interested. And with a lack of interest, the servers are empty. Dead. Maybe 10 people online globally if you're lucky, 50 on an update day. But they don't seem to care, because despite this they're still pushing development on 'Hell Week', a mode designed for 30+ players in a battle royale, which is barely ever populated. And the paying, supporting players who are still here are probably wondering, ""what has all our money gone towards?"" because the devs are at the point of taking on volunteer staff. Yes, they lack animators and modellers... And if they supposedly do have some as volunteers, then they certainly aren't using them.Don't board a sinking ship. Go play Insurgency and imagine it's sci-fi, then you'll already be playing what this game is aspiring to be. Someone comment on this in three years so I can come back and see if they've added new tangible content, or if they just kept tweaking the tiniest details and systems that should be icing on the cake later.

Early Access Review
								The game had a great potential of being an atmospheric story driven Sci-Fi shooter but through the last 4 years (out of total 6 years in development) the developers went the wrong way. It seems their new goal is too make a multiplayer shooter which is a huge letdown after their previous trailers and early announcments. Right now the game has very little content to offer. A handful of multiplayer maps, two weapon models and one enemy model. Even the frequent update schedule is not helping because the updates have little to no new content added. All they do is tweak some minor things like the colour of text in the main menu or the player's movement speed. Honestly this is something you'd see in a small patch after the game is released.The game feels empty, flat and too ""basic"". It has no replayability because of its complete emptyness. There is nothing to see, there is nothing to do and there is no hope it will change in the nearest future. Find your money a better use.Edit:It looks like I've made a mistake stating that the game is in the development for 6 years. Actually according to this[crowdsourcecapital.blogspot.ru] article the game is being developed for 11 years. Eleven. Years.			"

								The game is sound, it just needs more weapons, an actual storyline and love. Most of all is the love. Updates are rare and focus on PvP, which is the wrong focus for the game. The devs NEED to focus on Co-op or singleplayer missions and they NEED to do so since BEFORE all the PvP updates. PvP is good, but needs an actual playerbase to play with. The playerbase would increase with more singleplayer/co-op gameplay centered updates.Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this game. It is beautiful and only lacking in weapon diversity, actual storyline and TLC.			"

								All but the most devoted fans have left, the money is drying up, and the development team is falling apart. The only hope is for an interested publisher to fund it. Can't reccomened this to anyone except for gamblers because the odds of this game being completed is 1:100. The WhyInterstellar Marines got people excited with its idea of a sci-fi tactical shooter with scary co-op using Landsharks. Unforunately development cycle priorities were unplanned and screwed up from the beginning.The HowMost of the developmental efforts were focused on PvP matches, or what could best be described as a well made counter-strike mod with three guns. At some point a co-op effort was made, but it was poorly directed. Forgettable rogue robot AI's were implemented with lame-duck go here and stand there objectives. ZPS was too afraid of a buggy co-op Landshark release, so they avoided the issue altogether by making a different game. With robots and PvP matches. "

 THE GOODInterstellar Marines is a very good game with multiple modes to play on. I haven't complete any missions, however I was very close on the Starcrown mission. I found the community to be pretty nice in the fact that they give nice tips. The game's servers are empty but there are usually 2-5 full/ partly full of players.+ guns are good+ missions+ controls+ community+ no game breaking crashing THE BADThe flashlights don't seem to work for me, and i can't see in some of the mission during the night times and pitch black stations. I also found that some of the maps are spawn killer haven. This isn't really a bad point, but i hope they add capture the flag, team death match, and king of the hill. I would also like a game mode where its the bots verus 8-16 players. - flashlight doesn't work (for me) - more game modes- more missions-a campaign for single player? "

								Co-op just got released and holy sh*t please buy this game. It is the most intense terrfying multiplayer I have ever played in my life. I got online with a buddy and these robots stalk you, flank, change postions and do everything in their power to kill you. They also weren't designed to be terrifying yet they somehow are. They look human enough for someone to feel comfortable around them but the lack of facial features and the fact that they sprint full tilt at you when they notice you makes them horrifying. It is definitely rough around the edges as its a work in progress and if you have been worried about the long development time these people know what they are doing the shooting feels great, the design is amazing (fantastic lighting, weather effects, AI is almost perfect and the guns feel powerful) and these guys know how to make a games tense. No music just ambiance, enemies are almost always heard before they are seen, you never know if the robots or moving or its just your partners footsteps. This game is just amazing and they are planning to have SHARKS WITH MUSCULAR LEGS and tons of other crazy enemies and 27 weapons. BUY IT PLEASE			"

								Ambitous, but stuck in developement hell. The evnrionment and gunplay is a really immersive experience. The lighting and shooting feels really good. Its sad that its losing attention and hype because we all want the experience it promises. I think if it gets more funding and they focus on the singleplayer coop part of the game it would be in a better place. Toss out pvp bring in it later. Focusing on balancing and fixing pvp is a waste of time and resources. Game feels empty and needs to bring its original player base back.			"

								Don't skip my review just because of the low playtime, I have played this excessively offline and on a friend's pc when I didn't have it :PI don't usually write reviews for games, but when I do, it is usally because of the impact this has had on my life. My first Steam Card was $10, which I used to buy Garry's Mod (newer gamers would understand).When I saw this game 2 to 3 years ago, my jaw dropped.The graphics look amazing, the gameplay looked fun and it wasn't something I would play (as I didn't have much money anyways). I started to save up for it, coin after coin, stacking up on my bookshelf, eagerly waiting till the day I could pack those cents into an envelope to my friendly neighbourhood Steam Card dealer. When I got it, it exeeded my expectations by worlds. It was a new world to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Fast forward 3 years, and after I have played many new games and saved lots more money, I still have this game in my Favourites in my Library. I wanted to check out if there was more progress and was apalled at the sign saying 'Mixed' reviews. Why?! I asked myself. I started to scroll through the reviews and almost all of them were: ""its not finished"", or ""no updates, still buggy""I say to you, did you read that this is EARLY access? It means it is still being worked on. When I saw that there is only one developer left working soo hard on this, my heart really cries out to him. And if you people are so mad, just think about it. It's a $10 game. GAME. Someone is trying extremely hard to make it fun for you, and you complain that he is slow. 1 person. I really recommend this game, and shout out to the developer, thank you for your hard work.To those of you reading this, the developer's motto is FTLOTG. It stands for 'for the love of the game'. I think this really shows where the developer's heart is.Thanks for reading, and think to yourself before you stain this game's reputation even further by posting a negative review without really thinking.-CrimsonPythonP.S, to the dev, I think you should put this as a free weekend to increase publicity!

								Time goes by, interstellar war stays the same. That is - a bunch of grey halls with grey buildings and occasional light sources, filled by a bunch of grey people in grey suits of armor wielding grey guns. At night.I first bought the game when it was nothing but a single boot camp map with lighting and weather effects that you could toggle. Two years later it's mostly that but the lights and weather are out of your control - it's always night and occasionally it rains. There's a multiplayer component, but it's all ""basic boot camp"" styled with everyone wearing the same armor (that does not protect you) and using the same three guns which are neither precise nor different from each other.And as a whole the game feels deliberately clunky. Your helmet's faceplate is literally stained with grease and fingerprints and whites out shen shone directly upon. You can lift it, but you lose the HUD (it's admirably realistic, but what the actual joy). Your soldier runs out of breath BY WALKING. Walk for 30 seconds (or run for 10) and there you go - exhausted, can't aim at all. As for audio - extremely loud footsteps and actual tinnitus. It's a very realistic fat dude with a toy gun simulator, for all it's worth.I would have recommended it over a year ago when it had actual promise. But now... Not really. This ship has sailed and sunk.			"

Early Access Review
								""When is the next update?""""Next update.""~ ZPS.Bozar (the community manager) answering my question.Alright, now for an actually correct review.This game first of all is in Early access, as you may have noticed already. Surely some of you might think ""Oh great, it's another one of those sh*tty games where people are only begging for money, instant downvote."" okay, no, it's not as bad as it sounds, in fact, the game is quite decent even though it's a Unity engine based game, and I don't blame them for using such an engine, knowing how they got bankrupt a few years back. So far I will only say the game is in decent condition, not that many gamebreaking bugs, some neat coop and gameplay experience, and it's filled with good people (except for me, I am the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥of the game... probably), the community is mostly lively, and one of the devs (A.K.A. ZPS.Bozar (the community manager)) make Monday and Tuesday (possibly Wednesday even) community gatherings to keep the community updated with what's going on, what are the plans, when will be the next update coughnextupdatecough, and some off topic randomness with a couple of good laughs and shooting eachother in the faces, because hey, that's what the game is about.Speaking of updates, yes, this game gets updated monthly as soon as possible, while almost 95% of the updates do get delayed due to some bugs and glitches that seem to pose a threat on what the gameplay might end up like (stuff like missing keycard spawns in which they don't spawn at all, waypoint breaks, AI errors, falling through stuff and so forth), personally, even though the devs do put up annoying delays which just make us wait a few additional weeks for a hyped update to come out... and thus likely crash a train labled ""Hype train"" full of innocent people who are only looking to see what the game has to offer. But still, the devs always do it for a good cause, they want to make the game as solid and stable as possible, whilst also give a few balancing tweaks to make sure that no one is overpowered in any way, so that's always an up. And besides, all the scripting and modelling and animating and map making is not as easy as it sounds for a small dev team, really.But now, onto the fun stuff: The gameplay.The gameplay is pretty solid, you are brought in with so far two guns (an SMG and an assault rifle, more are on the way, so give it a wait), at 7 PvP maps, all with a constant changing enviroment and increasingly good atmosphere, which will always keep you on your toes. Several singleplayer maps which can be played in coop on certain servers (more on that later on), and right now, a gamemode called Deadlock (before it was Deathmatches and Team Dominations, though these will also be brought back soon enough in the later update). Personally I like the Deadlock gamemode, it's an onslaught of an 8v8 (if you're lucky to get in a full server) where the two teams have to either capture all of the 7 points or eliminate the entire enemy opposition before they lose all the zones or get mauled by the enemy force. It's like Insurgency with Skirmish, capture a point to get your team back, although in this case, it respawns only one but (hopefully) useful teammate which has died before, which is always a good thing to do, because having the enemy outnumbered is a always an up for your team, although, just because they have only one last marine standing (or LMS for short, that, or ""That guy who is gonna die and fail our squad because he has no idea what he's doing."") can always, and I mean ALWAYS, make a turn to the game where in the end it's YOUR team that gets outnumbered, and guess what, it wasn't because your team sucks, it's because the enemy team knows where to go first, where last, where the enemy might be, what point to cap, where to camp, and so forth, it's all basically tactics that bring this up, and that's the best part, there is always a way for something to go right or painfully and horribly wrong, and the game can easily be twisted by a single person's actions, wether was it a point capture or an enemy neutralization... or just smart corner camping, HELL, ANYTHING GOES BASICALLY. But mainly, it's the teamwork that keeps the team rolling, covering certain areas to prevent flanking, reviving dead teammates next to you (did I tell you that there is actually reviving in the game? Well, I tell you now, there is reviving in the game, use it dammit) to keep the odds against the enemy, and usually an accurate aim and some good reflexes will be able to get you out of the frying pan (and possibly into the fire if you're unlucky enough...), even though some people say it feels a bit like CoD coughgodieinafirecough and a bit like quake, well, I might have to agree there a bit, it does have a slight feeling to it, but never too much, as one going CoD style against the enemy will have him killed and his team to utter failiure (never underestimate the enemy, they can always appear smarter than they look). As for the AI of the game... weellllll... let's just say they still have a lot to improve with their robots, since they're buggy as hell (running into walls, shooting at people's feet, staring at the sky for no apparent reason, did I mention running into walls?), but nonetheless always fun to play against on harder difficulties (Realistic is the highest difficulty, just so you know, and I recommend that difficutly to be palyed at all games and times), beacuse it will always give you more of a reason to use cover and move around slower, because a few shots means death. So yeah. Speaking of dying, headshots are always instakills, so keep your head somewhere safe at all times... no, not underneath a bucket you baka. In the new update they introduced a stamina and accuracy system, which will obvously affect how you aim and such, so don't run around too much or you'll be hitting everything but your target, plus, you'll be moving with the speed of a snail if you drain out completely, you have been warned.But what are the singleplayer/coop games like?Well, so far there are 2 campaign mission, The Neurogen incident and Starcrown aerospace, which are both pretty good, even though Neurogen is a little bigger and darker, which is always good, while Starcrown is basically ""Take that keycard to open that door so you can get a keycard to open that door so you can then pick up the intel thingy that looks like a keycard so you can open the evac zone and spawn tons of annoying robots which will blow your head off in a split of a second."" ... That could've been better said, but sadly, I am being honest here. The Starcrown map is basically taking keycards to open doors like all the time... Still it does give the option to go through several enterances (Front door (my favorite), a side enterance at the left (which somehow looks more like a lobby...), a giant hangar door at the back, and a very convenient fence opening on the left storage area) which does give a little more variety to what ways you want to do this, always an up, even though in the end you end up Rambo-ing out to the evac zones with your friends, nevertheless a good laugh of constantly getting shot at. There are also several other coop maps, 2 Elimination maps (Mainline and Stronghold) in which you have to kill all the robots to win, 2 Survival maps (Colony and Operations) where you have to turn the power back on (CONTRADICTION + SPOILER ALERT: You actually end up turning the power off, not on, if you get the idea), and avoid getting killed by all the robots, and lastly an Escape map, in which you gotta get topside by doing some simple objectives.Welp, looks like I'm running out of space to type stuff, so I'm just gonna conclude this with a ""Must have!"". I would've typed in so much more if I had space, sadly, Steam hates me. :CBuy this game, buy the spearhead edition, support the devs, and I get a cookie. C:			"

								The team behind this game has great passion and great ideas for this game, but they lack the funds or the manpower to follow through with this project. I am sorry to give them a negative review but this game honestly just isn't worth it at this point. The community is dead with only one or two servers actually having players on them, and the gameplay gets a bit boring after a bit.Stay far away from this sinking ship.			"

								This review is coming from someone that followed the kickstarter of this game, and was incredibly excited to see it on steam.The moment the game came out on steam I bought it. My expectations were low, seeing as it was early access, and I was unsuprised at how little content there was. When I first saw the game, and when I bought it, I was hooked on how strongly they advertised an emmersive coop experience. The space sharks, the atmosphere, the whole thing looked like the coop shooter kind of experience I'd been looking for in other games, with a PvP gamemode tacked on for fun.Updates were slow, but I tolderated it. Small team, small funding, right?Updates continued to crawl along, with more content than ever. So why am I not recommending the game?Well the devs seem to have forgoten what they advertised the meat of this game being: a coop game. They continually realise PvP maps, PvP gamemodes, and other PvP specific features. There are currently two Coop maps. Both are a lot of fun, they both feel incredibly lacking in parts, but still fun.However, theres been two maps for almost half a year now. Maybe if they add  actual  coop features, I'll change my review, but as of now I'm incredibly dissapointed.Don't buy this game unless youre a fan of dissapointment.			"

								I simply cannot recommend this game at present. The concept is good, but it seems the developers take forever to release updates and the game is still missing some extremely important mechanics to make it worthwhile. While the graphics and sound are fairly good there is not really much else to say in favour of the game at present.- You cannot create your own servers. You are limited to a handful that the devs provide which are map/gametype locked. Their ""reason"" for not releasing the server-side files is that they are scared people are going to reverse engineer it. Utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.- Only 2 weapons that are very similar. Infinite ammo, no pickups in the game world.- Enemy AI is sub-par at best and laughable at worst.- Only 2 co-op missions (at the time of this review) - so not a lot of content if you buy the game for co-op instead of PvP or Player vs Bot.- Some of the level design is wonderful, others may very well drive you to the brink of insanity due to poorly communicated objectives, a broken waypoint system and some truly atrocious level design.- The tutorial doesn't even work. You get stuck at a door and cannot continue.All-in-all, it's very lackluster. The sad thing is, they have the foundations for a great game here, but with devs that are taking forever and ignoring some massive features, I say pass on this one for now.Jimbo Rating: 4/10			"

								Bought this game a little over 3 years ago, really liked the ideas and aesthetic of the game, Co-op survival story mode, Terrifying land sharks and claustrophobic combat.I played some good matches on multi player, very intense and nerve shredding, but the overall package was pretty barren, so figured i would come back to it after more development time. Since i have checked back from time to time over the years hoping for some progress on the initial goals to no avail, No story, no land sharks, hardly anyone on the servers, it's dead. I feel bad for the guys that paid for the spearhead edition, they are never going to see the future content they paid for if the base game hardly exists. Too much time was spent meandering with minor mp updates and engine conversions till they had probably burned through all their cash and then lost their staff.Another example of the darkside of early access games, poorly planned and unable to meet any of its major goals / selling points.

								Interstellar Marines is very polished, the gameplay is fun, controls are tight. However the devs seem more preoccupied with developping the pvp aspect of the game, despite adventising itself as an ""old school, co op, roleplaying, non linear gameplay"" game, it seems to have forgotten that entirely and the past updates have been PVP orientated. I personally think that this game has tremedous potential (hence the positive rating), but to reach that potential the devs have to realize that not a lot of people are interested in another deathmatch first person shooter. They need to develop the co op side of things since thats there the true potential is.			"

								I honestly believe this game has a lot of potential, and I like the interface and how they really focused on the tiny details (in particular I love the helmet effects). But, if I was to be honest, I wouldn't recommend this to my friends. Its been in developement for too long, and at some point you have to face facts. The developers are adding to the details of the game, but the overall game... just isn't there. Games like Insurgency, ARMA, Battlefield, (and hell even COD) get the focus of their games right. This game has no real focus. Its been in developement too long, and I just don't see it going down a path where its going to turn into the game that I think everyone hoped it would be all of a sudden.			"

 Awesome game with a bright future ahead of it    I have been following this game since it launched its kick starter, and i can clearly say this is one of the only games out there that dont do it for the money, the do it because they want to make the game they have alklways wanted and they need our help to fund it. Had it since the first days it was released and the game itself is growing quite quick for the time its been on steam. The bots in this game are very responsive and realistic, the player HUD is imersive and the only two weapons feel great. For now it has two coop missions with some lore and a few more that are just challenges, and it also contains some team pvp. This is my first real review so it might be pretty bad but all i want to say is that I have extremely high hopes for this amazing game.			"

As for Wargames, it received life-replenishing updates, & much-needed bug-squashing.If you are contemplating whether or not you should give Interstellar Marines a chance despite the many reviews which claim that updates are released at the speed of a turtle; I want you to know, I contemplated it too! I don't regret my decision even a little =)! Remember; You can request a refund if you decide Interstellar Marines isn't for you within 2 hours of gameplay. "

Early Access Review
Written on 08/08/2015I previously wrote a lengthy review as to why I wouldn't recommend this game any more (I had a Recommended review up before that which I didn't take down for a good while after I couldn't really recommend it any more), except Steam didn't want me to post it even after hacking massive chunks out of it to make it under the supposed character limit for Steam reviews that I found mentioned somewhere after googling it (many people write reviews over that count so it can't be right) and planning to paste those sections in the comments. I didn't feel I could remove any more and still have the main points in the actual review and covered well enough to say most of what I wanted to say, so I decided to leave it for the time being. I might upload it elsewhere and link it here at some point.In essence, I'd stated that while I wouldn't recommend it any more for multiple reasons, it was still a game people could potentially enjoy at least for a while before coming to the same conclusion as me and no longer enjoying / recommending it, and also a game that people could possibly be happy with from purchase up until it's completion (if it's completed). They focus too much on adding things and too little on keeping what they already have in a playable / enjoyable state. Too much on drawing people in with additions to make it look like they're making progress and too little on fixing the ever increasing number of bugs and making sure those additions are in a good enough state to feel like they add to the game, rather than detract from enjoyment. Too much on drawing in new players and too little on retaining those they already have.Now I feel I would not recommend it in the slightest, not even to those who look at the store page and recent gameplay and think “this looks like my sort of game!” because I don't know what the heck the devs are doing but I don't care for it.I have the following to keep things short (at least in this review..), however, to see some of my reasons for not recommending this game there'll be a fair bit of reading involved, and I can't guarantee that by the time you check these links out the threads won't be deleted. Just know that despite my hours I would most definitely no longer recommend this game.http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867777620602/The two previous (now locked) threads:http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867768186035/ - The original and first to be locked.http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867769392545/ - The second and second to be locked.http://imgur.com/PaBEvnL The community manager handed over the discussion moderation to the other community manager.

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines has been one of the most entertaining games I have played, despite the fact that I am not a huge fan of the FPS genre. Zero Point Software's vision of creating a Sci-Fi tactical shooter is incredibly impressive, as is their work on the game so far. The game is highly detailed, incredibly immersive (in fact, it can be quite terrifying at times for that very reason,) and its multiplayer experience is actually pretty good as well. In order for your team to succeed in PvP, for example, you must work with your team to be successful; trying to be a hero and throwing yourself in the middle of dense firefights invariably gets you killed, and denies your team an otherwise valuable asset. Co-op is also quite interesting as well, and provides a formidable challenge in its own right. Playing the game on your own is not quite as enjoyable as playing with others, but do bear in mind this game is meant to be a multiplayer experience, rather than a campaign-based shooter.Interstellar Marines, in my opinion, is an excellent game as it is. It does, however, suffer from a nagging problem that many early access games suffer today -- it has been, and still is, largely in its infancy after many years of development. The ZPS team is small and incredibly limited -- anyone who has been paying attention to their development knows this. It is for this reason I urge people to cut this team some slack. However, I also believe the way ZPS went about marketing this game was not smart. If I could give a piece of advice to ZPS, and I say this as a hobbyist developer, it is this:Do not publish your game on Steam, even on early access, until you have achieved your game's primary goals. If this means keeping it off Steam for three years, so be it. You'll be able to focus on building your game as opposed to (expending resources better spent making a finished product) supporting an active community. Furthermore, Zero Point Software has lost hundreds, potentially thousands, of players over the years as people lost interest in a title they would otherwise be enjoying if it had been released as a finished product. By publishing this game to Steam before it was complete, Zero Point Software lost a large chunk of supporters.Am I suggesting taking IM off the shelf until it is complete? No. It is far too late to take IM off Steam, as it would upset the few people still enjoying the game. If this game were finished before being put on Steam, I have no doubt it would be at least half as much a hit as TF2 for a good while.So, do I suggest purchasing this game? No. HOWEVER, if you appreciate the ZPS team's work and wish to see development continue, I highly recommend supporting these developers as they persue their goal of completing this game. Make donations, and to those who already own the game, please provide plenty of feedback. They have put a lot of effort into making what you see before you, and it would be a heartbreak to see this opportunity wasted. I hope it's not too late for this game to see a resurgence.			"

Early Access Review
								As of writing this, I have logged a good 217 hours into the game according to Steam.Update: 680 hours now.Since this game is in early access, the information written here is subject to change. Right now, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game to play with your friends or even random people online using the ingame VOIP.Stuff the game has:Enemies - Robots, Real People (in multiplayer), TR-100's (they are all your enemy)Guns - SMG, Assault Rifle with 3x scopeSingleplayer/Coop - Neurogen Incident, Nucleus Escape Mission, Operations (Swarm mode)Multiplayer - 5 or 6 maps with day/night cycles that happen while matches are happeningIt has a HUD which can be disabled if you get shot but don't die. It will regenerate if you don't get shot for a little while longer.A ranking system which basically quantifies how experienced of a player you are. Your Training Rank goes up the more Training Points you have. The first ten levels are easy to get, and so are the next twenty or thirty. After that you notice it takes a little longer to level up. It takes 1000 TP to get to TR-10. It takes 100,000 TP to get to TR-90, then 200,000 TP to acheive TR-100.So that's basically what it has. I glossed over a few things, for example, the maps. Some of the maps are dynamic, changing midway through the level, altering slightly how the game is played on that map (map name: Elevation, Colony).SHAMELESS PLUG - Youtube channel:  N00bvlog (n00bvlog) Now, back to your programmed content.The Neurogen Incident is a huge coop map which could potentially be very creepy for you to play. You could play by yourself, but I would recommed playing coop because there are no checkpoints and if you die, you die, which could be very frusterating if you play for a long time and then lose all your progress. In coop, your team mates have the opportunity to revive fallen teammates during a span of 15 seconds before their team mate is gone for good. The map is huge and has some performance issues (which, I'm sure, are being worked on).There are also some smaller missions which do not suffer from a performance hit quite as much.There's a new gamemode called Hell Week. It is pretty fun when there are people to play it with. The gist of this mode is this: it goes up to 64 players who gather Combat Points throughout the game. You can get these points by either opening loot crates scattered around each of the 9 maps, killing players and picking up their points in a dropped backpack, or going for high risk, high reward supply drops. There are 9 aforementioned maps of differing themes: winter, jungle, moon, canyon... etc. Eventually a countdown timer starts and, after 2 minutes, the player with the lowest score gets eliminated from the game. The last 4 players to be alive have ""survived the Hell Week"" and have won the game.There are 2 versions of the game mode. The first is basically called Hardcore Hell Week. If you die, you're dead. You can't get back into the game and have to wait 4 hours for another 'week' to start. This makes playing the game EXTREMELY intense. In the early iterations of HW, there was no team support. Once I tried to team up with a guy on VOIP. We spent a long time looking for each other. All of a sudden, he told me to jump. I jumped. He noticed me before I did and needed to quickly check to make sure it was me.Now that we had successfully teamed up, I got him to guard me while I hid in a bush so I could go AFK and pee.It was super intense. Unfortunately, because people were frusterated at having to wait extended periods of time between Hell Weeks, ZPS made another version of HW that is the one we, for the most part, play today. In this newer version, you can respawn after you die. It doesn't become hardcore until about 30 minutes passes by. ZPS also implemented teams so you can team up with up to 3 other people and share your points across all team members. This makes die-ing less frusterating, but it also takes away the tense-ness of the gamemode for me.Performance-wise, this game does not perform the greatest on my machine I seem to always get 30 FPS (a range of 15 - 45). Here are my specs so you can judge whether this is good or bad. Intel Duo core CPU running @ 3 GHz. RAM: 4GB, Graphics Card: Nvidia GTX 670.As far as I know, the update schedule of the game is about 1 update per month.EDIT: due to the game selling poorly, there are fewer people working on the game. I estimate updates will take much longer than 1 per month now.So, this game is coming along quite fine, and, with each update it is becoming more and more the game I want it to be (such is the nature of Early Access). Obviously it is not there yet, so if you want a full game that runs great, don't buy the game yet. Read another review in about a year or so. It should have many more features and potentially be optimized by then.Update: The game might come out before Half Life 3. Development has slowed. Even so, I still recommend it.Hope this helps. "

Early Access Review
								You can't just buy this game while it is EARLY ACCESS, and then complain about bugs, insulting and without giving any constructive opinion. That really doesn't help the developers. Probably because of the same people with disgusting attitude many games were abandoned. This is really really beta, you have only a weapon, so you can understand how beta this is.First of all, i didn't spend much time in the game to be honest, but i can give you my opinion so far, i really think it can be helpful.I didn't encounter any glitches like i don't know, falling through the map, so far. The game is well optimised but sometimes i get random FPS drops, but not very often.What can be improved:I love the shadows and the lighting, but i think you can work a little bit more on the shadows because sometimes you can confuse them with an enemy (or it might just be me).You could also improve the running, it feels more like sliding. (some more work on the walking wouldn't be bad either)The shooting mechanism, it doesn't feel very exciting or real.I love how weather changes and it starts raining, it is awesome, but since you have a helmet with some sort of face-protection i think the rain drops should slide, not just stick there.Chat system, currently, honestly it is awful, i am pretty sure nobody likes to open a window to see the new messages from other players.Accuracy, for some reason it is kinda weird, it happened to me to shoot an entire clip into someone and ending up by getting killed (even if i burstly shot).So far, i am impressed with this game, at this stage of the game, i honestly expected to see through walls, fall through the map, getting stuck inside the floor, maybe application not responding. So far, you really did a good job. And don't let this game go because of idiotic people who just rant about it without giving a constructive opinion, just because they couldn't read 'Early Access'. This game can become huge! It has potential more than probably 40% of the AAA shooters. "

								This is a game with a lot of potential. When I first got it back on March 2015, it promised a unique FPS experience. The maps are very interesting and even after 230 hours of gameplay I still find myself discovering new approaches. The community is competitive, relatively small and friendly which was part of what made the game entertaining. However at it's current state where the devs choose to ignore people's frequent problems, I wouldn't recommend anyone spending money on this. The development process is very, VERY slow and I've been experiencing frequent crashing for the past 2-3 months which ruins the whole experience (and the current match most of the time). Rather than dealing with the more serious problem, the devs are simply adding skins to the game. Needless to say, the direction this game has taken is what makes me not recommend it.			"

								Interstellar Marines is one of the first early access games I have played so I did not really know what to expect. So far I have played for five hours and I must say I have really enjoyed it. Sure its a unfinished product player movement is a bit stiff but there is really nothing bad I can say about this game. Rounds in matches can be very fast or take a while which is intense at times the outcome of a match can change in seconds.The environment playes a big part of the game also suddenly there will be a power failure and its pitch black which makes you change up your game plan. I would definitely recommend this game as I can only see it getting better as time progresses even as a early access game I feel like its a solid product.			"

								Well after some help from fellow players I am safely able to change my review to Highly Recommended. The promise in this game is amazing and I believe this deserves many more people to recognise it. Because I'm lazy however I'll head straight to Pros and ConsPros:  - Amazing Atmosphere. especially in gamemodes such as Elimination, The game combines slight horror with a tactical shooting experience the likes of which I haven't seen before. In most games, putting a powerful weapon into the hands of the protagonist will help ease the ""Spook Level"", In this game it doesn't. Especially with the volume turned up high, hearing a robots fast running footsteps getting closer and closer behind you is INCREDIBLY nerver racking and I love it - Shooting mechanics work very well, this game isn't another Spray'n'Pray FPS Shooter. It has a very balanced shooting system with amazing hitbox accuracy. It forces you to focus on your targets and make sure your bullets land, because if they dont you may just find yourself full of them. - Tacticality, the game makes you think about your actions. Going around a corner in the dark may only be a good idea 70% of the time, this game creates that decision of whether or not to turn your flashlight on. Need to go through a door? As soon as its open everything near you knows where you are so be ready. - Amazing FPS. As long as you don't have the bug (which can be easily fixed yourself) where the game will use integrated graphics instead of your graphics card, the game runs very smoothelyCons: - Multiple bugs, especially ones that have occured since the latest patch. However because this is early access this is to be expected - The devs don't update very often (or so I have heard). I feel like constant bug fixes are necessary for an early access game like this so I hope this improves - No option to host your own server to play with friends. You either play solo or join one of the servers availableOverall the game is very solid, it has a lot of potential and is already a very enjoyable game with friends or without them. However I haven't found a way to host a server yet, but if it is possible please tell me it would be greatly appreciated.			"

								The basic problem with most of the negative reviews is almost all include very little playtime.This game gets better and better the more you play. It is not like Counter Strike but both games share this.The charging bots will sometimes scare the crap out of you. Sometimes they seem to come from nowhere. The sounds of them moving are also VERY eerie. It reminds me of hearing the face huggers slither around in one of the earlier Alien games. Occasionally you will hear someone whispering, “Help me”. Eek. Overall, the atmosphere of this game is wonderful.The game includes many types of gameplay even though it is early assess. Personally, I like the ones that are coop against AI.The game is tactical. If you wander off on your own, you will likely soon die.Being early access, the game is clearly not finished. The basic game does play well and is a blast in its current state. That said, there are issues. The game is not optimized well yet so lag can sometimes be an issue. There are not many on the servers but I have found if I join an empty one, others join. You can also play single-player but this game is not easy on your own.The Dev’s have a lot to get done before they can call this complete and they are a small group. I like buying this type of game in early access as it is a lot of fun when patches are released. For being early access, the game is a blast and I would highly recommend it if you like tactical shooters, especially coop ones. "

								There are already plenty of reviews out there talking about the game itself. Some would argue for a review that is all that matters. However for an Early Access title that has been in development for who knows how long, the developers are also on equal grounds to be judged. Perhaps things will get better in time, but as of right now Zero Point Software is not a developer I will support any longer. The way they have treated this community lately has been nothing but disgraceful and disrespectful. The video they released is thankfully being taken down, but that will never fix any issues regarding their treatment of the community. Here is a link to a thread from Reddit, which explains everything. I will also link the third thread regarding the subject that was created by me, since the other two threads were locked. http://imgur.com/gallery/cbR1Rhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867777620602/ZPS's treatment of the community has been nothing but locking threads, making constant threats, permantley banning users, and not even hinting that they are taking anything I or any other member have put forward regarding not only the video but the treatment of their paying customers. They clearly don't care about feedback, and they clearly don't have the foresight or basic common sense to think about their actions before they make them. I tried to be as civil and respectful as possible, and they have yet to answer the points and reasoning I put forth explaining why members were upset, and why the video was not a good idea to begin with. I will never get a response, and it is also clear they could care less. Until this developer proves it can be mature and understanding, you should not entrust them with completing a game such as this. The image for Interstellar Marines was a beautiful one, and after all these years they have barely anything to show for it, aside from their harrassment of customers who bought their game out of support and trust. They have lost my support and have broken everyone's trust. Maybe when they begin to take some responsibility for their actions there could be hope, but I am doubtful and will no longer try to provide feedback. They had their chance to prove themselves apart from the usual EA dev. They failed not only themselves, but their community. As such I can not recommend the game for the shape it's currently in, or the prospect that it will ever be what it could have been.			"

								I've only played this game for 6 hours as of now, but I've gotten to rank 25 online, which isn't too bad considering 80% of people who're on there are all under rank 8.  PROS  Gameplay The gameplay is surprisily very good. Realistic, and yet not too hard.  The guns will move a bit upwards if you hold the trigger, but is still controllable, and confortable, so it's not bad. Just like other good FPS games like Battlefield(s), Medal of Honor, etc. The scope on your assault rifle is 4x zoom, but only has 20, contrary to your main weapon, which is a SMG, and holds 30. Nevertheless, the assault rifle packs a big punch, and if used right, can prove useful as a sniper would. Very accurate and easy to use. The SMG however, is all a SMG is really; quick firing, red dot scope, light, 30 round clip. Overall I like them both for what they are; one is close range, the other long range.  Maps So I haven't done very many of the single player missons yet, but I've played all the online maps that there are, which is 9. All of them are fun in their own way. The winter one is very *cough*cool*cough*, the swamp map is a nightmere in the dark, but still freakily fun, and the others are well-made with lots of spots to hide behide, and lots of spots to round a corner and get shot in the face, or walk up to a building in the dark only to find out a guy is in the shadows *dead*. Overall, they're great maps in a sci-fi setting. You won't get bored of them very quickly.  Gadgets The laser on the guns is awesome. You can see the point of it no matter where it is shining. (in the tree, on the ground, or 4 miles away) The only con about it is, in most maps whether in the dark, or rain, snow, etc, you can see the whole beam of light. Which makes it very easy to find the man holding the gun. The flashlight is very bright, but gives you away in a *cough*flash*cough*. You have to pick the right moments to turn it on. if you're in a big room, and you think you saw someone, it's totally worth turning it on to get a kill. or at least see where you are in the pitch-black moments. The silencer works, and I haven't noticed any reduced velocity as of yet. You have unlimited ammo. Keep reloading till your R button is broken. I litterally reload even if I only used two bullets. A good habit to have.Overall the gadgets have their advantages and disadvantages. Once you start playing you figue out what works best for you. CONS   Guns Although the two guns they give you by default are amazing, they do get old after awhile. And so far the game only has the two. I'm sure the devlopers will add more as they continue to add things to the game, but for now you'll have to live with the only two.  Team Killing  Oh yes, everyone's worst nightmere! Well, unlike other games that don't have team tags above players, this one does. The problem is once you get shot to a degree, your whole hub in your face screen shuts down for about 10 - 15 seconds.  In that time the person who shot you could be right outside the doorway, but the only way you can tell if it's him or your teammate is if you see a little blue on him, (which is hard to see anyways) as the friendly tags and all the digital things you see in the game are gone. (except your sites on the guns)  So yeah, there is a fair share of team killing, but it also makes it interesting for yourself when you get shoot.  Respawning Yes, when you die in an online match, (not co-op, I don't know what it's like for co-op) it takes about 100 - 120 seconds to respawn in a ten minute game. And you only have 15 seconds to be revived, which isn't very much at all, seeing is how you have to be careful in this game. But, if a teammate gets a kill, then a person get's to respawn early. or if someone captures a flag. So believe me when I say it's a team oriented game online. Overall I rate it 7/10. You will have lots of fun with it, and at the sametime get scared outta your pants in moments. And it's not finished, so get it now while it's on sale, because it's great deal.-------EDIT------- This is my first edit since a few weeks after I bought the game last February. Alot of things have changed. Hellweek was intreduced, then bots (CTR's) to hellweek. They added the pistol for the purpose of hellweek as that is your starting gun. (it's just a stripped version of the SMG just 15 round clip and semi auto with iron sites) One new map was placed into MP, and a 2nd one will be here in the next update. The weapons had a complete redo to make them more realistic. The game was upgraded to Unity 5. And alot of small things that really make a difference from a person who's played the game a ton.  The game itself is going through a hard time as of now because they're trying to implant new things but it's causing bugs while doing so. Even now they're trying to fix random game crashes that happens to just about everyone, and another bug that causing you to randomly fall through the floor. (Although that doesn't happen alot like crashes) The devs are working very hard to fix these issues, and once those get fixed, then we can see some fresh new content which  includes more co-op in the next few months. I have alot of hours, and it's because I love the PvP in this game, so much in fact that I joined a clan, and helped make that clan maybe the best clan in the game now. They're only a few clans in the game now, but that's mostly to blame because of the devlopment being slow and bugs causing fustration. Hopefully that will be fixed in the next few weeks, and Season 3 of the Phyregaming (.com for the website) league will start soon after these bugs are fixed.			"

								Early Access as hell, but what's here is enjoyable and has a lot of promise. Unlike some other Early Access games, Interstellar Marines has also been building on that promise, rather than tripping over itself constantly. It's got the best HUD in ages (A visor that actually reacts to the game world, with rain drops dripping down it, and damage eventually causing it to malfunction and no longer display friend or foe indicators. Hell, you can even open and close the visor if you want.), intense gunplay that Rainbow Six fans will instantly love, and, well, that's kind of it for now.As much fun as being paranoid, scanning around dark rooms, flipping your flashlight on for a second before turning it off again so you don't give yourself away can be, it's not going to keep you coming back for more time and time again when all that is here is a few maps, a few modes, and two guns. A complete lack of the main focus, co-op play, is also rather jarring.Still, if you need a Rainbow Six fix, this is already one of the best choices you can make. And while the updates aren't frequent, they've been consistently high quality. IM is a game to keep an eye on, if nothing else.			"

								Multiplayer: prepare to rage (If you find a server with players).Co-op:  Prepare to♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks.  if you have thin walls in your house or are prone to heart attacks and shock, please be careful.  I'm writing this just as I experienced the first co-op test.  problem is that i did not invite any friends ;-;.  Imagine being in a completely dark, sprawling hangar complex, with nobody to keep your sanity, and god knows how many robots waiting for you.  And let's not even count the scare when you see a robot but aren't sure if it's dead.  if you think left 4 dead or a similar game is scary, you ain't seen nothing yet.  I can tell that this fear I just had will be multiplied tenfold when more enemies and missions are there. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if there were good procedurally generated, dynamic missions, that would be craaaaaazy awesome (and bad at the same time).  Graphics are good, UI is amazing (Very realistic near-future/space age hybrid for the HUD) and the experience is unmatched.  god knows what it would feel like to play this on an oculus rift.  In short:  if you buy this, make sure you get a 4 pack or more for some buds, because without that sort of teamwork with people you know, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ed by 10 different species of aliens and robots.

								Pros: -good weather effects -great sound design-does nights/darkness right-decent variety of mapsCon:-Co-op missions are boring -incredibly slow development -potentially vaporware -barely any content -multiplayer is mostly dead -only 3 usable weapons In all honestly I can't recommend this game since it feels like another EA scam. The game started out with one weapon, no sprint, no crouching, no jumping, multiplayer and 2-3 maps. Now a few years later we have 3 guns, sprint, crouching, jumping, a few more maps, co-op missions, AI controlled robots. I don't see it going anywhere and I don't see why anyone should invest into this game since it still is barebones and not worth the current asking price. The devs will eventually run out of money and release this as unfinished product or maybe it will be stuck in EA limbo forever.So unless the development process speeds up and they actually add something meaningful to this game I can't recommend it			"

								There should be a limit to how long a game can sit in early access.Edit: I mostly wrote this review as a quick review to just express my opinion. This now being the top review, I feel that I should elaborate. I bought into this game very early. I'm not sure why it shows my game time as little as it does, as I played this game for proabably around ~30 hours or so. I have periodically tried this game, hoping for some significant changes to it, but it really feels like the same game it was 3-4 years ago. Sure there have been some cosmetic changes, and it is a very beautiful gtame now, but it took them over a year to even add another gun to it, making for gameplay that got stale very quickly. At this point you can still enjoy this game with a friend. The co-op definitely has some fun left in it, but there are better co-op experiences elsewhere. If this game is finally completed and has a significant single-player or co-op campaign that is worth buying, then I will update my review. Until such time I just really can't recommend a game that has felt stagnant and doesn't seem to offer much hope of improvement. One of my major issue is that I bought into this game because it claimed it was going to be a role-playing fps, it even still claims they plan to impliment this feature. I was hoping for this game to offer a new and unique fps experience, and really believed in the devs vision. But when 3 years later and these elements are nowhere to be found, the game ends up just feeling like another bland fps, and there are plenty other, finished, fps's that are worth playing over this one. There just isn't currently anything that this game offers that you can't find elsewhere save for the cool helmet mechanic (which adds nothing to gameplay).I'm not claiming the devs stole my money, or even saying it's a bad design or crap game. I simply would not recommend this game that feels stagnant, has never implemented rpg elements, and does not have enough people playing, making it difficult to find a full server nearbyI am not directly faulting the devs either. I understand that bad things happen even to good, well-meaning devs with a good vision. This game may still have hope, and could end up being amazing. But in the end, this is a review, and overall I would not recommend this game in the state that it is in. I just feel that currently I would not recommend to my friends for them to buy this game. That's my general gauge for a thumbs-up or down, would I tell my friend to buy this game? If in the future if it is finally at least close to the final vision I will absolutely update my review.			"

								Interstellar Marines is an old school tactical FPS games in a wonderful dark SCI-FI world with a realistic combat system.It's still Early Access and a small Team's working on but since the beginning i enjoyed more than 350 hours of gameplay.You can play 2 big maps in Singleplayer or 4-Player Coop: Starcrown Aerospace (infiltrate a fortress on a planet) and the Neurogen Incident (big cargo environment and science labs in space). 3 types of Challenges: Survival, Elimination or Escape you can play alone or in Coop.And the PVP mode Deadlock with a few maps for example Dynacore, Stronghold and Evacuation where you have to take points and hold'em as team. A round end's, after your team took all points or eliminated the whole opposing team. Every week there are community gatherings for EU and US where you can play with Dev's and IM-Progamer from different clans, to have a nice talk in the chat or in teamspeak. At christmas they add a funny Terminator PVP mode where one player is totally overpowered with a special-damage weapon and armour so you have to take the T-IM101 down as team or you die several times :) And the great Wargame (Hellweek) PVP Arena within 8 completely different maps (on the moon surface, in the jungle, mountains, wetlands, industrial environment and more) where you have to fight against bots and other players, collect weapons and ammo, points and marked air drops. You can play alone or teamup with other players in wargames, but after one hour the team or the first four player with the highest points will win and the round is over ,then you have to wait a few minutes until the next wargame-arena event starts. The enemys in Interstellar Marines are two kind of robots, a runner (weapon: fist) and a gunner. But there will come more, i wait hard for the alien race: the landsharks. Your equipment: 3 different weapons: SMG, AR and a pistol all with flashlight, laser and silencer (pistol without silencer) and skins for your suit and weapons, i hope a shotgun and something like a knife will come too also more types of enemys and a few animals in the environment would be perfect for the atmosphere i guess (jumpscares). But what i really love in IM ... the atmosphere, the day/night cyclus and changing weather, exhaustion system... unique. The price is definitely worth it.If i have one word for Interstellar marines: Intense.			"

								A decent indie game that, for the most part, provides excellent co-op and single player game play with a little extra multiplayer on the side that is also a great time-waster. I do recommend it only because I'd like to see this game grow & expand. Unfortunately, it's an early access game. I normally do not like early access games, especially since most of them seem to not progress any further. However, despite the extremely slow development this game has been getting, it's on a steady course to becoming a complete game somewhere down the road. I already enjoy this game as is, and imagining it in it's complete stage years from now as a tactical shooter in a realistic sci-fi future excites me.The community is fairly small and unless you've got a few friends to play with you're likely going to spend most of your time here in early access fooling around in single player fighting robots in a supposed ""training simulation"" as candidates for the Interstellar Marine program as we await the story to develop. There are two campaign missions plus two maps that host a terrorist hunt style mode, an escape mode, and a gauntlet mode of sorts. The multiplayer is what you would expect in a tactical FPS. There are some frame rate issues I've noticed.All in all, if you got some money to spend and are looking to waste some time alone or with freinds, I'd definately recommend checking this out.			"

Fear me.At 13.5 hours of gameplay, Im still loving the game, and no complaints.

								*This is an older review, but has been re-done up to update 12.**You should buy this game as soon as possible, it will only get more expensive!*I love it! So much potentional :) And its being made by danes (People from Denmark) which is awesome!I also really like the lighting and weather, the weather changing and dynamic lighting is really cool. You can change the weather in singleplayer itself by pressing N.In multiplayer it basically just switches automatically from day to night, sun to storm and rain throughout the match, which is a really nice touch.Also... LENS FLARES!! :D (I love lens flares...)You have a flashlight for when it gets dark, which looks nice actually, and a laser for hipfiring.*Note* - When you have either flashlight or laser turned on, you are easily spotted.You can reload while scoped-in, which is really nice.There is some basic HUD, you can see your ammo, if your flashlight/laser is turned on or off and theres a killfeed, as well as you are able to see capture points and scoreboards for each team.You have 2 different weapons, one is a close quarters SMG and the other one a long range rifle with a scope that can zoom even further, it has more damage but less bullets and fire rate than the SMG.You can jump, but its a jump you have to charge up before you can reach max height.You can toggle sprint by using Shift. (Default)You can crouch by pressing C. (Default)You can do covering fire by leaning up against an object and aiming with right-click. (Default)All in all i will give this 9/10 for being at its Update 12 state, and the last stars would be for fixing the FPS, optimizing it.Really cool game, highly recommended. Looking forward to seeing future updates.*You should buy this game as soon as possible, it will only get more expensive!*			"

SEE EDIT BELOWFor the love of the game, indeed.The Dev's at Zero-Point have done a great job with updates on this game and you can tell they really are making a game where they not only consider their own input, but their community's as well.When I first picked up the game, I enjoyed playing against others with nothing but just the basic SMG at a time when crouching (or jumping, I forget) wasn't even in the game, not to mention AI or actual co-op other than the Deadlock game mode.I stopped playing for a couple months and came back to find a second rifle, a fully functioning AI system that utilizes one of the two firearms and another type for melee, not to mention six co-op missions, eight maps each with its own dynamic weather and it's safe to say I was pretty blown away. The AI is fun to play with, especially on co-op, and with their ability to register light and sound they fully react to your every move and it doesn't help that they can be clever little robo-♥♥♥♥♥es sneaking up behind you and sprinting at you with a robotic screech which will startle you when you least expect it. The addition of suppressors for both firearms is great because this not only affects online play with players, but also the robots.So yeah, you can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and send all the robots a'runnin' to you and your squad. Community is friendly, helpful, and lively enough. Go on any day of the week at pretty much any time and sure enough there will be at least a couple of servers with players in them.(Edit, 3/21/2017)Well, I bought this nearly four years ago, Jan. 1st 2014 and it's been a good run. Unfortunately Hicks seems to be left completely alone on this game and realistically there's no way it'll ever be finished. I had a great time with the game and even now I just got done playing War Games with a few people, cheers Bleed Out.For old time sake I will keep recommending it.Fun fact: this was the 23rd game on my account.

								I REALLY like this game. I love the atmosphere, the play style, the little features like the helmet visor, and the gameplay. Everytime I launch it and join a server, I have a blast. If of course, there are enough people online. So why is this review negative? I support this concept. A more tactical approach to FPS shooters is a great approach, AND it's the only Sci-Fi shooter (besides the Halo series) that I like. But here is the underlying problem at its core. This game has made little progress in recent years. At its current state, the game looks like a very early access game. Of course, the steam page supports this. However, the game has been out for a couple of years now. It has not significantly improved since the launch. Should you buy it? If you have patience. The developer is struggling to keep its footing. They haven't released any updates in months (Aug 2014). I wouldn't recommend it until more content is released. Let the developers figure out what to do before you support them. Current state 8/10 (Don't buy until the game gets out of this ""Early Access"" stage)			"

								This game is honestly a disgrace. I have owned this game since 2013. They have made little to no progress with it. The only noticeable change is the fact that they recently added a new gun. A SINGLE GUN! The game has 3 count them. 3 guns. With so much potential I'm wondering what the devs have been doing since they started working on this game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! At this point the developers have made enough money off of this beautiful piece of crap. That is exactly what it is. It works, it's beautiful, it's interesting, but there is barely any content in it. The most fun I had with it was messing with my friend and telling him to press K to kill himself. The lack of overall effort in this game is unacceptable. The concept is awesome. The mechanics are interesting and I'd love to see them work in a full game. But at this point the game is barley finished and it has been YEARS! This game started development FAR before it was even put to the store. I want to say that it was first announced in 2006 (don't quote me on that). Until this game gets finished in 20 years don't waste your time and money.			"

								I'd love to recommend this game.  It shows much promise as a cooperative sci-fi tactical shooter.Unfortunately, the developers have seemingly directed all resources toward the game's versus modes.  While the versus isn't bad by any means, other games (Insurgency) do it better.  The last six months or so have been dedicated to a versus mode they call ""Hell Week"", that as far as I can tell, nobody asked for and the majority didn't/doesn't want.These devs had a lot of cool ideas that they have thrown to the wayside.  At this rate, Star Citizen will be out before this game's dead on arrival campaign.  Unless they shift gears again, save your money.Edit as of August 2016: The devs are now trying to sell out, and can't even do that properly.  This game is a dead, shambling corpse that has been lining the wallets of a seemingly 100% inactive dev team.  For the love of the game, DO NOT BUY IT.			"

Planning your attack on the objective or finding a nice spot to defend. This game has very well designed map allowing players to flank their enemies and conquer the enemy.The weapon handling is very smooth feel realistic and the character animations and controller are smooth and easy to use.I highly recommend this game to all the first person shooters out there and to those who love Sci-Fi atmosphere, you always feel immersed in this game.

								First and foremost, the number of people playing this game is what hurts it the most. You'll struggle to find a server to play on or anyone to play with.Second, it's really hardcore. I'm not at all sure why they show these marines wearing heaps of armor when it clearly doesn't do much for them. The game is ""realistic,"" meaning you drop the moment you're shot.Combine these two things, and here's what you get:Very few chances to play with others, and when you do, you die the instant you run into them in the game.I'm sure if you invest hours upon hours, you'll eventually get to the point where you don't consistently die the moment you run into somebody else, and soon you'll dominate a little ant hill nobody elsee comes to. If that's your idea of fun, then by all means. Throw your money at this.Otherwise, it's hard to recommend. The game is beautiful, the setting is neat, and I love the concept. It's just no ♥♥♥♥ing fun to play. Everyone is made of glass, the game is buggy (early access, so expected), and I don't really see a light at the end of the tunnel for dealing with all of that.			"

								Given a chance to review this game I thought I was coming into a simple survival FPS game. When I began to play more I quickly relaized my first thoughts were not on point. While this is an FPS and their is a survival element I was pleasantly surprised by the scary tactics and horror this game brought in. It reminded me of F.E.A.R somewhat as their was always ambient noises that could scary you by themselves. I went into more detail on a review I did.


YouTube™ Video: Interstellar Marines Review (Alpha) 

			Views: 541		

			Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS that has open ended level design, scary ambiance, linear, and non-linear game play.		

Pros:The Game shows huge pentential to grow. What I mean by that is being an early access game and in alpha it already has a feeling of almost being complete. This means there is still going to be so many things added to the game that will flesh it beyond what already it is.Horror ascpects get you. The Game is lethal a simple tackle or a few shots and your dead from the AI because they are not forgiving. It gives you the sense of realism in the game and immerses you to the point where all the running, clanks, and movement of enemies truely get you on edge and scare you.Co-op is amazing and well done.Cons:Its in Alpha so there are optimatization issue and clipping when going up and down in an elevator. This is to be expected as the game is still in beginning stages and has a lot to go so I am not worried theses issues will continue. Highly Recommend this game to everyone!			"

								I really want this game to survive, there's three developers, low income, no publisher and basically everything bad that can happen to a developer has happened to these guys. This game's concept is brilliant, the future plans are amazing and I  really  hope this game can be saved.I'm gonna buy Spearhead Edition very soon, not for the perks, but so that maybe I can help in at least the slightest.-----""But HuskyWolf, why the hell should  I  buy this game?! Is it actually worth the buy for gameplay?!""Yes, fellow steam user; The game is a tactical FPS with some sort of horror element to it that I personally love. The sound of robotic footsteps, beeping noises and loud sirens makes for a sureal experience where keeping your eyes open and your ears active is crucial for your success. There's also PvP multiplayer which, currently isn't too enjoyable.It's not all that boring, but currently there isn't much that can change the experience enough for it to be very different each game.All-in-all it's a great game, and with the addition of camos to keep me coming back, I hope that this game becomes the well known, great game that it deserves to be. And if that's what the game finally becomes after years of breakdowns and challenges, I want to be one of the people who stood up and said that we believed in it.Thankyou for your time.EDIT: I have now bought Spearhead! :D			"

								Let me start my review by saying this game is not complete quite yet, but as far as I'm concerned, it mind as well be a full game. In essence, Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS simulation game with sci-fi and mild horror influence. Even though there are some premises and technology that are currently not existent in modern day, it feels realistic. I feel like that in ten years or so, this is could be reality, especially with good physics, annoyingly lifelike recoil, pain and exhaustion wobble and other environmental effects on your condition and visor. The 'realistic' difficulty is certainly true to its title: it is a true challenge to complete tasks with that difficulty active.First off: gameplay. As of yet there are about 10 singleplayer missions of ranging objective, such as escaping a space station, clearing an area of hostiles, or restoring power to a building. In every mission you have two long weapons (no handgun, which I am not personally happy with) : one for longer range sniping, and one for fast, full auto, close range bursts. Recoil makes handling both of these weapons a great task, especially when scoped in. A silencer, laser and flashlight can be utilized at any time. The enemies are (in every mission I've done so far) robots. They have fairly good AI, and can be pretty fearsome when charging out of the darkness with ear splitting shrieks and slamming you around. They can recognize your flashlight and triangulate your position accordingly. Some are armed with weapons similiar to your own, and some use only their limbs. As for co-op/multiplayer: it's amazing. I love it. Some of the best co-op I've ever played in any game, ever. The tactical potential is immense. Working with your team mates to complete objectives and eliminate other players or robots is the best feature of this game. Nothing to be missed there. I personally much prefer the co-op to the multiplayer, as objectives often seem distorted and chaos seems to ensue in player vs. player scenarios. It is also frustrating to be killed in dark maps, where your enemies may be in a shadow, so they are invisible (or practically so) to you, but you are standing under a light. There is also no spawn protection, which can also prove to be aggravating.Secondly: graphics. Absolutely stunning. The vigetting, superb textures and smooth atmospheric lighting truly makes this game a joy to look at. Some of the best lighting work I've seen in a long time. The way that each map has it's own feel and atmosphere is almost completely a result of the fantastic graphical work by the developers. 10 years have obviously been put to good work. The sound design is also very good. The maps are dynamic, as they change weather, time of day and general status (emergency lockdown, totally silent, in tranisition, etc.). In each mode, the sound adds very well to the atmosphere. The sound of the rain is consistent; robots' groans and creaking adds to the tension and fear of a startling encounter; the overwhelming sound of gunfire accurately represents how an actual warzone would sound. And now, the conclusion.Singleplayer --> 8/10Graphics --> 9/10Co-op --> 9/10Multiplayer --> 7/10Replay Value (singleplayer) --> 7/10Sound design --> 9/10Overall --> 8/10. Fantstic game, would recommend to any sci-fi/simulation/FPS/tactical fan.			"

								When this game was announced George W Bush was still president of the USA. This game has been with me for longer than my girlfriend, my job, my dog and even my beard.In this time they have created a few corridors, some placeholder enemies and a multiplayer mode that had nothing to do with the actual game concept.In a way its calming. No matter how bad the world gets I know this game will remain in the same state forever and change marginally at most, like a mountain.It doesnt really have many bugs (or landsharks) but thats kind of a bad thing.

								With half life and rainbow six as inspiration, this game has enough thrilling game play, even now as an early access game.  The things that surprised me positively is the pace and the environment. The graphics is nothing much, but the sound system and the ambiance makes it very easy to forget anything IRL and focus on the menacing robots down the corridors.			"

								Another early access game that's essentially dead.  The game has technically been in development for ten years now.  Unfortunately they don't have the raw financial resources that the developers and publishers of Duke Nukem Forever had, so it's doubtful they'll ever complete this game.  It's a shame, too, because the concept is great and the foundation that is here is a good one.  But that's really all there is; the foundation.  Occasionally a board or a brick will get put up, but it's almost certain that funding will run out before even a fraction of the grand design is built.  And even if by some miracle it does come to fruition, I hope they make the single player really good because the multiplayer population is already gone.			"

								It's a great game with great mechanics, fun to play with friends just a little buggy. However the massve downfall is simply that the game has been ""in progress"" for several years now and has never fully realized it's dream. As previously mentioned, it's a fun game to play with a great atmospere and amazing graphics. The sound design as well as the ever present sense of danger makes it an amazing game. However, since there have been no real recent updates and some bugs can cause the game to be unplayable, I must give it a negative review. I wish it weren't so :(			"

								Hello Art Vandelay here, I bought this game not knowing what to think, 20$ is a lot of money for a game you never play. Well let's get to the review, the game is in early alpha and will get a lot of features in the future. I for one am really happy with the in-game mechanics, things like lense flare and the option to take of your interactive mask make it all the more exiting. Before i bought the game i thought it would be a Action Adventure game set in space, I could not be more wrong. the CO-OP games have some of the best horror elements added to a game since... well ever. I am not pleased to say that the multiplayer is finished, i was able to find a dedicated server but the only gamemode you can play right now involves a spawn time that is well over a minute.Overall i was really happy with my purchase of Interstellar Marines, the 2 guns that you can choose from are well balanced and have a good feel to it, i noticed the in-game community is very friendly and helpfull. The devs are really good to, they update the game on a weekly basis.9 out of 10: Would pay the double amount for a game like this, it was worth every penny.!!!			"

								I know this game is on active developing. There's not enough financing, but why so slow? 3 types of weapons, no melee, one type of AI enemy and not much options to play. After 4 years (or more, not sure) we got jumping, new SMG model, AR and ""pistol"", Hell Week and couple of levels.I understand it's small team with limited finances, but really, before to bring more gameplay content, just give us more weapons to use full combat experience. 4 years of crude shooter mechanics and nothing more.Anyway, it's EARLY ACCESS game, you paying for it because you want to support developers. If you seeking for play, do not wait from this one anything genious! Pay if you really interest on this, in other case just pass by.			"

								Before we begin, let's go back. Like, 9 years back. 2008 back. I was a secondary school boy. I was still playing stuff like Blackshot and Soldier Front back when they were still popular. I  played Fallout 3 that year as well. So me being an FPS guy I somehow stumbled upon a demo of this game. Don't remember how though. It was using the Unity engine, and ran on a browser. I think Unity was still new back then, or at least unheard of by me. But a full 3D game with that kind of graphics on a BROWSER? Boy was my mind blown. It looked so good back then. Gameplay wise it was pretty solid too, with nice HUD and shooting elements. Granted it only had a shooting range with target challenges as far as I recall, but it was good enough for me. I was hyped. I wanted to see how the idea would expand. How they would incorporate the shark-like creatures that they showed off (somewhere...).Fast forward to...2014. I finally bought the game. And I finally got around to getting myself on Steam. I played it a bit. And somehow...I was underwhelmed. It's like they sat around on their asses for 6 years and did jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ Where's the alien sharks? Ok, cool there's A.I. robots and a bit of multiplayer. Nice and all. But...nothing else? Yeesh. I stashed it aside. Maybe it'll get better.Fast forward again...to 2016. Booted it up. Been nearly two years since I tried it out. Maybe they added something cool. They did. I guess. A confusing scavenging mode spanning multiple levels and ridiculous A.I. bots, and more robot levels I guess? But where's that ALIEN SHARK? Did I miss a memo? Should I go off and sift through info online for a game I lost interest? No.To be honest the game's development cycle seems...tragic. Being stuck in this limbo for so long means that all investor interest probably died (along with anyone's interest probably). So...What happens now? It's been 9 years. Far too long. And I haven't touched upon the core gameplay. Here goes...I guess...- Generic FPS shoot-em-up gameplay. Move, shoot, aim down sights. Sprint. Crouch. - Cool visor that you can lift up mechanic thingy. Removes HUD. Clearer view I guess.- Weapon option mod thingy. Remove silencers! Turn on lasers! Blind others' with your light! That's all.That's about it. To be honest I have no interest of writing this game. That...died out 9 years ago.TL;DR game's stuck in a developmental limbo, and devs can't be ♥♥♥♥ed to push out anything soon enough. There's no incentive for them to do so. Sadly. A good idea...gone.			"

								This so far is an enjoyable game in the early stages of development. The depressing part is that in the TWO YEARS it's been in Early Access on Steam, it hasn't progressed past the early stages of development. There are two maps of a solo/co-op campaign, a few other solo/co-op gamemodes and (in my admittedly limited experience) a bit of lackluster PvP. Do not buy this game if you are expecting it to be a finished product any time soon. If you are ok with playing for a few hours every several months when there is new content to play, you might enjoy this game. For very brief periods.			"

								The most promising game I ever seen and I seen a lot.From the times of Commodore 64 until now, so many lonely space stations I have visited, but nothing compares to NeuroGen!In co-op NeuroGen is just great, but I dare you to try it in singleplayer!Even on easy difficulty you'll be terrified, but on realistic it's like the name of achievement suggest-psychosis.Alone in huge station, complete dark for at least 1/3 mission (with flashlight on SMG of course, you are marine), and...well, see it for yourself!Even if there is only that one mission finished, game is well worth buying, but the rest is very good too.Multiplayer is nice and I have not complaining, but the real deal is co-op games.Community is friendly atmost and all in all, game is real gem!Even if developers never finish the game, this now available content is beyond every expectations considering quality.And the feeling that I am part of something so extraordinary gives my somewhat old wings (42yr now) a boost, and this review is part of that feeling.

								I got this game from steamgifts two or three years ago. I remember playing it then and thinking how much potential it has. So I decided to play it in 2017 and was very disappointed. The gameplay didn't change at all. Though they added a new gamemode like co-op/singleplayer missions in whih you have to fight off hordes of stupid AI robots. Actally, that's the only gamemode you can play, because the multiplayer is dead now. There are like 5 or 6 weapons in this game and they don't feel different from each other. Maps are small and the buildings are small gray boxes, just what you would expect from Unity3d game. Pros:-You might have some fun if you're playing co-op missions with friends-Immersion(you can see your feet and your helmet visor can be damaged)-The graphics are good for 2013Cons:-Maps are boring -Few weapons-Not much variety in gameplay-Dead multiplayer-Development hellIn short:The game has potential, but I don't recommend buying it in this state. There are absolutely no guarantees that it will ever be completed.			"

If you are expecting to be a Space Marine, breaching and clearing ships or stations, don't expect that at all.

								I love this game. Its a nice solid shooter base, with incredible immersion. The atmosphere that the game creates in the basic stealth missions turns it into a slight horror game! The training bots that the Singleplayer puts you up against, make some really nice sounds which makes it easy to tell where they are; but this just makes the stealth more tense! I play quite a lot of horror games, and this was making me jump on a regular basis. There is nothing ""Scary"" about the game. Its a standard FPS. But the atmosphere that the game makes caused me to get rather scared just walking around the stealth mission!Most definatley reccomended. Fast paced FPS, great engine, runs well (Maxed on GTX 780 getting 160FPS Avg)I see this becoming a very popular FPS. Cant wait for more modes and features!!!			"

								Game is atmospheric and fun, but there isn't enough content to justify buying it, and the rate of updates is far too damn slow.What Steam doesn't tell you is this game has actually been in development since 2009. It's literally been in development hell for 7 years.Basically, it's trying to be Rainbow 6 in space with a Mass Effect esque single-player campaign added in. To be honest, I don't see how the finished product will be anything more than a dumbed down version of Star Citizen's single-player campaign. Sadly, Star Citizen's single-player will probably come out before this game does - even if Interstellar Marines does find an investor to help with funding.			"

								It doesn't seem like many people actually looked into the development of this game and what has happened to it. From what I've found/heard so far there are only a few people left working on it, but they are very dedicated and do what they can with the resources they have. The content in the game so far is pretty sparce, but the quality of it is wonderful. The sound design, movement system, and overall feel of the game is superb. I always check back every so often on the twitter page or the steam news page to see what progress is being made and keep my hopes up for the developer, a game such as the one that the Zero Point Software has in mind seems like it would be incredible to play, it'll just take time.

								I think this is a must-buy game for anyone who likes teamwork in a first-person shooter game.Interstellar Marines has a lot of feature I have never seen in any other FPS before, like changing weather patterns, lighting, and even near-total darkness in a single map, changing between various settings.  This game keeps you on your toes, and gets my heart-racing with intense king of the hill combat.Edit as of 2016I'm still playing the game, so that probably says something.Since my initial review they've added crouching, and jumping; as well as two new weapons, three new game-modes, co-op and singleplayer missions.  The communtiy is still one of the best I've ever been a part of, and the gameplay is still fun, and enjoyable.I've probably bought 20 or 25 copies of this game for friends of mine over the past two years.  As of now, the Dev team has shrunk a lot, and they're looking for a publisher before they start doing any major updates; but if you're fine with just a smei-competetive shooter, and some neat co-op on the side with a fun community, you're $10 will be well spent.I've gotten over 250 hours of enjoyment (and counting) out of my $10; that's a pretty good return if you ask me, since it took less then an hour for me to make that $10...Every purchase helps this company, ZPS, continue pushing forward to creating and polishing up an amazing game, and if you're okay with mostly multiplayer now, and are hopful for more in the future; I'd highly reccomend picking this one up.

								I got this two years ago because it looked like fun and the way the dev team talked about thier project made it seem like they had real passion and drive to make an awesome game. Two years later little has been done to the game and i really dont see this being completed at all. Shame.			"

It will be fun they said.. 
Community Created Artwork for Interstellar Marines
By: Voelkar

			#justmarinethings		


Overview - I am a Spearhead Edition Buyer. Funny thing is they've never added the Hall of Honor, or Credits. [probably because it's not officially, ""released.""]Honestly, IM is a great idea. It's actually been released for way longer than people think - there was a kongregate version like 5/6 years ago where it was just a training simulator and you couldn't move around much. I also talked a friend into getting the game since it had alot of potential like 2 years ago when the game was almost exactly the same game it is today.http://www.interstellarmarines.com/game/ where you can play those DemosI have a theory as well that this is all a dream/VR training simulator in the reality of the I.M. world.This is a good game though barebones, it's not worth buying unless the Developer team[which is about 2 people from what I see going on in forums] secures major money[that won't come from sales] in order to develop the game. It seems to me what they're trying to do now is make a presskit to get another company involved in the making, so the game would finally get made. I guess it's better that the game be finished although I doubt it'll happen the way they want it to if another company picked it up. Bottomline Unless you see yourself playing the game with your active friends I would steer away.BUT OFC the way to fix ALL Of these negative reviews is just to add content - make the game worth playing. The game mechanics right now are pretty much perfect except for stuff like prone and upgrade trees for skills/stuff like that... you would think that in the future we would have light intensity adapting visors.[when we have this in real life already]I honestly would not mind if you guys added a bunch of content and then cleared the reviews just to see how the current build would stack up w/ people.For now here's what the game offers:4 Player Co-op: 2 maps of Elimination, 2 maps of Survival, 1 map of Escape, 2 long-length story missions.PvP: 8 Vs. 8 I believe in Deadlock and EliminationVarying A.I. Difficulties from I can't see you! to 1-shot you're dead :)Unfortunately, nothing is ""really new"" since the Neurogen v3 update from way BACK.Pros+ Great Idea+ Good for groups of 4 friends or more, if you're playing Hell Week.[warning points split]+ No achievements that are really too hard if you get medium skilled players together, so it'll be a blast for a group of FPS loving friends.+ standard PVP[nothing too special or different from the rest]+ Great PVE+ Sound is perfect.+ Combat points - Weapon/Backpack/Camo Skins, but a very weak positive in order to increase replayability.Cons- The money already spent in making this game - it's been years since that initial fanfunding project. I know that the main dev only does graphical stuff, but maybe try taking on programming interns from your local college/DIY groups, so that they can get credits.- Shark mainpoint of IM has yet to be released into the game.- Only a few people behind this game now AFAIK.- Low game population.- E time to get magazines?- Old issue of Pistol...I do not want this in my inventory/want an option to drop this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥don't want to mousewheel to this gun when i'm empty on both of the automatics + looks too much like an SMG. I think you guys need to remodel it to something more traditional. Honestly, we're carrying a carbine length pistol[~15inches], sub-machine gun[~11inches] and a RIFLE[18+ inches]?- No shotguns- No snipers- Hell week is boring because there's not enough robot action, but it shouldn't be like every inch is a battle, but more robots than it currently has.- No improvements/additions to A.I./Robotic Enemies AFAIK.- Fall through map bug[Just rejoin the game unless you're alone then you're screwed]- You can clip through closing doors- So2 should be o2 or Co2- Groups of Robots[deadly] suddenly spawning in front of you- Non-solid floors/areas of glitching to abuse.- No penalty of PKing in Hell Week regardless of intercom stating that there is a penalty ,-,.- No Prone- Robots can blind you through walls with flashlight*note to developers*If you could get your game featured at a gaming con it would probably be a huge boon to your game's success though you'll have it pick up/release things faster like bi-weekly.

			Psychosis Run Completed http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=335811599 [not a scam link, it's a funny picture for interstellar marines] EA stands for Early Access		

 Specifics The IM Project began 11 years ago. In order to secure funds they began by releasing a few Demos through public game places like The Vault, Bullseye, and Running Man. The greenlit Steam game was released on July 2, 2013 and I can't remember back then if the game was just barebones PvP, or had the Co-op Missions as well. ""On October 2012, Zero Point Software attempted to do a Kickstarter campaign with a $600,000 pledge by November 28, 2012. Their campaign failed to meet its funding goal, with only $157,906 raised from 3,823 backers.""That's a shame that they didn't get the money even if the campaign failed :(Ex. List of expenses...Electricity, Building Rental if not working at a home which is way more economical of indie devs, Musical Composition[people say it could cost Free, or $280-$2000 per song/minute/soundtrack], The main developer is graphical, so it's down to coding[huge job], server costs[anywhere to $20-$400+/month], food, sound effects, special effects, ect.I guess it's good that we even got the 1st part of the trilogy done if you assume the $200k mark is where they were splitting the money per part.

Basically I gambled on it having the potential to be a really good game in a cool setting, and lost on both counts.			"

								Ok, the entire reason this game has negative reviews is because development has been slow. That's it. The devs are incredibly undermanned.The devs have however stuck to the game (unlike a lot of early-access games) and have been (at time of writing) talking about getting support from a publisher. So hopefully the development will speed up soon.That said, it's a glorious game with amazing promise. The current open-world survival-ish gamemode is pure gold. The pvp is lacking, but it DOES advertise itslef as a mainly coop game so whatevs.			"

Early Access Review
								In its' current state, this game is not very good at all. Originally it was to be a very ambitious tactical sci-fi shooter; with dynamic VoIP acoustics, customisable weapons, and different character classes. Currently, there is none of that, unless you count attaching a silencer as customisation.There is currently a short threadbare campaign available that consists of three missions on three different maps, not counting the tutorial. These all feel very similar and do not help demonstrate the game's ""tactical"" gameplay, as it is very simple to run-and-gun as the enemies are not very bright and infinite ammo is available.The saddest part is that it could have been better, had it had more funding. In promotional material, and partially in the game, characters are able to remove their helmet to talk clearer and to see easier. When your visor is down, it is almost similar to Metroid Prime or Star Wars: Republic Commando, with raindrops and sunlight glare obscuring your vision when it is down. In promotional material, this was also shown to change the sound of your voice, with your voice being more muffled when the visor is down, and clearer when the visor is up. Unfortunately, this feature is not available in the game and probably never will be. To sum it up, let me recount and experience whilst poking around the game. If you clip inside the player character's helmet, you will find a fully modelled, but untextured face. It looks ready to be used, but unfortunately never is. This sums up the game, potential is there, but the game itself is incomplete.Rip in pepperoni			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR ""DO NOT BUY IT YET, WAIT UNTIL EARLY ACCESS ENDS""Interstellar Marines is futuristic, online tactical first person shooter which has unique gameplay elements. In example you're actually playing in a virtual battleground which changes its' weather settings, platform levels and there is ""day/night"" cycle.The gameplay has a realism aspect in its' own way. Projectile damage is high. Dark is really dark; you have to find your way with your flashlight and using momentary lightings such as thunder or a malfunctioning light sources etc. You have a helmet which contains your GUI but time by time it limits your view because of raindrops or dusty particles on the helmet glass; so you have to elevate its' front side from your face.So, why don't i recommend this game to you (...yet)? Simple: Updates are occasional, framerate is still horrible despite the fact that developing process started a long time ago. Gameplay elements are still missing according to their gameplay plans but it's kind of OK. It has a dedicated player community as i see but they are few (or they are just playing the game when a new update comes).Keep this game in your mind if you like tactical shooters but don't buy it yet.

								It sounded great, had great concepts and features and the co-op and missions sounded amazing. I followed the game and the videos and website before it even went to Kickstarter, it's received plenty of funding and support, years of early access and is still no where near what was expected. It's been out on Steam since 2013 and the progress really is dissapointing. I had high hopes but they keep dragging it along and giving false hope. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game. Shoot some robotic dolls and other people with some decent graphics. Many free-to-play sci-fi/tactical/FPS surpasses this.			"

								I bought into this game wowed by the developers' crazy concept of creating a new universe populated by man eating sharks with legs. Though it said Early Access, I brushed it off, thinking the game would be completed by a year, two years maximum. It's been over three years and the only things added are a base AI, three types of guns, jumping, and sprinting. Other than that, all this is is just a very crude, very base FPS that feels like it's been left to rot on the table.I understand the dev team is undergoing some troubles, but why are the updates so far and few between? At most, this is just a tech-demo with ""missions"" slapped onto it. Unless you plan to buy this just to help out the dev team, don't bother with this ""game"". This is light-years from being finished. "

I still hold hope in its eventual completion, hoping that Zero Point gets the funding and support necessary to do so. While there are lots of negative reviews, if you want a smooth, semi-tactical shooting MP experience, give this game a shot.			"

								This is by far the biggest mistake of a purchase i have ever made in my life. I bought the spearhead edition thinking maybe i could contribute to the designers of this game that originally looked really good.  PROS-The gfx, sounds and atmosphere is really nice           -Has a pretty good concept(lots of potential) CONS- Forever in early access           - Lack of Everything (only 2 guns, litterally 1 or 2 playable online rooms..)           - The content that is available is very bland and repetative.           - I have a lot of problems with the controlls bugging out and not being able to move at times. The Devs are extremely defensive about complaints and dont want to hear anybodys♥♥♥♥♥♥ instead of taking it as constructive critisism.  For how long this game has been in development, its really not going anywhere and seems like it just stopped and is completely deserted. I am trying my hardest to see if steam can refund this for me. Its infact so bad that i didnt give any friend my FREE copy of the game.			"

I'm very glad to say that each time I've looked, I see improvemnets.  I've absolute patience for this project and applaud the dev team for their vision. The latest update adds enough content to get a good feel for the combat, is fiendishly challenging, very playable and highly immersive.  Excited to see the final version with story, I get the feeling it's going to be great.			"

								""Anyone who buys this game and feels tricked or exploited by what they got can get a refund from Steam no questions asked"" is what this dev said.i attempted to refund it in hopes of getting money back for a different game, maybe something that isn't early access, and it got denied.i enjoyed this game at first, but when i attempted to play with my friends, it was an absolute mess, and took us quite a while to play one co-op game. theres no feel to the guns, almost like im using a toy. creating a server is horrible, theres no way to make it private (from what i saw).all the enemies were melee, so there were no threats at all. the only thing that delayed us was finding where to go.graphics are actually quite nice. very smooth. animations were ok, some were a little jaggedy at times.but generally an unfun game. i may not have 300 hours into it, but thats because i didn't like it enough to play past one level with my friends. and that was a challenge in itself.tl;drdev promised refunds, didn't get one, making server with friends is difficult, and enemies are useless. graphics are nice though. 3/10			"

								It's been almost two years since I bought the game. At first I was excited and rode the hype train. After all this game has so much potential. Right now there is too little content to recommend it and after two years we don't even have a ONE interesting co op map with sharks. Yep, just robot AI. Which gets old quick. Hud is very minimal and its easy to get lost that however is not a bad thing. I like exploration but I would appriciate some sort of radar or compass to help me find key objectives. Combat wise is pretty standard FPS experience with addition of BEHOLD taking off your helmet... wow. 3 Guns couple of co op maps with stupid robots ( they are all the same, at least make some effort and have variety of robots, like melee ones, shotgun ones and kamikaze ones lol )Waited far too long and at this state and slow updates I cant recommend it yet.

								I bought this game because it promised 4-player co-op and some sort of shark creatures. It's been two years since the multiplayer shooter portion of the game released, and there's just no development toward campaign aspects whatsoever. There are a few maps to shoot robots in, a few maps to shoot people in, and your choice of Gun A or Gun B.The environments look great, the gunplay is serviceable, but development is downright glacial. It's looking less and less like we'll see a sprawling space epic with Land-Sharks before 2050 (or rather, before the money runs out).If all you want is to shoot some bland test dummies or creep around in the same 5 or so maps, then by all means buy in. If you're looking for a co-op shooter where you fight sharks, you'd be better served by 'Depth' or 'Shark Attack Deathmatch 2' here on Steam.			"

And anyone writing a positive review is lying out of there asses as they hope enough suckers will buy it and throw more money the developers way in hope that it will be enough to save this piece of garbage.. But no.. Do not fall for it. .Let this die out.. I paid for it.. I relize my mistake.. Why whould i load my sinking ship with more hopefull spirits.♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.Answer to Ypulse comment:Reign of kings. Life is feudal has people on 24/7, H1Z1 got people one 24/7. This doesn't.. And anyone owning the game knows that. Sure maybe occasinly a server would get some people.. Perhaps even fill up? But that I doubt. And now you as everyother pathetic individual trying despretly to defend there garbage pile. You pull your last card, By stating how low amount of play time I have.You know who else did that? Digital homicide against Jim sterling Took his video down and stated that he individualy violeted the copyright as the review was not based on what was there view on a minimal play time on record to be able to provide a valid review.. The truth sadly for your kind is that there is no minimum time.. Of course someone with 500h+ may have deeper insight to a game then somone with 50min but most of the time then it proves that the game is actually good.. As if somone can waste 500+ on the game it should add up to something and I yet find many people shouting out a bad review after that amount of time If not it been based on a recent update that the developers pushed out that changed the game drasticly for the worse. Still none should be forced to implement a certain amount of time to be able to state there opinion, specialy when the fact exist all around you. I did not need more then 10 min For Garry's shity incident, I did not need more then 5 min for zombies on a plane.. I needed not more then 2h for this game..   Now this 2h LOL..  As you so kindly stated is about 10 min each put out in 12 sessions.. the game never manage to capture me for more then 10 min in each session as i notice it was a bland shooter with some interesting ambient lightning effects that i can praise but not much there else. And the game developers themself have both in video and devblog stated that this was going to be a core COOP experience and pvp was going to come second.. Still there effort and Development plan has and still to this days proves otherwise as they continue to jam in things direclty aiming for the pvp and even less focuse for the coop.. I not seen anything done for the coop in the past 6 months. The game simply in coop action is. you and 3 others, Sneak/assault in on a base with stupid Robot AI that wanders around and have aimbot if you turn them up for anything more then normal. And any announcement for further plans seems to be going down the drain and i bet it's cause of financial problem. And here Is where it becomes sad.. That the fanboys themself must despretly throw out positiv reviews in hope of dragging more innocent souls to the fire in hope that the body pile will become big enough to climb up to the heavens themself.. SOmething I doubt very much as the company itself most likely are looking for an exit plan as I write this..  But I keep your opinon to a very facinating level.. And If they and if so you.. proves me the wrong. .Then win/win as i myself was looking forward to this game.. I just don't feel the need to lie to other people to get to my toys.			"

8/10""Feels a bit like back in the days - PLZ finish the game!""Early Access:This tactical sci-fi shooter is still in development and that is good, because there's still missing a lot. IM really has the chance to become an amazing ""indie"" AAA shooter. But the development time is quite long, especially if you take a look at it's history and the vision. Anyway right now the playable multiplayer has a great atmosphere and is worth a look (at least at the SALE price). This game has some really great potential, like stocks - but cheaper. ;) Pros:+ great atmosphere+ great sounds+ great setting+ great 1st person view+ good graphics+ good controls+ good weapon handling+ good movement+ light&shadows (indoors)+ textures indoors+ the feeling of SWAT4/RainbowSix in a sci-fi settingCons:- only multiplayer (right now)- empty servers (due daytimes)- the waiting time- movement animations- textures outside- no shark enemies yet :(- the ""hope"" for a 2014 release- no SLI support (SLI Fix!)- (really long development time)The Multiplayer is great, the waiting time sucks, a full release would be superb... This game is too good to become a ""never ending story""! Support it :) "

								This is a great and different FPS game, that has a interesting story to it, then most of the other FPS out there.Well if a FPS game with a mutation of a shark sound like cool, and are abit tired of all the zombie games - then give this a try.It might be early access, so take the bugs and glitches as they are - i am sure they fix it in the end.To those that start, with i have a low playtime on it here! Sure and true in steamBut did play before steam, so i know the game.Some of us do have kids and a real life, plus i own around 850 games to play when i can.I did support them before they went on steam, as they went on kickstart.Finaly they made it on steam, after greenlight.I do hope they get success with the game, as they have been trying hard to make this game work.Also as a born Dane, i want to support them with the spearhead version.So come give them a hand back in Denmark, as its a damn expensive tax country ;-)			"

								This game has been in Early Access for YEARS. I bought the Spearhead edition only to find that they had released the Spearhead edition on Humble Bundle where it was sold for 1/10th the price I paid for it. What was the devs response? ""Sorry guys"". Sorry doesn't cut it. That's not just a PR problem that can be solved with an apology. An apology didn't cost you $43.00. On their website, they're selling ""badges"" for $5.00 a piece as a ""cookie for the devs."" Maybe before you try to extort your ignorant fanbase, you should actually attempt to finish the game.  What exactly are those worth? Nothing to me. You know what I would like? A completed damn game. I've come to the conclusion that these guys are capitalizing on the indie trend, profiteering, and have made it their careers to profit off of a game that will remain perpetually in Early Access.EDIT: Half a year later and no updates. Over 3 years later and still in early access. Also, if you think this is rant or if you think this is a conspiracy theory that the devs are capitalizing on the indie trend. It's impossible to review this game any further because the servers are always empty. Wasted money and wasted time.			"

								Yes they are slow with development but it really is a great game. The graphics are pretty good and gameplay is quite amazing and is VERY atmospheric with things like the day/night change even going completely dark in some cases, rain, and snow. There's fatigue and unsteady aim after sprinting, rain droplets and affects on your helmet. It's also pretty realistic on the realistic difficulty, a few hits and typically your dead or damn near it and so are the enemies(minus the bosses of course). With a few friends you can have a riot of a time so I can't not recommend it for $10. Especially if its ever on sale, snag this sucker.			"

								While this game is currently in the early stages of development, I would highly suggest you pick this game up because it has a positive community, interactive developers and a very solid core experience. Most of you associate these types of business models as buy the game now and get rewarded later, but I believe that the devs have created a very basic yet solid gameplay experience. The devs are always involved with the community and constant updates bring new features to the game. I wouldn't worry about what the game looks like now because the devs have chosen to let you play what they have instead of giving the full product when its finished. Some of you may not like this type of development, but I like it because it makes you feel like you are connected to the devs and your opinions are heard.			"

								Please read the following to get a decent perspective of the game before buying.Pros:- Very smooth, sleek design. Graphics are very nice.- Simple controls yet very immersive and very to understand.- Extremely immersive in nearly every aspect (Massive +).- Being stealthly is very rewarding (Mentally and in the game).- CO-OP is slightly more fun than single player.- Not the hardest game to run, but will require a decent PC.- Guns feel very nice and play better than i thought they would.- A.I is very smart, even on easy difficulty.- Devs seem to be more active than other communitys which is good.- Potentially great story.+ And a few more that i forgot xDCons:- Reloading while in cover is broken. The animation dosn't work correctly.- Hardly anyone online to play with, even the devs know. ""people will be on for you to play with, it is usually during the evenings in North America and Europe.""- When on some hard difficultys the A.I is a little too smart. They one shot very often.- Sandbox is sometimes broken. You fall striaght through the floor and never return which results in restarting the map.- A.I needs to be more... 'Workable'. Once you've been spotted, you're done for. The A.I, when aware you're around, totally ruine the immersion, i mean completely!- No checkpoints! This might be deliberate but holy crap is it fustrating. You play through a long missions then you make a wrong move, guess what? You're back at the start. Same goes for CO-OP. When you join they could be across the map and you're at the spawn.- Story is terrible. You start on the tutorial which is great fun, then... wait what? You're running around in some random facility. Story has been thrown out the window completely. Wrost thing is that the story has great potential.I would recommend that you buy this game. even though there are more cons than pros, because i think that if the devs stay active and keep updating then this will be something. This game has great potential, i believe, and i would like to see a more active community on it.  A few tweaks here and there and some updates mainly on the story then this game will have more pros than cons.			"

								A rather overlooked multiplayer FPS, which easily became one of my all-time favorites.What's great:+ It does darkness right. When there's no light source- you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥for real and at the same time using flashlight/being near any light source would make you an easy target. It feels especially great when weather dynamically changes during online match- imagine sitting behind a rock, defending capture point when all of sudden night goes down and as sudden lightning strike brightens up your surroundings you can see enemy crawling to you through nearby swamp.+ Above makes co-op missions a thrilling and challenging experience, sometimes on par with actual horror games. Be tactical and watch your step around every corner or get eaten by scary FNAF robots.+ PvP multiplayer isn't brain-dead running around spray-and-pray like CoD, but rather careful slower-paced advancing on your objective. Most of the maps are quite open so you have to be vary about being seen and at the same time keep your eyes open because enemies don't have huge red marks above them.+ Gunplay is simple and basic, but solid and fun, rewarding quick reflexes and high accuracy.What's not so great:- It's dead.[steamcharts.com] Unless devs do a couple another free week promotions, i don't see it gaining new players.

								There isn't much of a game yet, it only consisted of 2 guns, an assault rifle and an smg of sorts.  However the atmosphere is really well done.  Despite it's current simplicity the dark atmosphere and ability to shoot out lights to make it even darker is an unusual factor in the multiplayer FPS genre (which tend to have reasonably lit dark places or else supply night vision).  Along with the dark and deathly silent atmosphere you have enemies which are humanoid robots, however, as boring as that may seem, i've never had robots freak me out this much.  Some of them are like fast zombies but they sneak right up on you before slapping you silly.My favourite factor of this game is definitely the fact that you get the feeling you're the only ones alive.  All there is is silence, that is very realistically unnerving when broken by sudden un-silenced gunfire.There are some issues with objective bugs and flashlights not rendering from other players, i find the walking/movement to be a bit jerky and awkward, and as i said there isn't much content yet: limited guns, only 2 types of enemy with the same model, and fairly empty maps.  While i like the atmosphere, i hope the game won't all be quite so barren and basic (when it comes to missions and so on).  I guess i'll look forward to when this game gets some more meat on it.			"

								Interstellar Marines is an immersive and addicting FPS that sets the bar high. The game prides itself with jaw dropping environments, dynamic lighting, and realism that will challenge your approach to combat. Interstellar Marines is currently sporting two missions in single player mode, co-op, and a plethora of multiplayer modes that'll keep you busy for a long while. It also handles extremely well on my aging hardware of 7+ years with impressive load times. The developers at Zero Point Software actively support the game with large updates and new quality content; even adding skins more recently. The player base is lacking but that's understandable for an early access. The game offers a healthy amount of achievements. Interstellar Marines plays like a finished product and, for $9.99, is definitely a must have.+Realism+Dynamic Environments+Replayability+Offline bots+Multiplayer/co-op+Achievements+Cross-Platform Multiplayer+Active developers-Player base-Cards			"

WHY? This game has so much potential to be a fun story based game with yourself or your friends, and I hate the fact that they're wasting so much time on something that shouldn't exist in this type of game. Alright but enough hating on the game, the gameplay itself is amazing i've never had much fun in a game in awhile.

It just seems like the ""creators"" (and I use that term loosely) are more concerned about getting cash than they are about making this game work. TWO YEARS! And then some! WTF?!?! I'd rather have my 15 bucks than this crap. If only there was a refund option! Anyway, I HIGHLY reccomend you DON'T BUY THIS GAME.  The developers seem to have no vested intrest in completing it.

								I bought this game over 3 years ago on a promise and a lot of hyperbole about what the developers wanted to achieve. The product is not yet finished and it will be a little while longer before we have a full single player campaign. However, what is there is very good, by no means perfect, but very good none the less, and I have no hesitation in recommending it in its current state.Whats good:* Lots of different game modes, with the main game being team based PvP, but also a 4 player Coop story mode vs bots, and various other co-op player vs bots modes.* The AI on the bots is fun to play against and they offer a genuine challenge, and have on more than one occasion made me jump.* Very focussed gameplay, there are only 2 weapons and limited ammo in each clip, so every shot counts* Great community of people playing, there is quite a lot of chatter on the servers with players, and people are generally quite nice, funny, helpful.* Quick loading times to get into games* Great respawn idea, basically when you die you have to wait 2 mins before respawn, but if your team captures zones you get to respawn earlier. This makes the game quite tactical and differentiates it over your usual COD, counterstrike type gameplay.* The game can be tough for beginners, but experienced players can be quite helpful, so stick at it and it will come to you* The developers are occasionally found playing with/against you, this gives the feeling that they also enjoy playing the game and adds an extra bit of fun when they do.* Day/night mode on maps; the night mode makes things especially interesting, how often do you use the flashlight to see where you are going vs giving your position away. The positional sound of footsteps also can give you away / help you find people.* A bunch of other things I can't be arsed to type.Whats bad:* Despite selling a lot of copies of the game, and there being quite a lot of servers, only 1 or 2 of the main ones tend to fill up. However, once you are in at the right time of day the games are fun, in fact I have had quite a few 2v2 or 4v4 games that were amazing.* Lag. This to me is the games biggest issue, and can be quite frustrating at times, however, again with experience you can compensate for it by firing ahead of target. If there is one thing that needs some more TLC its the lag compensation and reducing overall lag when connecting to servers.* I play a lot of counterstrike and miss not being able to melee people, i would take anything over nothing, even if you had to charge melee up before striking. The prestige of being able to sneak up on someone and stab them in the back and embarass them would make this game twice as good.* Not much else other than its not finished, but like I said this is still a very good and polished gameOverall if want something a bit different then this game might be for you, also you can test some of the early stuff out on their website before committing: http://www.interstellarmarines.com/ or even watch a few videos of it on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/results?filters=hd&search_query=interstellar+marines&lclk=hd&spfreload=1edit: added link			"

								Before you buy this game, you must first realise that this is an alpha and is missing many of the features which they are working on for the final game. There is ONLY multiplayer and the 7 maps which you can look around/play in multiplayer.Having said that, this game is surprisingly polished for an alpha.. there is so much immersion, firing a weapon takes time to master and adds a good level of depth to the game. The weather changes on the maps, sometimes it goes pitch black or foggy which completely changes the tactics you use. Currently the game is also very balanced (due to there only being 1 weapon) so it feels satisfying to get good at the game knowing no one has an advantage.Some issues you need to be aware of: currently there is only 1 gun in the game and couple of game modes (team domination being the most used and the best), there are some issues with hit detection and lag *make sure you pick a server with low ping however even then you'll need to learn to lead the target a bit more etc* (also make sure you turn off smoothing in the options to help with this). They are fixing this but for now it's there. Also there is no crouching in the game, no leaning or anything like that.. I believe they want to add in these features.In conclusion, this is definatly an early alpha with many features missing... however I believe that the current strengths of the game (immersion, satisfying shooting and balanced multiplayer) make this 100% worth the asking price which will also help them continue development. Have a look at some more recent videos and make your judgement, it's changed a lot over the past month (december).			"

I told myself ""Now is my chance."" I am glad I purchased it. Its challenging, and it forces you to take things slow. The first mission I did took me just over an hour. I was playing solo though. The game could use some optimization or at least let me turn shadows off completely. I am in the Army and live in the barracks, so I don't really have room for my desktop. I am playing on a decent laptop. It can run BF3/BF4 on Ultra no problem. I get a steady 30-40fps (@1280x720) when inside buildings, but sometimes when I am outside  it drops to about 20-25. I honestly didn't care because I felt it added to the overall tension and anxiety.

								I was very excited for this ambitious game when I purchased it in early access. I have sadly learned to be skeptical of early access games. This looks like another example of a great concept from an ambitious team that took on more than they could handle with Interstellar Marines. Very slow updates, if any, near zero player base. This looks like the skeleton of what was once a popular kickstarter like game in space. The sad thing is the game wasn't half bad, if the dev team really went back and turned it into something, it could have had a chance.			"

								Negative Comments are not 100% factual.MY RATING:Current Hours of fun gameplay: ~60hrs (enough MP maps to be fun for a while, a lot more coming)Graphics: 6.5/10 Maps: 10/10Sound: 11/10Gameplay: 9/10 (think original Ghost Recon or Rainbow 6 type Gameplay mixed with a bit of Quake depending on the map)Gamemodes 6.5/10 (A major game mode is currently in development and single player still needs work)Yes the company went bankrupt, yes their are only two weapons however what people are saying just isn't factual.1) Multiplayer IS TONS fun, their is deathmatch, team dm, a mode where you respawn a friend by getting a kill and another mode that I can't remember. Their are also 1 or 2 COOP missions and a game mode where you fight against bots.Think CSGO but with better maps, the maps are very good and have bushes and grass to hide in, the maps change as the game goes on (day, night, snow, rain, mist etc.). Even from South Africa and a ping of 200+ I had a lot of fun (ping doesn't mean much if you can hide in a bush and shoot a guy from behind, hope the make a small RSA server... please? please!).2) Excellent community, none toxic people that report bugs and make jokes, 2nd to none.3) Okay Graphics (COD level I would say, not BF level but acceptable), yes the graphics still overuse resources but my old GTX 660 OC does fine on highest @ 1080 and a 750ti will also. No need for a $300+ GPU.4) Best sounds ever, even BF3 falls behind on sound.5) Cheap, <$20 for a game that gives a lot of value and fun.If you Like the good old shooters (like Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon originals) this is for you, you do regain health as far as I remember but it is basically 1 shot 1 kill. Tactics like not capping a point and shooting guys as they try and cap it are a must, teams of two also help (usually I get shot and my friendly then cleans up the enemy, as I say my ping is bad).HOWEVER SOME OF THE CRITICAL POINTS ARE TRUE:1) Original backers will be sour that they have had to wait years, I don't blame them or the devs as the game simply didn't get enough support from the FPS crowd.2) 2 Guns only, this is fine as the gameplay is basically 2 body or 1 head shot however more weapons are about to be released soon from what I have heard.3) The game is early access and their are a few bugs (far less then some post releases) and A LOT of content is coming (not a bad thing is it?).JUST BUY IT, IT Won't GO BANKRUPT AGAIN IF PEOPLE SUPPORT IT AND IT IS A GREAT GAME!

								Версия игры: 0.5.17 В принципе неплохая игра.Но есть ещё вещи, которые я бы в ней изменил/добавил/убралНе хватает: указания расстояния до метки задания (буква в ромбе): метки отображаются одинакового размера и она может находится как за ближайшей стеной в полуметре от тебя, так и на противоположном конце карты, но ты это узнаешь только после того как доберёшься до неё субтитров с текстом задания (на слух не всегда понятно что говорят, особенно при слабом знании английского или во время стрельбы) мини-карты с отображением ближайших союзников (ну вертеться же постоянно как юла, а по звуку не определишь) и целей задания информации о том, кто в данный момент говорит в голосовой чат (например как в CS: текст в каком-нибудь углу с ником говорящего и иконки возле метки над его моделью в игре) информации о том возраждает ли тебя союзник (не столь важно как предыдущие пункты, но тоже не помешало бы) возможность рукопашного боя (бить прикладом): довольно часто можно умереть во время перезарядки оружия потому что всадил в упор остатки патронов в робота, а он от этого не умерНадо бы изменить: локализацию звуков (очень тяжело, а скорее даже невозможно определить направление к источнику звука и  расстояние до него: например, робот может спокойно добежать до тебя и убить, пока ты отвлекаешься на что-то другое и думаешь, что он ещё далеко). Шум от робота в нескольких десятках метров примерно тот же по громкости, что и у того, что стоит вплотную к тебе много серверов от создателей игры - это хорошо, но всё же хотелось бы иметь возможность создать сервер на который можешь зайти только ты и те, кого ты туда пригласил лазерные целеуказатели хорошо бы активировать на разном оружии независимо (было бы удобно, хотя не очень уж и требуется) при получении повреждений хотелось бы знать примерное направление откуда атакуют (слева/справа/сверху/снизу)-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Version of game: 0.5.17 In principle this is a good game.But there are still things that I would have it changed/added/removedWhat is missing:     indicate distance to the mark with the task (letter in box): labels are displayed the same size and it can be found as for the nearest wall a foot away from you, and at the opposite end of the map, but you know it only after doberёshsya to her     subtitle text task (by ear is not always clear what they say, especially with poor knowledge of English or during shooting)     mini-map, displaying closest allies (well, to spin like a top as constantly, and the sound is not defined) and the objectives of the assignment     information about who is currently says in voice chat (such as in CS: text in any corner of the nickname and the speaker icon near the mark on his model in the game)     information on whether revives you ally (not so important as the previous steps, but also would not hurt)     melee combat (to hit with a rifle butt): quite often you can die while reloading weapons because stabbed emphasis remains of ammunition in the robot, and he did not die from itIt is necessary to change:     sound localization (very hard, and perhaps even impossible to determine the direction of the sound source and the distance to it: for example, the robot can safely run to you and kill until you get distracted by something else and think that he is still far away) . The noise from the robot a few meters to about the same volume as that of the fact that costs close to you     a lot of servers from the creators of the game - it's good, but still I would like to be able to create a server to which you can go just you and those you invited back     laser designators well be activated on different weapons independently (it would be convenient, but not very much and want to)     In case of injuries would like to know the approximate area where the attack (left / right / top / bottom)I apologize for the translation of text using Google			"

I was able to beat coop missions on realistic by myself easily.I also found a bug where you shoot past an enemy while he's in your face.I don't recommend this game. The risk of the devs screwing up this game is wayyy too big.

								Sure it's a nice shooter and all, actually I'd even call it a good shooter. But there is nothing about this game that sets it apart from all the others. If you've got 5 dollars to spare and want a cookie cutter carbon copy of every other first person shooter out there, go ahead, buy this game.But if you are like me, and are gaming on a budget, you can find a much better shooter, and game in general, elsewhere.5/10 nothing at all special.

								This game is not fit to buy in its current state.  This is less of a recommendation and more of a warning.  The only current content consists of stripped down multiplayer and no single player at all.  You can walk around the multiplayer maps by yourself but that is it.  Basic things like jumping and crouching are currently missing from the game as of my writing this, sprinting was patched in about a week ago.  There is literally no weapon diversity and no AI.  I'm not saying this game won't turn into something worth playing, but right now it is not.  I'm not sure what to expect though, considering development began in May 2005, over 8 years ago.  I will update the review when and if the game enters a more acceptable state.			"

								First time I heard of Interstellar Marines, I was amazed by their idea and I majorly wanted to help, however I had no money. But now in 2013 I had just received the game by a friend of mine who was a donator in the kick starter and had spearhead edition. When I opened this game I was surprised what they have done already ever since with their bankrupt and situations. They had been training really hard for an amazing comeback, and dedicate their whole life to this majestic game. The features at the moment may not seem much but it's worth the money. The feature it has is a wonderful dynamic environment and a normal run & gun at the moment. They had recently changed the game mode on all servers to Team domination, therefore you would have to work with your team to win the matches. This game is still pre-alpha, so don't expect this being the final product, because they have a whole set of ideas to add in this game. Such as, a realistic tactical co-op campaign that makes you feel like that you are an actual marines in space with your friends fighting land sharks and having a first contact with aliens.

Early Access Review
								Updated 1/30/2015Keeps coming together every update. It is starting to have that excellent charm that I mention more so than before; and almost makes me feel like I am playing a spiritual successor to the old Rogue Spear series; which is great. In case you guys aren't as ancient as I am; Rogue Spear was a old Tactical FPS where you would go on missions to destroy, protect, survive, rescue, etc. This game shares some of those aspects with its more post-modern/sci-fi tactical style. I can't wait to see it grow more. The Starcrown Aerospace mission is a cool stealth-based one, which is demonstrating the versatility of the gameplay options. Right now it seems to focus on android murdering, but I would imagine in the near future they will start incorporating live missions where you are sent to fight real enemies. Also, I have notice some performance optimizations in the game.Original stuff:So far this game seems to be going in a great direction. The ambitious developers have been updating in good iterations and the background is looking very excellent. This game is essentially a Science-Fiction FPS where you are a Marine that goes to.. space! Common theme right? Well, this game does it different. You aren't some Halo Spartan or Warhammer Space Marine. You aren't some overpowered super-armored exo-suit marine that has access to giant guns and can punch enemies through a wall. You are a ordinary soldier who is trained for elite operations in space and ground. This game puts a nice emphasis on augmented reality technology, such as implementing a visor that indicates your objectives, ammo, used items, etc. This may compare to other Sci-fi Marine flicks, with the exception that it is in such a way where the technology IS apart of your helmet, and not some typical video game user interface. Take off the visor and you will notice there is nothing. No recticule, no ammo type, no indicators for equipment, no objective points, NOTHING. Just your gun and it's trustworthy Iron Sight. Right now as of Early Access, there are several features players can experience. While it isn't near to completion yet, it definately shows progress and I feel like these Developers are NOT out to dissapoint anyone. One thing I would like to see with this game is a little more of a team-based orientation when playing in competitive matches. It seems like no one really sticks as a team and it becomes a solo-festival of shooting. I don't have a big problem with it, but I have a problem if teamplay isn't encouraged.What really gets this game my thumbs up right now is the whole immersive experience. The Ambient sound effects while on board a space station with the lights out makes you feel like a real soldier sent to investigate a dead space station. The eerie sound of hostile robots and their locomotion has you glued to the iron sight to check all areas. The Helmet is on, the gun is loaded, the objectives are displayed and the flashlight is on. Ok, time to figure out how to proceed to the objective. This game just seems so much in that realm, and I would love it to continue being so. I just hope not all the levels are going to consist of pitch-black environments with 100% flashlight usage. The game should demand all sorts of scenarios. I do like the darkness, but I want a balance of dark and light. Missions in places where facilities have power and missions where places have no power and it is dark. Balance is everything when it comes to mission consistency.Things I expect and would like when the game goes gold:1. Peak performance optimizations2. Plentiful amount of multiplayer and singleplayer missions.3. Adherence to realistic player movement and team-oriented gameplay.4. Adherence to that immersive charm that I mentioned.5. Variety of equipment and weapons.I have a great amount of enthusiasm for this game. Keep up the good work!			"

								The game looks amazing but...This game is a clear example how early access can be detrimental to its development.

								Pros:-Beautiful to look at (amazing lighting)-Challenging and competitive multiplayer-Unique ""Deadlock"" multiplayer mode-Pace of multiplayer games is just right-Well-designed maps-Dynamic weather/time-of-day creates constantly changing multiplayer conditions-New story-driven co-op gamemode vs AICons:-Limited number of servers to play on/not able to start your own server-Other things that are to be expected from an Early Access game, such as limited weapons/customization along with minor bugs/glitches here and there.Bottom Line:9/10... and we're only just getting started.ISM is probably the most well-polished Early Access game on Steam.  It is fully playable (and competitive) in its current state.  All current issues with the game are things any fair-minded gamer should expect from an Early Access game.  Limited number of servers is sure to change as game development progresses.  Looking at both what has already been added, along with the concept art of what Zero Point Software intends to add, is incredibly promising.  Gameplay is not quite as fast-paced as Call of Duty, but is not so slow that it prevents you from running-and-gunning when necessary.For some gameplay, check out my YouTube channel, ""Mobyus1"".

Now, I play the game because I share the dream. Not only is the game becoming a fully-fledged FPS experience ( very  active developers with updates being released almost monthly), but the developers are finally making significant progress toward achieving their goal: realistic sci-fi FPS, in a truly tactical environment. A year ago, this could have been a rough demo. Now, it has grown into a ridiculously satisfying ball of tactical joy that I relish every time I capture a point. So,  for the love of the game , buy  Interstellar Marines  now!			"

								Game is very well done and atmospheric, but some parts of the gameplay are lacking (not enough content). I tried really hard to like the game but coop and solo mode are so short and the multiplayer is generic and boring (only one set of weapons). No doubt the game will be great upon leaving early access, assuming it ever will. This is the kind of game that made people despise early access, showing great potential but then stalling it for months or even years (this one is almost a decade old iirc).I'm not going to argue with anybody about the looks and feeling of the game as I quite enjoyed them, but the gameplay is lacking, especially for a game that has been in developpement for so long.(Playtime is during Free Weekend, and was plenty enough to try out every aspect of the game fully, believe it or not.)

Also it is a team work game that without decent teamwork becomes pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Trying to extract from a mission while a noob is lost in the endless maze of corridors is kind of frustrating.  I just wish they would scrap the missions and go all pvp.  I think that would make the game sooo much fun.  For now I don't recommend it mainly due to the lack of community and the boring missions.

								Took the elevator during the tutorial and fell under the ground.Great way to start the game.Further on, I gave it another try and once again fell deep down the whole map, I think I've made my point.Aside from that I appreciate the detail and atmosphere brought to the NeuroGen mission but I'm definitely not convinced into buying the game in its current state, nor anytime soon as this game falls in the ""forever early alpha"" category.But wait I'm not done yet, not every map seem to function as expected, in particular NeuroGen which occasionally 'forgets' to spawn an item that is critical to the completion of the mission. Now that's a real shame because nevertheless, I'm gonna' have to admit it's one freakin' immersive mission which I really do like for its atmosphere... and it does not work! Did it even work once in the first place? I canot tell you.			"

								I was around the 700th person to get Interstellar Marines during summer time. I've waited quite a while for the developers to give the features that we were promised from the beginning (land sharks, co-op, etc) for about half a damn year. I thought they would add something to this game that would really just ""This is unlike any other game because of this idea"" and wow me. My god was I wrong. I have waited a long time to get my 15 dollars worth but all I get is this extremely clunky, limited, and coreless game that would pass for free as a browser game. The guns, or only gun, for that matter, flies upwards when you try your best to shoot forward making the simplest of shots nearly impossible. The maps are varied, but so dark, you can barely see anything you are shooting. There are no crosshairs, no crouching, no weapon variety, things that are standard of shooters. It is very difficult to find something good about this game at the moment unless you set your standards really low for this ""alpha"" title. I believed, but not anymore. THIS GAME STILL HAS 2 WEAPONS ITS BEEN 2 YEARS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT.			"

As of now their updates have been focused on laying the groundwork for an interesting universe, and so far the game looks decent. The game feels smooth and all the character animations are fantastic. Allthough there isn't much to fight but other players and training bots (scary ones mind you), I feel the foundation that has been created has tremendous potential.			"

Early Access Review
Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Like team gameplay, know a thing or two about FPS shooters.Major Theme: Slow but coming along well.Bought at Price: $0.00 (Gift)I’ve always been a sucker for new first person shooters. As long as you don’t go overboard on the paid content, free to play titles interest me as well.Right from the start I was interested in Interstellar Marines. It wasn’t as if the small team was making yet another textbook example of an average FPS game. A lot of the mechanics are not commonly used in other games, and the environment is completely dynamic. Even the whole helmet idea seems “next-gen” (or whatever the marketing dept. is using these days).Running off Unity, the game does quite well in the graphics department. While it is still not completely optimized, most systems shouldn’t have issues running this game.


Update 11

By: DarK_St3alth




COOP was introduced not too long ago, and there are several player vs. player gamemodes on offer. With such as small team, it is going to take a while to get to the actual meat of the game – fighting mutant sharks and what have you. I’ve seen an update every month, or close to.

Personally I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but to those willing to wait it out, I’m going to recommend the game even in its early access state. As long as you are willing to wait out the slow release cycle, you should in theory have a very nice game to play. Yes there are going to be bugs, I’ve experienced a few in my playtime thus far. I have found that any bugs get addressed in the next update, so I don’t worry too much.

								I don't believe anyone should really buy this game yet. So far it doesn't seem legit, they barley release any updates and when they do they are extreamly small. I bought this game thinking they were actually going to release game updates at least every week or so. Be careful when buying early access games, when they release wait a while and see if you hear good reviews about them. If so and you think the game is interesting then it is your choice to buy it, just make sure you know what early access means for a game. I hope Interstellar Marines gets to the point where it is a full game, but it does not look like it so far. They release updates every couple of weeks. The eight developers just don't seem as active as they should be for this early access game.(Edit) There are only eight devs, get that in your head.I say save your money for now. If you buy this game and you are bored of the concept after a little while, and don't see anything heading for it because of the developer's lack of updates for the game. I say you just wasted your money like I did.(Edit) I feel I wasted my money anyway.Be careful when buying early access games! I just want to make that clear!Thanks for reading!-Dildacorn(Edit)Read the comments!I get feedback from a dev!*Update* - I would ignore this thread, it is old and is not relevant to the new Intersteler Marines. Thanks for reading if you did, but this thread is completely wrong with the recent patches and updates they have put in the game.P.S. When this game is released I am sure it is going to be a great title for fps players! I give a thumbs down in the review, but when this game is fully released I will give this game a solid thumbs up! Thank you for reading.November 24, 2015From reading recent reviews this game still hasn't gotten the attention you would think it would have gotten in 3 years.. Just noting this in the post before you go buying a game that may take up to 10 years to finish.. OR MORE?January 10, 2017This game has gotten some good updates, and seems to have gotten more attention on missions for the game. It all still feels like simulation combat if that makes any sense, because if you have seen vidoes you will notice you are fighting robots and not any creatures yet. I think this game has deffinintly gotten better, but still needs a story. They are getting there! Hopefully the devs do not split up, because I heard rumors of it happening. If this game gets a story, someone please notify me!			"

								The game has a lot of potential, but in this stage of early access, I cannot reccomend buying it.  There are only a small amount of servers with very little players.  Most maps are too open and the player models are too dark to see in most conditions unless they are moving right in front of your face.  The game is not optimized, as I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (a very high end card) and the game barely achieves 60 fps when running at 4:3 resolutions (640 x 480) on low settings!			"

								Pretty shocking that this game has been released in its current state - please don't be misled by the description! Most features are currently in development. Even though the sidebar states ""Co-Op"", that doesn't even exist in its current iteration. The Single-Player stated is being able to walk around maps. That is all.I think the term ""Early Access"" and ""Alpha"" in this case are an understatement. The game has 1 gun. The game does not have the RPG elements. The game has only recently implemented jumping after months in development. Look at the features listed as being IN the game. A flashlight. A visor. A laser-sight. Is that really enough to justify selling this game to customers?Some might like your hardcore shooters. But please. There are better ones out there that aren't of the quality you'd find in a web browser.EDIT: A developer responded (check the comments). Although I understand the game is in Early Access, and I have bought many games under that term. But to release a game with a concept spanning years ago in still a pre-alpha stage with many features missing is just.. Well, wrong. Until the game massively overhauls and includes features that are game defining, what really makes this a ""good game""?			"

								Interstellar Marines for me is like Coca Cola is to fizzy drinks. It's a true benchmark of originality.Yes.... it's developement has been slow in terms of optimising and often I wished updates were fewer and the focus less on polishing and more on grabbing a wider audience in terms of game play quality.Having said that it is a testament to the quality of the game's foundations that give it a strong dedicated select following.The servers are less full now than they used to be which is a shame because it is the players themselves that contibute to the quality of the game. The game itself, in it's rawest form is capable of creating a community that others may not. With full servers this game is absolutely fantastic. Play it more is all I can say.			"

								Great concept and has a lot of potential, first thing is that It is not a finished game and is a little rusty but already is already pretty good.  I haven't played a lot due to the fact that i broke my pc and am currently building another. But the in the little time i got to play the game i still had a lot of fun.  So far in the game you are in a abandoned facility with humanoid robots that want to kill you.  You think that's like a lot of other games but the dark hall ways and the constant sound of foot steps always keeps you on the edge...List of things that are great...1. Great atmosphere, really sets the mood2. Playing Co-op is really fun3. A lot of cool features such as raising your helmet, turning on and off your light and laser.4. Scares the s**t out of you   In general good game with a lot of potential and thumbs up all the way :)			"

								NOTE: if you wish to see this review in its true form check out my blog: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-reveiwinterstellar-marines.htmlIM Multiplayer is very fun and the Guns have that Battlefield realism to them. Most of the Maps are your standard shooter stuff, But one sticks out. ""Operations"" This map goes through three modes: Normal,Alarm, and Darkness. it makes the battles fun and exciting. during the Alarm mode it is hard to aim because of all the noise and flashing lights while in darkness you can not see without using your light, and if you do you will be giving your enemies a clear pointer to where you are.Although it is fun to play the lack of any choice when it comes to guns,armor, even your avatar's look, makes the game get old very fast. There is rarely more than one server with players on it, and sometimes when the server reaches 16 players you wont be allowed in with the game saying ""Error: Server is full"" even thought the limit says 18. Hopefully when the game progresses more there will be more players.  The game sells for $14.99 USD. Unless you get the Spearhead version in which you get all ""including all future updates and expansions"". i dont understand that really, ""All future updates?"" you get the updates no matter what version you have... right?Right now the game is very limited you can't crouch, go prone or do anything other than sprint and walk really. Leveling up does nothing other than giving you a steam achievement,  However the Dev road map promises that and more, including O-Rift support and Linux ports.The Devs seem to be staying on top of things with updates and bug fixes, and they obliviously have big plans for their game.if you want to invest in a small game that may one day become the PC's Halo then checkout Interstellar Marines from Zeropoint Software on Steam.

								This is reminicent of CoD, but with more focus on tactics and strategy. Although it is in alpha, it is a great game. Plus, it's not as expensive as it WILL be, and all updates are FREE when you buy. ZPS is doing a great job fixing as many bugs as they can in their timeline while also adding features at a pretty constant pace, and do an EXCELENT job of listening to the community.Current features include:        *Sprinting - Hold shift to sprint, and tap to toggle run on and off.        *Jumping - Press space to jump; Timing the release of the spacebar enables a slightly larger jump.        *Stamina - Sprinting and jumping reduces stamina.        *Crouching - reduces height of the model of the player and the hitbox.        *Sliding - While sprinting, hit the crouch button (Glitch - this feature currently breaks the hitbox of the player. To be fixed soon).        *Recoil - basic realistic recoil on weapons.        *Weapons: SMG - mid-short range 1.5(ish)x holo-sight. AR - long-mid range 2(ish)x scope.        *Revive - Press and hold <key> to revive a downed teammate (until the circle fills)[15 seconds after being downed players will ""bleed out""].        *Tutorial - Basic ""what to do to move, interact, and kill"" tutorial, and introduces Bots.        *Bots - AI controlled robots that can be set to different difficulties in the settings menu (I suggest Normal for beginners, and Realistic for those who are willing to die a few times)[TUTORIAL REDUCES ACTUAL DIFFICULTY].        *Two ""campaign"" missions - Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace        *Challlenge modes - Survival, Elimination, Nucleus Escape (map), Get Killed by Bots(single-player map).        *Online Multiplayer modes: Deadlock - Capture points to respawn teammates, final marine revives a teammate on a kill, first to eliminate enemy team or capture all points wins (Respawn timer - 120 seconds). Team Death Match - Kill the enemy team until time runs out. The team with most kills wins (Respawn Timer - 15 seconds). Team Domination - Control the point to remove tickets from the enemy team, first to reach zero tickets loses (Respawn Timer - 10 seconds). Free for All - Pretty dang self-explainatory (Respawn timer - 15 seconds).        *HARDCORE MODE - Hellweek : Servers of a max count of 64 players open once every few hours. Start out with a pistol with 15 rounds. Run around the 9 different maps collecting points, ammo, and guns, while avoiding/stalking/killing other players. Last 4 players have their points recorded to the global leaderboard. And, as is par with most hardcore games, NO RESPAWNS.        *Server lists: Multiplayer - AU, JP, USW, USC, USE, BZ, EU, RU servers, ping listed (ping is not accurate, just gives the ballpark with some exceptions). Coop - Same server regions as multiplayer, Includes both ""campaign"" missions, survival and elimination maps, and Nucleus escape (ping same as multiplayer server list)(There is an app on the steam forums that has accurate pings. Just search ""launcher"" in the discussions).			"

								Interstellar Marines, post update 12: The game is in early access on Steam and the most predominant game mode is a multiplayer variation of take and hold terrain. There are several servers available, and it is of course best to chooze the one with the lowest ping. Despite intermittent lag problems the game is very intense and immersive. The graphics are well done and the play between light and shadow is fantastic. Best of all is the audio though, which really adds to the immersion. The teams consists of up to 8 players each, with usually quite varying skill and experience levels. The game is quite hard for all beginners, and can feel quite hopeless when starting as a fresh TR-0. But if you don't give  up, and maybe enjoy a little masochism, you will improve and start to dish it out yourself. Before you  know it (well... hundred hours or more later) you reach top level TR-100. Then it's your turn to dominate the fresh meat pouring in!			"

								do not buy this game!nothing substantial or meaningful has been added to this game since they launched on steam's alpha release program, OVER TWO YEARS AGO. everything the developers have promised up to now has been a lie. i can tell you right now there will never be a campaign and you will never see a live sharkman because they taunt their former customers with only dead ones. i think the developers of this game intend to be making money off your children long after you have forgotten this game. i don't believe they have any intention of ever completing this skeleton of a game.this game is a scam, a total scam and nothing but...the developers of this game are the biggest criminals on steam! they are bad people.understand that the developers do delete every single negative comment from their forums and they ban every user who isn't there to congratulate them on becoming millionaires for producing a perpetually unfinished product!two years in early access and they are no closer to being finished today than when they started because each of the twenty-two updates they have made have been in the tiniest increments imaginagble and after two years they have only managed to bring forth the most basic framework of a game.remember that if you're dumb enough to pay the man.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and yes, i do see that they made another microscopic bs update to the game the day after i made this review, completely by coincidence.of course if you read the extensive changelog closely, you quickly realize that the changelog is padded with about ten reiterations of the same simple feature of ""inviting friends to your game"".i tested this bs update on another account. no improvements have been made. this so-called game is still a tech demo with graphics comparable to doom 3 in terms of visual quality yet the graphics still lag at 1080p inexplicably on powerful desktop pc's. a restrictive, locked fov, (estimated 70 degrees) that will make you puke after fifteen minutes on a 16:9 monitor. two guns that behave identically, both just throw bullets all over the place and they both point to the sky with recoil if you try to empty a magazine and something that might possibly be a shotgun, (really can't tell what it is) sounds like those finger-snaps that you throw against a hard surface and they pop. oh, and the same pathetic AI, reminiscent of Takedown: Red Sabre. also the same ridiculous anti-jumping mechanic that will make you want to reach out and strangle the cognitively impaired person who came up with the idea. this game has been billed as co-op from the start and here we are two years later with a standard deathmatch and no real co-op mode to speak of unless you just like shooting the dumb AI with another person on all the current test maps without any kind of continuity because it's not a campaign although they pretend it is and no cooperative mechanics nor objective other than shoot the pitiful robots that you can often find wandering off by themselves because they lose track of the player.the only people who speak favorably of this game are paid shills and/or gullible children who follow anyone who is willing to lead them.this review is not subject to debate. if you have an opinion to the contrary, keep it to yourself because I am telling it like it is and you know it.

								because... laser party! ...It not finished, not polished, doesn't has a perk system or customization options. But still has the best multiplayer there, on its current state, the game is better than others out there. The co-op mode is awesome, totally tactic, move like a real team, covering the rearguard, taking care each other... And you will be scared. Trust me in here. There are seven co-op maps for now (2 coop campaign levels and 5 coop challenge levels) but you don't need more. The single player is more of the same, tactic, unforgiven, hard... You feel even more fear... cause you will be alone. There is now Hell Week, a pvp and pve online mode, with the style of the Hunger Games, you need survive, finding ammo, weapons, making team with other players (or being a lone wolf)... in a changing environment, a really hard mode, doesn't forgive a mistake.You need to play as a team, understand the battlefield, think each move, do not rush. You can feel the stress of a battle, the pressure, the fear. It's realistic and raw. The changing environment, fighting in dynamic places, you can see around you and suddenly complete darkness (literally). Accesses that appear and disappear, rain, snow, changing ground level...The game has a incredible sound system, you can hear the steps of an enemy and anticipate to its movement, hear it while reloading its gun behind a corner, hear it running on the floor above you... The wind hitting your helmet, the rain dropping on it... The best treatment of the sound, outstanding.There are people who criticize the game, but they don't understand that without their support is very difficult to continue development the game...The devs need all our support, because the game is made entirely independent and with passion, and money doesn't grow on trees ya know. So do not listen to those negative votes, because the game is incredible, the best. Buy the game, then buy another copy to your friends and repeat, because that money is the one producing the game, and with our support the game will become an indie AAA game.The best community that can be found it's in here. The best. What a community! I dare you, I double dare you, to find such a committed, friendly, dedicated and awesome community. We all know each other.The best developers are here, involved with the community. There is even a competitive environment already, with clans and tournaments.We don't play Interstellars Marines, we live it, because those who really see beyond this game, love it, because all of this is  FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.

								Great game, great concept!Interstellar sports only half a dozen levels but as an early access game it is understandable. At this point there are two single player missions (up to 4 players can complete them), a couple of levels for a team of 4 players (designated as coop missions) and some more stages for those eager to play with even more players (multiplayer missions).When not playing against each other you play against robots. With the submachine gun they handle they look like T-800s straight out of the Terminator franchise. Some prefer melee to shooting - on greater difficulties it is easier to die but your friends can revive you.Level design is excellent and the environment changes constantly: changes in the weather affect visibility; suddenly it is nighttime and only your flashlight helps you but then it also reveals your position. At night light poles can aid you or if it is raining the sudden lightning can help you to eliminate your foes.Interestingly, you only have two rifles available. One is intended to help you with targets in greater distance; both can be equipped with a suppressor and laser sight. At this point they serve their purpose but perhaps a melee weapon could be nice.As for graphics: the good old Unity engine delivers. Lighting effects are great - with the quick steps of the approaching robots you are in for a treat due to the excellent atmosphere. In fact, the single player mission revolving around an accident can certainly give you the creeps!Interstellar proves we have to look out for independent video game developers! I am happy to recommend this game - especially now (February 11th, 2015) when it is free to play till next week.			"

								Note: this game is pre-alpha in time of review. Edited it to update some content that's in the game as of 6/3/15.Interstellar Marines is a game I've been following since 2008, it has been redone into the Unity engine and is constantly being updated. The community is fantastic, the dev team is really nice, and it is a overall positive environment. The game has a fun multiplayer component, an awesome lighting system, and has good balancing. The game also have a decent amount of maps that can change as the match progresses mostly by lighting, the atmosphere is very impressive and one of the best in MP FPS games. The game now has COOP with several modes in the game. The Terrorist Hunt-like mode Elimination, the Objective-based Survival, and Nucleus-exclusive Escape. There's also two Campaign maps (The Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace) including a tutorial for the game.The bad: The game has only has two weapons, the framerate isn't that great unless you have a good processor, and content is bare bones. If you expect a lot of stuff in this early version, you'll be disappointed. However, the game is decent enough to sink a lot of hours into it, and the community is remarkable. I would recommend buying it now, mainly for that and for future content.			"

								Listen I bought this game in a long time ago. No I don't have 800 hours playing it but I don't need that many to see that the Devs have lost their original sight for this game. The initial video they put out laid out a basic ""train of thought"" and that was that they wanted to create a Tactical FPS based on their past experiences in games like RB6. The said they wanted it to be a slow methodical FPS in space. Now with that being said, I saw them completely turn from that to a RnG style shooter which other than the polish, differs in no way shape or form from CoD, CS or any other number of titles. I loved the vision and I loved the Idea but I also sort of knew that this would happen because It's a small niche to work in. Soooo many people play ADD/ADHD style games these days. It's hard to fathom that people who actually like slow, methodical, deliberate movements, tactical pausing and even a bit of camping for survival sake, bleed damage one or two shot kills and team survival style play only nume in the single digit percentile of FPS players today. Sooo It's easy to see how a smaller company can lose sight of its intentions and jump into the race that they were trying to avoid in the first place. It doesn't make it any easier for a player such as me who was hoping that they wouldn't but hey, we live and learn.			"

								this game is not dead it is being made by one person and some volunteers (people from the community) so updates take a long time from what ive played its really good and I feel because of this problem with one dev it will be not complete for a long time it is for that reason that I recommend this game if you dont feel like buying it full price then it it on sale its worth it just note the game may never be finished (or will but take a long time) also if you buy and enjoy and know anything about game design maybe volunteer for the dev (note you will not be paid)			"

								The graphics, movements, weapons, and 1st person perspective of this game is fantastic. The story however, is not to my liking. This game is basically Call of Duty meets Friday Night at Freddies. The object of the game is to seek and destroy robots, but the way in which it's done is a bit too drawn out.			"

								Update 1/14/15 - Still pick this up from time to time trying to get into it.  I'm glad to see that they are finally releasing content more readily - almost want to change to a positive review just for that.  However, I still stick by most of the thoughts from the original review.  This game is still only a game ""with potential"" - currently 2 guns and a handful single/multiplayer maps large aspects of the game that is promised are missing and those are the elements that will really set this game apart from a standard FPS.  On a positive note the game LOOKS and sounds amazing and I like that I can see some of the elements starting to come into play such as ranks.  Also I feel a lot better about the state of the game since I have seen updates much more steadily.  Sadly, RIGHT NOW this game feels very shallow and offers nothing unique.  I'm not trying to knock the game too much in early access but I'm just warning for people that a lot of the core elements outline for what this game is meant to be don't seem to be coming in the near future.  I look forward to the day when this game offers something that really grabs me and brings me because I really want to like it, the game just can't hold me for more than 10-20 minutes per session because it feels so flat and uninspired.---Game development is just taking far too long.  It seems that the focus has been big time on graphics and little else.  So if they can apply the level of quality in their lighting effects to ANYTHING else in the game at some point it has a lot of promise, but after a few years I just don't see it coming.  It feels like a blizzard game, lot of time put into something that in the end is ""Okay"" and you're left wondering why it took so long for THAT.There are a lot of game elements missing and I'm not exactly sure why.  Right now you are greeted the same basic things you can find in standard dev kits.  The pure lack of simple features after years of development leads me to believe that this is taking a back burner to something else.  You should be alarmed that they make a big deal about adding in basic things and it just makes me fear how long it will take to implement all that they are setting out to implement (non-linear play, RPG-style character growth, Story) when they can't even implent sprint or a few weapons after years of development.Just grab it when it comes out (if ever) or when it gets closer to completion, you won't be missing anything.  They take so long to do anything the ""future expansions"" you're guranteed with preorder will probably never exist or will take so long you'll have moved on to something else.			"

								Sorry Zero Point Software guys, I really hope I'm wrong here and I'd love to buy/play the finished game. So best of luck!Gave it a shot as it's free for a week which is a nice gesture from the developers. I'm afraid I'm not hugely impressed in it's current playable state particulary after reading the history of the developement which spans a number of years and this is the result. You can certainly see the potential building blocks of a decent game and it promises some ambitious features  (90% of these aren't in the game yet) but ultimately it's a forgettable gaming experience right now and one must assume being developed partime due to the slow updates. I'd probably be a bit more forgiving if there were some especially original elements in this early version that gave it a wow factor of things to come. There aren't, and remains just a list of awesome ideas/plans. In it's current state the level designs feel quite average and lacks any convincing sense of impact when you shoot the enemy. Nothing in the game right now resembles anything that it promises, and that's a bit worrying. I'm not sure the developers have the ability to create that game.  I have a real bad feeling this is going to be a game that's never going to be fully completed and the current heavily discounted price drop and extended free play is a cash grab from the developers in final effort to raise some quick cash to continue the development work. I doubt it will raise the money they need so I'm not going to invest even the paltry sum of under a fiver that's currently available for. As we know Early Access can be a gamble but you sometimes get a vibe if it's worth taking the gamble, and I'm thinking not in this case.			"

								worst pruchase ever made. It went on about 8 months ago with a promising piece of PR Art that sugested a faily advanced point of development and actual skill. What got me was the promise: get it now, it will never be that cheap again. None of this was real and it went 66 % off twice. Some of the devs or friends of em are even giving away free copys. Though in EARLY development nothing that is not trivial like a new slider in the options menu developed over the course of about 8 months. HANDS OFF! till they get a finished Product done...  THERE ARE NO SPACE SHARKS.... 3 (now 5) ""maps"" mp shooter  with precise aiming... no cover system... no tactic elements no nothing... oh.. you can open your helmet... does the sound still get wonky if you do that?... a TECH DEMO at BEST... I feel like I supported lazyness and a big a** office.... Steam is a market place, no kickstarter campaign. I wanna buy games, not potential.To the Dev response:Maybe, they should not accuse people of not getting the early access concept. That's flat out offensive AND shaming, when the results clearly show WHO's not getting it! Since the release of Natural Selection 2 for instance UnknownWorldsEntertainment (5 people) released several updates a week (later less frequently ""only"" thrice a month) for free. Serious contend and balance updates with all new features, Engine performance workovers, models, animations and Maps tewaks. Till only one year later the game was finished and had changed its face several times for the good and had 2 completley free expansion Packs. And you wanna tell me your skill and know how can compete with that? Please stop the hair splitting and convincing of dumb people!.. we are NOT!And where did all the money go? Do you need all of it to implement a points system worth mabye 50 lines of code? Did you hire people who actually are up to it. Cuz' lets face it you worked out an engine. There are NO gameplay elements exept for the Doom 2 MP..... YET...... sure.. insert random promise here.TILL YOU GET IT RIGHT.... I didn't want to be that harsh, but taking peoples money and don't deliver for ages is a di** move. Tell you what. You can refund me and when the game is finished I will buy it AND take everything back... I promise!PS: I should compare the PR work with the actual game on youTube. Cuz' though there are no actual lies in the Trailers, they suggest pretty darn hard things that are not there.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, from what I've played of Interstellar Marines, I have to say I'm not 100% impressed. While I'm aware it's a game in Alpha development the problems which are presented are fundemental things, mechanics and such, which maybe the developers will see from this review.Let's get the ball rolling!First off the bat, there are only three weapons available at present, which to be frank isn't what you'd expect from a future combat simulator. All guns feel pretty much the same the only thing that really differs is one is single shot, one has a scope but less rounds and one has more rounds and is your all round most used gun. Gun sounds are alright, but again there doesn't seem to be  much difference between all of them. The laser sight is a bit weird on all of them, helps a little when shooting from the hip, but if your shooting from the hip you aint gonna hit much anyway. For some reason when you shine the lasersight at plants it acts like a flashlight on the plant as well which is equally as wierd. Maps are, at best... generic, no real detail, lots of spamming of textures, think planetside two but on a reasonable quality that the normal man can run on his PC. Buildings have collision flaws, so you can look into the world at points, where as at others you cant shoot round a corner because an invisible bit of wall is blocking you leaving floating bullet holes. The lighting system is really quite awful, sometimes you can shoo a light out in one shot, some times in three clips, it depends on how stroppy the light is. All lights seem to go through walls which is really bad considering we're no longer in 2005, and when a ligh in a bathroom is seeping out onto the outside decking that's just not cool.Most of your time will be in Single player as for some reason or another I still can't access multiplayer, servers won't refresh, which either suggests a bug or that no servers are up which is a bad thing seeing as the game is being sold as co-op and multiplayer. Single player is pretty dull for the most part, you're AI guide's voice is generic robot and just gives you a headache after a while, it also tries to crack some sarcastic jokes which doesn't make any sense as the rest of the time it's trying to be serious, Sometimes there are also some random adjectives thrown into it's vocalbulary because why not.Most missions are training missions, the one's that actually seem like real assignments are also training missions, but the descrptions don't include that, and you'll be fighting one of two bot variants, one's with guns and flailing shop dummys. One mission can't be completed because the elevator at the end kills the player, and on the same mission they throw in some audio logs which are about the most immersing thing into the universe and even they seem a bit strained.The Robot AI is some sort of horrible combination of skyrim's stealth detection and Deus Ex's: Invisible war. In short terrible. You're given which difficulties you'd like from easy, normal, hard, and ""relaistic"" (Which just means more bots, who can one shot you with some sort of taser you don't seem to be allowed to use). The stealth system is a fraud, you can shoot lights out and hide in the shadows, but this just means it takes bots a few seconds longer to see you, if you shoot a bot even with one of the weapons silencers from some 100 metres away another bot will spawn, will run or walk to where the other one was, find you and kill you. f you don't of course plug him full of some lead. I basically have mastered speed running the maps, you can use stealth or you can just memorise what spawns where, and go in full guns blazing, which works pretty succesfully if you don't panick.In short. 5/10 currently, with improvements could push a 6-8/10 depending on if they start working on new enemy models, multiplayer that works (I've seen none of it) more weapons, grenades, better stealh, lighting and more varied maps and by that I mean maps where metalic grey isn't the colour of every man made surface. Buy it at your own risk, I wouldn't personally reccomend it currently, I think it would have been a better option to release this fully devloped, because personally I coulda waited for the actual release. But hey maybe the devs will turn it around, I'm aware it's meant to be artificial environments and a training simulator but I've seen laser tag places cooler than this.I think I'll edit this in a year's time or so and see if anything changes.

								Okay. So. I played this game. Blasted through a couple of single player missions, cried my way through some Co-op missions due to the lack of stealth ability and it just became a co-op run and gun, then raged my way through multiplayer when i realised i was playing a mix between a CoD (spray and pray) AvP2 (excessive use of darkness) Battlefield (Conquest like map) mash up. Quite frankly. Alpha or not. unless they DRASTICALLY change this game. It's horrible. The movement feels like your on ice all the time, Frame rates are all over the shop 20ish-150, the whole game feels washed out due to lack of colour or too much of the same colour. all in all i don't know why this game is so special. IMO it's not worth the money it's asking for. Alpha/beta or otherwise. I doubt the roots of a game can change. I leave this review utterly disappointed. I couldn't even bring myself to play more than an hour of this game...			"

								WARNING: EARLY ACCESS AT TIME OF REVIEWAt the time of this review, the game is currently in Early Access and is missing a lot of core features like multiple weapons and attachments, Co-op and the immersive story campaign.Interstellar Marines is a Sci-fi Tactical FPS set in a believable future. In early access you take on the role of a special forces soldier training at an underground interplanetary treaty organization (ITO) Facility. The game is currently centered around multiplayer. Where you as the special forces soldier train in a variety of specialized environments. All multiplayer maps feature a unique set of dynamic lighting and elements which really set this game apart from other FPS. The level and map design is ""AAA"" quality, the level designs allow multiple entry ways into most access points and areas allowing for Tactical game-play, and greatly rewarding players who are able to effectively communicate. The game features a distinctive active HUD, which when shot can be disabled adding another level of immersion into the world.For a game that is in early access, it is incredibly polished, with very few bugs and glitches. The game has a very active community. The community Managers are online, on the forums daily, and will even stop by from time to time to play a round with you.Overall I highly recommend this game anyone who enjoys FPS. It is exceptionally well made for a game in early access, fun, and has a great community to be a part of. The game is getting better, and better with every update, and continues to become more tactical and immersive every patch.			"

								A fun little time-waster at best. As of 4/1/14, the game itself is missing quite a few core mechanics that in my opinion really define the term ""First Person Shooter"", which are included but not limited to: more weapons, more game modes, more team-oriented play, more use of an interface, etc.There are currently two game modes, being multiplayer and training. The multiplayer leaves much more to be desired, and unfortunately limits the player to only one class, and one weapon being an SMG; which has to be your close-quarters weapon, sniper rifle, assualt rifle, and secondary weapon. The only way to ""rank-up"" and I use this term lightly here, is to kill openents by shooting them in the head (as body shots do not count towards the enemy being hit); which makes me much rather just want to play Halo's SWAT game mode. Even though the objective of the game is to get your openents ticket count to zero by dominating a controlled area; this can be done much more quickly by just killing openents (and is a lot more lucrative too, seeing as how dominating the control area doesn't help you ""rank up"" at all).There are a few cool mechanics such as the ever changing environments; and the abillity to shoot out lights in the area forcing your openents to fight in the dark; which could either help or hurt you depending in the situation. Overall, it just makes me want more out of it; but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on, as there is major potential.			"

								Forget about this. Nothing the trailer or description promises is actually in the game. I get that this is early access, thus an alpha, but alpha state means the basics are basically implemented albeit in an unpolished and buggy state.You can't promise a ""4 player co-op tactical FPS"" inspired by Rainbow Six, when all you get is 8 servers with random team deathmatch, featuring gameplay that would be archaic even by the standards we had 10 years ago.If you buy this now, this is what you get:A space marine with sluggish controls (you walk very slow, sprint barely changes speed) ONE weapon and useless features like being able to open your helmet. Multiplayer consists of very basic team deathmatch (good luck finding a non-full server though, there's only 8 of them) that feels very uncomfortable due to the aforementioned controls, which are so archaic, especially for a supposedly ""tactical FPS"", that it feels like a joke. Quake did control better than this. Seriously, after multiple updates you are now able to jump (meaning, you press space and then akwardly hop a little bit, after a short delay). What's more, you can't lean to the left/right to peek around corners and you're unable to crouch. In a tactical FPS. It's ridiculous.And don't talk to me about ""it's early access, bla, bla"", we're talking about basic, most fundamental things missing that really undermines my trust i have in the developer.Other critics meantioned the fair and balanced maps and online gameplay. Seriously? I just joined a server in which i killed ONE dude and then subsequently got killed as soon as i spawned. The top player in my team? 43 kills. The top players of the enemy team? 389 and 346 kills respectively.Don't buy it, it's not worth 5 bucks (it's on sale right now) and i'm very doubtful now that this will ever be something akin to a finished game (another critic mentioned that this game is in development since 2009).

IT IS A RIP-OFF AT ANY PRICE!!there is still nothing to this game as of 10-01-2015.also i want to preface this with the fact that the graphics are literally on the level of Doom 3.the fov is fixed and narrow enough to make anybody sick, i was nauseated after less than 15 minutes.and the so called ai are about the most pathetic i have seen since Takedown: Red Sabre.the developers have stated that they do not plan to finish the single player campaign for another five years.the programmers at zero point software intend to become old men while they work on this game but i don't intend to play it when i'm old so buying it was a waste of my money that helped make them millionaires for doing nothing. i don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if future generations play this game when they are born, i wanted to play this game in my lifetime and that is why i gave them money a year ago but i have yet to receive anything in return for it.it took them nine months to add the most pitiful crouch we've seen in a game. it's as though they just rushed the changes through this week so they could advertise it for the current sale.those videos and screenshots look so nice. don't they? the game must be good, right? the problem is, that's all there is to see, most of them are only concept videos and not the real game. they make it look like there is a game to play in the video but it's all fake, there is no gameplay to speak of.look at it closely, what do they actually show of gameplay footage? two guys getting shot, the in-game footage in the video amounts to about four seconds out of a minute and a half of video and you really can't see what's going on in that video, no matter how closely you study it.there is still nothing to this game, the movement and shooting are terrible. each of the arenas is just a big square room with nowhere to go and of course there is also terrible network lag and the most recent update has introduced an incredible drop in framerate, it's like a ♥♥♥♥ing bad dream. and in case you think i have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc, i'm running an 8350fx on a crosshair V formula z w/32gb and an r9 290x.also they are no closer to a campaign and coop today than they were when the game came on steam almost a year ago. READ THE AD CLOSELY, NOTHING THEY ARE SELLING IS IN THE GAME YET AND WHEN QUESTIONED DIRECTLY, THEIR ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR ANY OF IT IS AT LEAST A YEAR AWAY!!you are going to be sorry that you spent your money, if you buy this game, i promise you this.if you are wondering if this game is a scam or not, an owner of the actual product is telling you that it is.now you can't say no one tried to warn you.it's a shame that confidence scammers like these men are allowed to become millionaires overnight for doing nothing more than bringing perpetually unfinished software to steam.

								I followed this game before release on Steam and picked it up on the Day 1 release.Interstellar Marines is a great game and I would recommend it if you would like to support the devs though the process of making the game.  I don't usually write reviews, but this is one of the few games that I think has warranted a review.  Interstellar Marines is a great concept and widely fun.  I know this because I have convinced 8 people to buy it and they all love it.  The devs while struggling through tough times have managed to keep this game alive for many years and while progress is slow, i'm sure the end result will be worth it.  This will be a coop game with multiplayer integrated in with it.  ZPS decided to first start with the player mechanics, so multiplayer was the first thing being developed.  While there are not a lot of people on it, you can still get games going and i've had fun in the Wargames mode known as hell week and have actually gotten into quite a few good firefights.  While the game is barebones as of now, I believe there will be major progress once this game gets a publisher.  I have the patience to wait and love the game and want to see something truely capture the feeling of a sci-fi first contact scenario.Things I like about the game:-The weapon play(Even with only 3 weapons being available)-Art and character design-AI that is actually scary and dangerous-Unique Multiplayer with the C.E.R.A. weather and lighting AI.-Robots -The few Co-op previews on the game are fun. (Even better when you play them with friends)-Hellweek (It's interesting and a very unique gamemode)And now for the one negative:-Lack of content (This is understandable though because of the current state of the dev team and lack of a publisher)I still believe in this game.

								While it is in early access, and the quality of early access steam games is less than reputable, this game's developers have again and again continued to update and fix this game making it the best it could become and will continue to do so into the future. Since I purchased the game in 2013 they have made tremendous leaps and bound in it's development. Buy the game now while it's cheap and give the devs some well earned funds so that you dont have to buy it later when all your friends are raving about it and the game is higher priced.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a very ambitious project. It has a lot of potential but has been held back by financial problems from the credit crunch and the loss of a major investor. They had to start all over again with a new engine. This is why it's taken this long to get this far.What is available right now is bare bones stuff. We have a simple multiplayer game with not much else. The devs don't want to waste time putting things in to the game for the sake of it which then have to be changed further down the line. We have no crouch, lean or even any extra weapons...YET, and that is the key word. All of these things will be implemented in time and from what I've seen of the updates, implemented in a brilliant way.The game as it is now is very well polished, looks, sounds and 'feels' great and will only get better, (and more expensive), as more stuff gets added.I'm very excited by Interstellar Marines as I reckon it's going to be amazing once finished, if you buy now then you do need to realise it's in PRE-ALPHA, so there isn't a great amount of content right now, but even so, the multiplayer is a tense and exciting affair, not to mention a lot of fun, and the level design is magnificent.Pick this game up and it's unlikely, in time, you'll be dissapointed.For the love of the game!

								Quick review.Stealth in this game sucks. No matter if you're sitting under the lamp, or in the deepest pitch black, those ♥♥♥♥ing robots still see you, and snipe you from across the map. Also, almost everything here happens under the veil of night, yet your ♥♥♥♥ing future soldier doesn't seem to have a nightvision. Cool. Also, it works really weird. With my i5 and 8 gibs of ram, I can barely take 30 fps out of it. Also no graphic settings. I lowered my resolution, and turned the shadows to low. That's all you can do.I mean it's not all bad. Animations are cool, graphics too. They're trying, but they're trying for a really long time now.			"

								It's the best Indie FPS I've ever seen! It has some performance issues, hopefully Unity will make it runs smoother, but it's a really good game. In this state it hasn't much to offer, but the developers are working on the game all day and night. It has a very good feature, which I've never seen before, you can make a trip on the maps, and test some lighting effects, and enviroment types. It's a pretty cool feature, but like DayZ it hasn't much to offer. You can play multiplayer, which is crazy good: No name tags, no minimap, and team kill is ON! IF you want to take a look at the gameplay elements head over interstellarmarines.com/game, and try out 2 prototypes for FREE! You just have to register an account and play. It's the only Single Player mode in the whole game, but the game doesn't contains them. Anyway: Interstellar Marines is a good game, but if you want a full game ( or doesn't understand what Early Access means ), then don't buy it yet. But if you'd like an old school multiplayer shooter, with an amazing atmosphere, THEN Interstellar Marines is your game!			"

								The Game isn't really finished. The multiplayer was pretty dead during their big ""Hell Week"" event so I guess it would be even worse any other time. The game is DARK as well. Arma can get pretty dark at night but this game get absolutely pitch black, no light coming off of the screen. The single player AI doesnt need light though, because combat drones can smell you through walls apparently. The singleplayer is a nightmare to play, combat drones spot you instantly regardless of crouch, flashligh, or laser. and they hit every single shot, most times I got detected I died immediately as soon as I rounded a corner that was black as night. Really need to work on that stealth mechanic, but I dont think that was put it yet. Do not reccomend in this state at all.			"

								Production started in 2005 as per the wiki page. 10 years later they are still working on ""recoil"" of the three weapons in the game and multiplayer VS content like Hell Week, despite being advertised as a co-op/single player driven narrative.The idea they are selling is solid and interesting, something a lot of people want - but unless they really start pushing content instead of nitpicking details like how much damage one of their three weapons should do every 6 weeks, I see this game losing a lot of momentum.

								I'm confused.The atmosphere of this game provides some level of stealth, some level of close-encounters jump scares due to the general darkness which seems to haunt every single level in this game. But that's pretty much it.I'm confused. What's special about this game?Interstellar Marines seem to be doing the exact same thing any other FPS on the market does, only with the exclusion of any natural light sources. That's pretty much it. Every map is dark, and you walk up to someone and shoot them in the face while spraying.Is this the selling point? Dark maps? That's it? Seriously, I'm lost.Before any of ye wail : ""But it's just in alpha!! Give it some time!""From what I experienced, the game seems to have its gameplay in order, its roots can hardly change any more than Evolve could've changed while it was in ""Alpha"". All it lacks is some additional content -- but all it means is that what you're looking at is Counter Strike with some extra flavor, or even a Call of Duty in perpetual darkness with no other selling point. Interstellar Marines, as much as I experienced -- is your generic shooter....In space. That's it.Update:Other than my disbelief that there's any actual gameplay (spray-and-pray), I find the free week long trial to be a marketting blunder, who thought a ""pre-alpha"" game is a good demo? Heck, even when stepping into the tutorial of the game, it never does anything to tell you how Interstellar Marines is in any shape or form unique or interesting. You walk around, you shoot stuff for no reason, the end. I was informed they essentially want to create a form of a Rainbow-Six tactical-shooter, but when you finish the tutorial, or when you even finish a multiplayer session....You get absolutely 0% Rainbow 6. You are only welcomed by a ""The Swapper"" atmosphere, which is pleasant, and, sadly, some mindless bot killing. You do nothing but blindly walk around in a poorly lit series of rooms, and spray anyone you can see.That's it.The game, upfront, tells you its current vision : ""Nothing"".I don't buy the ""pre-alpha"" monotony, the game's design is too polished, too satisfying. They clearly thought that'd gain them more sales if the game was an eye-candy, but sadly -- they neglected how the game works, how the game plays out -- and currently, and most likely for the very distant future -- it will not be anything like Rainbow-Six in space. I cannot be anything but cynical regarding the development of this game. If they do manage to pull their vision off, whatever it is, good for them, really. But I fear that might be some time in 2018.TLDR: The CORE OF THE GAME does not exist. Whatever it is they have envisioned, it does not currently exist. After 2-3 years, they have nothing to show for. What were they doing all that time? They sure boast their dynamic-lightning system, but where's the actual game?I seriously think someone up on advertising and marketting thought he was being clever for coming up with this week-long thing, what a rubbish idea. It only demotivated me from buying this game. For shame.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS published in 2013. It's still in early acces... (you probably know what I'm talking about).The Devs seem motivated and active (regular updates) but the game is going anywhere, it feels like nothing has changed in the two years I own the game already. Any other Dev would have already abandoned this, and for a reason. Their idea of creating a AAA-Indie failed obviously. They overdid themselves, and they are still beating this dead horse. It's sad to see what happened to their idea, and how they are using a lot of energy towards this.To come to the things I like about the game:-Active devs-Decent community (not too friendly, not to toxic either)-Different ways to approach an objective-Multiplayer, campaigne and co-op-Some attachments (silencer, flashlight and laser pointer)-A tutorialWhat I didn't like:-3 weapons (where one isn't even implemented in the tutorial yet, also not having the silencer attachment)-Forced fire mode (two are auto)-Overwhelming kick (recoil). This might be interesting, but it just throws me off too much, I can't hit the direction I was aiming at after 3 shots.-Limited number of maps-One sort of enemy (robots)-Same spawnpoint (or at least no great varity)-Hardcore multiplayer, you will get stomped-Outdated graphics (due to the time of development)-Ai..Need i say more... Pretty much the worst I encountered-Repetive as f***, going hand in hand with the limited map pool-Same controles as every FPS (no leaning etc.), making it not as tactical as it could be-Buggy (getting stuck in wall, running in straight lines without pushing the buttons etc.) (may be fixed)-Laggy! When I started playing, I had no problem. Now, I can barely shoot without crazy lag spikes (playing on a Macbook Pro mid 2013 though)I would have loved to see this become an amazing game. The idea is fantastic. However, other games outplayed them (Insurgency). The game is simply a Zombie, not alive, but also not able to die. It has a rotten body, but the heart is gold.In the state I started playing it, i would have said: Yeah, get it on sale, give it a try. I had some fun playing the co-op, however, after the 2nd playtrough I could solo the mission because i knew where what was and where the enemies spawned.Now, I say: Don't buy it, it isn't worth it. If you want to support the devs, do it. But every alcoholic has somebody who provides the alcohol. Just keep that in mind.I'm sorry, but this is not worth your money, nor your time			"

 This game made me a Tactical Space Marine Operator in Space. 10/10 With jokes aside, I really enjoy how this game is so far. It has a ton potential, I'm confident that the game will be good, since it was in development since 2005. Uh on second thought, maybe games with long devs time don't ALWAYS turn out well. *Looks at Colonial Marines* Err-uh anyways. I'm sure this'll turn out just fine. (please forgive me for mentioning that)    The singleplayer/co-op missions are atmospheric, which I absolutely love. It's like both System Shock games, the movie Aliens, and Doom 3 had a baby. (With Alien/Aliens mainly being the inspiration for any sci-fi horror game). Your eyes and ears (mainly your ears) are the only friends you'll have in those missions. As to who or what you're fighting in the missions, well you'll have to figure that out for yourself.The multiplayer is interesting, well. The maps are, for the most part. I love how they have day to night transitions, and weather effects. Not many games have that anymore. I like how it encourages stealth, and team work, I've been playing nothing but Conquest. And I have to say, being the last one alive and having to capture a point, (or waiting out their respawn timer) to bring back members in your team can be pretty exhilerating.I like what I see. A highly enjoyable game, and I expect to see great things when it comes to it's final release, because this has potential.			"

								Interstellar Marines is far from complete and won't be for a long time. However dispite this I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. I find it reminds me of my days played Halo:CE where you could just spawn in and play instead of haveing to bother with loadouts and perks which many games today do. In short I like it's simplicity. Servers are quiet and you'll have to try and play at peak times or organise a group of friends. If you enjoy a simple to join game with friends then this is your game. If you need 5000 guns and attachments and 100 maps then this is not your game.			"

If I remember then I will come back to this in 2 years to say that it is still in early access (90% sure it will probably just be dead at that point).

But the team that is behind the game(zero point software) has actually been doing a great job making the game and add more and more good updates to make it better.so yes, I really enjoy this game a lot and I cant wait to see what this game becomes in the future(I have heard some really cool stuff Is supposed to come).

								Ok so first off i know the game is new and is in alpha and stuff but right away there's some major problems. Now truthfully the idea of what this game is and what its being shaped to become is going to be awesome and i totally love it but right now there's various problems that are supposed to make the games graphics and designs more ""realistic"" but some of these have gone to far, for example the shadows and the trees swaying in the wind these are all great small touches in the game that all games should have but the lag for my laptop is UNBEARABLE even games with 40+ players for me lag alot less, I think truthfully that these are good implements the game should have but you need to fix the framerate or at least find ways to greatly reduce graphics such as reducing shadows to a bear minimum or canceling moving decorations. Next is the rankings, So far i have played quite some matches and theres always one guy whos rank ""TR"" 30 or 40 who has me and all my teammates on the ground before we even see him walk in the room, There needs to be an evening out rank system because either this guy has some OP gun or he's just way to skilled for new players like me trying to actually understand the game. Anyway these are just major things that need to be fixed to make the game welcoming to new players and let them have some even fun matches. Anyway love the concept these are just some problems that me and what seems other players are having. Thanks for your time and I hope to see these implements soon!			"

								A wonderful tactical shooter.This shooter is (as of Update 11) the most immersive game I've ever played.  Every detail is meant to immerse you in the game, and manages to succeed.  I found myself playing with even smaller features simply because I could.  Nice graphics, good sound, especially for early access, and interesting maps.  I especially like the domination game mode, which smaller scale shooters don't see enough of in my opinion.  That said, netcode sucks and you'll die to lag (yes, lag, not lack of skill) a lot more than you should.  Some encounters turn into hilarious spray-and-pray competitions to see who can reload faster and shoot near (not at) the enemy more.  As of update 14, this doesn't seem to be an issue as much, but reviving can be laggy.In Update 11, the addition of an assault rifle is great.  The rifle could definitely use some more ammo and an updated scope, but the general feel is fun.  There is also a new game mode, which needs some tuning but is, overall, quite fun.  UPDATE 14:  Wow this game has progressed.  Co-op is fun and frantic, and gives some great (and conquerable, if you're skilled enough) ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments.  8/10 in current form, would absolutely recommend.			"

								I bought the game because it was on sale in the Steam Store.  I usually do not spend my hard earned money on anything that is less than complete.  Heck, I had never even heard of it before.  The trailer hooked me and the price was right.  I checked out the game for about an hour and enjoyed myself. The dynamic changes to the map environments is brilliant.  One moment the map is at night then changes to day and then dusk and then night...like a real training simulator. The game as is now is deffinately EARLY ACCESS...meaning not much in the way of bells and whistles.  So far they only have one type of multiplayer (a domination) and one usable weapon.  They do have several maps to play on though.       It is not the actual game that amazes me, it is their plans for the future.  After looking in to Zero Point alittle (love thier company motto) and what they have planned for IM. I ""upgraded"" to Spearhead Edition, not for the perks, but to show my support in them and their dream.  If they deliver, there will be a truly amazing game on the market.  Hell, if I had the money I would fund them myself...lol.  My point is that if the devoloper stays true...this will be worth buying/playing.			"

For COD/BF fans, there is no crouch and no prone, no slide, no overly fake elements.  This is about guns with recoil and making sure every shot counts. For TF2 fans, there are no bouncing people and gimmicks.  Some levels are dark and gritty and you can't see beyond the shine of your flashlight or the muzzle flash of your opponents.  No bright color pallettes here.			"

								Fan of the good old days' tactical shooters? This game is for you, it's not much currently (Still Pre-Alpha), but in time it will be the best! The project has been around for almost a decade now, and it has faced everything from lay-offs, rejections, even a failed Kickstarter. And it's still standing strong on its feet. It may be as tactical as Rainbow Six 3, but what it lacks it makes up for with its sci-fi elements. Yeah, shark creatures! Titan walkers! Full 4-player coop campaign! Damn, this game's got everything a gamer would like to see. Words alone can't describe how awesome this game will be. Some may scoff at the idea that something so small could hold such great power!BUY IT NOW, YOU'LL GET EVERY FUTURE DLCs JUST FOR $14.99!!

								For an early access game, this one has a fantastic amount of potential. I had the pleasure of having this gifted to me, and it is easily one of my more favorite early access games, and also a powerful FPS experience.The aesthetics are awesome! The detail in the environment and two gun models is very good. The music and sounds are good - hearing bullets flying near and around you creates an extremely intense experience. One of the best features of this game, however, is the dynamic lighting effects. During gameplay, the enviroment will change - in some levels, there will be an increase/decrease of elevation in certain areas of the game (allowing for sudden height advantages/disadvantages if you are in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time). Even more impressively, the light will switch between day/night-time cycles. During night, you can barely see directly in front of you - and using a flashlight and/or laser pointer for too long may give away your position. Stalking your target, hiding, then killing them when the lights come back on is so gratifying! Different levels also have red warning lights flaring during the night-time cycle, and this helps a little bit with visibility. So far, I have not come across any other game with lighting effects on par with Interstellar Marines.The controls are typical of an FPS and easy to familiarize yourself with. The tutorials are provided in short, informative videos provided within the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate (and actually, to challenging) depending on your experience with the FPS genre. Now, I pride myself at being fairly strong in most competitive shooters, be it first- or third-person; however, I had a rude awakening when I first tried Interstellar Marines. The gameplay is so intense and cutthroat - you die very quickly (which I love), and it took me a few game sessions to find my bearings. Another thing I love about this game is how your heads-up display (HUD) will turn off when you are near death. Considering that friendly fire is always on, it can make firefights very interesting if you cannot remember where your allies and enemies are. You can open your helmet, however, I do not really see a point of doing this (for now). There also is no melee at the time of writing this review. The two weapons you have available is a close-to-medium-ranged submachine gun, as well as a longer-ranged assault rifle. There are no grenades to use. You can crouch, but not go prone, and sprint is already one (you can toggle it off). I am unsure if there is going to be a stamina mechanic, however, as of now, I think you can sprint indefinitely.Overall, if you are an FPS buff, you MUST try this game. You will not regret it.Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

But sadly, this game feels as if it is still in very early access. like it has not even moved at all. I've been reading the game is in Dev. hell, and it happens.. but like similar reviewers have said, I refuse to support EA games anymore.. as they have a high chance in becoming something like this game.

								The game still needs a lot of basic & simple required functionality as far as movement controls are concerned. These things are not only necessary but required in any real first person shooter. Especially those claiming to be among the best tactical shooters. While they finally added jump after a year, unfortunately they still have yet to add the most basic movement controls a soldier requires such as crouch, prone & lean. It's not that hard to add, & it should be a number one priority. These essentials are much more important then say new maps or a laser sight or a very cool & innovated helmet feature which the game employs. It just shows the dev teams priorities are bizarre after 9 updates they focus on maps & other interesting but unnecessary features when compared with essential & simple basic movement controls. VOIP would be nice as well & also an initial requirement for a tactical shooter, not as important as basic movement control but certainly a desired feature in any modern FPS.Another aspect seriously lacking after a year & 9 updates is that there is still only 1 weapon available. No pistol, no nades or any equipment. Don't let the concept art fool you. Again not sure what the devleopers priorities are but clearly movement control & weapon selection are of little or no concern to them. Go figure!The game is pretty good & has potential to be even better in the future if they ever figure out how to program simple things like crouch & prone & lean! Seeing how the developers obviously don't feel these things are important, It is my opinion that you would be much happier & satisfied getting Insurgency, America's Army Proving Ground or even Takedown Red Sabre, if you enjoy excellent tactical shooters with frequent updates & a more skilled & tactical player base. It is obvious that those games developers are able to understand the simple concept that having complete movement controls for your character are actually a number one priority. Weapon selection also would be expected. Being stuck with one weapon after a year & serious movement restriction is pathetic. There is simply no excuse for those most basic features not being included in any of the 9 updates so far. All that being said I can still recommend this game. It is unique & uses the new Unity engine which is gorgeous & has great environmental effects & has a lot of potential as does the game itself.  The developers seriously need to get on the ball. There are simply no excuses for their laziness & obvious lack of effort or perhaps skill, in providing the most essential elements in any shooter. Early access?? This game is so far from alpha is is zeta! º¿º			"

								I love Interstellar Marines!!!It's currently a game in progress but totally worth getting right now. Several types of game play:PlaygroundSingle playerCo-opMultiplayerHell WeekMaps:Maps are dynamic, anamorphic and dirty unlike other FPS games.In Breif:Dynamic elements:Ever changing light and weather conditions. These change at random intervals and the associated sounds increase the realizm of the moment. One moment a gentle breeze and sunny skies, the darkness rolls in with hard wind and driving rain, a short while later... Darkness falls and silence... A flashlight or walking could give you away...Anamorphic elements:Most other FPS maps are quite static with maybe a door or a window to break to achieve an objective. In ISM many maps physically change often causing you to reroute to achieve an objective. Matched with everchanging environmental variables this is quite engaging.Dirty elements:I love the fact that the physical ripples of water motion can give away a creeping enemy. You hide in long blades of tall grass or have ferns providing disguising you for an unaware opponent.Tracking a target that runs into a bush and still nailing him; but they run behind a tree and you miss... A missed shot can give you away. Sometimes you're in a combination bushes grass and trees, you might be spotted and shot at. They might hit or miss depending on that coverage. It's harder to hit what you can't clearly see...This provides a better sense of realism than other POP FPS games with maps that have clear sightlines in all directions and no cover.Currently there are 3 guns:Pistol with ironsightSubmachine gun with dot sight x2 zoomBattle rifle with ACOG x4 zoomAll are equipped with Flashlights Suppressors and Lazers.Each have different fire rates, damages and accuracies.Fresh free content on an almost monthly basis with huge updates quarterly to semi annually.The Dev's:ISM Devs are all approachable and easy to talk to. There's an event every Monday/Tuesday where the dev's join into a public game and interact directly with the players. Don't miss out! They even have a teamspeak channel for all to speak freely.I'll most more as ISM evolves. Don't pass up on this great game!THE SHORTER BREIF REVIEW:This is the best game you never played!The maps are dirty and anamorphic with dynamic weather conditions.The Dirty: You can actually hide in the environment. Stratiegic use of camoflauge and environmental terrain is fantastic; actually blending in to your surroundings!Anamorphic: The terrain constantly changes. You have to change your thinking on the fly to achieve objectives.  This is unheard of in  any other game ever played!Dynamic:The weather variables add a unique element to play. One monent its sunny and calm making you easily heard as you run; next its stormy and raining which maskes your running but also makes it harder to hear and spot enemey movements. then it's almost pitch black. Do you wisk using your tactical flashlight and give away your position or do you fumble in the dark hoping to catch an enemy off guard?Extras:There are single, co-op and multiplayer missions with adjustable difficulties on the single and co-op missions. also there is the scavanger hellweek.Hellweek is meant to mimic the real world marines final rite of passage. 9 different servers all interconnected with up to 64 players each! It lives up to the name!This game is in development and the dev team is working hard to release patches that are hassle free; they are doing an excellent job!Be part of this great legacy!			"

								A genuinely tense gaming experience without resorting to cheap jumpscares... and it's not even really a horror game.  The devs are active within the community and if you join the steam community group you'll be notified about the community events where one of the devs livestreams the game on twitch, talks to players on teamspeak, and everyone has a really good time so be sure to check that out.One thing people forget when commenting on how incomplete an early access game is, is how much opportunity there is to give feedback at a time where it can actually be implemented into the game.  It's obvious the team is very passionate and dedicated to finishing this game so I'm not worried about that like with some others on early access.			"

								Every single update only makes this game even cooler. I can't wait until the full release and the release of the coop mode. This game definitely blew me away when I first saw it, and it's continued to improve since then. I think this is the best indie game I have ever seen.			"

								A very intense and suspenseful FPS. Good overall game mechanics and excellent single-player and co-op missions. If there's anything negative about the game, is its slow development. But they release regular updates and with each update the game seems to get better and better.Also, them robots scare the crap out of me. 8.5/10PS: I have played many hours before this game was released on Steam Early Access. I plan to play more of it soon here on Steam.			"

								This game has amazing graphics and an interesting concept; however, it has a lot of bugs and there is almost 0 gameplay, at the moment at least. I would recommend getting this when it is further along development if you don't want an incomplete game. Personally, I got bored after half an hour.			"

								At time of writing --- 5/31/2014I definitely reccomend this game. Consider it's still in alpha, the gameplay it does deliver is fluid, fast paced and to be honest, I don't see anything like it around. The maps are highly developed with a high level of attention to detail, and perform in game perfectly. The two weapons available are both balanced and have their ideal situations. Of course the game being in alpha has a few issues, the main one being lack of optimisation for computers. I will give a warning that people with non-specialised computers (i.e. computers not built for gaming) will find the experience unnattractive due to low framerates and latency, so waiting for future updates would probably be best. One point however, it would be appreciated if you could have more than 6 (or however many there are) graphics settings. However, they have been promised in future updates.All in all, I could not reccomend this game anymore. Besides, for the maximum price of £13.99 it's a worthy investment to a game that in time, could rival most of the AAA FPS's out there. "

								Now before i get any kind of response to people who see the red thumb, i would like to say that i do not DISLIKE the game, i simply feel it is not developed enough to buy it and expect to have hours of gameplay. I actually really like the possibilities that this game could have. So now that i got that off my chest, i would like to tell the people who are looking at this review for some kind of 'make it or break it' statement. This game is not fully developed, with a single gun, 7 maps, and a minimap. I did my research on this game and its developers, and i find that with such a small development team, they are doing as much as they can in their power to get this game up to its full potential. I personally bought into this game knowing it will be something great, and I put money into it to expecting pre-alpha. I bought it to hopefully be that extra tiny push to get them developing. In conclusion, if you are here to buy a game that is in pre-alpha, know that it is in pre-alpha and in its most simplistic form. If you would like to invest into something that will be great, after some time, feel free to join in! For the Devs :)Just want to let you know how much i want this game to become something great, and how much i want this game to be my next favorite PC shooter. Don't let the negativity get to you. Keep it up and make this game worth mine and everyones money!			"

NOTE: THIS IS A FANBOY REVIEW!!This review was made in 2013. I was quite the fanboy of the game back then. I may update this review to fit the games current state and to get rid of my past fanboyism.I understand that some people think that this game sucks because you can't jump (which you can now), crouch, there's only one weapon ATM.But hey! How many shooting weapons did Mario have in the first Mario game? One! (The fireball) Was it a bad game? Not it was really fun and it still is! (I know cause I have it for the NES :-D)So why is that relevant? That is because it's just features! You don't even need these features for a game to be fun! I understand that some people have standards these days because every FPS game include loads of weapons and stuff but in the end: You don't need it to have fun! Simple games can be fun! Remember Minecraft in alpha? That was really simple but still really fun!Also! This is a game somewhere between alpha and pre-alpha so what did you expect? You're not seppose to expect games with a lot of content if you buy games on Early Access!Now! Since this is a somewhat review I guess I gotta say my overall opinion about the game and stop telling people why they are wrong about the game.I will review this while keeping in mind that it is in alpha.Interstellar Marines is a really fun game if you get together with some guys in a match. It can be challenging if you're new to the game but it doesn't take much time to get the hang of it.The graphics are pretty decent for an indie title.The game runs smoothly even at 40 FPS (I have a hard time playing other games at 40 FPS).The maps are fun and exciting and there are many ways to trick or storm your enemy with many entry points, hiding places and sniping positions.The maps also have this really amazing dynamic weather system where it changes the weather a few times while playing a match. Some times it gets really foggy and other times it gets so dark that you can't see anything without the flashlight on but if you turn it on you will reveal your position to the enemy. I personally think that the darkness in this game is one of the most amazing things in a game. My heart always starts pumping of excitment when it gets dark and this is one of those few games that arn't scared of the dark cause I've seen a lot of games with dark level where you can just barly see without a flashlight but in this game it's a different story! Which adds some realism and immersion to the game.I got a little ahead of my self with that darkness talking so let's just get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Playable at 40 FPS+ Fun and challenging+ Dynamic weather+ Amazing darkness+ Decent graphics+ Great maps for tactical opportunities(+) One really unice map that changes the height of it's floors while playing+ Fun gamemode (Domination like)+ Nice sound+ Singleplayer room made for players to test the new featuresCons:- Only one playable gamemode even though they've made two- None of their two singeplayer modes from the official site in the game- No connection to your user made on the official site- Progress feels kinda slow(I didn't like to write that last con because I'm a fan of the game and I understand why it's going slowly but it doesn't change the fact that it's going slowly)So this is my review of Interstellar Marines in it's current version (version 7).Since this is a game in alpha state I might make a new review of it when it's fully released cause you can't really rate a product that isn't done yet. If this was the final release then yes. It would not be worth the money but it is in alpha so I do actually think this is worth the money.- Martin Schultz / Mtsmts			"

This is an awesome game for Pre-Alpha. When you first play this game, you probably will get slaughtered all the time, but practice makes perfect. At the time of writing this the game does not have many features or gamemodes but the devs have been hard at work making the game we know and love today. If you don't like it now, give it a year or two and then come back, it should be way better then :)9/10 "

								Very interesting game and concept.Overall, I'd recommend this game to people interested in an ""Alien Swarm""-like game, except in first person. Heavy emphasis on squad tactics and strategy over reflex shooting.The 10$ price tag is a bit high for the amount of content in the game, but there is a high amount of replayability for the achievement hunter or perfectionist.Keep in mind, this is an early access game, which means that it is not meant to compete with other, similarly priced titles.

								I want to like this game. It has a great concept, but the development is way to slow. I know that they have had development problems (e.g. switching engines) but there is too little progress.			"

								Now first off the game had potential. I say had because progress is painfully slow. I understand that the devs have had very tough times and have been screwed over countless times. I simply don't recommend the game because updates take way too long to come out, have little content (don't you dare get on with me about hell week. few of us asked for that), don't progress the goal of the game (co-op campaign but we get multiplayer instead), and add more bugs that don't get fixed. I've been optimistic with this game for too long. I can't do it anymore. Plain and simple. It's in development hell and won't ever come out.			"

								Great potential but the game sufffers from huge performance issues. This game does not lack content especially for a  early access game as it includes Single Player, Multiplayer, Coop and a new feature called hell week (i'm not totally sure what this is; I would like to play it but no one is ever on the servers) . Interstellar Marines has a solid story despite it being fairly difficult to complete. Multiplayer is ok but there are never anyone on the servers. Sometimes you will find the devs on european servers but i am yet to see players on any other server. Lastly IM suffers greatly from performance issues, My computer (amd fx 6350 + sapphire tri x 290) runs medium settings, 1920x1080 at ~20 fps. this game has great potential but is currently lacking many critical features.

								By far the best environmental variables captured in a FPS ever. I have played FPS since DOOM and this game has nailed 100% the feeling of player weight, size and inertia in a game. The lighting sounds and environmental conditions are stellar. The maps are challenging and allow for a tactical approach.  The AI are stupid enough to boost ones ego but smart enough to continue playing against them. The AI difficulty is adjustable so once a player gets used to the game mechanics, he/she can crank up the difficulty. Weapon variety and ballistics just feel right. Multiple game modes and maps keep the game interesting and the sound of a 600lb robot running at you will get the adrenaline pumping. I can go on and on about how this game feels but until you try for yourself words will just not do it any justice. 5 out of 5, even in Beta.			"

								The game just doesn't have enough content to support a decent playerbase. The multiplayer is bad and you will have trouble finding a game to even play. The singleplayer I thought had so much potential, but the devs just won't lean towards it anymore. The updates are too small to get anyone back into the game and eventually ZPS will simply run out of funding before anyhting good gets done. Do not buy this game.			"

								I cannot write a full review since the game isn't fully out yet although that it kina is like a Dayz first person shooter in space(because it's been in develpment forever) I still think that the game is pretty awsome and fun to play with friends. Before anyone checks my playtime on the game I want you to know that it is on another account that I no longer have acces to since I forgot the password. Anyways I think this game is fun and is a must play with friends even though it's early access.			"

								A friend told me about this game, and I thought to myself... oh no not another fps game... what can they do differently that 100 other games haven't already done?Well after trying it for a short 1 hr, I can say this game is a cut above the rest, already it demonstrates more common sense and playability than other fps's I have tried, and I just had to pop in and write something positive about this game and how (I would hope) it to go forward in the months and years to come.I could start with the level design, realistic environments that really immerse you into the game, shadows of opposing players running through your screen makes your heart jump every single time, the terrain is almost flawless every detail is considered and implemented perfectly, and try to remember this is pre-release and they have done so much already, I cannot imagine how a finished level will look and feel to play in, but I do know it will be an awesome sight, and a terrible fright !! Each level design is made to have you gripped to your console, after playing a couple of levels I noticed a slight pain in my right arm, FROM GRIPPING THE MOUSE TOO HARD !!! These levels are intense, the design is breathtaking and although it's per-release I would still recommend you and a few friends playing multiplayer for a couple of hours and I bet 20,000 zorks you will be hooked.Moving on to actual game play, it's about as real life as you can get (without getting shot ofc) in Pre-release we only have the smg, which is fine I would like to get a hand on a rifle or frag grenade but I'm sure it will come in good time, when it's ready and not before. Dealing with the smg is a lot different than every other fps I've seen (which isn't everyone, but a few)So lets say you spot a shadow in the dark of night, and you pump a few rounds into it getting your first kill of the evening, you'll notice the guns aim doesn't reset to center, oh no it stays in the last place you fired it, until you aim somewhere else, I have to say I love this feature, it's about as close real as real gets, absolutely no easy aiming. Everything must be done intentionally and with extreme malice, which will quickly sort out the pro's from the novices in no time. We have yet to see some kind of ranking system, to allow for the learning curb in this game, every at the moment gets mashed together and the best team wins. But I guess right now Zero Point Software is working on game play over ranking mechanics at the moment, but don't worry we already know this game is going to be amazing to play, casual, competitive or solo, so I don't think anyone cares about mechanics just yet. (but I'm sure it's on the list)Stamina and exhaustion, keeping a good balance seems to be the key here, when your exhausted you can't really aim correctly or sprint... or jump very high, and recovery time can be an issue if you run into a building full of the enemy team, in the dark.... to afraid to turn on your flashlight in case you get spotted ! (would love to see some thermal imaging, though perhaps only heat signatures and not obstacles to allow some fairness also.) So for right now I sprint for short bursts at a time, not allowing exhaustion to overcome me, (You don't really get feeling of moving fast when you sprint, perhaps some blurred edges and slightly increasing the speed of your sprint would help make it feel like your character is moving faster)Weapons - SMG at the moment, and it acts and feels like a SMG should, good work on that, and I hope to see as much thought and detail in the rest of the weapons once they are released.Solo content - Looking forward to it, and I hope it has as much diversity as ME3 when it comes to missions, non liner progression, pick-ups and power ups, and perhaps even a squad selection window even more immersion.Overall it looks amazing, feels great, plays well and can still make your heart jump or skip a beat when it gets very intense, recommended to all players who love realism and high detail, and with upcoming releases and updates this game is going to be one game you just can't put down.Great work so far ZeroPoint,			"

								This game says single, multiplayer, and co-op. There is no co-op, and there is no single player. Only multiplayer. Add to that a whopping 20 players online at any one particular time... Well you get the idea. The game seems like it has potential. However with almost no players and two very big parts of the game MISSING, I have to say this game is a go... Preceeded by a no that is.

								For a pre-alpha, this game looks amazing, and handles just as well. I'm able to run this game at highest graphical settings on a 2011 Macbook air and still nail a solid FPS, which speaks volumes for the excellent backend work that has been done so far. Don't take its performance to mean it's graphically unimpressive, however: the game is one of the best looking FPS's I've seen in a very long time, with dynamic lighting and environments, fully realized particle effects, and an incredibly fun shooting system.Hell, this game already surpasses some of its inspirations, and I can't wait to see how it develops in the future. Well worth the Spearhead Edition.			"

								As of writing this review I don't believe that this game is worth the buy. I was stupid enough to buy the Spearhead Edition when this♥♥♥♥♥♥first came out, but I would never buy it again. I'm pretty sure I have more hours on Takedown: Red Sabre, and thats pretty sad. The problem with this game is that there really isn't much progress since the game first showed up on Steam. A pvp multiplayer that has like a whole 20 people on at any given time, a coop mode that I haven't seen anyone playing, and of course the single-player. PVP comes in 2 flavors: 1) Everybody is hiding in a corner 2) Everybody is running around frantically shooting their smg's at the first person they see. Coop and singleplayer are completely interchangable experiences. You shoot robots, every robot is pretty much the same, and will either have aimbot level accuracy or shoot nowhere near you until its aimbot.exe is done loading. You'd have more entertainment value from your $15 if you spent it on a box with nothing in it.			"

								Development since Date: Jul 2, 2013, I cannot recommend this game since there have been no viable updates or foreseeable completion. It seem like a great game but at this time its mostly dead, no direction and nothing but empty promises of features. I have no actual rating for the game but I personally will no longer invest in kick starter projects. It seems as the gaming industry has become a cesspool of failure.			"

								Interstellar Marines is hard for me to recommend in its current condition. While it's visually spectacular and deserves some slack for the fact that it's still not complete, it does not have any partically unique nor remarkable gameplay aspects. They've said it themselves: it is an overly ambitious, wannabe sci-fi experience that is trying to fit in with the quality of popular shooters such as Half-Life and Doom. The problem is, however, instead of offering any new or simple themes to the gameplay, this game clones the gameplay of your average online shooter. For an indie game to become successful (like Minecraft, Fez or Amnesia) it has to introduce new gameplay features that dramatically change the experience in its genre. Interstellar Marines tries to do this but only manages to create minor enhancements to the gameplay such as 'lifting up your helmet' or 'not being able to figure out who is and isn't your teammate after you've been shot too much'. One feature, however, that I really enjoyed on a few of the maps is the variation of brightness or conditions (such as weather and fog) on the maps. On some of the maps this can be quite annoying, but on others this really helps create a genuine atmosphere and truly immerses you in the gameplay.The best I can say is that you're guaranteed some fun playing some of the brilliantly designed maps and immersing yourself in the impressive graphics and typical FPS mechanics. I'm also looking forward to seeing how they eventually execute the single player gameplay.Unfortunately though, if this game is trying to rival other Sci-Fi shooters, it has a long way to go. Simple aspects that are essential for creating immersive and strategic gameplay such as crouching, meleeing or throwing grenades still haven't been added to the experience, and this must be included in the SOONEST UPDATE POSSIBLE. Furthermore, in the eventual finished product, I would expect to see some real, brand new ways to play the game that we've never seen before, especially considering the goals it is trying to achieve. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST GAME POSSIBLE, DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL OTHERWISE THERE'S NO POINT.Hopefully we'll eventually see this game in a much better quality than it is at the moment, but for now I simply can't recommend it to anyone until there's a large increase in overall content.

								To be completely honest, I didn't buy this game, I invested in it. Several years ago they had a promotion for people who spent a certain amount of money to obtain ""stock"" in the company. I was one of those people. (I had to sign paperwork and mail it to them.)This was all before it was ever greenlit on steam. Now, a lot of people say that it's slow or it won't be finished. Most people compare a small time-frame of from EA release until now, or an even shorter time-frame of ""Free Week"" until now. What I compare is literally from the time I invested in it, it was a browser-based unity engine, without an actual ""client"" to now.Then, it had a few things to play around with, empty maps to explore, the visor, changing weather/day-night cycles, etc. Now it has multiplayer, coop, an emerging ""campaign,"" and even some fun little things to find in some of the maps. (Personally found one of the shark models and took a screen-shot of it.)While a lot of Early Access is considered failures or scams, eventually being abandoned by devs, I don't believe this is one of them. Sure it's slow, but how long does it take a AAA company to pump out a mediocre game with teams of 100s of people? Two or three years? This game has less people, and are working on a level of immersion I have yet to see in an FPS. I'd say that would take a lot of time. Now, call me crazy, maybe I wasted hundreds of dollars, (Yes, I spent several hundred dollars), but I am excrutiatingly picky about games I buy, and even pickier about games I ""invest"" in. To date, only one of them has ""failed"" me, and that's Star Forge. Should this game succeed, I can see it changing the face of the FPS genre from here on out. A lot of ""new"" FPS's are simply revamped graphics with the same content. This one promises to introduce new ""features.""Bottom line:Don't buy if you are: Impatient, don't have faith in Early Access as a general rule, expect a whole lot of content right out of the box (current box at the time of this writing)Do buy: If you actually read what I wrote, are willing to place faith in a potentially genre-changing title, don't mind slower updates.Why: Because no matter if you buy it now or not, if the game fails, it's impossible that you will have wasted as much money as myself (Unless you also bought into the stock option back then, in which case I was on the lower tiers).

								I've spend 1 hour with this game and I know only one thing: in current state it's rubbish. Lack of content is not a problem. Main reason I really, really don't like this game is shooting mechanics - delay between hitting the trigger and starting shooting is huge. Bullet speed is also freaking slow. Close combat (less than 2 meters) looks like some comedy - 2 guys going around each other emptying mags after mags. If you're looking for some realistic tactical game - buy ArmA 3.It's just bad - very bad.			"

								Interstellar Marines, early access, bugs and a very fun game! Wow, I think Insurgency and CoD had a baby guys. Very interesting story/lore in the campaign missions that can be played on both single player and coop. Multiplayer is fun, a little annoying at times with no kill board and one-line at a time chat box but none-the-less, it is a fun experience. Play casual or register at Phyre gaming[www.phyregaming.com] to compete in tournaments. Over all 9/10. I definitly recomend this game to anyone with a PC with mid range specs (2.5GHz CPU, NVidia GT with 2GB. Anything better and you're good to go).			"

								Yes, there are little players. Yes, it IS very raw. Yes it is in Early Acces for a long time. BUT... This shooter has a very strong base. It has an awesome sci-fi setting, interesting gameplay. I don't know why other people write negative reviews just because of some low budget problems! The only thing that makes me go ""argh!"" is the requirements. It said GTX 120 and around 4GB RAM as recomended but it has only 21 fps (which are rather stable) on GTX 330M (maybe because of M?) and 8GB RAM.Overall Conclusion: Good game! Keep it up, devs!P.S: Liked it from the first look.			"

								This game is missing too much and the gameplay itself is not enjoyable enough to make up for the lack of content. Six years is a long time to be working on a game and I expect there to be more available after all that time. I will say I do like the coop missions. They have a suspenseful atmosphere. Like I have been saying though, I just wish there was more content than just the same two enemies, same two guns, and same objectives. Definitely not worth the $19. I would recommend it if the price was below $10.			"

								I've been following this game since 2009.... what can I say, the dev team is inspirational and their commitment to telling a story through game is amazing.ATM the game consists only of a variety of multiplayer and co-op features that serve the role of providing a living platform for the team to develop around.Even though these game modes may seem seperate from the final goal they actually fold in amazingly well with the narrative providing almost a pre-prologue setting as you ""train"" (play the game) for the interstellar marines.Pros:- Amazing goals and story to be told.- Wonderfully executed deep understanding of what makes a game immersive and captivating.- Enjoyable early access/beta game modes.Cons:- Buying into this early access is a long term investment that requires a lot of trust in the dev team.- Unless you are commited and interesting in the long term journey of this game the current material    may seem pointless/repetative/boring after a few hours play due to the slowly developing features etc.- Due to this nature there aren't a lot of players online at any one time which limits server choice.Do I recomend you jump on this? HELL YES!!!But please don't expect some full stand-alone game.This is about joining a story.... the end goal for us all is the narrative to come (just ask the devs... they wont bite)			"

								I don't even have to be saying this, go buy this game! This is one of the most intense and immersive FPS ive played, it has amazing potential and is just hellafun, I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH FUN WITH AN !EARLY ACCSES GAME! The maps are amazing, the way the enviornment and sounds works make it feel real. I love the weather, usually in games like minecraft i would hate the rain, but i absolutly love it when it rains in this game, its amazing. And in most games, the sound is somtimes overlooked by users, one of the many things that stands out about this game is the sounds, you CANT play this game and not stop to enjoy the sounds of rain patting down on barricades... even if you just got shot in the head. I pat the men and women on the back who put those sounds in the game. The controls are very smooth and the character animations are great! One thing that also stands out is the lack of a HUD, usually in FPS's you have your health, amunition, and energy all just stuck to your face, in Interstellar Marines you are looing through a simple dang fancey lookin helmet, nothing to break the immersion. And the way they did the helmet ammo display is awesome, also if you press h you can lift up your helmet, making for an amazing immersive experience that i havent seen in another game. Overall i highly reccomend INTERSTELLAR MARINES and i love where its going. And in this game, if you play your cards right, you CAN be a one man army.			"

								This game is looking like a very promising space-shooter. I purchased the spearhead edition of the game because I thought it was very cool how the developers promised to put your name in the credits. It also comes with an extra copy of the game which you can send to a friend, as well as the game's soundtrack and concept art. Interstellar Marines is different from other shooters in a really cool way. Dynamic environments. Every few minutes or so the weather,lighting or structure of the map itself will change. I like this because it forces you to switch up strategies depending on the condition of the battlefield. The changing environments will affect your combat behavior as well as the behavior of your enemies. Barriers will be erected, the game will go dark or flash red emergency lights. It's kinda reminded me of paintball in a lot of ways. You can be eliminated quickly, but if you are strategic enough, you can prevail.I can't wait when this game is released in its final form.			"

I should also mention this game looks GOOD. Amazing even. Better than most Triple A titles. So, with all that in mind, I would get this game. The potential this game has is even better given how hard the devs are working and updating the game all the time. The is an early ALPHA build. Not beta.

								ISM is a great take on the old tactical FPS genre. It punishes head-long derp rushes a la Halo, GOW, or Unreal Tournament, instead rewarding careful movement, foresight, tactical analysis, and a steady ♥♥♥♥-you gun hand. While in it's current state (Update 10 as of this writing) feels sort of limited (one gun, no customization, missing several features of other FPS game like sprinting or melee), the gunplay is solid, the movement is slick, the graphics as beautiful (especially on ultra. Dat Pc Master Race), and the maps are amazing (Pitch black? Do you dare risk the flashlight for some clear sight that everyone else can see? Turn on the laser sight for some accurate hipfire at the expense of everyone seeing where the ♥♥♥♥ you are? Decisions, decisions!).I can't recommend this as a full game, not in it's current state. But as an Early Access game?♥♥♥♥ yeah.Get in here, Marine. Training starts in five.			"

								I thought I would edit my review, seeing as I had been playing it a bit more over the past few days.Interstellar Marines still is very much in Early Access, and has been for as long as I can remember, seeing it pop up on Kickstarter some years ago. Though fear not, though we've had some shaky EA games recently, the attention to detail and updates coming to this game show no sign of slowing down. We received a campaign type map mode to play either singleplayer or cooperatively, there's also another more linear map that can be played singleplayer or cooperatively, and then there are the whole host of survival and extinction maps to play either singleplayer or cooperatively. This is all on top of the previous PvP game mode that was already implemented.The coop and singleplayer have you facing against both armed and unarmed CTRs, or Combat Training Robots. There is a small bug where when you kill an armed one it still comes up saying unarmed, and it says +15 points for killing one when you only get 5; but they're minor issues.The dev team at Zero Point Software really know how to do atmosphere. In some of the survival modes, near the end of the sequence the whole map goes pitch black, you HAVE to use your flashlight. Of course, this means you can only see in the direction you're facing, it also means that when you reload the light points into the air somewhat as it's an underbarrel mounted flashlight. This makes for super intense moments when you can hear the unarmed CTRs running towards you, but have no idea where they are.The environments are also amazing, the rain and effect it leaves on your helmet visor, the fog, the alarm lighting, and just the areas you're dropped into in general. Definitely a fantastic game, if you ever see it in a bundle, I would buy it without question as you will not regret it, even the Steam store asking price isn't bad for what you're getting, especially with the stream and quality of updates.

								For what the game is right now, it certainly has alot of potenial. Its generally a rather fun game with moments of you mowing down your enemies and there are moments where the game is a bit annoying. But I can't really complain about an Early Access, right now its definitly fun to play but as they keep adding more and more content it will get better.Buy if your into helping AAA Indie games, and for space shooters.

								Fun, It's early access, so I think it's got a ways to go before the final product.  That being said, for an early access game the gameplay is phenominal, and the visuals are stunning.  I firmly reccomend this game to anybody that likes backtobasics fps games.  I see great things for this game in the future, and I can't wait to see what's in store.			"

								Interstellar Marines. In it's current form is very entertaining and fulfilling experience after you understand the mechanics underlying everything. Now, the game does suffer from poor framerates for the average computer and tanks my FPS with AA applied. Being that this is Update 10 it's to be expected. Now, this game brings some serious game changers to the FPS scene. You have variable environments mid level, meaning that you have daylight, rain, red alerts, or pitch black and likely more to come. Then you have actual movement mechanics, aiming mechanics, and cover system. This game has a large potential to blow up in popularity in later stages of development and I wholeheartedly look forward to whats to come. Recommended.			"

								If you enjoy a game you can play for HOURS on end, a game where there are ""wholly♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments and jump scares with the enemy around a corner or in the shadows; this game is that. Interstellar Marines is a game that places you in the front lines as an interstellar marine, combat trained and ready to go into many training zones filled with extreamely lifelike sounds and weather simulations that make you feel as if you are really there. Although, this game is in Pre-Alpha it is a great game, with emersable graphics and sounds, smooth gameplay if you know how to custumize the settings, and easy to play; if your comp is glitchy there is the visual lag customization in the settings allowing ou to smooth out those irritating laggs and play with visability. BUT! we al know what the betas and alphas offer guys, so be prepared for crazy glitches and wild shizz for there is a lot to make you laugh, yell/rage, and even cry over those sneeky little arachnids in the corners of the dreadful walls. all together i say buy the spearhead package, for this game has a lot to offer and more to contribute, but, in a new perspective with all the games people-THIS. IS. THE. NEXT. BEST. THING. SINCE. Counter Strike!!!			"

								After 2 hours of playing this game, I enjoyed it. It is a first person shooter in which you have to use your environment to your advantage, cooperate and eleminate your ennemies. It's gameplay style is very similar to America's army, if you think about it.You have four options when starting the game:Single playerCo-opMultiplayerPlaygroundThey are all fun, and each add some variety . (In Co-op, you fight bots, literally)Pros:As of right now, there are not many good things; as in there is nothing spectacular.-Environment interactions-Graphics look good (like the helmet visor)-Great maps-You shoot peopleCons:Interstellar marines is currently in early access, so I can forgive it's faults, but here are a couple.-Only 2 weapons (rifle and assault rifle)-Running only works when going straight.-Only quality specs to lower are for the shadows -When incapacitated, there is no way to know if you are being healed or what.-Recoil a bit too highThese are pretty minor and will probably be fixed.Overall, it's an enjoyable game. Unless if you are willing to play something with not much variety, I say wait out. I have high hopes for the finished product and I hope it becomes something spectacular.			"

Early Access Review
								First impressions: I love it.Looks: a lot of post-processing going on, and without it I'd say it would look along the lines of Half-Life 2. Runs smoothly, looks very immersive with its dynamic weather and small touches like the raindrops hitting the helmet. The helmet itself features a HUD and if you lift the helmet up it's a HUDless view. A few graphical bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking at all; things like your gun disappearing into the wall if you stand too close, or snow falling through walls.Gameplay: plays like a tactical Source game, with aim down sights and sprinting. A lot of emphasis on the sound around you, and the environment plays a big part in the gameplay, like when lights dim and you're forced to use your flashlight, while exposing your position in doing so. At the moment there is only one gun to use, so everything is balanced, and the hitboxes are fair.Overall, it's a very fun game with a level of immersion you rarely see in shooters. It almost seems like a finished product, yet it's only in alpha stage. Very interested to see what the devs make of it over the coming months.			"

								Great game! Loving the gameplay and graphics.For gameplay, just check out youtube videos, the developers have done a fantastic job on releasing detail videos explaining/showing -. But bear in mind they are still in developing stages. At first i was very frustrated with their slow updates, but soon after  viewing the updates i've realized the heavily amount of work they put into, in detailing almost every aspect of the actual gameplay (lightening, shades, SOUND EFFECTS, it's just quite a ride. These maps the producers produce, ARE ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISICATED MAP'S I'VE SEEN, in regards to the quality of realism they bring to the game.All i can say is i am crazily looking forward towards the completed version of this game, which they aim to do so by the end of 2014.As a pc fps game player for over 15 years, i'd say they've made a work of art out of pc FPS. (in progress), under the circumstances that they deliver a consistent game content update as from their vision they've shown in their videos (more guns, SHARK AI's!!!, co-op maps).These guys are the REAL deal. Not some high budget company with capital and resources that just produce similar games every year that are alright... just so that they may profit and keep shareholders happy. I gotta say this game is probably my best purchase on Steam.			"

Early Access Review
								Once again, I haeve returned to the realm of Gaben to pick up a game. ""Oh, joy!"" I thought to myself. ""I wonder what glorious new things Steam has to offer!""And here it is.Intertellar Marines is an early access first-person shooter based off games such as System Shcock 2 (a good sign) and Counter Strike (a better sign!). However, this is an early access game. Like, really early. Really really really early. How early, you ask? It's in Beta 0.8.5., I think. So yeah, pretty freaking early. It's mostly just a core idea and concept art right now, but this game has potential. Lots of potential.Most indie games have reletively low-res graphics. Not so with this game, which has graphics that could hold their own against a modern AAA game. There's not many mechanics so far. You can lift up your helmet (to give you slightly better visibility and provide a shield from rain) and use your flashlight and laser, both of which are like great, shining beacons of ""SH00T H3R3!!1!!1!!"" There's also only one gun, an SMG that, quite frankly, sways too much. One would think an accomplished 22nd century space marine could keep an SMG a little steadier, but one would be wrong. Team killing is always enabled, causing some, uh, ""misunderstandings"" (sorry to all my teammates I killed. You look kind of like the enemy). On occasion, a teammate will walk in front of you in a firefight and you'll accidently blow his damn fool head off. I can imagine it now... ""But Sir, he walked into my bullets! It's not my fault!""The weather system is superb. Sometimes it'll rain, sometimes it'll snow, other times it'll be dark as♥♥♥♥♥♥and you won't be able to see, so you will naturally turn on your flashlight and promptly get a welcome committee from your enemie's bullets. The game lets you be as stealthy as you want, escecially in dark areas. Watch out when it gets dark, the ninjas are everywhere...So, all in all, for a hyper-early access game, Interstellar Marines has loads of potential. So guys? Make Interstellar Marines badass. You have my confidence.			"

There are no checkpoints in the game. I played for about half an hour... died.. and went right back to the beggining.. which was a bit annoying. If you die in co-op and don't get revived fast enough, you're stuck in spectator mode for the rest of the level... QUIT.From what I can tell so far there are no grenades of any kind in this game...

								Best gaming experience i've had so far. The depth given by the game is amazing. it perfectly takes your mind from your head and puts it inside the games Helmet and HUD and give you the most fantastic game graphics; lighting and atmosphere (musical and visual).Its really a mind twist from all those games up there, with hints and in-game aim assist all delivered by a guy that liked to sing; had money but no voice; became a rap\pop\rasta\turqish serenades\romanian dancing and got a gig on your games music...To sum it up is hard but here it goes:Stuning Concept of Depth trough the active helmet which adds 1 more level above other games that try to imerse you in.Breath Taking game modes and by that i mean your forever in motion objectives.Day and Night simulation is even more breath taking then the last one, being trown in pitch black darkness, with dim coloured light pulsing from the suit; buildings; laser or gun fire and having to guess if the guy in front of you is your teammate or not,Amazing Graphics delivered with a unreal briliance mixed, with amazing ambient (visual or graphical) powered by brilliant innovating minds that created this 3D Surreal First Person Shooter and so on for some time.Worth the triple price i've paid for the Spearhead Edition.

								The game has a short learning curve, and is very frustrating at first when you you're first learning to see the enemy. But once you get that down, the gameplay is pretty tight. I get frustrated with how vague the mechanics are though; you can be spraying your opponent down in CQC and nobody will land shots, and it's unclear how the gunplay really works. I just kinda go with the flow and things generally work out though. I can't wait to see VoIP implemented, because this game could be very fun to play competetively with a team. It's tight. But god damn, give me a RIFLE would you? The SMG is the only weapon in the game as of 3.28.14, but they plan on adding more. All in all, not my favorite yet, but I'm loving where it's going and it's not going to go into my Steam Graveyard like so many other titles.			"

Which is really saying something for a game where crouching is not currently implemented. Its flawed, unforgiving, and literally can only continue to get better as its foundations are already so solid. This is something every hardcore fps fan needs to have in their collection, and 15 is a ridiculously great price is this game even delivers half of the features that are planned for it. Buy it now!

								This game is difficult in all the best ways. It's definitely far from finished, but even in its current state its more challenging and addictive than any fps that I've played in recent memory. Which is really saying something for a game where crouching is not currently implemented. Its flawed, unforgiving, and literally can only continue to get better as its foundations are already so solid. This is something every hardcore fps fan needs to have in their collection, and 15 is a ridiculously great price is this game even delivers half of the features that are planned for it. Buy it now!

								This game is what tactical shooters were meant to be. If you're tired of the run-and-gun scene, Interstellar Marines will be refreshing. Take your time, check your corners, slow and steady is the name of the game. But the mechanics aren't the only appeal of this game. The environments and weather simulation are the best and most genuine I have ever experienced.			"

The developers are very active and you can constantly see them playing around with the fans which is something i love to see.It may not be complete but if you have a bit of spare money lying around then it's worth a look.Oh and LANDSHARKS! arre coming soon so of that doesn't get you all hot and bothered then i don't know what will.

								This looks like it could be an amazing game. I dont understand how one of the first implementations was not Controller support though? It looks to me like the team has spent a lot of time creating different environment modes that turn on in graphical fashions with rotating arches carrying lights which seems besides the point to me. It is cool but I don't understand how it in anyway revolutionary. I read reviews saying that even at an early stage this is a completely playable game but i disagree, At the moment it is just running around empty maps. There are about 9 servers all of which are completely full whenever I try to join. The rest ofthe levels are just empty ""Playgrounds"". The sandbox mode is interesting and displays the damage system well but in the back ground there is a wierd repeating track of someone with such a thick accent coimplaining about something that the only word you can pick out is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ each time it repeats.I am very much looking forward to playing this game when it is playable. But at the moment I don't understand it. It is early release because you want to recieve feedback but at the moment the only feedback i have is add Controller support. Beyond that I have noting to provide feedback about!			"

								First of all what you need to know is that as of right now when im writing this review (22-1-2015) the game is still in the Pre Alpha Stage of development and that it is developed by an Indie Studio. So it is far from being completed (But that is also why this game is in Early Access) However the developers are very dedicated, friendly and active on the forums and ingame, so there is already a very strong, very friendly but kinda small community in the game.The overall feel they are trying to make the game have is inspired by the games:Half Life, System Shock 2 and the Rainbow Six series. (they are aiming for a tactical and immersive shooter)If I should describe the game I guess the closest I can come to it is this:This game is what Aliens Colonial Marines should have been and Insurgency in space.So for an Early Access game, it is amazing and I'm really looking forward to see how this game develops in the future, I really have high hopes for this one :)			"

								Here's the conversation me and my friend had after playing a couple of games of IM:Dansrage: whats the point of this I can just play Insurgency lol Arthur Von Winklehammer: Right dude? Dansrage: let's go play play InsurgencyArthur Von Winklehammer: aha alright  Visually this game is quite impressive, excluding the endlessly copy/paste assets and environments, the lighting is nice, the weapon models are good, the rain on your visor is reminiscent of Metroid Prime, but there's just nothing under the hood.There are three game modes in IM, Campaign, Coop and Multiplayer. In campaign and coop you'll play on the exact same maps, with the exact same bots. There are minor variations of gametype that essentially boil down to ""kill all the guys"" or ""press all the buttons while you kill the guys"". This isn't bad in itself if the gameplay is engaging, but unfortunately it isn't. Bot AI will either run directly into your bullets or stand still and fire at you. The atmosphere with it's excellent sound design and moody lighting is obviously aiming for creepy, but all that ends up happening is that the four players fan out and clobber clueless bots, there's no tension, no real danger besides a bot spawning on you.  The multiplayer is just Insurgency with fewer guns, less varied maps and worse mechanics. It's a bog-standard twitch shooter with the supposed realistic weapon handling counting for nothing when everyone is hip firing in corridors at point blank range. All of the levels look like they're built from a single tileset as if they've been randomly generated. Everything looks the same.It's pretty much impossible to play with your friends, you can't create servers, the only way to host a private game is to set your preference to ""friends only"", and then try to join one of the seemingly random servers that pops up while it's still empty, hoping that it's the gametype and map that you want, and that you won't be instantly spawnkilled by somebody who wants this server for themselves. There's also seemingly no way to change map or gametype once you're in the server. This game uses ""Early Access"" as a blanket excuse for laziness, this game has been in development since May 2005.Think about that for a moment.TEN YEARS! It was originally supposed to release on PC and 7th gen consoles, this current version of the game that you're able to play today was Kickstarted in 2012, and is itself three years old.This is all they have to show for it. This is the game. If you think the core mechanics and gameplay will improve from here you're optimistic, I'll give you that, because three years of work has given us an ""Early Access Alpha"" with off the shelf shooting mechanics and about as much content as a Kinder Surprise. My bet is they're going to tack on more ""campaigns"" which basically amount to offline bot matches with text-to-speech voiceovers.			"

If you are undecided then wait for the next deal. Remember it is only the alpha version. But it pretty good and on the right track.Update:So after a few update its gonna be better.There a so many new things and improvements.New weapon model and sounds. New animations, New crouch feature with peek and peek over cover ability and many more.Already now a great game. And anytime i want to play there a some full servers to join.Thumbs up.			"

So far we have a one multiplayer gamemode and a co-op/singleplayer mode in which you shoot dumb unarmed robots, I've only played the game for 48 mintues and I've done everything there is to do...Since this game was released all they've been saying is ""look whats coming up, look whats coming up"" If I was you I wouldn't put money into this game because the devlopment is too slow and the main idea of the game (Marines vs Land Sharks) is a looooooooooooong time off.

Early Access Review
								Feb 8, 2016I tried this game, really loved the environment.However, as it is PVP bent, it lost at least 50%, if not more, of its potential  market and audience. Sad really that the Developer, and many players, think MMO technology require forced PVP, as though the erroneous assumption of saving money is more important than having money to save...Without buyers of the game, meaning: people who love something about the game so much they'd pay for it and Developers showing respect for that by not forcing them into activities they didn't buy the game for, there is no money to be saved. That is the epicfail of Zeropoint by making the game so PVP based PVE players only see themselves as griefed after paying money. If not for a free weekend one time I probably would have bought this game and been even more ticked off about the situation, of course the Developer probably sees that as a ""winning tactic"" to get more money, the money their object not developing the game nor having a quality product in the gaming industry over the long-term.In most circles if you buy something and then it changes or is changed away from what it posed itself to be, that's called fraud, better known as ""bait and switch,"" and when the Developer hides behind the Early Access legal fiction AFTER taking our money, and uses this to not develop the game according to the market that has shown interest by paying money, if without intention that's incompetence and they don't deserve to succeed. However, as is usually the case, such as with Starforge, it is with intention and that's called Gross Negligence, which in many cases is tantamount to fraud legally.Point being, if the Developer has abandoned or is not making any effort to make the game appeal to the market, thereby securing the funds by profits from sales, funds they need to develop the game further, then whatever money they want is just stealing, irrespective of whether it's Early Access or not. Buyer beware is the axiom they depend on, which, if the company is actually trying to reach and grow their market is a reasonable idea, however, when the company exercises reckless abandon and utter failure to listen to those who've played the game, fails to pay attention to the cries for the game to be more appealing, and, fails to pay attention to how many walk away because the Developer thinks they can hide behind Early Access and ignore the players, then the entire idea of Early Access fails, and is merely a ruse to steal being taken advantage of by Con-Artists. Buyer beware is not an excuse to defraud peolpe of their money.			"

								""For the love of the game"" That covers it, a bold and rigid statement by Zero Point Software.Going through the demo's you can see where this game is going and how much effort and care is taken to ensure a proper bug free experience.Early release and i did not even counter one bug so far, it is just amazing.Then you start up the multi-player even though you are at the moment limited to one gun the experience as is, is really good.In it's current state it can already be seen as a proper game that works well and looks amazing.With recent updates a 2nd gun was added, a Assualt rifle with scope primerly for long range.The SMG has been tuned for medium to short ranges.In short buying this early access game will not disappoint any one with a appetite for FPS/Tactical games.Rating for this game is a defiantly a 10 out of 10!

								I purchased this game back when it had the $40 price tag. The game looked like it had amazing potential, and it had land sharks. LAND SHARKS. I also really loved the passion and love the devs have for this game -  it's almost inappropriate. I wanted to support that passion and see this game made. But here we are, no closer to it being a reality, and while I feel bad for the devs, I feel worse for the player base who are clinging on to the hopes this may ever be finished or a full game. At this point, some honesty from the devs probably is due. Are we hanging on for nothing?			"

								Although the Devs may take their time with game updates.  I'm grateful for the amount of content that has been released within the past few years. This gets me rather  excited for what is to come upon the next few months. Mostly because of the amount of game content that we have now is rather impressive. The game has multiple modes that such as Single player and  Coop campaign missions, Horde style game modes where players must defend off waves of killer robots,  and the standard multiplayer team deathmatch where players must take over control points in order for their team to win. (  think of it like the Conquest mode from the  battlefield games but on a smaller scale.)  And lets not forget that this game has a hunger games-ish gamemode where players are put against each other  in LARGE maps. The main idea is to be the last man( or woman) to  survive the hour long match. The graphics in this game is great to look at.  the lighting and the sound within this game is just drop dead EXCELLENT.  The sounds of gun shots make the feeling of shooting within the game feel meaningful.  the hunting rawrs the robots make when they spot you from a point of view. With so much good to be said about the game. it does come into some faults. One of the coop maps are bit bugged right now. its a bug that disconnects you from the coop map before you even play it. This game requires  a bit of heavy specs to play on if you want to fully take in the experience more smoothly. Overall, for a steam early access game its quite impressive to see how much content has been added and how much more will be added into the future. TLDR: 8.8 out ten.  its a great game but it is a bit of buggy and demands more Mid- high range  PCs to run.			"

								The game is ok, but kinda overpriced. This is an ""early access game"" so it has potential, but as of november 2014 it is not really that fun unless you have a bunch of friends with a copy to play around with. The single player campaign is slightly engaging if you like fighting in the dark, but it gets boring quickly and having no options to save makes you wonder why to even bother playing it.On sale for 10 bucks it is not too bad of a deal. but 19 dollars ? No.This game also has a rabid fan-boi following that likes to harass anyone that does not agree with them and would DARE to write a critical review of their most favorite game in the world.So now I can officially say that the community associated with this game makes it even less enjoyable to play.So in summation:  mediocre game with a community of opinionated♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								I'd recommend this game. The more money these developers get, the better this game becomes. Ok there's a few peroblems I'll point out such as optimization. Yes, the game has frame problems due to it using the Unity engine. Yes, there's not that much on the game (like guns) but as I say, the more meny the better. The atmosphere when it comes to Co-op is excellent, I've also been told they plan on adding Snipers some time in the future.This game has lots of potential, I suggest buying it now so you get it cheap. :)They need to do a special offer where you buy it for £50 along with a few hundred pairs of pants.

Early Access Review
								EDIT: I did a bit of research after writing this and found that the game was actually announced *11* (ELEVEN) years ago.  That's right, this game has been around for over a decade and there still is nothing to show for it.  The most recent update as of May 21st 2016, rather than adding anything meaningful, added a new Main Menu UI and weapon skins, and the option to vote on what map you would like to play when your current round is over.  Two months for weapon skins and a new main menu.  Sorry folks but I don't think that asking for something other than that is very unreasonable at this point.  Please don't drop money on this until the devs have some actual, functionable content ready.I read a preview for the game I want to say around 6-7 years ago in the back of a magazine at the library.  It detailed what the developers wanted to do and how they wanted to do it.  Fast forward 6-7 years and so far we have a slightly above average multiplayer TDM/Domination game put together in Unity.  It's above average because they've obviously spent quite a bit of time and money putting the game together, there are some neat ideas in regard to how guns handle and how you move.  The sound design in particular is very well done, especially noting the differences when you play with your helmet on or off.  I purchased the Spearhead Edition for $45 on their website back in 2010 when I was back in college, back when the game was only playable in your browser and was only a few sets of target practice modes.  If the game had been released shortly after, even 2-3 years later, then it would have been fine.  However, that is simply not the case for Interstellar Marines.The bad parts are, like I mentioned earlier, that this game has been in development hell for what will be coming up on a decade now.  There has been numerous issues, engine changes, failed crowdfunding attempts, ""accidental"" key giveaways that gave people who purchased the game all of the special legacy upgrades that people who paid $40+ five years ago originally had (Spearhead Edition benefits).  They say the concept is to have an ""indie-AAA"" where the production values are AAA while being ""published by the community.""  This is absolutely fine, and it's worked for many other developers and games.  This title, however, has been in development for *years* and the only progress that has been made is adding a relatively uninteresting multiplayer component (You would be *very* lucky to find more than a dozen or so people playing, even on their ""Hell Weeks"") and a few uninspired singleplayer missions that revolve around you shooting robots, collecting a handful of keycards, and racing to the endpoint.  This would be fine, but the amount of content, and how ultimately boring it turns out to be, is just not worth your time.  The environments are nothing more than large empty hallways and open rooms, with a handful of fences and doors.  Nothing stands out, nothing is memorable.  The robot AI consists of them walking in a straight line and trying to hit you, but they're slow, which means you can easily kill them before they get close.  About 4 years ago they released a standalone ""museum"" type level that showcased a variety of enemies and environments, none of which have been seen anywhere else in any other part of the game.  The community essentially being dead is the big kicker at this point.  Whoever is left defending the title at this point seem to have a fixation on making sure that there is nothing negative ever said about it.  If you check Youtube, Steam communities, etc, you'll see quite a few people going on about ""FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME"", which is a phrase the developers came up with in regards to them developing a very generic coop military space shooter.  ZPS has done a phenomenal job of doing the bare minimum of development and making it out to be part of a massive game changing update.  I used to receive weekly emails that amounted to them saying:""UPDATE: Gun model revisions.UPDATE: Tweaked pistol soundsUPDATE: Added laser sigh, have fun ;)""It's kind of odd to say the least, the devs have been somewhat forthcoming and open about the development process, and they do stay in contact with what little people still have faith in them.  But beyond all that as I mentioned before you aren't going to find a lot of people playing the multiplayer, even during peak hours it's practically impossible to find a full match, don't even get started on trying to find one with decent ping.  All else I can really say is: It's your money, it's $10, the game has been in development hell for years and I cannot in good consciousness recommend that you spend your money on this.  At this point, it's not worth the $40, and it's barely worth $10.  If ZPS can somehow pull something major off then props to them, but the game is just vaporware.  I doubt I'll be able to get my money back since I purchased the game 7 years ago and I doubt they still have records that I bought the game in the first place.			"

								After some time playing the game and testing all its current features, Interstellar Marines is a game I cannot recommend at its current state. Its a very clunky, floaty, heavy work in progress. The game doesn't run that great, even with my 780ti. Runs at 60 sometimes, but drops to 30 at random locations for no reason.The sound design is pretty great for the most part but there appears to have a lot of gitches. Such as heavy breathing loop, audio cuts, and reverb in areas/senerios where it shouldn't be. EDIT* Sound problems are still as persistent as ever, seems that extended play will lead to that looping heavy breathing gltich. It also lacks content and reply value. There are plenty of maps to play in, but lack of good enough AI and or gunplay to keep it exciting.AI spot you across the map in dark sections of the map no problem and headshot you. AI run into walls, get caught on each other, glitch through stars. This game at its current state is not worth the buy. It carries nothing worth while or different from any modern first person shooter.Your better off playing Blacklight: Retribution, its essentially the same game just with far more content and its free 2 play (thought pay 2 win.)

								As of now, this is a very simple game, but it's really fun. TL;DR at the bottom.Players have only two guns for different ranges of engagement (I find this is very balanced and works well, but they'll probably add more guns in the future). You have infinite ammo reserves, and your weapons have toggleable flashlights, quick attach suppressors, and laser aiming modules. Weapons are reasonably accurate regardless of aiming down sights.I played Survival mode, and I was really pleased with the emergent gameplay.In Survival, you and your co-op partners are put into a large urban/indoor area with objectives strewn around it. You just have to reach each objective to win. Each objective you reach will change the lighting and/or weather of the area, reducing or increasing visibility indoors or outdoors. Objectives can be reached in any order. Killed players can be revived immediately with the press of a button by a teammate. The main component of the gameplay is a steady flow of hostile combat training robots into the area. There are two kinds of robots: melee robots that sprint (really fast), and robots that use guns. Both types can kill you in 1-2 hits. You will usually die before you can react, so you have to listen for them and make sure you see them first. Robots will immediately see and shoot at anyone standing or emitting a source of light, such as a flashlight or light source in the environment. Good players will shoot out lights and use their flashlight sparingly in this mode. The gamemode encourages very tactical movement. Good players will practice sticking together, covering multiple angles, avoiding shooting at the same enemy, timing reloads properly, and entering new areas and rooms sensibly.The graphics are clean and simple, but are likely to be changed as development continues. There is heavy emphasis on atmosphere and lighting that really lends itself to the game, sometimes things get kinda spooky.The sound design of the game is impressive as it is; most of a player's information on how to proceed through an area will be from sounds far, near, muffled through walls, or in the same room.My only technical complaints about the game are the framerate instability and slightly high latency overall; the game is totally playable for me. The game is also a long time in development, it's a crowd-funded game before crowd-funded games were cool. It would be a great shame if the game was not finished. The core gameplay fundamentals are very solid and would probably be called ""hard but fair"" by a lot of people. It's certainly impressive by modern game's weak standards. The devs cite strong influences for this game: Half-Life, Rainbow Six 3, and System Shock 2. Each one of these influences shows. If the devs stick to their principles, this game can be a nice little pinprick of light in the darkness of recent FPS fare.TL;DR: I recommend trying this game, even in its current state. It's good challenging fun with friends, and despite its simplicity the gameplay does not get old quickly, which is very promising.			"

Early Access Review
								As of now, this is a very simple game, but it's really fun. TL;DR at the bottom.Players have only two guns for different ranges of engagement (I find this is very balanced and works well, but they'll probably add more guns in the future). You have infinite ammo reserves, and your weapons have toggleable flashlights, quick attach suppressors, and laser aiming modules. Weapons are reasonably accurate regardless of aiming down sights.I played Survival mode, and I was really pleased with the emergent gameplay.In Survival, you and your co-op partners are put into a large urban/indoor area with objectives strewn around it. You just have to reach each objective to win. Each objective you reach will change the lighting and/or weather of the area, reducing or increasing visibility indoors or outdoors. Objectives can be reached in any order. Killed players can be revived immediately with the press of a button by a teammate. The main component of the gameplay is a steady flow of hostile combat training robots into the area. There are two kinds of robots: melee robots that sprint (really fast), and robots that use guns. Both types can kill you in 1-2 hits. You will usually die before you can react, so you have to listen for them and make sure you see them first. Robots will immediately see and shoot at anyone standing or emitting a source of light, such as a flashlight or light source in the environment. Good players will shoot out lights and use their flashlight sparingly in this mode. The gamemode encourages very tactical movement. Good players will practice sticking together, covering multiple angles, avoiding shooting at the same enemy, timing reloads properly, and entering new areas and rooms sensibly.The graphics are clean and simple, but are likely to be changed as development continues. There is heavy emphasis on atmosphere and lighting that really lends itself to the game, sometimes things get kinda spooky.The sound design of the game is impressive as it is; most of a player's information on how to proceed through an area will be from sounds far, near, muffled through walls, or in the same room.My only technical complaints about the game are the framerate instability and slightly high latency overall; the game is totally playable for me. The game is also a long time in development, it's a crowd-funded game before crowd-funded games were cool. It would be a great shame if the game was not finished. The core gameplay fundamentals are very solid and would probably be called ""hard but fair"" by a lot of people. It's certainly impressive by modern game's weak standards. The devs cite strong influences for this game: Half-Life, Rainbow Six 3, and System Shock 2. Each one of these influences shows. If the devs stick to their principles, this game can be a nice little pinprick of light in the darkness of recent FPS fare.TL;DR: I recommend trying this game, even in its current state. It's good challenging fun with friends, and despite its simplicity the gameplay does not get old quickly, which is very promising.			"

								EDIT: The game is on life support, and that is if I'm being optimistic. It's a real shame to see what this game could have been go down the drain. Below is my review from when it was still alive, and not a vegetable. The game is still good, and you can play singleplayer stuff, but all of the multiplayer is empty... :(This is the best twenty dollars I ever spent. I cannot wait to see what they plan to add to this!THE GOOD:I really enjoy the fast paced gunfights and the slow, nerve-racking calm before them, as you sneak around killer robots in the Neurogen Incident, or just try to get the jump on another player in the versus modes.The multiplayer shines even with only 2 guns, each balanced for their roles perfectly, in my opinion.I have fun with the games singleplayer/CO-OP missions, even if there is only two, because the layout offers a few ways to go about each objective.To add to all this, the game is very immersive, all these small features that just add to the overall game very well such as: Exhaustion affecting aim, No automatic reloads, the ability to remove your visor when the helmet systems die, and even the way breath and rain can appear on your visor.THE BAD:I do have an issue with fps lag however, from all the dynamic lights and reflections and so forth, but its not impacting enough to detract from my enjoyment of the game.I do wish there was more enemies to fight than just a gun robot, and a crazy melee bot.Overall one of the best games I have played.

								My second reviewI suppose the error in my thinking was that early access games weren't supposed to have problems. I will be the first to say sorry to the developers. This is actually a big sorry guys! You stuck to your promises and the game is shaping very nicely at the moment. I've yet to play any other game where relying on sound play such a big roll. The atmosphere in the game is tens and they never let that feeling of what is around the next corner go. I need to set the record straight and go with a thumbs up!!!!My first reviewRunning up and down stairs with nothing to shoot is not called single player, its called bad game design.			"

								I do recommend this game. It has a lack of content atm, but it is definetily fun to play, espesially with your friends. The main core of the game is the environment change, and by that I don't mean levolution (though it might be added (?), but I mean that the whole map could have the lights turned off, and so will do your suit systems. You will end up being in a dark and without any knowledge of who is who, so you'll be trying to figure it out and to remain hidden both, which is pretty fun. It might not cost this much money yet, but it sure will be while developed. Although it is avaiable for one dollar in a bundle, so grab it and test it by yourself!			"

								This game is awesome. It has great atmosphere, the gameplay is solid and of course the Robots scare me (a lot!). So buy this game. Also there will eventually be sharks with legs sooo have fun!Edit: Due to a lot of bad reviews I wrote this long 'review thing' defending ZPS and IM, read it or not if you are going to bash IM and write bad reviews do more research on the company first, so many people I have seen just seem to copy/paste what other people wrote and just put the games reviews  even further in the hole when this game DOESN'T deserve it, this game deserves better.(Under is the review thing I was talking about.)4.5 years ago I paid money to a group of individuals saying one simple thing. ""We want to make a tactical Sci-Fi shooter"", Looking through the ideas and their history gave one implication throughout. THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT. I understood this simple fact when I jumped aboard. I knew this would be ambitious, that they were trying to take an old genre with a lot of tropes and copy/pasted games and taking old tactical gameplay present in older games (Rainbow six is one that I can think of right now.) and applying it in a game series with 3 games with 4 player coop that impacted the game and to have each path and role be important, engaging, viable, and realistic. ZPS has been through financial difficulty in the past and they kept working to make their dream a reality, then people come along, the game gets some funds and the developers finally have the platform to release it on steam, start gaining higher levels of income for the game, they finally have a bit more income and start releasing updates. Then they release Hell Week, something that just didn't have the player base to really work, the levels looked awesome the infastructure was promising but due to this simple fact they started getting more and more negative reviews then they reach the ""mixed"" reviews section of steam. At this point they started losing funding, thus they had less money to make the game better, thus they had less game to make people happy, thus they had less people to give them resources. Then people start yelling and screaming that ""ZPS stole our money"" and that ""they bought coffee with our money"". I hate seeing entitled people yell and scream at a company I respect for a multitiude of reasons because they don't have enough game and don't understand and don't care to even look at and do research about the company's history, they just assume that ""Im not getting update, game is therefore bad."" I do not mean to devalue people's belief's and I believe people have a right to expect a game, but getting mad for supporting a company with barely any resources, while a company like EA takes Star Wars battlefront and monotenizes the crap out of it and gives less and less value with every release (If you like the game great, the gamplay was solid and the maps were well built, I am talking from an hourly content and payment required for ""everything in the game"") People should be mad at SW Battlefront for not ""giving as much content as SW battlefront 2"" (People are mad about that but SW battlefront still made so much money it doesn't matter.) And a company who are trying to create value get yelled at for being slow when they have next to no resources and next to no manpower. I support ZPS, I always will, I still believe and it saddens me not many people stand by me on this anymore.			"

								This game could be considered great if we were talking about a single-person developer doing this in their free time.  Why? It is a working multiplayer shooter that heavily relies on usage of superior team tactics to win matches - an organised team with voice chat will outmatch a team of ""super skilled pro players"" with each player doing his own thing. That's the good thing.The bad thing is, that nothing ever happens in term of updates. Every three to six months the developer team wakes up from their beauty sleep, decides what to do for the next hour, puts out massive walls of text praising the amazing new feature (even if it is just a single gun), and then goes back to sleep for the next three months. That would actually be okay if we were talking about a ""finished"" product, but this isn't a finished product. The way things stand, I can't see any intention of the developer to ever finish this game and implement any of the features promised originally. If you're okay with that and you want a small-scale, team-based, tactical FPS you can of course still go for it. You can of course have a lot of fun with this game as is. But don't expect the grand plan of the developer to happen within the next ten years...			"

								The gameplay is amazing, and keeps getting better. I really enjoy the stealth aspect of this game aswell. You really need to play with your team if you want to win. The coop is also amazing. Scary bots that suddenly jump in your face everywhere! This certainly is one of the best Sci-Fi Fps games I've ever played.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is awesome. It has great atmosphere, the gameplay is solid and of course the Robots scare me (a lot!). So buy this game. Also there will eventually be sharks with legs sooo have fun!Edit: Due to a lot of bad reviews I wrote this long 'review thing' defending ZPS and IM, read it or not if you are going to bash IM and write bad reviews do more research on the company first, so many people I have seen just seem to copy/paste what other people wrote and just put the games reviews  even further in the hole when this game DOESN'T deserve it, this game deserves better.(Under is the review thing I was talking about.)4.5 years ago I paid money to a group of individuals saying one simple thing. ""We want to make a tactical Sci-Fi shooter"", Looking through the ideas and their history gave one implication throughout. THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT. I understood this simple fact when I jumped aboard. I knew this would be ambitious, that they were trying to take an old genre with a lot of tropes and copy/pasted games and taking old tactical gameplay present in older games (Rainbow six is one that I can think of right now.) and applying it in a game series with 3 games with 4 player coop that impacted the game and to have each path and role be important, engaging, viable, and realistic. ZPS has been through financial difficulty in the past and they kept working to make their dream a reality, then people come along, the game gets some funds and the developers finally have the platform to release it on steam, start gaining higher levels of income for the game, they finally have a bit more income and start releasing updates. Then they release Hell Week, something that just didn't have the player base to really work, the levels looked awesome the infastructure was promising but due to this simple fact they started getting more and more negative reviews then they reach the ""mixed"" reviews section of steam. At this point they started losing funding, thus they had less money to make the game better, thus they had less game to make people happy, thus they had less people to give them resources. Then people start yelling and screaming that ""ZPS stole our money"" and that ""they bought coffee with our money"". I hate seeing entitled people yell and scream at a company I respect for a multitiude of reasons because they don't have enough game and don't understand and don't care to even look at and do research about the company's history, they just assume that ""Im not getting update, game is therefore bad."" I do not mean to devalue people's belief's and I believe people have a right to expect a game, but getting mad for supporting a company with barely any resources, while a company like EA takes Star Wars battlefront and monotenizes the crap out of it and gives less and less value with every release (If you like the game great, the gamplay was solid and the maps were well built, I am talking from an hourly content and payment required for ""everything in the game"") People should be mad at SW Battlefront for not ""giving as much content as SW battlefront 2"" (People are mad about that but SW battlefront still made so much money it doesn't matter.) And a company who are trying to create value get yelled at for being slow when they have next to no resources and next to no manpower. I support ZPS, I always will, I still believe and it saddens me not many people stand by me on this anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								When looking to buy this game, you should take note of the fact that it is in Early Access. This means that the playable content is very limited. However, there are 2 large co-op missions, 5 smaller co-op missions, 8 player versus player maps (I think), 2 weapons (customization is going to be added in later on for weaponry), five movement speeds (crouching, walking, crouch-running, jogging, sprinting)... it is already incredibly advanced for a game in Early Access, and the developers play the game as well, to communicate with the community and see what they want, and have excellent presence on the forums.There are some glitches in the game. Naturally; it's Early Access. However, there are so few compared to most Early Access games, or even FPS games in general, that it's almost mind-boggling. Each update is extensively tested and prepared before it becomes available to a small segment of the community - Spearhead testers - and are then further scanned for glitches and bugs before being made available to the entire community.Many people had a bad experience during the Free Week, and gave this game bad reviews. Unfortunately, this is mostly because of people playing it on the Free Week only to annoy other players, and the limited customization available at this point. However, what many people don't seem to understand is that it is in Early Access, even though it entered Free Week; it's nowhere near complete, and rating it as if it were the full game is unfair to the developers and potential buyers.Now on to gameplay.When I first began playing the game, I went into multiplayer. DO NOT DO THIS. The game is so extraordinarily fast-paced that unless you play co-op and single player first, the people in PvP will be killing you so fast you'll suspect they're hacking - quick hint, they're not; they've generally played the game for literally days straight, and have become fifty times as good as any beginner. Don't think you can compete just because you've played other FPS games.The robots in single player and co-op are still a tremendous challenge. Start off Easy and find that, without other people to revive you, you're dead in minutes. Two to five shots will kill you in Easy, and it only gets harder.One thing I've found is that many people complain that Realistic isn't any harder than the other modes. Here's the thing: It is, but not for the reasons most people think. Yes, the robots one-shot you on Realistic. Yes, they have a shorter delay to begin attacking once they see you. Yes, they see you better in good lighting and notice you more quickly in bad lighting. However, the real thing that got me was that the closer you are, the faster they react; open a door and there's a robot immediately on the other side? You're dead.In spite of this game being in Early Access, the amount of content already implemented is amazing, and the gameplay and realism of the game is incredible. So there are a few glitches and fewer weapons than you'd want in an FPS game. So what? It's still remarkably complete for something in this stage.I would definitely recommend buying this game, and if you don't feel like it's right for you, check back in a month or two; the content increases with updates constantly. The results might surprise you.			"

Early Access Review
								[Review as of Update 17]What's good:It's a fun coop experience, it feels really unique and it requires you to think before you act whenever possible. It seems pretty realistic too (as far as that's doable in a SciFi setting), but without being annoying about it. It's great to wander around in pitch-black darkness and the adrenaline rush when something pops up right next to or behind you is something you don't find in many games these days. I didn't try much ""PvP"" yet, but it also seems fun I guess... it really feels like the game is focused on coop though, but I don't mind that. It's better to focus on polishing one thing first rather than trying to do everything at once and ending up with mediocre results.What's bad:There's some bugs and the engine could offer better performance (as in, graphics look decent, but not good enough to warrant the fps drops that happen sometimes), and it definitely feels like there should be more content... but hey, it's still early access, and it's probably the most polished early access game I've come across in a long time. Also, the devs try to keep the community up to speed on their plans and what's planned next. They also seem to talk to people on the forums, so that really seems promising. It's sad when a game has an interesting concept but the devs make you feel like they don't care anymore and abandoned the project without notice - this is not the case for Interstellar Marines, in my opinion. I really appreciate that.There isn't much left to say. It probably won't become my competitive game of choice, but after Warframe, Payday 2 and Insurgency, this is something new to waste my time on with friends, and I'm really looking forward to the new content even though I still have to try more of what's already there.

								Game Score: 6/10 - 7/10Interstellar Marines is an excellent game (even though it is in pre-alpha) and looks like it will progress in a direction that is even better. As of this point, the game is drawing closer to a full release and the dedicated developers at Zero Point continue to deliver new content to the game. Visuals and Effects: The visuals on this game (especially for an indie company) are second to none. The particle effects on the rain on your helmet in game is almost realiztic on the highest graphics setting. The scenery (especially in the outside environments) is extremely detailed and well layed out, immersing you in the environment. One shining point of this game is the changing environment, one moment, it could be thundering and pouring. The next, it will be bright and peaceful (with the exception of the sounds of fighting). The lighting is well done and constantly changes. The visual effects of the guns firing is averageSound: Average sound effects, at this point, there are only a few death 'screams' that the Marines will emit upon dying. Gameplay: At this point in development, the game only supports a multiplayer platform. However, the dynamic environment adds so much content to the multiplayer. For example, you could be fighting in a well-let hallway then alarms will start blaring in your ears and the hallway will go dark. Forcing you to choose to use your flashlight or not, which would expose your location. There is a certain level of strategy you must employ when fighting in the ever-changing environment. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves a good and original FPS. The gameplay and visuals (especially the environment) are extremely satisfying and will continue to be improved upon by the developers at Zero Point Software.			"

								Interstellar Marines is by far the most fun I have ever had in any game. Fight robots with your friends or go lone wolf. As of now there are few maps and guns, but despite that I find myself replaying the same map over and over again. This game allows you to use the environment and lighting to your advantage, and with the suppressors the game can be attempted from a stealth perspective. It is sad where the community and development is right now but that doesn't take away the fun that you can still have with friends. FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME!			"

								This game is really good, even in early access; It's better than a lot of games already out there(I'm looking at you, CoD Goats.) Although there isn't much to it yet, there's only one gun, and a few maps, not a lot of players either, but the server I played on had some really cool people. If you're into this sort of game, get it now, but if you're a filfy casual, I'd wait for more content to be realeased first.What is amazing though are the maps, there's different ""map modes"", where the map will change after a while, like rain, fog, night time, day time and a few other things. and when it's dark, oh christ is it dark. I can't wait to see what comes in the future.			"

								A very dedicated team that's heavily involved with the community. They have been posting updates regularly and keeping us informed. They've made relatively slow progress in the past, but are surely coming through. The game is very basic at its current form [2013], but they've shown plenty of potential; it's still very enjoyable at its current stage. So far, I have not encountered really any game-breaking bugs, at all. They aren't asking you much out of your wallet at all to get this game, but do not get it if you do not have the patience to watch it slowly be developed into something great.

The game is not perfect. Needless to say for those who really gave something about this game they would state that this game is not bad. The A.I (though still in beta) has been better than what I see on other games. Shining a light at them actually alerts them instead of them just sitting there. The game has two interesting co-op missions that lay out what they plan on making in the long run. But saddly due to devolpment hell it's been stalled for them. The fact though that an update is finally coming out though shows that the guys that are still there are trying to not lett this dream die. Now am I going to say BUY IT... no, I can understand hesitation and such. But the game has made strides since I last played and better ones at that too. Again, I'm not going to be every CoD kid and praise the game as if it isn't flawed. But I will not deny that they still want this dream to happen. Hell, it's friday and I've saw more people then what there was a while ago.In the end I feel that this game has yet another Milestone to enter before getting back on it's feet.

								Keep in mind one thing before buying this game: This game is in Alpha. Ergo, it's not a finished product.Time of writing this review: 30/03/2014 03:10 AM (+0:00 GMT)I've been meaning to do this review for a while but now I felt I should do it now. Too save you from reading a giant essay on why I love this game. I love everything about it. The community is one of the nicest ones I've encountered, sure, there's teamkillers, but the community notifies one another about a teamkiller if he's ingame with them. The staff team (I've only encountered one and from my experience and the experiences from a few others) are extremely friendly and nice.This game ran on my PC which has a 3.7 GHz Quad Core AMD A10-6700 and 620 GT surprisingly well. Sure, I got 17-20 FPS, but I have to take in account that the game is in alpha, and more optimizations are to be made before the release of the finished product or the release of the beta. The gameplay itself is quite fun, a little slow paced but nothing too slow. You will encounter different dynamic enviroment changes and enviroments. There is rain which can affect your visibility by wettening the visor on your helmet. There's night time which makes you choose between sight and stealth and a few others. The game has a cover system as of Update 10 which is actually better than most game's cover systems in my unprofessional opinion. The gun's recoil is a bit.. much and can be a little frustrating when using the sight to aim down but you really have to fire in burst shots to get the most.This game is quite bug free and glitch free, in my entire month of owning the game, I've only encountered one bug. Which was a wall not being solid and letting the player walk through, could be abused if the wrong people find the bug. (Told the staff member I encountered about it)Tactics isn't really teambased as there's a lack of teamchat unless you're using Steam Chat and that's really it.A little side note: You will be seeing a load of players again and again. It's fun seeing players again and knowing how good they are.			"

								2 years in Early Access and there's still nothing. Do not get this game.It has potentials but I don't think the dev really wants to develop them. Instead they charge you to play beta for 2 years for them.You can barely find anyone on the servers anymore.So, unless you really want to finance the dev, do not even think about getting this game.

								In my opinion this game can only get better and i hope it reaches it's full potential. It has an interesting play style and breathtaking visuals and is definitely a game i will be looking at with great interest until its release. Ofcourse there is always room for growth but this is something Zero Point Software manage well with each update. Felt very much like the film Alien, just without the aliens, mainly due to the atmosphere of the game overall.For my full first impressions review of this game go to:http://godbomb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/interstellar-marines-first-impressions.htmlI will provide my full review when the game is released (TBA).

								It's a tactical shooter like no other. The only problem is that the developers have focused on multiplayer while ignoring the single player portion. Luckily, before they've done so they have created a few GREAT, amazing atmospheric levels which will get you pumped and scared at the same time.There is not much content, but what is there is amazing.

								This game has great tactical fps gameplay. Clever usage of the silencers and the flashlight is a must. Though in early access, the game still feels pretty complete, packing in some replayable single player missions, co-op, and a unique multiplayer experience. The environments are well done, and change often, forcing you to adapt in order to survive. The Colony map even changes shape in between and during rounds, Maze Runner style. More awesomness is sure to come with future updates. If you like tactical fps games, I highly recommend this one.P.S. The game can be quite challenging in pvp or on higher difficulties. Be prepared for a licking until you get the hang of things. "

								This game has the potential to be one of the best, most memorable sci-fi simulators. Unlike most early access games, this is one perhaps truly deserving of attention and in desperate need of funds. IM is one of only a handful of other early access games that I can think of truly in development, and it shows. It has a few place holder items at the moment, that in due time will be replaced. And, unlike almost any other early access title, IM is funded only by your own, and my own patronage - and perhaps the only one not funded by a kickstarter. This game doesn't happen without purchased copies or, if you have an account on the IM website, through small $5 donations. If you don't have an account, but still want to support this game, perhaps without purchasing or lacking enough funds to purchase a copy, go to the Interstellar Marines website, create an account, and make donations here and there. Every little bit helps.			"

Sure, the advertised landsharks are still to make the appearance after all this time :( . But I have had fun playing the couple of co-op maps and the amazingly atmospheric pvp swamp map. Hell week gamemode was a pure frustration for me though and eventually made me uninstall this game.So recommended but barely.			"

								*** WARNING: This review was written while Interstellar Marines was still in Pre-Alpha status, on November 27th, 2013! ***First things first: If you decide to support Interstellar Marines, make sure you understood what it means that it is an Early Access Title! You are NOT buying a complete game! You are supporting the developers to make their vision come true! Read the store page from top to bottom first.What you get so far when buying the Early Access version:- A single multiplayer mode, ""Domination"", with multiple servers for several regions available. 5vs5 and 8vs8 is available so far.- ""Playgrounds"": You can walk around the included multiplayer maps in Singleplayer. There is no goal, you are basically freeroaming the maps so you can learn their layouts without any stress.- Some tech maps for demonstration.- A single weapon with unlimited ammo (30 rounds/clip, with toggleable Flashlight, Laserpointer and Red Dot).- Almost completely bug and lag free game, but not much content.What's NOT available so far:- Singleplayer campaign/missions/shooting galleries.- Coop campaign/missions.- Melee.- Grenades.- Jumping (coming in a few days as I write this!).- Crouching.- A working HUD (only thing you see at the bottom are the remaining bullets in your clip, nothing else)Ok, now that we cleared that and if you're still interested to hear about Interstellar Marines, let me put it this way:Interstellar Marines does not try to be a carbon copy of any large sale franchises which currently exist, like Battlefield or Call of Duty. The developers of Interstellar Marines, Zero Point Software (or ZPS, for short), are some die hard gamers themselves, probably remembering the ""good old times"" of FPS, which are definitely over today.Playing the multiplayer part of the Early Access version feels very different to those AAA big budget titles released today. One thing which is a very positive thing and a very important one for me personally, is the netcode. I adjusted the network smoothing slider in game all the way to the left, and Interstellar Marines is basically lag free. Something you usually don't find in AAA titles today. If you own Battlefield 4 for example, you know what I'm talking about. Of course Interstellar Marines has the occasional hick up here and there, but that's probably due to the connection of the other players. At least for me, if I experienced lag, it was coming from the same players usually.My own internet connection is pretty slow, but stable. I have a DSL3500 connection with an average ping of 50ms. And like I said, lag free in this game. I usually play on the ""All maps (EU)"" server.To describe the smoothness of the network code, the last titles I remember to be that smooth were Unreal Tournament (the original one from 1999!), Quake 3 or Counterstrike (not Source, I mean the old one). So if you're an old school gamer like myself and remember at least one of the titles, you know what you're up to. If you have a good aim, you'll hit your enemy. Easy as that.The overall graphics so far are not top of the line of course, but the lighting effects definitely are. The dynamic lighting in the multiplayer maps (remember: all environments are deeply underground in a training facility, with artificial weather, lighting etc.) is creating a tension at night it's mind blowing. I love this! To orientate, you can switch on your flashlight for a short time, but don't use it constantly because it's basically a ""shoot here"" indicator for your enemies.The performance is great for me, but I got a beefy graphics card. I have all ingame settings maximized, and I get 100+ fps at all times. I'm using a five years old rig with a modern graphics card:Intel Core i7 920 @ 3,6GHz6GB DDR3-1600nVidia GTX770Considering the overall pace of the gameplay, it's quite fast so far. I know ZPS are aiming for a more tactical gameplay like in the very good ""Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield"" (never played this game? Go get it!), but it is significantly faster than this right now, but it certainly will change as the game progresses. Playing Interstellar Marines in this current version feels a little similar to Counter Strike Source to me, minus the flashbang, grenade and AWP madness. But don't be fooled, Interstellar Marines has another feature which is, at least in my opinion, outstanding:The sound (engine)!Interstellar Marines allows me to pinpoint the exact location of an enemy if he's giving away his position by making some noise, either by shooting, sprinting or falling off e ledge and landing on the ground. I have a good old 5.1 sound system connected to my dedicated sound card (Creative X-Fi Titanium), and it's been a long time I've been able to tell the exact direction of where a sound came from in a computer game. Doom 3 comes to my mind. So if you're sprinting around too much, people will know exactly where you are and can react accordingly. I love it, love it, love it!One other thing: So far the community does not go into the 100.000s, so don't expect to see a dozen full servers online. We are not there yet, but lately there was usually activity at any time on the EU server.Read a little more about the game and learn where ZPS wants to go with Interstellar Marines, ask questions about it here in the steam forums and decide if this is for you.If you are fed up by annual releases of big franchises with little to no innvations, tons of bugs, lags and bland gameplay, Interstellar Marines could be for you. It will grow and become even better, and so far I'm already having heaps of fun with it in it's very early stage.If you expect explosions every few seconds, choppy controls, a short campaign with little gameplay, boring script events and an absurd storyline for three times the price, there are better titles out there for you.I prefer to support Interstellar Marines though. Without a big publisher, ZPS can concentrate to create the game with a different aim: To make it the game they want, to maximize the fun. Publishers are forcing their developers to maximize only one thing: Revenue, no matter the cost (lack of fun).Support Zero Point Software! Support Interstellar Marines! For the love of the game!			"

								Such an awesome game! Seriously! Give it a try. I have been following this game since it was on the internet as a unity engine web game. Even than it had amazing graphics and sound! This game has a horror side to it as well as a pure combat side. I would rate it 9/10 easy. The co-op is fun, the AI is extremely smart, the weapons feel good, and the graphics.. well the graphics are AAA quality... They are phenominal. ..... on a side note this game gets extremely scary when you're alone in a building and you can hear the robots stomping extremely hard on the floor above you with you knowing full well that they are hunting you. And oh why do the robots hiss? Its terrifying, especially when they are melee ones and they sprint at you.			"

								♥♥♥♥.----------------------PROS-----------------------Gunplay. Weapon handling is fantastic. Feels very nice. All the guns feel as they should, though they are few in number. Hit markers point out exactly where you hit on the enemy (more on this in the hud section.) Realistic-ish wounds make them feel as powerful as they should be. Fast paced, react or die mechanics are very enticing.-Hud. The hud is everything you want it to be: good checkpoint markers, fantastic hitmarkers, good scoring module, and fitting colors. It feels very immersive as it gets taken away the second you take off your helmet.-Atmosphere. It's not perfect, but it is certainly a plus. Massive lack of light forces you to rely on your flashlight, surroundings, and mopre importantly, your foes' flashlights. Fantastic scenery immerses you in dark dead space stations and militeristic complexes.-Character design. You are the fist of humanity, crushing aliens, robots, and even other humans that stand in your way. Think of beefed up SWAT in space.-Immersion. Like I said before, this game is very immersive. All your gear is cleverly made to hide the fact that it's a game. The HUD is entirely linked to your futuristic helmet, guns are attached to you via magnetic holsters on your legs and backpack, even the map will be implemented on a wrist-mounted pda. The radio is also pretty darn realistic sounding too.-Promise. The game itself has a bright future, IF it is finished. Mor on this in cons, friends.----------------------CONS-----------------------Development. It's slow. Crawling speed slow. There is only one active dev, though he's incredibly dedicated. Updates take months to come out, and the game itself is struggling to get the needed funding. I pray it's finished.-Content. Yes, it is an early access, but the game is lacking replay value. Two coop missions, some survival, and PVP matches. I really can't wait to see those landsharks in action. Yes sharks with legs, look it up. They cool as flip.-Players. They are nice, but they are few. Very few players make matchmaking a nightmare. Speaking of which...-Servers. There is no hosting a server. Just a warning, as playing with randos will happen. If you're lucky, that is.----------------------TLDR----------------------Fantastic concept and a beautifull future if it gets there. PLEASE just help it get there, friends. Zero Point NEEDS you to help.FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS in which two teams of marines are pitted against each other in an underground simulated environment.  Some very unique features of this game include the almost immediate death and the weather mechanics.  This is a game in which the old run n' gun technique will almost always get you killed.  Often the best strategy involves using a suppressor and sneaking around until you can ambush your enemies.Some subjective and personal positive aspects to the game I have noticed are:Losing your HUD once you take a certain amount of damage.  In this game's multiplayer it is nearly impossible to tell friendly soldiers from your enemies without the use of your HUD.  The feature which temporarily removes use of your HUD makes being wounded even more frantic because when you turn to run you need to look twice to make sure the marine behind you is friendly.A feature which closely accompanies the loss of your HUD is the ability to open your helmet.  By pressing ""H"" you are able to completely disengage your display and open your helmet.  This comes in handy when it is raining because the rain will obstruct your vision by sticking to your visor.Operable doors.Most FPS these days have decided to remove the idea of operable doors in their multiplayer modes.  I beleive that it is a strong suite for this game they have not decided to do that as well.  When opening a door on a map such as Dynacore you can't tell if some one is hiding on the other side.  Doors are also very useful as cover from enemy fire.  It also adds a degree of realism and dynamic gameplay.Weather/Day night system.This game has fully dynamic shadows and a weather system which has been expertly fleshed out.  You have different weather conditions from rain to snow to high winds.  The rain will greatly obstruct your vision while your helmet is down. The snow reduces visibility in general and plays tricks with your mind because of the movement. The winds add slightly more chaos to the area however are likely the least influential of the three.The day and night rotations are incredibly important in any game of Interstellar Marines.  In the day time you have only a very small chance of successfully hiding.  In the dusk and at night you will have a much easier time at remaining concealed.  You will also learn that the use of a flashlight is unadvisable to say the least.  The dynamic changes in weather and time force players to change their strategies whenever the map decides that it got bored.Lastly, the dynamic motions of elements in the maps.Many of the multiplayer maps have different structures of elements within the maps themselves which will periodically move.  This will force players to change their routes and hiding spots as hallways are cut off and buildings rise into the air and sink into the ground.Now for what I dislike about the game in its current state.  Please be advised everything listed below is subject to change.  Alpha = AlphaThe game has very few weapons at the moment.I am personally very happy learning to use two different weapons proficiantly.  But for those of us who want more variation you may have a hard time excepting the lack of variety in your choice of weapons.  On top of this there is only a few small differences in the way the two current weapons handle.  The Rifle has more accuracy over the SMG but it quickly loses that with sustained fire.  The SMG has an additional 10 rounds over the Rifle bringing it to a total of 30.  It also has iron sights with a much lower magnification that allows it to be used in close quarters combat, as opposed to the 4x scope on the Rifle.  However besides these small differences the guns are essentially identical.Movement system.Although perfect in almost all situations, the movement system has its flaws.  The devs have nerfed sprinting and jumping by forcing you to start panting after a certain amount of either running or hopping about.  My concerns with this mechanic in its current state are as follows; Jumping rarely allows you to overcome an obstacle the first try.  After your second or third attempt you begin panting for as long as 20 seconds afterwards.  In multiplayer it can also get tiresome when you are trying to catch up with your team on the map Evacuation and you start to pant, then you encounter and enemy and your crosshair is bouncing all over the screen.Early Access.The game is currently in development.  Listen to me when I say that this game is in EARLY ACCESS.  That means when you buy it you are admitting that this is the product you want in its CURRENT STATE.  Although I think this game deserves all the support it needs to have a successful launch, you must understand that there is no guarantee it will ever be released, and there is no guarentee there will ever be another update.  If you decide to spend your money on this game, I would say its worth every cent.  But at the same time you must make certain you want this game and not the Interstellar Marines that you are thinking about 5 years down the line.Please remember this is a preliminary review of an early access game which is subject to change.  Before perchasing you should look at other reviews and perhaps some video coverage of it online.Thank you,AviatorFox			"

Early Access Review
								Think Aliens, crossed with Arma.Now I know it's been in development for a long time, but it has been developing - albiet not as fast as some users according to several reviews on here.. But that has to be the only negative for the game though. The gun play is excellent, even with only a few weapons in the game, they're well done and work well in their respective uses. The lore of the game so far is that you're in a training facility under the Nevada desert, so there doesn't yet need to be many kinds of rifle or whatever else. The use of either Pistol, AR or SMG is enough for the current lore of the game.And that HUD! I've yet to see a better implemented HUD; properly a part of your helmet's visor - with the option of raising the visor on your helmet to maybe see better in the rain or fog, at the cost of losing your HUD altogether. Such immersion, I haven't seen this done so well before. PVP is great too, in my hours of playing; tactics and positioning are everything.Teamplay and moving from position to position, hugging the walls, keeping in the shadows makes the difference between winning or losing. Sprinting about trying to run and gun will only get you so far, usually not very far at all! The multiplayer maps range from cramped storage facilities with ledges and corridors (reminds me of laser quest as a child) to large assault maps with water, fog, thick undergrowth and hiding places galore.. The simulated sunny/rainy/day/sunset/night cycling of the 'training environment' that the matches are held in constantly changes adding new elements to your fight as you play. So I do recommend; no it might not fill several hundreds of hours just yet (though some have got thousands of hours on their profiles) all the same for the small price tag and the huge potential, it has to be a win. It's less than the price of a couple of pints these days. How can you possibly go wrong. The only sad part of it is that it's been so long and so stuck in development that the population who play regularly is thin on the ground. But with more support this game could, hopefully, be a really good co-op alien killer. Stay frosty people.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is the reason why I don't like the Idea of early access.  The whole point of Early access is so that you can support the game you want while its in development.  When in development the goal is usually to make a rough wireframe of the game.  As everyone knows, you can't edit and refine what doesn't exist. However, this team doesn't know this.  They have forgotten what their goals were for this game.  They have been making small updates forside content which is (usually) suppose to be second to the main content.  They seem to want to appease players with small updates so that they can forever have a stream of money, with no effort involved.  This game will most likely not ever be completed, and having bought the game I am severely dissappointed in them.  What they have made so far has nothing to do with anything they had promised me when I purchased.  Years will pass by and almost no progress will be made.  It will most likely be dropped into the abyss called canceled project, if they haven't quit already.In a few years this game will be forgotten, and nobody will miss it.			"

								This game has a great potential, i like to think that this game will become a great and known franchise in the future. But no i dont recommend it in the current state, not because of the gameplay or bug, simply because it's in early access. That means if you want to help the dev make this dream become real well go ahead buy it, but has a friend i can't tell you: hey buy that game it will be ♥♥♥♥ing awsome later and have a lot of content. No, this game is a dream, it will take time, and until the game has the content it promise i wont tell someone to put 10$, i know its not that much, for something we have no garantie of the delivery.I have enjoy the game and my review will propably change for a :Yes I recommendbut not until there isn't a real mission with landshark xD			"

								The road to [development] hell is paved with good intentions. I've seen my fair share of early access cash grabs, and this game had some of the most exciting and enticing broken promises of them all. To me it doesn't really matter whether the devs meant to disappoint us, they promised a game and we gave them money for it, and now the project is out of funds and dead in the water. Color me an optimist for not getting a refund, but I would not recommend this purchase for anyone but the extremely bored, or those who feel like they just have too much money lying around.			"

								Reviewed after update 23Gameplay: 300+ hoursCool game mechanics:-Realistic gun recoil -Exhausted?  You will find it harder to aim, your heavy breathing will make it harder to hear also.-Hearing is just as important as seeing.-Minimal hud but still full of tons of information, however it deactivates when your suit is damaged.-That light giving away your position in the dark?  Try shooting it out-React to conditions and accept consequences dynamically.  Silent enviroment? Players/bots will hear you running.  Dark Enviroment?  Players/bots will see your flashlight.  Solo/Coop:-Solid AI, very well done.  Have fun tricking robots into looking behind boxes that they thought you ran behind.  Have fun getting mad when they see your muzzle flash/flashlight from across the map (just like you can).  They have similar restrictions as the player including health.  A fun challange to play on realistic.  -Good assistance and teamwork mechanics.  Its easy to feel hindered when you have a bad team, in fact it is usually easier to play alone than with a bad team.  However with a good team you can cut through maps like melted butter.  Things like needing a teammate to watch your back or cover you while you reload actually can be quite benificial.-Level design and attention to detail.  Some of the best installation designs I've seen in a game.  Can be a bit overwhelming at first, just like if you walked into a real military research base or commercial space station.-Only a few weapons but they are well done and feel right.  Feels like a soldier getting a standard loadout.Multiplayer:-A dynamic training enviroment where the enviroment can wildly change from brightly lit to hurricane condtions to pitch black.  Very fun and totally changes the way the match is playing.-Want to run and gun?  That is okay but deal with the exhaustion and inability to aim well.  Want to run around with a laser sight (which acts as a crosshair) then be ready to give away your position.  There is no wrong answer to tactics, just results.tl;dr:This game is fun and enjoyable.  Get to watch a single person take out a whole team using stealth in the dark.  Watch people complain that stealth has no purpose. 11/10 would play again. "

Early Access Review
								As of this writing, on the startup screen this game is identified as ""early access"".   The single player gameplay is kinid of old school with very limited story and repetitive fairly plain levels and graphics. On the upside the game seems to run smoothly and the engine is ver responsive and seems well suited to a twitch and shoot. I should mention that I generally don't do multiplayer, or co-op, so can't comment on those modes.  This review is only about the single player mode.  Something that is kind of surprising is that so far in the first two levels, the only enemies are these dumb robots that seem like they are modeled after the ""droid"" soldiers in Star Wars.  The have a similar metalic voice and the AI is kind of predictable, and a little clutzy and, well, dumb-- just like in Star Wars.  From the title, ""Interstallar Marines"" I was expecting some aliens or maybe a race of militant humanoids like in Kill Zone.  But, no joy-- all lyou get are these dumb robots.As dissppointing as the robots are, a larger weakness is that there currently seems to be no way to save progress.  What this means is that if you are killed on a level you have  to start over from the beginning.  This is especially painful when almost at the end of a level.  After playing the first level  for about a half hour, and almost ""exfiltrating"" the compound, I was killed at the last moment (by a dumb robot who didn't die even after I emptied a full clip in hsi stupid face).  The thought of having to start from the beginning was too unpleasant to contemplate, so I quit and played a different game --one with a way to save progress.So far this game has single player potential,  and I like to support Indie developers.  If you wnat to support development then spend a couple of bucks on this early access, but don't expect too much from the single player mode at this  point-- my guess is that the single player mode is more of an after thought with little focus or effort from the developers.  Hopefully there will be an improved single player update soon.			"

You can't see anything unless you turn on your light but that will only let your enemies know where you are!			"

The developers don't have a big enough team right now or the funding to get one. It's really unfortunate because I paid $40 for spearhead to support them, and it's unfinished.I'm going to change this review hopefully in the near future. if it leaves early access without some serious updates, then the review remains unchanged.

Early Access Review
								Sharks. With. Legs.(Early Access Review 26/07/2015 Update 20 Unity 5)Interstellar Marines is rich in story, development story firstly.This is a game that was originally created in the Unreal Engine at the wrong side of the economic crash.The outcome? A bankrupt studio and no way of affording the price of the then current Unreal pricing model.So what did they do?Give up?Of course not!They just shrugged it off and started in Unity Engine.20 updates later and here we are at the Unity 5 update.So what is this game all about in its current state?What will it be like when it is finished?Will it even be finished?Why does everyone keep talking about sharks?Is the IM community really that awesome?Currently the game is all about the multiplayer, the single player and the co-op and most recently it is all about hellweek.Multiplayer is fun, difficult, tense and frantic.Single player is unnerving, tense and atmospheric.Co-op is fulfilling and to be honest, a worthy challenge.Hellweek is ambitious, sometimes cruel and unique.When finished IM will probably be the best science fiction fps and I would go as far as saying it will probably be the bar that all other sci-fi games are judged on for single player story going forward.Not even bankruptcy can put IM down so it seems safe to say that this game will get finished.Sharks are scary enough at the best times but these abominations have legs. Have you even considered how scary it would be to get chased down in first person by a great white sprinting at you?Some say that the IM community is the best community by far, all I know is that a game is only as good as its community when it comes to games with multiplayer.I've been vague on this review, but just wanted to add more and keep building on it so it's the start.

Early Access Review
								IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only for the Early Access content as of August 2014. My rating is subject to change once more is added.The Review: ISM is very lite on content, to me. It has a couple multiplayer competitive maps, and a early demo for Co-op mode where you and a friend kill robots while trying to reach the roof. 2 guns, no grenades or customization or any other weapons, not even melee. The 2 guns are both Assault Rifles with emphasis on different engagement ranges. I see the potential for an amazing game, but right now it's just too simple. The lighting adds a good layer to the game, as well as the decision to use a laser and give away your position in return for better hip aiming. It seems you can take off your helmet but this currently seems to have no effect other than removing the hud; I assume this will result in your suit powering down (no lights) eventually, but it's not the case currently. In summary: If you are you are interested in their concept, get this on sale maybe. I got it in a Humble Bundle and don't regret it. But if you want a good game to sink hours into, I don't see it happening here, yet. Keep an eye on ISM though, I do expect it to become awesome eventually.			"

								The game certainly has potential, but the same can be said about a lot of titles that have not delivered what was promised.  While graphically pleasing, the game currently lacks what I consider to be any decent gameplay.  Multiplayer death matches are pretty much all you have to look forward to if you buy this game which is *not* worth the money in my opinion.  With these things in mind I will point out the pros and cons of this game as best as I see them. Pros:(The graphics are more than I expected and makes the game look quite believeable.(Weapon performance is surprsingly good, with the sounds and recoil reminding me of actual rifles I have fired.(The heads up display mixed with the toggle modes on the helmet makes me feel like my head is actually in the helmet, which reminds me somewhat of the metro series.  This is a great immersion modifier.(The dynamic weather system the have in the arena is very well done and they demonstrate that they can develope immersive environments within their game.Cons:(While the devs have multiple ""gamemodes"", all of them occur within an enclosed arena which, for me, gets dull really fast.  Again, the lack of gameplay variety just ruins this for me.(Next to no visible progress on this game.  I understand the time it takes to develope such things but their updates  are both irregular and sparse.  I see no indication that this game is going anywhere fast.(Lack of player customization leaves me feeling like a stormtrooper with no identity.  This breaks the immersion greatly in my mind.Overall I'd say that this game has the barebones framework that can be the foundation of something awesome, but sadly I don't believe it will be.  As I said, I see no noteworthy progress on the game and with that fact alone, I don't reccomend buying this game.			"

								ok. I LOVE this game. now, don't let me make you think that it's a good game, it can only appeal to certain people.If you're a person like me, who loves immersion (mostly the fact that your helmet is ACTUALLY right there in front of you) mixed with action (shooting insane robots in the face) with a touch of survival horror (being afraid, because damage is realistic), then you'll love this game. HOWEVER, if you like cod's gameplay over what I listed, then you probably won't like this.Now, watch some trailers, gameplay, look at some images, do whatever you have to do, but in my opinion, this game is amazing.Now, I do not play this game a lot, I actually played it twice so far, and I don't usually play the robo missions, I play multiplayer versus. The robots are too damn spooky. Some people love the robots, and I do too, just I can't find what reason I like playing multiplayer versus more than robo missionsI guess it's because I don't like having to restart, but even then, I also don't like waiting to respawn (cuz revenge).the gameplay? awesomethe mechanics? awesomethe bugs? only a few, and sometimes it said ""press space to spawn"" presses space, jack♥♥♥♥♥♥happenskeep in mind, this review is posted while it is still in early access, however, there aren't really any gamebreaking bugsfinding a server? this is the one that I had semi- trouble with, because there was at least 100 servers, and there were literally 4 servers with pleople in it.

								Interstellar Marines is a very good first person shooter game. I am tempted to say it is one of the best I have played, but I have played many FPS games and so it would be  kinda hard to say it was one of the best. For an early access game though, it is amazing. The developers really seem to pay attention to every little detail to make the game immersive, tactical, and most of all playable. I say ""playable"" because some early access games may have alot of bugs/glitches, but Zero Point has done a great job of getting down to business and making the game very fun. I am looking forward to the future updates, and eventually the final release. this game is definately worth getting!			"

								From what I played, this game is goregeous. It doesn't really rely on online multiplayer team vs. team combat like most FPS nowadays. You can play singleplayer missions, co-op with a few friends, and if you really want to, you can play multiplayer. Visually, it's stunning. The effects on the visor are new to sci-fi shooters and really haven't seen that done before. I didn't get my chance to try out multiplayer against other players quite yet, and don't think I'll get the chance for a while. Although this game is fantastic, and is different from the many shooters that it's in the market against, it lacks one thing that might make this better for us, not so rich people that can't afford to buy a gaming pc. A graphics tab. It does have the v-sync, etc. stuff, but I maybe want to lower some of the quality to medium instead of always being on high. For laptop users, like myself, this is a big issue that we have to deal with. I'm not saying my laptop is terrible graphically or anything, but a graphics tab, visual quality slider could be useful to many players. Other than that, this game is fantasic and hell yeah I recommend it to a friend!			"

Thanks developers! If you haven't already, BUY IT! IT'S AWESOME! (i wish i could get it, remember, i got to see the early access, it ain't boring.)			"

 Awesome game The devs managed to combine the feel of a tactical FPS and the atmosphere of a Sci-Fi horror game. Multiplayer and co-op is frustrating yet fun. Has a campaign mission but only has 2 weapons currently. The Problem The ping is unstable and i managed to find a server glitch where the match is only 4 seconds long and then 'no winner is found', and it keeps repeatating. Respawn time is too long and it made lots of people rage quit (should be 60-70 sec instead of 100+). Conclusion Interstellar marines a good tactical FPS game in its own rights, it's spooky and challenging. I highly recommend this game for FPS/Sci-Fi horror fans and for those who seeks challenge and frustration.			"

								I have heard some say""it's not like halo"" or it should have this or that from another game. It's not. most games of that nature are linear.Go the same path every time you play. Intersellar Marines is deffinately not linear. The robots are unpredictable. They maybe here, or there or attack you if they see you.Very creepy.very imersive.it""s early access at the moment and darn good already, more to come. This game is totally different.free to roam anywhere and the enemies will follow or react to your flashlight,or lazer. it's just a great game all around, and as I said it's getting better all the time. The developers are really engaged and hard at work on some of the suggestion from the community which is also great.An experience well worth the small price of the game. i give it 10/10.			"

The maps are so dark :(Its really hard to control the recoil and spotting your enemies as well. Oh and the leaderboard is TINY. Like, really really tiny. So why have I recomended this game then?Well for a start the graphics stunned me. I play on highest and it honestly rocks!

								I like the game, I see that it has the potiential to be a fun game, but it needs some improvements. Like they should add in game currency so you can buy the attachments for your weapon because most of us feel that it gives us a sense of achievement in getting that item. They also should add a secondary weapon which would make it funner as there seems to be only one weapon in the game. Combat felt a bit dull but i think it still was pretty fun. They also should add Co-op like with the sharks/ legs on because that seems to be what the game is for.but i think this is still a great game.9/10Edit:10/06/2014 The game just had the first co-op come out and man I got admit even though they where robots, it was dark and creepy, i hear that thump thump thump whack and i start fireing without aiming. dam its like does have a creepy feel in single player think i going to get a few friends and that may make it a lot more fun and hopefully less creepy.

However, these reviews are not slights on this game. The reason I say this is becasue the level of presicion, how pollished it is before release, the absolute immursion of this game....this isnt achieved without taking your time with it. This is not just another FPS game, its verging on a work of art with how profesional it feels.I want to see that single player campaign too. I want to see the sharks too. I want this game to be finished too....But If I am to expect this game to be as great as it claims to be, then im not going to rush the developers.			"

The maps are very well balanced and having changing environments during the match so it doesn't get boring or feel like the maps are repetative. The gameplay is very raw and has a great feel to it.

								I've played many combat sims and even though this isn't big (I often play with names I recognise) the one thing I find is that I can join ANY game and the whole team are playing as a team, even if they've never played together before. That's something I've not seen in CoD and BF. It's also not difficult to get into, there's no gay level up system, only raw skill and teamwork separates players so it's well balanced, and you can pick up and play shortish games. Fine, I like the odd long campaign but it's not something I always have time to do.People are complaining about weapon selection and so on need to remember that in real life you don't get to choose those things. This game is going for realism, so it would be obvious to provide standard issue weapons. The addition of the supressor is in my opinion the difference between success and failure in coop games. Too much noise will bring the entire robot army to your position in seconds! Better hope you have good buddies...This game is definately coming along nicely. Coop and campaign add to the already enjoyable multiplayer mode, and all modes are best played with stealth and planning. It gets your brain thinking and your heart pumping.Those of you that know me well know I generally don't put a lot of effort into things unless I'm really passionate about, so the length of this review should be a good indication of my my I enjoy this game.

								Review for Interstellar Marines Update #10LINK TO VIDEO REVIEW: 


YouTube™ Video: GAME REVIEW - Interstellar Marines Update #10 

			Views: 7,062		

			Check out the very first review for Interstellar Marines update #10! This update is a small step in the right direction. Please support these developers by checking out the game on Steam.		

Zero Point Software has proven that nothing will stop them from finishing Interstellar Marines. With long list of development setbacks, managing to get Interstellar Marines to this point is a huge accomplishment. For the past month, Zero Point Software has been working extremely hard to release the latest update for their game, update #10. Is it any good? Well, it’s a step in the right direction.Visuals: At first glance, you will notice some major changes to the visuals. The HUD has been completely reworked, the weapon model has been replaced with a new, modern looking assault rifle, and the overall realism of the environments and their effects all blend together to make a very polished feel. I’ve been killed quite a few times while stopping to watch the environment change its weather cycle because it just looked that good. But, as much as I like the new visuals, the option to turn off the bloom effects has been removed, and while this makes the game fairer for those who would keep these effects on and play with the disrupted vision, the bloom glow effects can sometimes feel overused and disrupt the vision to the point of frustration. It would be nice to see ZPS turn down these effects or balance them more to keep the visual impact, but not make any sacrifices on the game-play side. Also, when you are walking, the HUD moves and bobs so much that it’s almost impossible to see who is on your team or what their score is without completing ceasing all movement. I liked to check how my friends are doing in previous updates but now I feel more excluded.Gameplay: There is no doubt that Zero Point has worked very hard on making the experience in Interstellar Marines as smooth and polished as possible, and it really shows here. With the addition of a crouching and basic cover system in update #10, the tactical element has never felt more important. I’ve never had so much fun hopping from cover to cover with my squad mates. And the excellent improvements to the sound design only add to the overall experience. In one instance, I would be moving from cover to cover with my squad mates to reach the building across, zzwhile being sniped by the enemy team from across the map. It’s moments like these which make Interstellar Marines different and memorable than any other shooter. The more ZPS improves the features in the game, the more the game will feel alive. Sometimes, though, the cover system doesn’t always work. The camera’s height adjustments when popping in and out of cover can feel a bit clunky and switching from crouching to standing to quickly escape gun fire feels too difficult to achieve and ends up in a cheap death. This isn’t a game breaker, but since the cover system is a big deal, after a few matches, the errors start to really stand out and impact my overall experience. With the lack of support for any communication with your squad mates personally in game, players are still forced to communicate through and outside source, which isn’t bad, but just a bit tedious. I understand that this is still an early update for the game, and the developers have promised some sort of squad communication system in the future, so I am looking forward to seeing what they will do with this.Summary: Update #10 is a welcome addition to Interstellar Marines. While it has a few flaws, it’s a step in the right direction. It doesn’t do anything to drastically change the core game-play, but the additional features being added each update is really making a huge difference in the game and the fan base. ZPS has done an amazing job with the game so far, and I can’t wait to see where they take this game.

								This game is quite good for something in Alpha stages, I think the hit detection could be improved and hopefully new weapons will be added in the future. The environment changes during gameplay, going from snowy blizzards to pitch black darkness, creating a truly brilliant experience for the user. If you're looking for a cross-platform planned FPS with decent graphics and gameplay, pick this up and support the developers!			"

The head-up display is greatly implemented and underlines the atmosphere wich can only be outdone with the soon coming landsharks.Early access means that there are a lot of more essential features coming like a campaign and more weapons. All in one I have high hopes for Zero Point Software and I'm sure the danes will do great.			"

YouTube™ Video: Interstellar Marines - In Progess 

			Views: 59		

			Hello there person of the internet! New to this channel maybe subscribe! Hello this video is a little different from the normal I add some stuff in.		

Interstellar Marines, what can I say it is a very soild single-player/co-op FPS focusing on realism... well are real as you can get for a sci-fi game. Multiplayer is this game's strong point at this stage of development, and might I add it is very well done I mean this game has dedicated severs to make it even better. The 4 player co-op in this game is all of these 3 things fun, challenging, and scary all at the same time and it mixes together in a great way. So being very brief this is a great little game with good game mechanics and game design. The maps are well made, the audio is good, and the visuals are pleasant to look at. Also this game is actually updated and is not just an abandoned cause!			"

								I've been following Interstellar Marines for close to 5 years now. I remember it caught my eye on ModDB. Fast foward to 2015 and the amount of content has barely shifted from that initial concept stage. Hell, I'd say the majority of the concepts first portrayed still aren't present in the game itself and it's hard to say if they ever will be. That, in of itself, is enough to push me to make a ""negative"" review.A sci-fi, story driven tactical FPS is what this game was supposed to be about. You'll be getting a semi-decent multiplayer arena FPS with two guns instead. Believe me, the groundwork is there, it's just not going anywhere fast. It's simply not worth the 20 dollars it asks for.I won't lie, this was in many ways a bitter disapointment to me as my hopes were high and the concepts/ideas lured me in for many, many years. It just seems like by the time we actually see the game progress in any meaningful manner we will all be experiencing mid-life crisis.  "

								Bought the game since 2013, It was pretty good for an hour but that's it.Pretty boring so i left it, never to download it again for years and it's been 4 years already. No actual update, No campaign they promised, No landshark they promised, No actual difference between guns, Eats up spec pretty bad i mean....very bad.My pc can run 2017 AAA launch title but still struggle to run this game at swamp map. The whole game is pretty much abandoned as i heard that only partial devs are still working on it. It suffer the same fate as many other Early Access title which is sadly something we need to keep in mind.The concept is great, an actual realistic and futuristic combat , the squad based gameplay, Co-op campaign and landsharks!I hope that some bigger company might took the game and actually finish it, this game will be a rather wonderful game to play.

This game needs as much support as possible. It is amazing what these few people are doing and I am super excited for the campaign and co-op campaign, and with more support, it can be finished faster. Whats more is that for right now, 15$ for the game forever is an amazing deal that is unregrettable. Anyone who is a Sci-Fi FPS (like halo and any other semi spacy short future stuff) fan would love this game. BUY IT. You read other comments saying bad things.

								Good game so far from what I've played. I love the environment that differs from your normal FPS.Completing some missions solo makes it more enjoyable and intense.Yes some of the game seems clunky (jumping for example) but honestly it's not that bad. Feels a bit more immersive that you can't constantly run around sprinting like you can in most of the mainstream FPS' out currently.Would love to see more weapons, and yes I realize it is still early access but some variety is always a good thing. Same goes with enemies.Larger maps would be another bonus for me.Biggest downside of this game is the bugs. Yes I realize it is still early access, but not being able to complete a certain game type due to do a bug causing your mission item not to spawn gets annoying after a while.Would love to see a more completed version of the game, but still highly rated IMO.

								Review for Interstellar Marines Update #10LINK TO VIDEO REVIEW: 


YouTube™ Video: GAME REVIEW - Interstellar Marines Update #10 

			Views: 7,062		

			Check out the very first review for Interstellar Marines update #10! This update is a small step in the right direction. Please support these developers by checking out the game on Steam.		

Zero Point Software has proven that nothing will stop them from finishing Interstellar Marines. With long list of development setbacks, managing to get Interstellar Marines to this point is a huge accomplishment. For the past month, Zero Point Software has been working extremely hard to release the latest update for their game, update #10. Is it any good? Well, it’s a step in the right direction.Visuals: At first glance, you will notice some major changes to the visuals. The HUD has been completely reworked, the weapon model has been replaced with a new, modern looking assault rifle, and the overall realism of the environments and their effects all blend together to make a very polished feel. I’ve been killed quite a few times while stopping to watch the environment change its weather cycle because it just looked that good. But, as much as I like the new visuals, the option to turn off the bloom effects has been removed, and while this makes the game fairer for those who would keep these effects on and play with the disrupted vision, the bloom glow effects can sometimes feel overused and disrupt the vision to the point of frustration. It would be nice to see ZPS turn down these effects or balance them more to keep the visual impact, but not make any sacrifices on the game-play side. Also, when you are walking, the HUD moves and bobs so much that it’s almost impossible to see who is on your team or what their score is without completing ceasing all movement. I liked to check how my friends are doing in previous updates but now I feel more excluded.Gameplay: There is no doubt that Zero Point has worked very hard on making the experience in Interstellar Marines as smooth and polished as possible, and it really shows here. With the addition of a crouching and basic cover system in update #10, the tactical element has never felt more important. I’ve never had so much fun hopping from cover to cover with my squad mates. And the excellent improvements to the sound design only add to the overall experience. In one instance, I would be moving from cover to cover with my squad mates to reach the building across, zzwhile being sniped by the enemy team from across the map. It’s moments like these which make Interstellar Marines different and memorable than any other shooter. The more ZPS improves the features in the game, the more the game will feel alive. Sometimes, though, the cover system doesn’t always work. The camera’s height adjustments when popping in and out of cover can feel a bit clunky and switching from crouching to standing to quickly escape gun fire feels too difficult to achieve and ends up in a cheap death. This isn’t a game breaker, but since the cover system is a big deal, after a few matches, the errors start to really stand out and impact my overall experience. With the lack of support for any communication with your squad mates personally in game, players are still forced to communicate through and outside source, which isn’t bad, but just a bit tedious. I understand that this is still an early update for the game, and the developers have promised some sort of squad communication system in the future, so I am looking forward to seeing what they will do with this.Summary: Update #10 is a welcome addition to Interstellar Marines. While it has a few flaws, it’s a step in the right direction. It doesn’t do anything to drastically change the core game-play, but the additional features being added each update is really making a huge difference in the game and the fan base. ZPS has done an amazing job with the game so far, and I can’t wait to see where they take this game.

								Interstellar Marines. What can I say? Well, for one, CoD fans REALLY missed out on this one. Second, this review:Interstellar Marines is a sci-fi FPS that has AMAZING potential. I could see this being a revolutionary game in the near future. The devs are very involved with the community, it has a basic attatchment system, and the Co-op robots never seem to stop FREAKING ME THE HELL OUTOHMYGODPLEASEDONTKILLME!But, in all seriousness, this game is a very solid, immersive game, with the only thing that could add to the immersion is Oculus support. The Winter Holidays event is DM with the T-IM101: A christmas-light-filled, yelling, insanely stat-boosted Arnold Shwarzeneggar inside a spacesuit that possesses you when you touch a present. Yeah. The updates also never fail to bring new and interesting content, and you will be on the edge of your seat waiting for the next addition by Zero Pont Software.There aren't many weapons, but after you have the basic weapons (Assault Rifle, Pistol, SMG, Sniper Rifle, maybe a Grenade Launcher as a special pickup, etc.), they should focus on customization & attachments (If they aren't doing that already). The few weapons only adds to the balance and tactical-ness of the game. However, no system is without its... Kinks. Phone Guy said that, and it is very true, especially with Early Access games. The updates DO take a while to come out, so you'll be on the edge of your seat for a while. There is, however, no issue with crashing or glitching as far as I'm concerned. So, TL;DR, a very solid and immersive game with tight shooting, superb graphics, and updates and robots that never fail to impress and scare. Respectively. 10/10			"

								The game so far looks good. It has a tutorial and shows what type of equipment one has to play with and use. The guns are  very limited right now with an smg and with an assault rifle. There are some things that the game can improve on as far as the gameplay and it is still in the early phase. Lets hope that the updates for this game do not ratchet the gameplay that this game has achieved so far.			"

								Very fun. This game is exciting and terrifying at times. The stealth system is very fun to utilize and it is very tactical. Some things could definetly be added though. Instead of jumping walls or fences, you should have the ability to vault over things just to make movements smoother and fluent. More weapons could absolutely be added, including additional co op and campaign missions. It gets difficult to play them over and over again. It would be nice if a co op gamemode with rounds of difficulty was added, so you have to hold out. ALso, when you pull up your mask the other player should be able to see it. A greater variety of robots would be interesting as well. A list of objectives would help when you become completely lost in a mission too.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is really interesting in the combination of fps and stealth, but there are some things that definitely need to be fixed:1) Framerate. Now I know this is probably just my computer, as I have the same problem with nosgoth, but when I tried to fix the resolution, suddenly all of the buttons registered my mouse only when it was several inches away from the actual button. THIS IS NOT GOOD, but it is a small problem that probably could be fixed with a quick update.2)Lighting. This game is pretty dark, with lights in the levels shutting off randomly, even without me shooting them, and I have no idea if this is on purpose, or a bug. some explanation would be helpful. Also, incorporation of a night vision feature would greatly help, as a flashlight automatically gives me away, and as was previously mentioned, this game is pretty freaking dark.3)Audio. The computer giving me directions in the game sometimes repeats things, and again this is a problem that I'm not sure is intended or not, and if not, this is just another small problem that could be fixed with a quick update, as instruction was sometimes garbled among itself.Overall, though this is a really cool game, with solid controls, decent graphics (for an early access game), and a really cool helmet/HUD feature that entertains me to no end. I would love to see this be a full release and move beyond the early access stage, as this game has a lot of potential.			"

								I've been following this game, for a few years; basically I seen mutant land sharks, and well I am still left waiting for it. Lets be honest this game is early access but its good, the basics are there, and the shooting omg, I havent played a game that I feel like Im actually hitting where I aim. Perhaps many will say its unrealistic as there doest seem to have any variation of flight, but damn it feels good to know you as the player are on point.  Where is the game now? Well, its playable with a some bugs that are easily repeatable but nothing that breaks the game. There are 7 maps, and really it doesnt seem like much. And once you clear them all with you group of friends its hard to go back to them. And you will need friends, this game can be hard and failing is a part of it, but with a full group of friends there are alot of tactics to try in all the maps  in all the modes. It just feels like there isnt enough game yet, esp with updates so far between eachother. The online server chooser needs to be fleshed out a bit, currently a slight pain to get a game going, but not hard either, just missing some nicities. So for me and my group, there isnt enough yet for us to buy into I.M.'s Early Access yet. BUT if an update adds the sharks and give me some LAN play, I'm all in. It just need a bit more.			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is a fantastic sci-fi 1st person shooter. The developers show that they care by using tons of detail. The enviornments change, from day to night to rain to snow in just a short match. The player has so many decisions to make when this fantastic enviornment changes, you can use a flashlight attachment to your gun, have a laser sight, open and close your helmet visor. For example, in the night you can choose to use your flashlight to find people or you can creep around in the shadows (in the dark.) Another nice feature is you can walk around the maps by yourself and get to them before challenging others. This game is early access so you can imagine there are a few turn-off's as of right now, lag, the campaign has not been added yet, and sadly as far as I know there is only 1 or 2 guns in multiplayer. Overall though I would recommend it, if you are intrested I would purchase this game asap before it becomes to expensive because I think this game has a great future. It is a blast in my opinion similar to Halo and Call of Duty mixed with an amazing fighting enviornment. I would ABSOLUTELY recomend this game to anyone who likes 1st person shooter games.			"

I had more fun than I ever had in any other game ._.Basiclly all I did was running around, playing with my Gun's flashlight and laser pointer, nonstop opening/closing my mask and failing at killing other people while talking in the chat to a (so far) nice community...It's just that the Atmosphere is so dynamic and interesting aswell as unique it's just fun to go around there, when it's dark - It's REAL darkness, when it's rainining - You acctually know there's rain, it changes your gameplay and tactics.So, Atmopshere : checked,  Community : Checked, Graphics : Checked, optimization : Checked, Gameplay : Yup.All we're missing is some explosives!

This game needs as much support as possible. It is amazing what these few people are doing and I am super excited for the campaign and co-op campaign, and with more support, it can be finished faster. Whats more is that for right now, 15$ for the game forever is an amazing deal that is unregrettable. Anyone who is a Sci-Fi FPS (like halo and any other semi spacy short future stuff) fan would love this game. BUY IT. You read other comments saying bad things.

Early Access Review
								*UPDATED OCTOBER 12TH, 2016*Unfortunately, at this time, with the rapid loss of momentum the devs had, I cannot recommend Interstelllar Marines any longer. The developers have been drained to one last man, a very dedicated one at that, but realistically I cannot recommend this game unless things begin to look up once more.At it's core, IM is a tactical shooter that focused on immersive first person experiences in the vein of games such as Rainbow Six. It has relatively solid gunplay, fleshed out movement, and working SP/MP. It is a game that's been fun, that's had potential, but has lost steam as money ran dry, and devs were let go.Kim, don't give up on your dream; but don't forget about your life, please. Perhaps one day, IM will finally live; but for now, it settles in for a long night.For the love of the game.ORIGINAL REVIEW -*HIGHLY SUGGESTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT GAMEPLAY VIDEOS; IT'S A LOGICAL CHOICE*Interstellar Marines is a game I’ve anticipated, forgot, and then, to my great joy, rediscovered 2013 on Steam, fresh from being greenlit. My mind filled with visions of shark-creatures, tactical combat, and more sharks...Unfortunately, that game I saw a few years before is still in early access stages.However, that’s not bad. On the contrary, it’s a good thing, considering all the troubles Zero Point Software has faced even trying to get it to this point. The stuff they’ve been through so far is already an inspiring tale by itself.Note that the following is subject to change and modification as updates roll out and as I improve what I have to say. If you don’t like my review, please, give me some feedback in the comments!The review-	As of writing, the current update (Update 16) features quite a few things, but is missing many more. The game is still rather barebones due to all the indev and inactive features, the guns still possessing infinite ammo and marines still missing some vital things.HOWEVER, even at this pre-alpha stage, Interstellar Marines is a blast.	Tense Player versus Player matches, while not the focus of the game, drip with a fragile surface tension that can be broken violently with gunfire as you try to take points or navigate the map, the immersion being damn great.	The low health, movement style, and unforgiving weaponry contribute to this tense and (semi) tactical gameplay, and will hopefully continue to get better and better as updates are rolled out, and features are added, increasing the number of strategies and tactical moves a team can use to wipe out the opposition, be they Human Players...	Or Combat Training Robots, built to push you to your limit in tense PvE missions, all designed with co-op in mind. Update 13 brought everyone access to fight CTRs proper in the 'Neurogen Incident', the first 'Campaign' mission of IM that has a tense (if glitchy) atmosphere, achieved by setting players in a replica space station and giving them multiple objectives to achieve their way.	Since then, more and more AI missions have been added, with Terrorist-Hunt style elimination missions, or Update 16's new 'Assault on Starcrown Aerospace'.	In terms of the effort and care put into the game, there is a distinct lack of major bugs and issues most of the time, and even then Zero Point Software always listens to the community. The quality of the game is high, especially for early access and Unity Engine, and with a shared vision they've gone far, and seem to be going further. You could mistake their work for a veteran developer’s. Triple-A indie indeed!	Unfortunately, at times it’s a bit challenging to be tactical and immersed like ZPS wants. At the moment there’s no proper teamchat, and a limited number of gamemodes and players (Get on more, damn you).	As for how it runs and looks, this game isn't for low end PCs. Before I upgraded I often had 15 FPS on average. Despite this, the views are spectacular, and the graphics actually play an important part in gameplay, due to the dynamic lighting system, the fog and the storm effects. A map can be pushed into pitch-black due to the said lighting, a player can shoot out lights, you can be spotted using the light, etcetera. Loads of options opened by graphics.	As for the online community, with the exception of teamkillers and some new players, those I’ve seen are mature and understand the game, and despite a somewhat lower population of players, there's still dedicated people playing. Very rarely have I seen someone call anyone a 'hacking noob' or anyone go on generic 'CoD-child rage'.	As for the major story and all that, we’ll just have to wait for the future, and the Carcharodons/landsharks. Glorious landsharks!As for ZPS, you guys are dedicated, and the stuff you’re doing to connect with the community is great. Can’t wait for the future!tl;dr, Even though it’s barebones, it's something to follow, and it plays hard.	Now, as for buying it, I'd personally recommend it to support the devs (I know they need it, for the love of the game!) and purchase it, but if you're not that into early access or 'barebones' gameplay, then you may want to wait a bit.	The price will go up, though, over time.NOTE,	Before you make any decisions, you should go see some gameplay of the current version.Additions:CONCERNING THE LACK OF LANDSHARKS AND CAMPAIGN:This is a bloody early access, and it takes time to recreate those things in Unity. Be patient, there's less than 20 devs, and they first want a solid multiplayer first for you, the player or potential believer! And then, only then, can they begin to focus on the landsharky goodness.Where is the ‘First Immersion’ demo?!It was a small publisher demo created to get them publishers back in 2007-8, demonstrating features on Unreal Engine 3. Unfortunately they can’t release it or work on it due to licensing red tape. However, Xeno-13 will be remade eventually!My feelings on the progress of the game after so long:	They've gone through some stuff, and they hit steam with only two developers. Now, today, they're becoming able to hire more due to steam's early access, which will allow them to slowly speed up development and finally get the game out the gate.	After seeing what some of the Devs had to say, I’ve also learned that the ‘lack of progress’ some people argue is actually lots of unseen progress, and lots of bugfixing going on. You don’t see the badass ninja from that one VLog anywhere in the game because they actually fixed that BEFORE updating the game!More/Outdated responsesI see how some complain that the game did not deliver, lied in it's advertising and all that. I say that when you look at the big picture, with all of ZPS' troubles, experiences, and traits, that the advertising was in no way false at the time it was made. Original trailer, made to impress and to get a publisher, but from what I remember they didn’t say it was really ingame. Space Station and Sharks gameplay, a demo built on the Unreal 3 engine to impress and get a publisher, before 2008 screwed them over.Why does the current game look and play so differently than the demo? They can't use the Unreal 3 engine, the license costs a million bucks. That and the assets are a bit dated, and more legal tape.There's more, but I believe this illustrates my point.			"

Sound and light affecting environments (u can shoot out the lights, and u really can hear the enemy approaching so don't run all the time). the PvP games are pretty good in that the map scenario means even if you are the last man and all the flags are nearly capped, you have a target rich environment!

								It's incredible on how this game is so realistic, yet still in it's developing stages. There are multiple maps with envorinment settings. So you can go to one server with a map and it's raining, and as you play in the map the weather actually changes to where it'll be easier to fight, or to where it'll be harder to fight.-Weaponry/Equipment: At this time, there is only 1 weapon, which is an assault rifle. Yet, you also have the abiloity to activate a lazer for you to help with your accurasy, a flashlight incase it get's dark (game sometimes has you in pitch black darkness), of course you can zoom in by right-clicking, and unlike any sci-fi FPS, you can actually take off your visor. So it'll be like fighting with literally your own eyes. But the game doesn't give you a cursor to aim with like Halo, Battlefield, TF2, etc. You actually have to aim like everyone does in real life when in combat.-Maps: There are multiple maps that go from the middle of a swamp, to the cold regions, to a colony in the forest. All maps has the ability to change the weather to throw off players.-Game Mode: So far, there is only one game mode where you hold a certain area for the longest, but as time goes on, the capture zone will move into a different area of the map. In order to win, you must hold the capture zone for the longest when the time runs out, or when the amount of time you hold it reaches it's max. Either way, you have to work with your team in order to win. Cooperation and skill will bring you to victory in this game.Overall, this game is incredible for it to be an Early Access Game, I recommend this game to anyone that reads this.			"

								In its current state it is a very good game. The only thing that bothers me is its unoptimized state in which it is, but since it is in early access I'll let it slide for now. Singleplayer:Before I installed the game I read reviews about it and saw that people got scared while playing singleplayer.At first I was confused as to how a shooter with robots can be scary. Then I played the singleplayer and I understood.It's pretty scary when a robot starts to run towards you. Although they may seem non-frightening, their faceless head can spook you once it randomly pops up in front of you.Co-op:Didn't play so I can't comment on that, sorry.Multiplayer:The multiplayer for Interstellar Marines was quite fun for me actually, although in my past I played only CoD multiplayer(long time ago). To be honest it took me a little to get used to the guns(only 2 for now) and the lack of crosshair(instead you use a laser), but because of this I was forced to focus on my little tiny dot and I was sucked into the game. The game for now has a small amount of maps, but the ones that are in it currently are very well designed and I look forward to future maps. The players that I played with didn't chat alot so but the ones that did were very nice. I would recommend this game to the people who love strategic shoters as it involves alot of tactical cooperation between players, if you want to win ofcourse.Although I played the game while it was free for a couple of days, I will buy it as soon as I get money as it is worth the money and the wait for better optimization.

It's not a typical cookie cutter fps, it plays like a tactical shooter (though very limited for now, the game is still in development). Playing with your friends over a VOIP program, in the dark where only a flashlight can illuminate anything at all is a wonderful feeling, not knowing when or where you'll be attacked, not knowing if you turn around and your friend is dead at your feet; The game does an amazing job already of this, and there's till more to come!

								If you're looking to buy Inserstellar marines as of today: December 2nd 2014I'd recommend this in some circumstances.The game is fun and offers a base-level immersive tactical experience while maintaining just the right level of arcade influence.The graphics are excellent, considering the low texture fidelity, continues to prove that lighting can pretty much make or break a game as far as visual fidelity is concerned. Neurogen Incident certainly shows this off, creating a tense co op experience.The UI can be a bit cumbersome, as I understand that it's meant to be immersive it can still prove to be a pain given the amount of time a chat message appears on screen. Thus forcing you to bring up the chat menu, I'd prefer if they showed all messages from the past 5-10 seconds and slowly faded them out based on lifetime. Making the social experience a bit less frustrating.Something to be noted is the gunplay is not like anything I've experienced it's hard to describe really any other way than it feeling like you're controlling something and it has a considerable latency. Keep in mind my setup has no latency issues monitor is 1ms response time graphics card is more than capable... etc. Not to mention in the game's current state the community is quite small, it's hard to keep an audience's attention when you have such little content to show for, regardless of the content's magnitude.All this taken into consideration also with the fact that this game is still early access, the game is quite unique and definitely delivers an FPS experience unlike anything else I have had. I'd certainly recommend this to a friend who was looking for a basic and immersive tactical FPS for PC. "

Early Access Review
								This game has some amazing potential. Despite the (current) lack of content, the dev team has already nailed the atmosphere of Dead Space cross Rainbow Six , with some surprisingly immersive gameplay and gorgeous graphics from the Unity Engine. Your player character is very human-slow, vulnerable, and brave. Teamwork is just as important as twitch reflexes and awareness of your enviroment, and while the game can be played alone it is difficult and boring without at least someone else by your side. The game currently fearures a decent Multiplayer experience, several solo challenge missions, and two epic story missions pitting you and a team of 3 others up against intelligent and dangerous training robots simulating events from the IM backstory. While many features such as more guns (currently only 2), missions, and enemies (Land Sharks), the game feels balanced and very well done. According to the devs, this has been tehir life's dream for almost 20 years now, and they are very unlikely to give up and leave this as vaporware. The one complaint I have is the development cycle: with only 12 people building the equivalent of a AAA-quality title, it takes several months to update the content. If you're willing to wait, gab the game and start playing-realistic difficulty is hard and takes a lot of cooperation and skill to complete, so don't excpet to be bored. And if it feels too risky, keep an eye on Interstella Marines-this game is going places.			"

								Although I couldnt play the campaign mission because somehow it crashes (I dont know if it is my problem or the tutorial is the only mode playable to date) anyways, I think I can say something about it. The concept of the game its actually pretty good, trying to figure out what was the character doing there though, it doesnt really tells anything about that, but I'll give them some time to think that. No crosshair, soft movements in the gun while moving the camera, makes it very realistic, and the atmosphere its awesome, the darkness and the fight against the training robots made me feel scared as f*ck, and I loved it. I would say its a game you should buy as quick as possible, but its an Early Access, so, we'll leave it to that, before you buy it you should wait until the game it's out. The graphics are great, not the best ones, but hey, you gotta admit that they are not bad. There are almost no graphic options, apart from the quality of the shadows and some view quality options (Depht of field, etc) , and that its disapointing. As far as I seen, this game has future, its pretty ""green"" yet, but you just have to wait!(Note to developers: Please put more graphic options on it, THEY ARE NECESARY! :D)			"

								Interstellar Marines is a game that reches for the stars. With a creative new way of making a fps simulation of future warfare in a multiplayer game. Even in its early stages it shows effects and gameplay elements that rival with half life and other great shooters that have come out over the years. Anamation may not be finished and ai still to be seen, but what it has so far is done with polish and has great stile. Its the game that just keeps getting better and i give it a 8/10 and expect it to get a 10/10 in the future.			"

								If you're like me, you've probably lost interest in shooters the likes of Call of Duty several years ago. Tactical shooters seem to have passed into history and games like the Rainbow Six series have no equals in today's gaming landscape. Interstellar Marines is an admirable attempt to ressurect this genre and is absolutely brimming with potential. In it's current state the game is lacking in both content and polish. There's a few weapons, a handful of maps and some single player content that feels like a tutorial. There are no real tactical options yet and simple features like peeking around a corner are lacking. Still the game is an absolute thrill to play. I found myself holding my breath while sneaking through a futuristic compound, listening for robotic footsteps and checking every corner. The game is every better when played in co-op mode. Interstellar Marines has a long way to go to become a complete and finished project but the potential is there.PRO's:- True TFPS atmosphere- Movement and shooting feel rigid- Fun co-op and Versus MultiplayerCON's:- Inconsistent performance- Incosistent level of polish- Overall lack of conent			"

								as always thanks for the free weekend guys.i saw alot of tools and playground stuff to toy with and wish i had the time but currently am knee deep in another fps co-op game and decided to give this a shot before the free week ran out.actually pretty suprised and glad i snuck it in there.there's not alot of cosmetically attractive indie fps games out there, but there's some talent at this studio. i'd say the game is not quite a $300 million dollar masterpiece, but it's certaintly on par with the best THQ could put out before their demise. and im sure this was made on far more sweat and alot less cash. the sounds are also fairly solid too. nice little package here.chief complaints?- sever ping was kind of wonky. i had full ping to austrailia? not a chance.more than likely thats steam and/or my internet provider. so can't ding them for that.-no controller support as of yet.  it would've been nice. im sure it'll get added in. maybe ill give it another try then. im sure some people that made this game will be getting phone calls from the big leauges very soon.

								This isn't a reinvention of the FPS genre, but it does add some mechanics that have been controversial.  Before I outline those issues, it should be known that this is a great game at a great price.During my playtime, some issues that I have heard random people scream about is the lack of jump or crouch.  This is a very simple FPS that is currently in ALPHA and it is a shame when new players are too selfish or ignorant to realize what an Alpha means.If you are looking for regular FPS style mechanics, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are interested in innovative game play, tug-o-war scoring and a good (on the most part) community, give it a try.

								overall i find this game EXTREMELY immersive, good lighting, sound, combat. it made me feel like a real spec op marine, i would like to fight more than robots however in the campeign. in addition to the robots, one distinct problem i find is a lack of checkpoints in the game. i had a few occasions where i was at the last couple seconds of a mission, then i would die, only to see i had to start all over again. but  with the few levels in the game i suppose it is understandable, this does extend gameplay time, but not in a good way. if anything there should be a option to turn checkpoints on and off. i have had a chance to see what multyplayer had to offer and  i am VERY pleased with what they have done. but with all of its pro's and con's, i would rate this game a 7/10. it would take me to long to list and explain them all. this a game for all fps fans, i recomend grabbing your friends and playing this right now.

								I've been following Interstellar Marines for close to 5 years now. I remember it caught my eye on ModDB. Fast foward to 2015 and the amount of content has barely shifted from that initial concept stage. Hell, I'd say the majority of the concepts first portrayed still aren't present in the game itself and it's hard to say if they ever will be. That, in of itself, is enough to push me to make a ""negative"" review.A sci-fi, story driven tactical FPS is what this game was supposed to be about. You'll be getting a semi-decent multiplayer arena FPS with two guns instead. Believe me, the groundwork is there, it's just not going anywhere fast. It's simply not worth the 20 dollars it asks for.I won't lie, this was in many ways a bitter disapointment to me as my hopes were high and the concepts/ideas lured me in for many, many years. It just seems like by the time we actually see the game progress in any meaningful manner we will all be experiencing mid-life crisis.  "

								As an Early Access game, it has managed to keep my attention ever since its initial release. The game has come a long way since its initial release, and the updates are starting to come in faster and faster. If one wants to know how far this game has come, check out videos of the original release vs the current game version (Update 18 for the time this review was written). In terms of gameplay, here is what players can expect to see (As of Update 18):Solid gunplay mechanics. the weapon's sights aren't ""glued"" to your screen, and will move around as you walk, fire, etc. (Think kind of like Red Orchestra). The weapon does reset at the centre of your screen however.A stamina system that affects your character's accuracy as he gets tired. Stamina is drained when jogging, sprinting, and jumping. You can hear your character's breathing and when your HUD is offline, his breath will fog up the inside of the helmet. An intuitive crouching system that allows you to change stance between a low crouch or a higher stance to shoot over low walls. Aiming down sights will also make your character peek over cover, and if you change stance while aiming, he will only bend at the knees for faster movement. Sprint, Jog, and walk. Three movement speeds that are very useful and easy to cycle through.Two weapons. An Assault Rifle for long range combat and an SMG for close range combat. The ability to attach a sound suppressor to your weapon. It actually works really well in both multiplayer and co-op/single playerYou can shoot out lights to create darkness in order to sneak around (Think Metro 2033/ Last Light)Multiplayer maps will change time of day, weather, and sometimes layout as you play. Matches have a sense of unpredictability for newcomers because of this.Three game modes to chose from: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Domination.3 campaign missions, and a few other side-missions. Currently, all missions are training excercises for your character (A new recruit to the Interstellar Marines).HUD deactivates when you take 50% damage. This makes it hard to identify between friend and foe because IFF markers and objective markers all vanish. I hope that this review has convinced at least one person to try out the game. Despite all the praise I'm throwing at it, note that there are many missing features in the game. The updates have been coming in more quickly recently, and a big one is apparently going to be coming in soon. So if you feel like taking a risk and betting on this extremely promising title, I highly suggest that you buy it. If you can, go for the spearhead edition to get a few extra goodies.  "

								Been playing this game for about three hours and it's very addicting. the constant shift in environments[multiplayer] forces you to adapt. also, tactics are vital in this game.[Example: When it's dark, try to use the flashlight as little as you can] The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are beautiful.

								So this game isnt too bad for being early access. I like the design on the maps even the weather and time changes every 3ish minutes. Yes its not realistic but a challenge to use or not to use your flashlight. Its different and slow pase so if your looking for a fast killing game this game isnt for you. The spawn points are good, they arnt smashed together where the fight is happening. Plus other features like by pressing H your helmet opens up, you can see better but you wont know who are your team mates. Also by pressing G you enable or disable your red laser. OH and one other thing, if you look up you can see the map is surounded by a dome. I think its like some sort of simulator or something IDK.  But overall I pretty much like this slow pase futureistic FPS Sci-fi game :) I recommend buying this game when its out of early access. To see the final product or buy it now to see the progress? :D			"

Early Access Review
								Now, this is my first review for Interstellar Marines and it's still an early access game, so there can be some changes in my opinion.Alright, so far Interstellar Marines seems to have great potential in becoming one heck of an awesome sci-fi FPS game. I bought the game's Spearhead edition and immediately looked at all the references they used to model the Marines, and I was amazed that there were references of Halo's SPARTANs and the Halo 4 era Marines in there. I really liked those designs, so the developers could be trying to appeal to those who like the aesthetics of Halo (such as me).The multiplayer matches, however, seem to be VERY unbalanced, as long-time players are always mowing down crowds of new and inexperienced players, which makes this game a bit unfair for newcomers, but the connection to those servers is simply fantastic. I haven't found myself lagging yet and I doubt I ever will. Another thing that bugs me about the gameplay is the constant and wild shake of the weapon. I highly doubt any highly-trained Marine would shake his weapon around like that and even if it's for the purpose of gameplay balance, it's poorly executed and thus makes the players lose valuable long-range accuracy.Also, there is the issue of hacks appearing for the game. These hacks, however, are not as bad as in most FPS games, like, say, Counter Strike or Call of duty, but they still present a significant problem.All of that, though, does not stop me from enjoying this well-made game. I can clearly see that the developers have been trying to create their own great sci-fi shooter and they're doing a pretty good job at it. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a change from the rage-inducing Call of Duty, the military sim ArmA, or just Battlefield... or just for those who want to test out their skills in multiplayer.

								I have only played the single player so far but from what i have played i am really liking this game. the main things that make this game fun for me  are:1. there is no mini map to show where the bad guys are2. there are no checkpoints so if you die , you start over on the mission3. i feel the aiming and handling of the weapons is super smooth and just feels really good4. these 3 things together make for a slow paced, very tactical shooter where you must move slow and constantly check the environment around you to not end up dead and back at the start.5. terminator robots, who don't like those?6. realistic mode is very challenging seeing as you will die from one hit from the robots, but very satisfying when your able to pick off the enemies and progress.7. the dark creepy environment where its best to leave the fllashlight off and only use it briefly to get a quick view of your surroundings. to me it keeps me on edge and my heart pounding.8. the devs are in the forums answering questions and making sure they stay civil and trying to keep the trolls and flamers outin conclusion i say give this game a shot it's free for the week so you have nothing to lose especially as it's only 1gb to download so like 2minutes of your time. i's not gonna be for everyone but if you like tactical games where you don't just run around like some movie hero who can't be hurt it might be for you. I'll add more once  i have tried co-op and mp. plus i know for $6 i will get my monies worth even if it takes the devs a while to finish it.edit: im thinking checkpoints on the easiest difficulty might be nice just so you can figure out how to complete a mission without dying after 2hrs not knowing if you were close to the escape or in the entirely wrong spot, but i hear they might be coming			"

								My first ten minutes in Interstellar Marines:Start the game.Get my nerves set on edge by the almost unnecessarily creepy training.Go to final stage for training.Shoot the robots.Get the living crap scared out of my by a robot standing right behind a door.Fall complete in love whith this game.IN ALL SERIOUSNESS:This game is really a gem.  It is the best tatical FPS I think I have ever played.  Suck it CoD.  True, it needs more guns, and the huge outdoor maps are kind of laggy, but these small flaws are easily made up for in the truly immersive multiplayer, incredibly tense single player, and the great (and I mean GREAT) co-op.  This game creates so much fear and the chemistry is so good with all the different variables in each mode.  You can shoot the lights out, put silencers on your guns and use lazer sights or flashlights in missions and in multiplayer.  All of these options create their own pros and cons in a mission.  This is a truly great game, and I think that it and it's genre deserve more respect and attention.			"

Have not considered getting back into it.The day and night changing maps and the option to temporarily shot out lamps and light sources or trigger terrain changing stuff is cool. Single Player against AI was really though in the preview version. Don't know if it changed at all. You can have a few sessions of fun with friends and strangers but you better not have a potato to run it.I do hope this property gets picked up by / sold to someone who can make it work.

								I haven't played a lot of this game, but what I did I thoroughly enjoyed. Honestly the reason I only played as little as I did was because it was a lot scarier than what I expected. I know that may sound childish but seriously, it was freaking terrifying. The single player tutorial: you're thrown into a room full of bloodthirsty androids with nothing but an SMG, an assault rifle, and whatever god you believe in. Then suddenly the lights go out, and all you can hear is the robotic hiss and footsteps of the creatures created solely to destroy you. As your heart starts rapidly beating the footsteps grow closer, you ready your gun to defend yourself... then BANG you're dead sucks you're awful at the game and now you're crying on the floor begging for your mother. That's how I felt.			"

								No. This is like playing Counter-Strike. You have only 2 guns and they both work the same way. Lots of problems. Still very Early Access and not worth buying. The main PvP game mode is Point Capture. Objective is to capture all 7 points or eliminate all opposing team members. If you die, it will take you 120 seconds to respawn or your surviving teammate can capture a point and give you an instant respawn.This game isn't as polished as it claims to be, do not listen to the marketing bots. I think they just pay bots/people to spam positive reviews for them.PROS1. HUDVery interesting. No need to keep pressing Tab to see who's alive and dead. Doesn't block your view either. Everything in the top left and top right.2. Moving mapsSome parts of the map move up and down, changing the terrain. CONS1. MatchmakingYou have to manually find a game that is of a suitable ping, the map you want and hopefully with players.2. Map DesignLots of map design flaws. Step heights, stairs, handrails... You name it, they got it.3. DoorsEvery single door must be opened by pressing E. No automatic door sensors. There's an Open-Door simulator in this game. Don't try it.4. Night / DarknessWhat's this? A stealth game in the shadows? Bust the gamma on my computer to see my enemy?5. Rain / SprinklersNo. Giving me a wet HUD does not impress me.6. JumpingYou will start panting if you keep jumping. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.7. WeaponsOnly 2 at the moment. Both seem to work like Counterstrike rifles.8. BackpacksWhy do the models have backpacks?			"

Early Access Review
								First impression: What a FPS should be. Having cut my game teeth on Wolfenstien,Doom and Quake in ID's shareware beginnings, I found this game to be a great step forward. It is not easy, but if it is easy it soon lacks fun and challenge. I am having a bit of control issues as it is more real in its physcis than the average game of today. Also I have just recently returned to using a mouse as opposed to a trackball and am still getting used to moving the mouse around. The A.I. of the N.P.C. 's (currently robots) is excellent and random in nature, much like hunting humans.  I only have played a few hours so far, but expect to spend a good deal more time in the future. An odd note on server selection is though I reside in the intermountain west the best ping times are to the EU servers, far better times than the US West or East servers. The learning curve is quick and simple with only 2 weapons , however unlike most current shooters there is no auto reload when the guns go empty. Also there is a limit to sprint and jump functions so there is no hopping to avoid fire(yeah) and sprint is soon exhausted (just like for real).  In summary it is well worth watching this one , It should prove to be interesting to see where it goes and hope it does not fall apart as BulletRun did (i really liked that one). at this early stage I would say {7 of 10}. Enjoy.			"

								10/10 a 'demo' with great potentialI'll make this brief and simple and to the point, okay?OkayInterstellar Marines is a game that I found, upon playing it, has a wonderful amount of charm and potential. Yes, the weapons are currently limmited to the standard SMG and the Assault Rifle, and yes, there's not a whole ton of REAL missions in the singleplayer (by REAL I mean The NeuroGen Incident and the Starcrown Assault), which brings me to my main point of the game.It's not finished...When I look at this game, I think of it as more of a Singleplayer/Muliplayer/Co-Op, tactical, space, first person shooter demo.So if you want to buy this game, I say 'Go for it'.Just keep in mind that this game is unfinished, and that I cannot be held responsible should anything go to crap, okay?OkayP.S. If you've made it all the way down here, I appreciate it, and will let you know that you can find both Valve and 20th Century Fox references within the NeuroGen Incident. Simply listen closely to the station's announcement system, and you'll find them :3			"

								this game is alot of .. if you have good people to play with, when i say good, i basicly mean any fps player who plays games like CSGO and battlefield games, if you play cod and more cod, then this isnt for you. the multi player is super easy to finda game and requires you to actually think about how and what you can do to help your team win the game. the co-op is alot of fun as well, the singleplayer is fun too but i would have like to see a check point system implemented just so that you dont have to restart from the start all over again (having to 5-6 times) can make the game seem repetitive and it loses alot of its replay ability because of that.i'm writing this as of February 2015, seen as though this game was released into early access in july 2013 i did expect alot more content for the amount of dev time, however i am satisfied with the current available so far.8/10 will absolutely be purchasing this game when it has its full release.keep up the good work devs			"

								Almost reminds me of what CS2 could've been.  Epic foundation and lots of immersion factor-like DOOM level immersive w/o losing the genuine feel of tactical play!! A welcome newcomer to the genre; or is it a NEW genre altogether.  Still ingesting before digesting--GET SOME IMonSTEAM NOW!			"

								A realistic FPS.You die in one or two shots. But can be revived by teammates if they are close.Please note that my review soley focuses on Multiplayer and does not include the story missions as i havent tried them.The game features rather fast, combat but asks the player to be sneaky. The good part: This actually works. You find yourself carefully going through each room, sprinting over open areas and crawling through bushes.The map design first struck me as cheap. Until i played 2 minutes and realized that the maps are constantly changing while you are in it. Every map does it differently. Most maps change daytime and weather conditions (pitchblack night to rainy day in 5 seconds). Other maps lock certain doors and activate different lights. Yet another map actually elevates/decends entire buildings a floor up/down.Now for the game and respawn mechanics, which after the maps is the best part.The goal  is to either clear the map from the enemy teams players (killlsssss) or having control over all the capture points. The respawn timer is 2 minutes. Yep. 2 MINUTES. But thats not bad at all, if your team is capable, because if someone captures a point, one teammate respawns, circuimventing the timer completly. Should someone end up being the last one alive and gets a kill, that will spawn one teammate back into the game as well.The order of respawn is first in first out (or rather first out first back?), so if you die first in the team, you will be the first one to be back in game as well.In many ways it reminds of Insurgency, but it has no lying down, no looking around the edges, plus its respawn/capture mechanic is pushing you torwads more aggressiv play. It feels more action packed then Insurgency in that matter, but has less depth. Yet its not inferior. Lets put it like this: If Insurgency was to slow for you this might be exactly your thing.As its early access, i'ld love to say this: Some more maps, another gamemode maybe, and at least some skins or whatev for your guy and guns when you level up. The game lacks any real progression, and i think new guns would hurt the gameplay more then they would help it. So focusing on skins would be better.If you mistrust Early Access, dont buy it. But otherwise its already very promising.'nuff said.			"

								The state it's currently in, there's not much to experience in Interstellar Marines. I've only played multiplayer, however. You are given two guns, one for close to mid-range combat, another for mid to long-range. Both guns can have silencers, flashlights, and laser sights toggled.There aren't that many maps yet, which is super understandable, but the maps that are provided are extremely balanced. Maybe too balanced for some, but balanced nonetheless. The maps also change over the course of each round, which is extremely interesting. Platforms move up and down, rain starts to fall (muffling the sound of your footsteps), and the lighting changes. One of my favorite things about this is when the lights go out. Fighting in the dark is insanely satisfying. You never really know what's going on... but in a good way.There's a quite a few bugs here and there, but it's in alpha. Of course there's bugs. This game has a hell of a lot of potential; it looks like it could become the FPS I've been waiting for.			"

								In it's current state, I DO NOT reccommend this game. However, based on what the devolpers have planned and how frequently the updates are coming along I think it will be a good game in the long run. Let's get to the Pro's and Con's of the game so far. {I PLAN TO UPDATE IT}===PRO===1. The game looks great and runs great, even on some of the lowest settings. The enviroment changes really do add to the combat experience.2. Immersion. The devolpers have been trying to make this game really immersive, and they really have. The rain on the helmet, the ambient sounds, everything about the immersion is great. Once the Oculus Rift support for this game arrives, this will be a MUST-OWN for anyone with an Oculus Rift3. Planned features. This may not seem like a real Pro, but the features the developers want to add sound great. Land Sharks, need I say more? ===CON===1. Only one gun. Gets very boring using the same gun (THOUGH IT IS IN ALPHA, AN EARLY ALPHA). No sidearms, no melee, just your one SMG.2. No hit markers, and the gun feels like it does no damage. Kinda feels like shooting at ghosts until they fall over.3. Only 2 gamemodes (yet again, it's early alpha) Free For All (feels like CoD with one gun) and Team Domination. Team Domination is great mode because it forces teams to work together to hold areas. Sometimes however...4. TEAM KILLING! Your team mates are only marked with little blue lights. Sometimes it can be hard to see if someones on your team, exspecially if they open fire on you.Not gonna rant on how there's no melee or crouching yet in the game, because, once more, it's EARLY ALPHA!In short, Interstellar Marines in it's current state isn't great, but hopefully in a few months it will be well worth the $15.

								one of my favorite FPS, just as great or better than Battlefield and counter strike. The flog limits the range of fights making it crucial you watch your back, dark environments make you use flashlights, sound is so suttle you have to listen carefully, dying is truly punishing which makes you play as if your doing airsoft.  The game is so emersive and intresting.The some maps have an arcade theme, others feel like a swamp, and some feel normal.Recoil is hard to understand at first, but basically you have to tap fire.  New rifle makes it easier for long range fights, while the standard weapon shoots like a close range SMG.			"

								This is a good game, but beware it is EARLY ACCESS. This is why it doesn't have many features at the moment but it is very promising for the future. The gameplay mechanics are very interesting. The guns are rather reckless when you fire them so you really have to master how to use them; 1 hit kill to the head, 5 to the body. Although there is currently only one weapon, I rather like it. This is because there are no classes that can be unbalanced, meaning it is raw skill that makes you win the game. In the future I would love it if the developers could add melee and crouching. This is because it would eliminate awkward moments where both players are standing right in front of one another without being able to defend themselves whilst they are both reloadingTL;DR: Good game. Know what you are purchasing.			"

Early Access Review
								Tried out the game on the free weekend, have the following thoughts:Someone was complaining in a negative review that the free weekend was the stupidest marking decision they could have made. That is just complete and utter garbage. Especially for early access games there should always be a free weekend if for nothing else but to simply let people try the game in the current state. But in addition to that, and regarding the comment about it being the stupidest decision, all I can say is that steam seems to promote some games and burry others. The fact that this one got a whole free week was a great boost for them I am sure. Hopefully this boost will push the development to the next level, and hopefully the devs can add some critical features to the game and address some of the issues which I will outline below.After playing the game for most of the free week I have the following observations in no particular order:Character Control – overall as good as can be expected with the exception of jumping. Your player just feels weighted down. Maybe this is intended, but I found myself frustrated with the lack of fluidity and height in the jump. I would like to see it be where you can jump over some of the cover items in the game such as the concrete barriers and such. And do this in the heat of combat. As it is now, it’s just not very natural feeling and cumbersome. Because of this I rarely even use jump in the game.Gameplay – A nice variety of mission types with some interesting features. First time I played on a level where the entire area had parts that would raise and lower opening new paths and blocking pervious paths it gave me pause and I had to stop for a minute to marvel at it. Makes for some very tough tactical situations. I like the elimination missions in coop the most, but once you play them a few times it gets stale as you learn where many of the bots spawn from and quickly develop a strategy to beating them, alone or as a team. Not much else in the game at the moment other than bots and not sure if this is by design or because it’s simply not implemented yet but you have infinite ammo. Still have to reload, but you never run out. Still looking for the role play and rainbow-6 tactical elements, but maybe it’s too early for that stuff. The stealth element seems to work well for the most part. Stay low and in the shadows and the bots seem to overlook you. Fire your weapon without a silencer and they will come running to your position. The bots also can home in on you by spotting your flashlight and laser pointer, so you need to know when to use them and when not to.Coop – This is the area that I would really like to see improved the most. I have two major complaints here. 1) absolutely no recourse for griefers and during the time I have played there have been many, many little sh!ts that have nothing better to do than to f-up your game. That and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who want to come in and hijack the server you are playing on. I know they said this is coming but come on, at least give us a group kick vote option or something in the meantime. 2) coop needs more elements to encourage team work. As of now, you get no points for reviving a teammate and communication is terrible. The few people who I have heard using a mic it was terrible, and chat totally blows. Why would you make your chat screen have to be opened with a key press and then cover the entire field of view? The chat interface needs a complete overhaul and we need team quick commands. That would be a good start to making it more tactical. If they want to do something original, give us hand signal animations that we can map to the number keys or something. That would really make stealth tactical. I would also like to see a post-game summary. As of now, when the mission is done, you don't get to see anything.Levels - Some people complained about how dark some of the levels are. Yes it’s dark and in some cases I think they take it to the extreme, but it definitely makes the levels interesting and challenging in some cases. I hope the light balancing will be tweaked to be more fun and less frustrating in some cases, but over all its not terrible. The bots don’t like it either; it makes it harder to see you!Content – Aside from the static décor and the bots there’s really nothing else in the game yet. There are interactive doors, some power switches you need to turn on for some missions and lights that you can shoot out. I hope things are added such as ammo, first aid items, of course different weapons, and the typical things you would expect in a shooter. Oh and there is also some background chatter on the intercom, as well as a female voice that gives you some mission instructions from time to time. Interesting to note, it seems like some of the intercom chatter might be alluding to events we might actually see in the finished game. That would be cool.Weapons – As many people have already said, the weapons that are in the game are pretty good, handle well and cover long range and CQB combat. Nothing special here.All in all the game has potential. I have heard that it has been in development for a long time, something like 2 years, so it seems to be going slow. I hope the pace picks up. I do recommend the game if you like the genre and the setting, but I’m not gonna go full fantard and try to convince you that they have all these fabulous features planned all you have to do is wait for it. I really don’t know what’s going to come of this game, but while it’s on sale, why not. I am sure I, as well as you, have wasted more on less so give it a shot… maybe the extra cash will help them realize the potential of this game.			"

								Still in very early stages and with somewhat limited content, but very beautiful and very promising. A good tactical shooter with a very strong emphasis on visuals and environment. The maps are beautiful and interesting, offering different tactical challenges and opportunities. Still some performance optimizations planned apparently, although it works excellent on my NVIDIA GTX 760 card running under Linux, and for an Early Access game it seems to be relatively bug free.The biggest thing that sets this apart from other shooters is the use of the changing lighting and weather effects to create quickly changing scenarios; and it's so satisfying to just flip on your flashlight and open fire on an unsuspecting enemy in the dark.

								Today they released the first of the CO-OP/single player missions and I have to say its a fantastic first installment.VERY atmospheric, VERY scary at times, the first enemy I encountered i nearly wet myself in panic lol :)I was a little disapointed in how long it was taking Zero Point to add a campaign mode as im not a huge multi player shooter player, and up until now thats all that was really available, but after my intial play through of this update my confidence with these guys is through the roof :) They have a solid, though small team of guys over there who clearly have a solid vision for what they think a modern take on an ""old school"" scifi shooter should be, and I think they have it spot on.IF YOU HAVENT BOUGHT THIS GAME YET, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT TODAY !!!!!!!!im so excited for future content now :)			"

								Imagine this: ""Player 1 has decided to pull the plug"". Everything goes dark except your hud lights and small blue arrows, indicating your allies. Some fluorescent tape on the containers strained in the hallway. You lift your helmet and look around you. You hear distant footsteps and beeping of the computers. You breath deeply and flick your flashlight for a second. A slight movement startles you. As you lower your helmet, you are assecured that that is indeed your friend, your guide in this blue, subtle darkness that engulfs your field of view, and forces you to scout your surroundings. Was that an enemy or a lone wire? Was that a footstep or a drop of water from the sterile, metal ceiling? Suddenly, you hear gunfire, not so distant but not too close. You rush towards the sound and you are greeted with a grim reminder that you have enemies, and their hands are faster than yours. You spray bullets on their shiny costumes and boom, bam, tak! Lo, and behold, they are no more. You huddle your hands around your keyboard in solumn satisfaction: ""lol get rekd noobz""			"

Although, I do hope the sounds of the guns firing while scoped are place holders, because it sounds like the gun is firing from far away, it might be my sound driver but I doubt. This has features and is constantly updated by a friendly developer team. I would love to see a pistol though, and a shotgun.  Is campaign coming soon? I vote this 10/10, and I even bought spearhead to show my support! Good job on making a terrific game, devs!			"

								Even for a game that's in it's pre alpha stages, it's a very good game. Don't get me wrong. Like all games in existence, this game has it's fair share of problems. You really can't expect much from a game that's currently in alpha, or pretty much ANY game at all since every game as I've stated before has their own set of issues.As of right now, the game is very lackluster and barebones, but again, you really can't expect too much from an alpha, so have caution if you're expecting this game to give you a lot because as of right now, there's not too much for this game to offer at the moment in it's current stage considering it's an early access title.Another issue I've come across, which I'm still confused on determining what exactly the issue is that's causing this. Regardless, hit detection is another issue (when I'm not in U.S. servers). Any combination of these three reasons could be the cause: Netcode issue, tickrate issue, server location. But again, since it IS an alpha title, I can't really expect it to be perfect considering this game has been in the works slowly for the past decade, which definitely tells you how much the developers care if they're taking their time to perfect their game.One other issue is engine optimization. The graphics, while great, are also very simple, and with simple graphics, I shouldn't be having such huge FPS fluxuations with my FPS dropping as low as 10 FPS at times. Now, the prototypes of the different game modes on the official Interstellar Marines website (especially Bullseye, which ran at a solid 60 FPS for me) looks, sounds, plays, and runs much better than what we currently have on Steam (again, alpha stage, you can't really expect much) which tells me that they're probably taking the DayZ route of things and most likely going to change engines in the future to a more optimized, a more playable engine. Again, it's an alpha. Not only is this game an alpha, but Zero Point Software is an independant game development company. You gotta start somewhere. Gotta be patient with this one considering how careful the devs are being and how delicate they're treating this game. Obviously, this game still has a lot of work to be done, but it's still great nonetheless for an alpha. Pretty much, most of the issues we're seeing currently is due to it's alpha status, which really NO game as an alpha or even a beta can avoid. It's just part of early access games and development. It's natural and it takes time.Regardless, the game is great, and the prototypes of the different game modes on the official Interstellar Marines website are also fantastic as well, which pretty much gives you a taste or a hint of what's to come with this game in the future.Although this game has been in development since 2004, I'd rather a game take 10 years to develop just so it can be perfect and up to it's full potential as opposed to having a broken game released to me that clearly isn't finished yet *coughcoughBADCOMPANY2coughcoughCALLOFDUTYcoughcoughBATTLEFIELD4*.With that being said, I'd really suggest supporting Zero Point Software as much as possible considering they've been busting their asses off for the past 10 years just to dish out a good game, and that right there tells you that these developers take this seriously and pour every ounce of their tears and blood into this game.Get this game. If not now as an pre alpha, get it as a full release when it's finally complete.UPDATE: As of now, many of these issues I mentioned earlier have been resolved by the devs, all the more reason to get this game seeing as the devs actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their game.

								This is a fantastic early access game. Well worth the price and an essential purchase if you see it discounted.The game really shines when working with teammates over VOIP. We played it for hours and had a blast.Pros - Good atmosphere        - No grenades        - Excellent lighting dynamic. This especially keeps things interesting and dynamic.        - Nice map design        - Excellent respawn dynamic, get a kill or capture a capture point to respawn a dead team mate.Cons - Current joining onto the same team of your friends can be a bit difficult, You can only switch teams at the end of each match even if teams are uneven.         - Limited content for single or solo (no VOIP buddies) players.         - Spawn points can be camped. Something needs to be done about this.I recommend grab it and support the developers.			"

								The game's dynamic shifts would probably stand out as the main bullet point of the back of the Interstellar Marine box. It changes everything. Suddenly the rain is teaming down, thudding off the helmet of your suit, meaning that running suddenly becomes viable, your loud footsteps masked by the sound of the rain. As the simulation changes again the rain might stop, but the light might abandon you. When it does players are forced to use flashlights for navigation, but open themselves, and their locations, up to attack.It’s this single mindedness that marks Interstellar Marines out as more than just a standard first person shooter. This doesn’t feel like a game that is going to♥♥♥♥♥superfluous nonsense to it to draw in a crowd of Call of Duty gamers. Granted, not doing so could be detrimental to the game’s sales, but, as with the game itself, sticking to their guns and being deliberate in both message and content could attract a dedicated and loyal base.http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-games/early-access-investigations-interstellar-marines/ "

								I saw this game online on a game website years ago and made an account and played the free training course and target shooting the game offered. I always wanted this game after I saw it and would always be checking on updates and what the devs were doing, the concept and idea of the game was amazing and sounded like a new amazing co-op and maybe horror game with an optional PVP mode but the soul of the game would be the amazing story and co-op/single player gameplay. Then back to 2013, I saw the game finally went on to steam early acces and was excited and instantly bought the spearhead edition and gave the free key to a friend. We played and checked it out, it was only pvp on like 2 or 3 maps but I didn't care, it was early access and just released so I still had hope and faith in this game. Then came some time after early access release, more PVP updates...still nothing for co-op, even more time, they finally released something..a small concept of co-op is what it seemed like, it was fun for the first run through of it but then it still seemed bland and not much. Still more time goes by and a new PVP mode and a few updates to co-op and singleplayer, just basically the co-op but a lone. I still had a little bit of hope in this game for a while but right now, three years and nothing to show for and very few to no promises made, I'm starting to struggle even thinking this game will get anywhere, I can't even touch the game anymore, theres nothing. I just comepletely forgot about this game and the company and so did the whole community. The community is lost in their hopes for an amazing co-op and singleplayer game that just probably will never happen. Many of the people who bought this were long fans of the game and thought we were finally going to get what we have been waiting years for. I can't recommend this game to anyone, just not now and the sad truth probably never. It's just an idea left in hiatus. So, don't buy this game. It shouldn't be on steam and its not going anywhere, we never got the co-op or singleplayer we were promised. Just so many PVP updates, it took so long for the first co-op to come in and it was just fighting robots and pressing E on things. Do not get this game, maybe sometime in the future we'll have the game we were promissed and hoped for, but probably not for a long time.If you want this game for PVP it's dead. Completely dead, no one plays anything but around 7 play PVP.			"

								one of my favorite FPS, just as great or better than Battlefield and counter strike. The flog limits the range of fights making it crucial you watch your back, dark environments make you use flashlights, sound is so suttle you have to listen carefully, dying is truly punishing which makes you play as if your doing airsoft.  The game is so emersive and intresting.The some maps have an arcade theme, others feel like a swamp, and some feel normal.Recoil is hard to understand at first, but basically you have to tap fire.  New rifle makes it easier for long range fights, while the standard weapon shoots like a close range SMG.			"

								In it's current state, I DO NOT reccommend this game. However, based on what the devolpers have planned and how frequently the updates are coming along I think it will be a good game in the long run. Let's get to the Pro's and Con's of the game so far. {I PLAN TO UPDATE IT}===PRO===1. The game looks great and runs great, even on some of the lowest settings. The enviroment changes really do add to the combat experience.2. Immersion. The devolpers have been trying to make this game really immersive, and they really have. The rain on the helmet, the ambient sounds, everything about the immersion is great. Once the Oculus Rift support for this game arrives, this will be a MUST-OWN for anyone with an Oculus Rift3. Planned features. This may not seem like a real Pro, but the features the developers want to add sound great. Land Sharks, need I say more? ===CON===1. Only one gun. Gets very boring using the same gun (THOUGH IT IS IN ALPHA, AN EARLY ALPHA). No sidearms, no melee, just your one SMG.2. No hit markers, and the gun feels like it does no damage. Kinda feels like shooting at ghosts until they fall over.3. Only 2 gamemodes (yet again, it's early alpha) Free For All (feels like CoD with one gun) and Team Domination. Team Domination is great mode because it forces teams to work together to hold areas. Sometimes however...4. TEAM KILLING! Your team mates are only marked with little blue lights. Sometimes it can be hard to see if someones on your team, exspecially if they open fire on you.Not gonna rant on how there's no melee or crouching yet in the game, because, once more, it's EARLY ALPHA!In short, Interstellar Marines in it's current state isn't great, but hopefully in a few months it will be well worth the $15.

Early Access Review
								How do I think of interstellar marines?This is a good game. That is the easiest way to put it. You get into two team into a battlefield/arena. And similar to counterstrike you have one life. The exception to this one life rule is you can respawn in 200+ seconds or capture a point. The round is usually over in two minutes (with the exception of games that go backwards and forwards) so the only way to really give you team an advantage is to capture the points.What else is great about this game?One of my favourite things about it in the day/night cycles and lighting. Most maps outside have a day and night cycle which changes how you have to play. It's to dark to see anything so you have to use a flashlight but the enemy can pinpoint where you are from the flashlight. You have to play stealthily other wise it's gameover. This goes the same for lazer pointers in daytime. Indoor maps usually have three modes. The light are on normally, There is a red alarm or there are no lights. I find these all brilliant features which change the way you play every now and then.And extra thing that i like about this game!Well the fact the developers put the time and effort into letting you be able to take your mask off is amazing. It is a little feature but it is great fun when a couple of friends and i jump into an empty lobby and take your mask off. It has given us a few laughs like *friendly Fire* and *lucky shots* This game just keeps me coming back for more.The minor thing about this game is the population of it. You will occasionally find a full lobby and a couble of half lobbies but the rest of it is dead. The main reason for that is probably early access and I hope the population grows.(I probably missed some stuff out in this review.. I apologize)In the end I give this game a 9/10 It is great fun. especially with friends!			"

								Now you might be thinking to yourself, how can you give this game a positive review already?For many reasons- I had always kept myself on check looking around EVERY corner that i passed.- Had to actually stay with other squad mates to finish the objectives.- Great intro to the game, it just throws you in for your first life. (It is a lot better than it sounds)- Great Co-op experience.- Also, what AAA developers are missing way too much of, seeing your own feet- Sounds are great, but a bit more ambience to levels would be niceThere are a few things that i want added to the game, few of which I am pretty sure that are going to be added to the first place.- Leaning- More weapons and possibly loadout menu- Melee attack of some sort- An actual tutorial (right now it only takes you to a youtube playlist)- More control customizations (Non-Toggle Sprint, one click ADS on/off, hold down click ADS on/off instead of bieng both on at once)- PVP Multiplayer ( I know this is Co-Op but this would be a nice addon to the game, i can see it compete against Insurgency's Multiplayer)- More graphics options- A larger penalty for players for team killingAlthough at the current state (Beta 1.6) this game seems more promising than DAYZ right now. And for this being a Unity game, this looks and feels really nice! I am looking forward towards seeing what else this developing company has to offer!			"

								All i can say is BUY THIS the game has a great team of devs who care about their game It looks fantastic plays great and has a fantastic community. This game deserves more players than it has and before reading all the negative reviews notice how most of them are from the release when the devs were getting their footing down so updates werent as frequent now upadates come almost monthly and each one brings a slew of new content and fixes that make the game even more enjoyable. The shooting is great the controls easy to learn and the graphics amazing (that lighting is garunteed to make you have a nerdgasm) One of the best features in my opinion is the enviorment changes constantly throughout a match it could go from high visibility daytime where you feel safer but more exposed to night where you constantly fear that an enemy will sneak up on you and only do short burst of your flashlight so as not to give away your position			"

If you are interested, here is a pro's and con's list.Pro's:- Beautiful graphics- Beautiful sounds- Has ""Realistic mode"", which means you can die super quickly and have to be really stealthy to complete a level.- The 3 guns are cool- There is multiplayerCon's:- Menu is horrible. It is ugly and takes time to figure out.- The only enemies that exist are robots- The game is empty, if you play multiplayer, there are only 5 people online.- There is only co-op- People on multiplayer always play on Realistic mode, which means you will never finish the level- The players look like fat Half-Life 2 elite combines- It is always night. (not entirely sure about this one, as there are map screen shots that show day, but have never seen it.)Hope this review helps!			"

								Can't play the game.The fire button on the mouse doesn't work if there is a gamepad connected.  I use combination of mouse and gamepad when playing.  What good is an FPS can if you can't fire.  Developer has known about this game breaking bug for almost a year now and it has not been fixed.I've played hundreds of games on Steam using combination of mouse and gamepad.  Strange or not, this is how I play games and it's impossible to play the game this way because the game is disabling the mouse when a gamepad is detected (even when I select the option in the game to ignore the gamepad).Given that this game was released for early access back in the July 2013, the game is an epic fail in my mind.  You would have thought that a bug that makes you unable to fire would have gotten more attention from the developer.			"

								This is a truly good game.  This is an alpah review as of 09/06/2014 so things will change.  It feels, and I dare say this, like a futuristic cs:source.  The weapons take presicion to handle and it doesn't take more than a couple of well placed rounds to take you out.  The respawn time is punishing, it varies based on how well your team is doing and sometimes you might just have to wait out the round.  The graphics aren't anything crazy, but they look pretty good.  The weather, rain and wind, are amazing!  So are the sounds!  The darkness of the levels is really fun too.  It teaches you to pay attention to where you move.  This game is good.  I hope that it does leave alpha stage and makes some good money because it has so many cool ideas that haven't really been done before.			"

								Quite frankly, I first bought this game after following the updates and I wanted to play it because it added something new to the genre. I played it for a bit with my mate, after getting the spearhead edition for cheap and two keys, we only played multiplayer and was fun for a while. After an hour I got a bit bored becuase it was very slow paced considering the amount of players (4). But with these new updates, I have to say, it might be the best horror experience I've played. It's not intended to be a horror, at least I don't think so, but may I say this game is incredible for that. Playing the neurogen experience for the first time with my friend, we we're both shaking by the end and loved absolutely every second. Hearing a robot in the next room means any loud actions and you're done. The robots spriting at you is incredibly tense and makes me too scared to go around the next corner!!!For a fantastic tactical FPS game with a group of friends, a singleplayer horror experience or a visceral co-op game to hear your friends scream over skype, this game is perfect for you.9/10			"

								This is a great game. I'll admit, it's a bit of a rip-off now (they've increase the price by $2 after adding three story missions, 2 new guns, a bunch of other missions and a few new maps) but with the freatures their promising they're basically giving it to you for free. You all have a SMG, Assualt Rifle and Pistol (that looks like some sort of sub-rifle?) with a reflex sight, laser and torch so everything is fairly balanced. The devs are doing really well they have a great community full of people that can help you and make your expeirience as fun as possible although they are very, very, very, very... slow. The single player/co-op that they've added needs some work aswell, it's very shallow and simple. The missions are basically, go to place, kill robots, go to place, kill robots etc. . Some are literally elmination with just robots for you to kill and if your serious about playing this game (as in CSGO mindset serious) they'd be good for practicing on but they're kinda boring. The mulitplayer is whats worth playing. Since there isn't that many people if your not on at peak times you don't play at all and if you have a bad computer/internet you are stuffed. Peak times include: 8:00am -> 12:00am and midnight in Australian time. This is just from my experience and people tend to play more on weekends aswell. Another thing is that I noticed people raged about how defensive the devs are and while I'm guessing their right in my experience (which isn't a terrible amount) the devs have been great. Honestly some of the best indie/early access devs I've worked with excluding big companies (e.g. valve).

								This game is pretty fun but I do not think it is worth your money. If you are interested, here is a pro's and con's list.Pro's:- Beautiful graphics- Beautiful sounds- Has ""Realistic mode"", which means you can die super quickly and have to be really stealthy to complete a level.- The 3 guns are cool- There is multiplayerCon's:- Menu is horrible. It is ugly and takes time to figure out.- The only enemies that exist are robots- The game is empty, if you play multiplayer, there are only 5 people online.- There is only co-op- People on multiplayer always play on Realistic mode, which means you will never finish the level- The players look like fat Half-Life 2 elite combines- It is always night. (not entirely sure about this one, as there are map screen shots that show day, but have never seen it.)Hope this review helps!			"

								Can't play the game.The fire button on the mouse doesn't work if there is a gamepad connected.  I use combination of mouse and gamepad when playing.  What good is an FPS can if you can't fire.  Developer has known about this game breaking bug for almost a year now and it has not been fixed.I've played hundreds of games on Steam using combination of mouse and gamepad.  Strange or not, this is how I play games and it's impossible to play the game this way because the game is disabling the mouse when a gamepad is detected (even when I select the option in the game to ignore the gamepad).Given that this game was released for early access back in the July 2013, the game is an epic fail in my mind.  You would have thought that a bug that makes you unable to fire would have gotten more attention from the developer.			"

The only game i have ever seen able to make the unity engine feel smooth is dead trigger 2 for the ios.			"

								This game delivers one of the most best ""tactical"" feeling coop experiences out of all the fps game I have played. Sadly the game is on its knees right now and the devs are looking for investors right now to support their game. The shooting feels nice and the atmosphere and locations you are put into are great. It's just that the updates come at a very slow pace and they need to focus more on the coop part of the game not the pvp. There aren't may lvls and the game may keep you entertained up to a few hours. But those hours are amazing indeed. (For me) I'm very sad that this game is on its knees and I'd hate to see this game wither away like this. Is it worth $9.99 ? Yes , and play it with friends but beware that you might only get 10 hrs of play time out of this game. I hope this game gets a full release.			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is a early access game which only has limited multiplayer modes and maps. But it presents what they have in a way that makes it fantastic. The game is going to add a co-op campaign which is bringing inspiration from System Shock. The multiplayer is extremely different to Call of Duty and Battlefield which makes it already a great game. There is lots of recoil and cool tiny things like ligting up your masks for no reason at all. The developers have made it so you can see the outline of the mask over your face. Tiny things like this make the game realistic and makes you feel like you are a marine. There is only one gun which is a assult gun which you can play with at this current time of writing. I hope they add new guns soon to add to the experience. The graphics look amazing for an indie title. Sun glair reflects on your visor aadding to the experience. I would also like to note that Interstellar Marines is harder then it looks. It is extremely hard to kill people and there is a lot of recoil. I would recommend this game to anyone which wants a challenge or is a sci-fi fan such as myself (reminds my of aliens).7.5/10			"

								Interstellar Marines IS what Skill Based FPS should be. No random spray and pray or full burst of entire magazines like in Buggerfield or Call of Copypaste, where even blind noobs can frag.If you can't control recoil and know how to shoot / aim, you will never frag anyone even at 1m of distance.Netcode and Hitboxes are great, 1 shot 1 kill if you go for the headshot, damage similar to other games like Insurgency or Red Orchestra.Dynamics maps ( with fog, pitch black, sun, rain, emergency alarms only and much more weather stuff ) , stealth and tactical gameplay, no crosshair, minimal Hud with the essential you need, Marines Suits that can let you without sound or hud / no team mates indicator if you get hit harder in critical points, co-op and single player and more to come !This game is Higly reccomended to Hardcore gamers / players that love those kind of games, casuals can use the exit door right there and go back to cod or other sellout crap games with bad netcode, balances and stuff.You can♥♥♥♥♥♥in your pants too when Pitch Black turns in !

Early Access Review
								To make it short, just read this review as it's basically how I feel about this game: http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipolar_bear/recommended/236370/I don't know what this game wants to be, nor I care to follow its history and the current discussions as I don't care much about early-access stuff, but I can give you some short details about my own, short, experience with it.To descript it visually, just take the first F.E.A.R., worsen visual quality by reducing models polygon count, quantity and quality of textures, and take out most of its special effects except shadowing. Now reduce framerate by at least 75% and you pretty much have a good idea of how this game looks like.I'm not kidding. I don't know what engine this game uses and how, but even reducing graphics quality to the minimum gives me only like 5fps more than max settings, and I can play any game here, usually at max detail with 16xAF and 4x AA.It's not unplayable but the performance/detail ratio is just terrible right now, so consider that if your system is not very powerful.(EDIT: ok I just checked the game's directory and the game is using Unity. That explains the terrible performance and will also give you a good insight of what you can expect from this game in the future: a lot of troubles.)The game starts with a tutorial. It all goes well though it's pretty tedious, but I've seen worse. The real problem starts with the campaign. I'm not really into tactical shooters and I don't even see anything that tactical in this game, I just know that there's no save button that I can find and the enemy can take you down in just 2 shots, and that happens more often than just taking 1 single shot. With that I mean that you often die by what seem to be just a single bullet but I learned that it's actually 2 shots in rapid succession: the first takes out your armor completely (it will auto regenerate after a lot of seconds) and the second will kill you.Ok I'm probably too much into Rambo-style games, where you just rush into packs of enemies at once, but that's just silly. I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it weren't for that, but after dying a couple times I decided it was time to move on and try the coop.I don't like versus games, so I just wanted to test the coop mode. Despite of me choosing coop from the menu, I was presented by a big server list of on-going games, which keeps updating making it hard to pick the one you need (at least if you sort them by ping, as I usually do). It becomes a FPS game into a FPS game to aim and shoot the join button of the right server you want to join in less than a second, but I'm sure that situation will get better after the free week.The real problem is that this list also had versus games, which I accidentally joined. I then realized my mistake (I was attracted by the high player count), got killed in the usual 2-shots-that-looked-like-1 and then left it.I then joined a real coop game and the situation didn't get better, but actually worse.People kept joining and then leaving after 10 minutes of going around pointlessly, looking for whatever the game wanted us to look for, with no sight of enemies, unpickable cards (they were maybe audiologs but I don't know, they just looked like keycards to me), closed doors and out-of-map fun, but yeah, that gets old soon.I tried a couple more games but one ended seconds after I joined, with the usual mass player leave after it, and the other had a mass leave before it ended, so I was left alone with not much to do.It all looks very early, very simple, already seen, bland.I'm not sure for how long the developers has been working on this, but considering what I saw, the road ahead is very long still. So long that it looks almost endless considering how much work this game seem to need before becoming interesting, at least for me.From my very little experience, it seem that the only thing this game has to offer right now is a versus mode that seem to work, though I didn't really look so much into it because of the reasons above.Not my kind of game right now, but I hope one day it'll get finished, and then I'll happily take another look at it.

								First Impressions:""Interstellar Marines"" is very easy to pick up and play.  The ""playground"" maps are very well done, though only one (possibly a few others as I haven't tried them all) feature AI bots.  The single player campaign will task you with getting from Point A to Point B and so on, though a map or some sort of directional guide would have been helpful as I got lost often.  There aren't many enemy types either and the ones I did see had a ""Final Rush"" feel about them (generic robots).  That aside, this is a great first start!

There are nearly no players online, but in the evening there is at least one ""full"" server. ;)If everything with the development goes right, this might be the next BIG shooter.I would totaly like to see it happening.If you want to see it happening too, help the developers by buing this!It will be worth it ;D			"

								ok so the first few times i couldnt even get into a server, every single one full. I was patient and finally got to play tonight. I am extremely happy with the enviromental effects, the sun rising and setting. Night and day. Adds an entirely new aspect to a first person shooter, that I very much enjoyed. Also, I do hope more weapons will come, but please keep a game mode with all assault rifles :D It's fun when every player is exactly matched with weapons and armor. A few more detailes, such as textures, would be nice, but i am already very happy to have tried this game out! keep up the good work!and pleeeeeease, at least one game mode with assault rifles only!

								Interstellar Marines IS what Skill Based FPS should be. No random spray and pray or full burst of entire magazines like in Buggerfield or Call of Copypaste, where even blind noobs can frag.If you can't control recoil and know how to shoot / aim, you will never frag anyone even at 1m of distance.Netcode and Hitboxes are great, 1 shot 1 kill if you go for the headshot, damage similar to other games like Insurgency or Red Orchestra.Dynamics maps ( with fog, pitch black, sun, rain, emergency alarms only and much more weather stuff ) , stealth and tactical gameplay, no crosshair, minimal Hud with the essential you need, Marines Suits that can let you without sound or hud / no team mates indicator if you get hit harder in critical points, co-op and single player and more to come !This game is Higly reccomended to Hardcore gamers / players that love those kind of games, casuals can use the exit door right there and go back to cod or other sellout crap games with bad netcode, balances and stuff.You can♥♥♥♥♥♥in your pants too when Pitch Black turns in !

								I hate to have to put this Review as Negative, But as much as I see potential in the game and I personally enjoy it. It has to be set as negative for this one simple reason...There's two servers for each region currently for the co-op game, so no matter how cheap the game goes during a sale, no matter how many of your friends want to play it. There is absolutely no guarantee you'll be able to play it. Since you're literally in a queue refreshing the server browser waiting for people to finish their session and go offline.Game is fun, I enjoy it, It sucks there's only one developer currently working on the game. But as much as I feel sorry for the project and the creators of the game, it sucks that there's no way of hosting lobbies yet.			"

Early Access Review
								I did not put many hours (yet), but still, here comes my review.Facts:SP/MP first person shooter.Long times between updates. Some says, game is in developer hell.Well, i quite disagree. Yes, update rate is very slow, but when they deliver content, it's rock solid and stable.I admitt ,i did not followed every single update, but when i come back from time to time, there are ALWAYS improvements and something new.I rather give them time and enjoy game than to be excited about 3 updates in month and find out, subsequent updates just fix what previous updates broke.AAA games might envy. For example, BF4 bad start and updates two steps up, one back.Personal experience.Now it's great game.What i like is constantly changing environment and weather. Very refreshing. Stands out from other online fps.Fun fact:Some years ago i was frustrated with team balance and did some teamkill(s). Nothing big but not innocent. Six month later when new update arrived i found, i got banned from MP.(hehe)Contacted devs, explained, apologized and got unban.Conclusion: Devs are normal people.Devs actually care for community of their game.Be good guy, and dont TK. :)One thing: Even now, when there is a lot of single player content, i recently found a nice feature: in game press F1, online chat will open and you can invite other atm online players to match. :)Many times in past i wanted to play, but when i checked MP maps, no one was there. :/ So we DO have option to gather players :)No player dedicated servers = one authority = no badmins (u keep killing me all time i ban u from my celeron attic server) = no playerbase splitSingle player missions -> great!Intense hunting (or being hunted?)Outnumbered but not outpalyed :)Cheaters? I dont think i met one.Cons:Maybe it's me, but to my taste there are a lot of places where you get temporaly blocked when moving.Like you want to go upstairs and you approach like  in 99% of other online fps games but boom, you stuck and you just HAVE TO move that 10cm more to continue your walk. I would be happy if characters have freedom(style) of moving like in CoD2(2005) or Quake. I'm not talking about speed, i talk about that feeling of moving freedom. Here, when i'm moving i have to focus all time to not get stuck. That's biggest con to me. Make moving system more benevolent to environment?Ai in lower difficulties can get stuck in doors or railing.(didn't try highest difficulty yet)So better AI path finding is needed. Or don't improve them too much? Still 1 vs 38 terminators! Just kidding, i'm best under pressure :) Or you are behind some cube and your gun barrel goes up because it's realistic. FFS i want to be ready to shot 100% of time when i want to shot. This propably ain't gonna change.More palyers :)  Hey just use F1 and you get your match :) Faster updates? I don't know, game is in ok state now. IMO except movement style. I repeat, i don't have high number of hours.==========================Game was/is worth my time.			"

								This is still a bit crude (early access), but it has the beginnings of a great tactical shooter and it does get updated with a modicum of new content about once in a month. It already has a good amount of gamemodes, both co-op and versus. The gunplay is good and smooth and everything feels properly balanced even at the early-access stage. They've really put some effort into the details and the sci-fi athmosphere, which I have to like. Detracting is the lack of enemy, gun and gadget variety (most enemies are just the basic robotic dummies that either attack bare-handed or with guns, and you only have 2 guns at this point that you can equip with silencers and laser sights).One thing I didn't like is that there is no way to host your own dedicated server if you wanted to play with your friends for example. Thus you have little control over the multiplayer component (though you can join a game and set it to friends-only, but you still don't have much control over what maps or modes are being played). There are some glitches, such as revive not working always, and buggy enemy spawns and pathfinding, but they don't happen everytime.Still, it is showing a lot of promise. They update regularly and there is a playerbase in the multiplayer. I will try to keep posted on it and I hope that at some point we will be able to host our own games so we have some control over what we play.			"

								Interstellar Marines is WORTH the money. The gameplay is fantastic and despite from not being a finished game it feels super polished. Bugs? Well let's just say it's exactly the opposite of Day-Z Standalone.Graphics look modern and the game runs like a beast on my GTX970.It does has it's flaws. I really miss an easy way to stop random people from dropping in my Co-op games and a co-op hosted game would be A-MA-ZING.Lack of maps and missions is another point. It's early access ofcourse, but I'm reviewing the game ""as is"".Although I see A LOT of potential in this game, it is my understanding that the game currently only has one developer and some volunteers... For the price I say BUY IT. It's unfinished but nevertheless amazing to play! "

Posted: November 8, 2014
Early Access Review
								(Be aware this game is early alpha, and thus I'm reviewing my impressions on the game as of November 8, 2014.)Interstellar Marines is a Co-Op Tactical FPS. It pits you and 3 other teammates who are, you guess it, interstellar marines, against defective robots in a battle to survive to the end by means of elimination, escaping, or simply surviving. Or, you can also go against other players in a control point-style battle.This game actually has a good amount of realism and atmosphere which blend very well for a game like this. The game has a real dark atmosphere to it, feels genuinely creepy and lonely with only your friends by your side. The maps, for the most part, are like an abandoned and broken facility. Very dark, and your main light source would be flickering lights or your own flashlight. It really brings immersion into the game, which is very helpful. The animations of the marines too are very well done, especially in first person. You actually see your arms move as you look around, see your own feet, and so on. Small detail, but very welcome.Speaking of realism, that's one of the best parts of the game. Whenever you take damage, your hearing is impaired (which is important in this game), your HUD disappears until you heal, and team damage/killing is also real. The guns aren't all that powerful either, but that's a good thing. The robots you face are very powerful, and can down you in seconds. You only have two guns: One for short range, and one for long range. Neither have that much ammo in it's clip (Probably enough for 3-4 robots if you're accurate), or have amazing accuracy, so you need to be precise and careful; Spraying and gunning your way through just won't succeed.Teamwork is heavily emphasized here. It's only four of you, and because the robots are so powerful, you're likely to go down. The only way you can survive is if your teammates revive you in your 15 seconds of last breaths. The aforementioned guns are weak with only one person, so if hoards of robots come, you all need to use your ammo and shoot tactically.There's currently 5 game modes as of this review, and they all have nice variety to the game. Elimination is killing all the robots in the area, Escape is moving to the top of the facility while surviving from the bots, Survivial is activiating several objectives and then escaping (with robots.), and Stronghold is the PvP game mode, 2 teams trying to capture all points in the area. The other mode is a campaign mission, titled The Neurogen Incident. It appears to be story oriented, but I cannot currently play it as it crashes my game.All in all, Marines is an incredible team based tactical shooter, especially for being early access! And I would really recommend this to anybody who wants some good times with their friends, using teamwork to achieve the goal in a dark and desolate enviornment.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros:Very promising for an Alpha, one of the most polished I've seen in a while. The development process is made in to a 'storyline' it would seem, where the marines are currently doing a number of training scenarios. Future updates propose team based PvE combat against an unknown enemy as of yet(?) I haven't done that much digging in to exactly what is planned, but apparently it is the basis for the game. The PvP is fantastic, smooth and responsive. The level design is incredibly innovative and it will keep you interested throughout the entire round. Some levels will have the physical properties changed during stages of the round (doors/ramps being blocked or parts of the map moving up and down), and simulation of fire drills/power outages putting you in complete darkness and forcing you to change tactics.Cons:Server hosting issues where all across NA you will ping around 100 to the server, personally I ping 125-150 to every NA server despite this not being an issue anywhere else. This leads to a 1/4-1/2 second bullet delay, requiring you to lead moving targets slightly regardless of distance from you. This is also combined with a very small hit detection issue. Overall, the problem is minor for an Alpha considering it is the only apparent problem I've seen yet, and loving every second of the game otherwise.The game is worth $15.00, so it's absolutely worth it for you to grab it at 7.50 on one of the sales or even pick up the more expensive version and score a free copy for a friend + some exclusive titles for you being a founder.Get this game, help it to grow and become amazing!

								Surprisingly Good. Albeit a bit simple at the present moment only offering TDM/Domination type maps, it still offers a bit of mindless fun. The more players there are then the chances of this actually taking off might be good.			"

								A great game, even in its Alpha state. The game so far has fairly few mechanics like the basic shooting but it feels so smooth that I can believe that the future mechanics will be smooth and fun aswell. Fairly good graphics pretty great gameplay so far which is basically the only thing that matters. 8.5/10 in its alpha state.			"

								Even though I just recieved this game, I can already tell it will be great. This game is an epic mix of space and first person shooter, allowing you to feel like an Interstellar Marine while gunning down the enemy. After getting a hang of the controls and learning how to get the perfect shots in, you can really begin to appreciate just what went into this game. The graphics aren't the Battlefield 4 good, but they are pretty darn good, and add this in to the ever changing environment, (which is also amazing), and you get an enjoyable game not only from the firefights, but the visuals too.                                                                              Pros- Good graphics, enjoyable gameplay, and an epic feel.Cons- Still early access meaning that many features aren't available, like more multiplayer options, singleplayer, and a few bugs every now and again, and it could be smoothed out.Over all I think that this is a great game that you will have hours of fun in. A few things I would like to see in the final build are better movement, (feels kinda slow), also feels like the bullets travel slowly in CQB, but mostly just some smoothing and customizability options, which they are working on. All I can say if you are thinking about buying this is go ahead and buy it while it's on sale! It will only get more expensive as they finish it!			"

								There are a lot of people complaining about this game lacking certain features and polish, i guess they missed the early access part.  Yes, this game has a ways to go, but it is pre - beta, so all that to be expected. Just in the few months that I have been playing it, it has improved greatly. Also, the core multiplayer gameplay is quite good, and I am always looking forward to the next patch. So far, this is a fun game, and it deserves your support, especially at the discounted price!

								Interstellar Marines is WORTH the money. The gameplay is fantastic and despite from not being a finished game it feels super polished. Bugs? Well let's just say it's exactly the opposite of Day-Z Standalone.Graphics look modern and the game runs like a beast on my GTX970.It does has it's flaws. I really miss an easy way to stop random people from dropping in my Co-op games and a co-op hosted game would be A-MA-ZING.Lack of maps and missions is another point. It's early access ofcourse, but I'm reviewing the game ""as is"".Although I see A LOT of potential in this game, it is my understanding that the game currently only has one developer and some volunteers... For the price I say BUY IT. It's unfinished but nevertheless amazing to play! "

								Technically, it runs really well and the multiplayer can get downright creepy at night in a map where there is only one other player. I know it is a  work in progress. But the steam marketing really should say that it might be a solo playable game some day in the future. That tag that says ""Single Player"" means you'll just sit there. Or walk around. There won't be anything to do. Very disappointed in this aspect, although  rewatching the video I should have heard this caveate perhaps. Promising. Definitely not done.			"

								I pre-purchased this game almost two years ago due to the amazing attention to detail and new qualities (read: technologies) not before seen in an FPS game, that ZeroPoint software were bringing to the scene. I won't talk too much about this pre-release game, but I will say that I was a huge fan of games like Aliens versus Predator and F.E.A.R., and this game is looking like it's shaping up to be another left field favourite of mine.Do note however that this game is very much early-access. There is only one gun, and the recoil doesn't even seem completely implemented. This is purely a tech demo at the time of writing, July 2013. I will rewrite this recommendation as the game is updated.			"

INTERSTELLAR MARINES: MINI REVIEW AND FIRST IMPRESSIONSThis game.. This game is something new. I've only scratched the surface on what's to come, but here's my minor review, good, bad and would it be worth getting? THE GOOD:Is heavily reliant on hyper-realism, and does a good job with audio and over-all feel with the game.Great graphics, and doesn't take much HDD space (Max 2GB, base game is only 1GB).Neatly optimized.Great community against new players.Solo-campaign.PvP is engaging in innovative strategizing methods. The floors move, the lights go out, anything can happen.PvP is heavily teamwork reliant to win a match.PvE is still buggy, but relies on thinking about what way you want to approach your objectives. Go all-out brute or stealth-only? You, and your team's choice, really. THE BAD:Could use more maps.Could use more game-modes for both PvE and PvP, especially PvP suffers from the same game-mode, although fun as it is.Trolls (by teamkilling and trashtalking in chat), although not that many, really, could be combatted by votekicking.Could use more weapons. (Although I know that it will eventually be implemented soon.) THE VERDICT:9/10, Would buy.As the game is still in early stages, I will still hold my finger on the trigger and keep an eye on this title.Still much to be implemented, still much to discuss. "

								Currently early access beta, Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS that is beautiful, balanced, screaming potential, squirting loads of fun, innovative, a catching story, and waiting hundreds of hours of gameplay. With it being in beta it has many surprises to come. I.M. is something that will tickle your fancy if you were ever into the Halo: Combat Evolved and/or Counter-Strike scene. The multiplayer gameplay is dynamic, fast paced, fun, and strongly teamwork oriented. While playing not only are you presented with hostile forces like sharks walking on land lunging at you, but you have to adapt to environmental conditions, as well. While it is raining water will bead up on your helmet's visor hindering your sight some, you can open your helmet like the bill of a ball cap to improve your vision. Opening your visor will also help improve vision while taking damage, however, your visor will display information. There may be other uses for the visor to come as the updates are released like enviornmental hazards. Know your situation and prepare! It's a fantastic game and I'd like to see more people playing!

								The game is nowhere near finished but that doesn't stop it being alot of fun. The levels are well designed and the models look good. There is a solid multiplayer experience already where you have to to capture and hold points on the map. The environmental effects really change the gameplay. Sometimes the level goes dark and you will need your flashlight to see properly, but you may not want to because that could expose your position to enemies. Similarly your gun has a laser that you can turn on and off, which helps you improve your aim but also can give away your position, as the laser is also visible to enemies. Had a blast playing this so far and I can't wait for more weapons and features to arrive. Funner than Counter-Strike (and i like counter-strike)For all you potential Australian buyers: yes there is a healthy Australian server. And of course servers in the US and EU.			"

Basicly its hard to spot what really distinguishes this game from alot of other fps, but w.e it is... it definetly works!Simple, pretty fluid movement and combat, alot of ""skill cap"" potential and imo good graphics. Another major point is the constant attention from devs and the possibility of it going competitive.anyway its a early access game and some stuff is obviously unpolished or not 100% yet. Campaign and single player is slow and not that good.  "

When closed player can track any necessary combat information, but when opened player can remove that pesky water effect in raining map and shiny light effect in return can not track any combat information.[+] I can see my legs, ahahahaha.[-] Spiky lag...[-] Current campaign feel bland... you spawned on kinda small map, got mission info from AI? to do this, do that, inform this and that.... thats it all? no cul cut-scene or event? you bye-cha... kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!Something to note :Misc :[] No game updates since March 2016.[] At May 2016 the dev announced about expanding to PS4 and XBox One... godamit, just complete the current PC version first![] If you lured by that cool shark-mutant enemy ... then, no, they are still not in the game.[] Only 2 missions for coop and campaign... +1 tutorial mission, but... for me it is puking boring... your only opponents is robot (the same puking model)... at first was ok but getting annoyed with the sounds fx...  [] Online coop mode, got 2 EU server and 4 US-West server, but... 0/4... dead (well atleast when I checked it per 17-11-2016)[] Online mp mode, few server and yeah 0/18... dead, same date as above.[] Online wargame mode, ... 1 server? but no info how many players inside? try to join, got only my name on the list, yeah dead.[] From last play (means long ago lol) Drop-in in coop will spawn from the first spawner.... kinda wasting time for looking other players ""guys! where are you?"" .... ""Timun Emas! arek ayu?!""[] There is sandbox (playing around in current sp and mp map alone) and challenges but ... well I buy and support this at first was for sp campaign and online coop.... so... meh.Weaponry :[] only 3 guns?, smg and 2 rifle?... with toggle-able silencer, laser sight.... tazer ammo type... errr thats all?Map level :[] Infiltration mission.... errr .... okay noone around, crouching tiger sloooowwly... krik... krikk... krikkkk.... MAOOOoooooooooo (robot sounds fx) .... blepblepblepblepblepblepblep (gun fires as my helmet system go down).... yeah its just I cant feel the vibe of being space marine doing infiltration mission...[] Retrieval mission.... same as above... godamit robot!

								Incurgency with robots + Big and empty maps. That's all this game has for now. And that's after 3 years of early access.+ Co-op missions. Pretty fun and even scary sometimes.+ Big and somewhat nice-looking maps in that ""wargames"" mode- The bigggest number of people I've seen online is 5, which means the game is not so popular, but you can play co-op.- Only 2 co-op missions- 1 gun (actually 3, but they feel the same and the only difference is scope)Worth picking up on sale if you have friends to play with (or if you like to try the same mission over and over for a few hours like I did).

								So far It is looking great...yeah my hours don't seem that much but i come on to updates time to time try them out and wait..It is worth the wait the looks of it because i really do enjoy the current missions they have implaced i'm so excited i can't wait to see the release version because the game is getting the atmosphere right and tense action of inflitrating the base even if they only just robots i love the level design so far i'm really impressed with the inflitrating the complex and fighting your way through to get keycards and such. Overall the game is feeling more polished with updates and i can't wait as i said before but saying that this is really looking positive. It's great to see the progress going somewhere in this game. All i can say is if you thinking about it you won't regret it.. just get your friends to join you in it i'm sure you'll enjoy it and be ready for what the finished game will throw at you..it is promising			"

								I got the spearhead (I think that's what it's called) when the game was on sale some time ago. I played it for a little bit just to see what it was like. It wasn't bad and I knew I was basically putting my money (while not a lot of it) into the game as an investment basically. I would have like to see more stuff added to the game in the time I bought it to when I played it again a few days ago but I have not really noticed anything new. I hope the game gets up and running. I would really like to see this game get off the ground.As a note. I am going to recommend this game but at your own risk. It is an early access game so there will always be the potential, like with any other early access that it might not take off. Let's all hope it does.			"

								Good game, still waiting on it to get out of the robots and onto the actual coop play vs aliens.  The robots were basically just fast things that hit you and you die.  Sometimes they have guns, which I find a touch easier to survive somehow.  Loads of potential, just need to get the ball rolling.  When that happens, I'll shout from the rooftops for all to join.Even with the slow development, this game is still leaps and bounds ahead of most the ""alpha"" messes that go full (*cough* Starforge ""never came out of alpha"").

								0_0 Interstellar Marines is intense!!! the first mission which is just a training mission basically where you learn controls and what not, sets up the story and puts you right into the action... If you want to call it that. The action is very subtle and when it happens it is scary intense. The causing factors are the anticipation, the ambiance, the narrator, the enemies intelligence, even the training mission captures all these!! Along the way to the first mission, the narrator gives you simple instructions and it is your job to get it done. What makes it scary is certain warnings she might give about the enemies and trust her, the robots will sneak up on you and kill you in game, but also in real life by giving you a heart attack!!Only having played the training and part of level two single player, I can tell this will be a perfect unintentional-horror, stealth, puzzle, first person shooter game when it is finished. Puzzle? you may ask. for each objective, there are many ways to achive this. Go stealthy or guns blazing, but don't forget to relode or you will die!! What a must have video game!!			"

								Is it done? no. Does it develope quickly? no. Apparently there's only one guy still actively developing it. But that doesnt matter. Look, right now its on sale for FIVE DOLLARS. Otherwise, it's only TEN. The game, finished or not, has more than enough gameplay in it already to justify the cost in the state that it is in now. Unfinished means nothing, it's just people whining in the review section. Value means something, not some superficial status. And this game has more than five dollars of value. Anything added is a bonus in my eyes. The game is incredibly atmospheric, terrifying at times when its you and one or two of your friends in a dimly lit spaceshit or station as you hear the loud metallic footsteps of unseen enemies, creep around the corners slowly and carefully, just to catch a bullet to the side of the face and jump out of your skin. this is a game for people who like atmosphere, plain and simple. if you want some epic action packed space marine game, dont bother, its not for you. its not intended for you. you wont enjoy.

Early Access Review
								I picked up this game early on in it's release. I was sold by the (seeming) progress that had been made when it went EA, The compelling dev interviews, the pretty strong stylised aesthetic and the promise of Rainbow 6/System Shock in space. It did not seem like a tall order at all. The concepts were there and the game already had a lot of cool ideas implemented. Put in the ideas, polish the rough edges and we would have had a winner. A few months later and it then seemed the devs wanted to turn it into a strong multi player focused game which was not what I wanted, but the devs said that they would build up the player base and use the MP to balance the game and tweak single player. Ok, sure.  The audience wanted to help the devs achieve that premise through feedback and support. This game generated a lot of hype and people trying to build a community they imagined would exist and grow like the Arma and Rainbow 6 crowds. Fanart and groups were created. A year later and I am fighting stupid cannon fodder super accurate robots with the same weak feeling weapons and it feels like a multi-player game with a tacked on single player rather than this amazing single player campaign we had been sold. Incredibly shoddy AI and zero noticable improvement. It was pure lip service paid to the original premise on which the game was pitched.Here we are another year later and it looks like the game is going to be dropped. There is practically no hope for a fraction of what was promised and the worst part was that it was not an insurmountable task. They had a neat framework to hang some great original gameplay and ideas and they did not even come close to trying to be as innovative as they originally seemed to intend. The game will go on that long list of black listed steam games that are remembered not for even being failures, but for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ behaviour and cowardice of the dev team. They did not fail because they never really tried. If it wasn't for games like Prison Architect, Satellite Reign and Nuclear Throne, I would never bother with EA. The only reason this game is still in my library is the fact the devs are teaming up with a publisher. In a year's time this review may be completely wrong and I get to eat my words with a big spoon. I doubt it, but I hope so.Edit: I just checked back in to see if there was any progress with the game. (There is not)I noticed that the price is about half what I paid. Now the general idea of some early access games is you pay less now so the devs have the capital to make the game. This rule is by no means applied across the board. But it's a kick to the teeth when when you paid twice as much for an early access game than people jumping on board now, knowing it's dead in the water. But then again, thats EA and half of nothing is still nothing. This game is dead. The devs should have the decency to announce it and bury it.			"

Early Access Review
								i have had this game since it has been out and the support is barely even there, if at all. For example, they started out with two guns; a assualt rifle and a marksman-like rifle. Fine. In the 3 years this has been out they added one gun. A dinky machine pistol. I feel bad because i bought this game formy friends as well and it has just been collecting dust in their library. We can't refund it because while we have definitley played less than 8 hours of the game, we have owned it for more than two weeks. This is the type of game that weakens people's belief in the early access concept. You get people excited by saying that this is a return to form for the FPS at a time where FPS games a getting stagnant, then you have a proof of concept by having a working build that shows promise, then do absolutely nothing substatial with it for 3 years except for multiplayer and a sparse campaign that explains nothing and has no cohesion as a narritive whatsoever. I saw something good in this game, but as of now and for the last 2 years, i cannot reccomend this game. No support, barely any content, and lacking alot of what was promised 3 years ago. Your money is well spent elsewhere. And be wary of early access. It's not all bad, but there are people out there willing to abuse the system; like making a promising game, getting a bunch of people to invest early thinking it will be something, then disappearing with all that money.

								I think it was pretty generic for a FPS and the only thing I thought it added to the genre was the ability to attach and detach suppressors on your assault rifle and SMG. The Coop was fine but nothing to keep my attention. Just robots that run at you in the dark. The multiplayer had nothing new was very limited in what you can do; you litterally only have 2 guns and do not get to customize anything. Not my cup of tea. I did like that it was realistic in how few bullets it takes to kill an enemy and how there isn't much of a HUD. However, it lacks a lot of content and isn't worth the asking price IMO. Tldr: It's got potential but not enough for the price. Best of luck, though.			"

								Want to sneak through dark buildings and shoot down armies of trigger happy (not to mention creepy) training robots? Join a handful of interstellar marines as they skirmish in intense fire fights against their own comrads? Or even travel across beautiful underground landscapes in search of loot, waiting to engage a fellow wandering marine around every corner? Sir, you have come to the right game. Interstellar Marines is one of the most emersive shooters you will find, anywhere. Sporting some outstanding gun mechanics, dynamic enviorments (by dynamic, I mean that sections of the maps actually shift and move), and a hunger game-like game mode... Underground! AS AN INTSTELLAR MARINE!!! Seriously, who doesn't want to be a special ops solder from the future!? Anyway, this is pretty much the only game I play now, and I highly suggest it. Double thumbs up.

								The original trailers, concepts, and promises of Interstellar Marines were a significantly better alternative to viagra for gamers who love realism and tactics. This alone made it a dream game, and the fact that it was paired with an interesting and unique setting with an emphasis on Co-op rather than deathmatch made it all the better.Unfortunately, after following this game for a very long time, most of those orignal promises have faded away. The only content that seems to be dropping pertains to multiplayer. I'll admit that Hell week is actually pretty fun, and that I don't mind it, but it's not what was originally promised for a game like this.Basically, purchasing the base game isn't a bad idea if your interest is piqued after researching the game, but hold off on Spearhead until your confident that it's a worthy investment.

								Very impressed for an early access. I've had it for a while, and, though I haven't played it much, I really like it. I didn't get around to playing Neurogen Incident until today, and was quite satisfied. Borrows the feelings of solitude and the quietness in outer space from Dead Space, but instead of limb-slashing necromorphs, so far the only enemies are robots (though we're all waiting for the landshark!), with one kind that charges at you and beats you, and another wielding guns. While there is no goriness so far, the robots' eerie robotic screaming and oinking (sounds like it) make them quite creepy, especially when you hear them screaming right before charging at you out of nowhere! The lack of checkpoints and pausing can either add to the tension, or be an inconvenience, depending on how you want to look at it. Multiplayer is aight. The changing of lighting/artificial weather are cool, but don't make up for the flatness of TDM. Once again, this is just an early access, and judging by how updates have been going, this game will become freaking amazing. I'd definitely recommend buying, even at its current early stages.			"

								first off the idea of this game was amazing .But at the end of the day, your looking at a game that will stay in early access to the end of days, or be cut down in to a ok multiplayer fps . There budget seems to small to do what they want . the game itsself (at the time of typing this)has only two weapons which are similar , a  auto high range futuristic rifle and a close range one. there are bots but they have an impossable difficulty level. the server selction list is small but not that many people play on them so you dont need to worry about not geting in to a game, the server list has multiple u.s ,eruo and australian servers but mostly you will be playing on the eruo servers becasue the others are empty. i dont want to talk about the other aspects of the game, becasue its still early access. but i feel like the developers have abused early access to fund the game they want to make.I dont think they have the people or knowledge to create the game they want.

								This is one of those cases of Early Access gone bad. This game had potential and could have been something decent. Not amazing, but decent. The developers have not kept up their end of the bargain and the updates have dried up completely. It's a shame, but that is the risk you take when you back an early access title.			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is a highly ambitious tactical FPS, promising a unique co-op experience with roleplaying and nonlinear gameplay. According to the developers, the game is heavily influenced by the likes of Half Life, System Shock 2 and Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield and will have a heavy focus on realistic science fiction. Interstellar Marines has been in ongoing development for a very long time and the team have been subjected to quite a few complications. Zero Point Software has had to overcome some obstacles along the way, such as having to change game engine mid-development, filing for bankruptcy, as well as failing to reach their Kickstarter Campaign goal of $600,000.At the time of the publication of this review, Interstellar Marines is in Steam Early Access and is expecting full release in late 2014. The game currently consists only of a multiplayer component, featuring the 'Team Domination' game mode, where the objective is to capture and hold areas within the map to gain points. All of the maps in the game feature a dynamic environment with changing lightning and weather conditions. This is for me the only real differentiator between Interstellar Marines and other FPS games at the moment. The dynamic environment force players to change their play style multiple times throughout the match. One moment, the map might be well lit and players will sprint to the objectives playing very offensively, until suddenly, the map goes completely dark and people will move slowly around using their flashlight sparsely to avoid detection. These sudden changes in player mentality really helps the game in terms of its tactical focus.While Interstellar Marines' tactical aspect is quite impressive, it still has some fairly major shortcomings. Firstly, the game has yet to receive basic FPS functionality such as crouching and proper sprinting which is kind of odd, considering its long development. The shooting and overall gameplay is extremely barebones and not very satisfying. The assets of the game are fairly limited, and many of the maps are littered with big identical boxes at every corner. Lastly, the game has a very lackluster options menu, with barely any settings at all. Brightness and gamma sliders are not available at current time, which unfortunately for me means that under medium-low light situations my monitor looks absolutely horrible. This might just be a problem I am having, but settings like these should be fairly standard anyway.All of this can of course be improved as time goes on, considering it's still in Early Access, but I do have my worries as the game is expected to release later this year. The game seems like it's been stuck in progress in the 1,5 years I've been following it, which honestly make me speculate if this game is vaporware. ZP Software is currently promising a fully fletched story campaign with up to 4 player co-op, roleplaying elements, an open game world, and a customizable arsenal. As you might see, this is a lot of content, of which none exist as of yet. Taking into account that Zero Point Software are a very small development team, it is quite hard to figure out just exactly how they will manage to put out so much content in just under a year.Whether my speculations are unfound, and the game will end up getting a successful release or not, is up to Zero Point Software. But as it stands, I do have my doubts and will therefore recommend waiting for the game to receive more content before buying into it. "

								The map loads as my visor slides down over my face and I attach a silencer to my sub-machine gun, and then my rifle as the gates to hell unfold. I willingly step through them and am thrust into a dark enviornment with lethal robots. Fast foward 5 minutes, and I've killed 10 out of seemingly countless robots, although there are only 40. Enter Interstellar Marines, an amazingly intense shooter. These past few updates have made the game worth playing, because, beforehand, the multiplayer was often empty. But now, the single player levels are awesome to play. I highly recommend buying the four pack, as playing alone, nobody can hear you scream.			"

								So far, Interstellar Marines seems like a great game in the making, but the 15$ price seems like a bit much, since until today no one's been on the multiplayer servers, so it's just been finding all the cool little parts of the maps. With update 11 (which was released today and is probably the only reason someone's actually on the server.) They've bumped the price up to 18$, which I'm guessing is for the new gamemode. However, in its current state, I'm thinking more like 8$ would be a good price. However, if they don't bump up the price every once in a while, the creators will run out of funds to continue developing the game. It seems like they've got most of the basic mechanics down (Which so far are pretty good, just need to add the campaign/NPCs and maybe promote the multiplayer servers a bit more). So as long as it keeps updating (which seems promising) and the final product has the co-op campaign they promised, I'll feel that my money was well-spent. Keep it up, Zero Point Software, and good luck! :D			"

The game runs very smoothly and has awesome mechanics. A few shots to the body and you're done, or 1-2 (mainly 1) shots to the head, and you're out. The devs said the campaign and co-op aspects should be out later this year, and getting this game in pre-alpha is a must! You will get all updates, and more importantly, all DLC for the low low price of FREE! When this game is finished, I beleive it could be the #1 FPS on PC.

								I ♥♥♥♥ing love this ♥♥♥♥ing game.Graphics and Audio are excellent. A.I. can be improved on as sometimes they are blind to you.There is something wrong with the jump action. It just feels weird. Seems like you can only jump a couple of inches of the ground, however jumping on objects does not seem to be a problem.As a solo player I really enjoyed the SP mission. Even though I had to redo it 5 times to complete.Very surprised at two things. The small download and how little attention this game is getting.			"

								This game is tension at it's finest. When the maps go comepletely dark its impossible to see unless you have a flashlight. But it gives you away just like the laser pointer. This game puts CoD to shame. 10.1/10 would scream upon opening a door and get shot at in the darkness again.			"

								It is a bit early to write a reveiw about this game, due to it being in Early Access. Still, for being in Early Access I think it's a great game to play! I feel the game excells when playing with other people online, due to the freakish way the game is played; in a good way. There are both pros and cons to this game, as I will list a few of them below.Pros:- Simpy frightful! You'll find as you play that you have no idea what to expect. Robots seem to come out of no where, which can really creap you out; and with little, it's hard to see them from a distance.- Almost realiztic! You notice quickly that there's no aiming assisant, which I think makes the game a lot more fun to play. There is a Red Dot Sight, as well scoping which will help you to aim.- Anothing amising thing which I enjoy is your amount of health! Every player has so little that 2 bullets, or melee attacks will kill you, making it seem a lot more relizticCons:- The option to paly survivle doesn't seem like survivle. The goal of survivle is to ""servive"" for as long as you can or for a certain amount of time. Here they have you complete objectives instead of surviving.Multiplayer is also a blast and fun to play. Just be careful, you only have one life!Interstellar Marines9/10Can't wait to see what else they add and fix to the game!  "

								you should assume every review for this game that says it's some kind of tactical classic tom clancy-esque shooter is paid for by the developers whose crowning achievement in 6 months is adding a really janky jump button. there is nothing tactical about this in its current state; it's pretty much indistinguishable from every garbage shooter out there, and judging by the years and years it's been in development it'll probably be that way forever. the weather stuff is cool tho good job			"

Hit detection is still a bit jittery with people lagging about slightly and while running you can run into walls.overall this game seems to be headed in the right direction, being a super fun atmospheric sci-fi game! and the bot survival mode, albeit easy at the moment is very nice!

								Actually, surprisingly, a very solid shooter with tight mechanics and very, very good optimisation.Only con would be not enough content or weapons right now, but if they make all the weapons feel as nice as the two they have, it will be amazing.Levels load in seconds for me... Literally, a few seconds. Constant framerate of 75 (even though one of my cards is dead right now thats on par with CS with two cards, and looks better) If the server has good ping, the shot recognition feels VERY good, theres no kill cam so I cant call ""BS"" on any kills but I didnt feel cheated at all (LIke i do in CSGO when i run around a corner but the 64tick server still thinks im out of cover, or my shots miss if i'm on the other end) Definitely worth keeping an eye on if not buying. At its sale price right now of 7 bucks, its a steal, full price at 20 bucks, good value even in its current state (Two weapons, but lots of maps and AI survival modes)I say this not because it shows promise, but because it has delivered. as of right now you have a tactical team-based shooter with some cool mechanics (Like respawning on a cap) some serious immersion, and great tactical shooter moments.... seeing how i got duped and paid $100 for the broken shooter that was battlefield 4, this is worth every penny			"

								Okay let me just say this game does what few games actually do. Scare me. Sure other games can give you a couple jumpscares but all the horror levels I have playedd are permadeath. No respawn. You learn to fear for your life in game more and more the farther you get. Your character is also not too tanky so a couple of hits and your deadI give this game and 8/10 currently as there are still some issues such as slightly buggy stairs and the Ai sometimes gets caught on small things. Overall though considering its still in alpha my expectations for this game is a 9.5-10/10 when all is said and done. Graphics are quite good. Another minor negitive is there are only 2 weapons both of which are auto fire. I may just have failed to discover how but if there were ways to change from auto to burst or semi firing on the rifle that would improve the gameplay significantly in my opinion.To rate my experience for this alpha though 10/10 would weep like a little girl in a corner again			"

								A good game overal with the gameplay, but when it comes down to the rest of teh game it can at times fall short.The game is somewhat based on a futureish time frame, so I would expect to see more tech than just a cool HUD and robots...What the game lacks in graphics it makes up for in diffictulty. When I started playing I expected it to be slightly harder than any other shooter (thus the MARINES in the name) but, I would have to say that the normal mode was a bit too ""hard"".I say ""hard"" because the game itself wasn't difficult, the robo-guards were just inacurate yet when they hit you you were basically dead. There were several occasions where I was simply walking around and a guard randomly saw me across the map and killed me in two hits. So overall I would recommend this game, it was a lot of fun, it just needs a little touching up and more futuristic gear (If that is the feel the developers are going for)			"

								Ok, first off, you die WAY too fast. Second off, people are idiots and never revive you. Third off, the tutorial is literally worthless.Movement seems incredibly clunky and stealth is a worthless mechanic in this game. Don't use it.Yeah, I've only played about an hour of the game, but if I can't move past one hour because of these glaring issues, we're going to need to have a heart to heart, you know?So, there's literally no explination to how the mechanics work. In every other FPS it's either so simple only an idiot wouldn't understand it, or there is an extentive, scaling campain which teaches you how to play the game.No no, in this game I have no idea how to do half the crap in it, and the missions are worthless wastes of time.Did I mention the control layout?Press shift to switch between 'jog' and 'walk' and hold shift to run. F is for flash light, which is understandable. G is for the laser, which is OK because there are no grenades.Did I mention there's also no mele? Yep, you have to spray n' pray at close range. Oh yeah, there's no reticle to help in that regard, either.Oh yeah, and there's no surround sound. Someone can be on the right of you, but the noise is coming out of both speakers. So have fun trying to pinpoint where people are based on sound.I understand this is a small dev team, but there needs to be some serious work put into this game before it's even worthy to be mentioned anywhere but here. On steam.I'll try to mention anything gamebreaking that I come across, but that seems to be the high point of this game....There are no bugs. For an early access game, this is practically bugless.My advice to the dev team? Bring this game over to Bethesda and have them produce the bulk content. Then you guys can make it bugless. It would literally be a perfect game with no issues that everyone would love no matter why they play the game.So, here's the TL;DR: It will need a lot of work in the gameplay, audio, and content department. This is a given for an early access game, and I'm not telling you to forget this game forever. I'm telling you to wait a while to see what happens.All in all? It feels like it's trying to imulate Payday 2 type stealth, but without any real knowldge how.On the ""This game has the potential to be awesome"" scale: 9/10On the ""Current rating of the game"" scale: 2/10INVEST WITH CARE.

								Well I've always liked the concept of this game, but seriously it's merely advertising.The devs haven't delivered most of what they are promising and the game is far from being fun, I can't play more than 15 minutes, I just can't bear how buggy and unstable it is.Firstly, I found there's a lack of servers, or people playing the game at all, so it makes it hard to achieve a decent enough multiplayer experiencia. The game lacks to provide any highlights as of why it'd be any different from the wide variety of FPS out there, for me it's just the same because the devs haven't added up half of what they have promised over the years.Maybe wait a couple years to purchase...

All we got are robots because its ""simple and easy"". There turn around from doing something unique and interesting. Just went to another generic semi-realistic shooter.But no lie, i bought the game all because there trying to make a realistic coop shooter with added survival elements by adding Land Shark Hybrids. It is a very scary creature to come across....but we have to deal with ""generic robots"" for now.Until they release content with the sharks and add real survival elements like they were going for...i wouldn't recommend it at this state.

								Backed this game before it was on steam. It was the first game I was truly excited for. But the focus on multiplayer has caused the decs to stray away from their original plans, which was a tactical and strategic singleplayer sci-fi shooter. don't get me wrong, multiplayer is a good thing, but if the primary focus was a singleplayer experience, the focus should not have been on multiplayer so much. Yes it's nice to have something to play, but more should have been turned towards the fundamentals of the game. The couple of missions available are a great teaser to see what this game could have been like, but after a couple playthroughs, they get old quick. I hope they find a publisher or an investor and make the game they wanted, but until then, there is not much point to playing this game. I wish I could say otherwise. I am truly disappointed.			"

								Don't waste your money on this. The idea of it is great, but it is still in like super alpha stages and there is literally no single player content besides running around on maps/sandbox(ish) maps. I've owned this almost since the original sale on steam and I've seen almost nothing change besides a function to open the helmet, an added laser, some hud functions, and polish work on the, so far, crappy multiplayer. I would recommend you don't buy this, at least until they come out with some actual content that is worth exploring.			"

								Backed this game before it was on steam. It was the first game I was truly excited for. But the focus on multiplayer has caused the decs to stray away from their original plans, which was a tactical and strategic singleplayer sci-fi shooter. don't get me wrong, multiplayer is a good thing, but if the primary focus was a singleplayer experience, the focus should not have been on multiplayer so much. Yes it's nice to have something to play, but more should have been turned towards the fundamentals of the game. The couple of missions available are a great teaser to see what this game could have been like, but after a couple playthroughs, they get old quick. I hope they find a publisher or an investor and make the game they wanted, but until then, there is not much point to playing this game. I wish I could say otherwise. I am truly disappointed.			"

								A few downfalls of this game:1. I don't really enjoy waiting to respawn for 105 seconds, kinda sucks.2. A lot of the controls are ♥♥♥♥y, for example jumping.3. A lack of gun variety (only 2 guns in total)4. Sometimes when you join a server it just seems to be broken entirely and nobody can spawn in at all.Because this game is in early access, I don't really mind the bugs that much and I am 99% sure that the develepors will fix most in the next update. The develepors have been working their asses off on this game and will continue to do so. I recommend this game, I myself am going to buy it after already putting a few hours into the free version that is available for a limited time. At the price it's going for you should grab it now before everyone else has it and you're the odd one out.			"

								Salty as all hell I put money into this, just another clear example why the Early Access program is abused. I feel sorry for anyone who put money into the Spearhead Edition when the Devs have pretty much made it clear that the game is not going to get finished at all. Its a shame, really, the game looked really good and their ideas I greatly enjoyed, the main idea they had I didn't agree with was taking the money and running, I guess.Oh well, fool me once.			"

								The game attempts to play like a sci-fi Rainbow Six. Only problem is, it doesn't. The game doesn't discourage tactics that you would never use in Rainbow Six, much less real combat, in fear of getting bullet stuffed. The result? People just walking around indiscriminately shooting with no fear of death or major wounds because the game not only doesn't take measures to discourage it, the game actively encourages it.			"

								BUY BUY BUY!!! This game, even in  the pre-alpha, is great. There is virtually no custmization, though the weapon, HUD, maps, enviroments, etc. are amazing. The game runs very smoothly and has awesome mechanics. A few shots to the body and you're done, or 1-2 (mainly 1) shots to the head, and you're out. The devs said the campaign and co-op aspects should be out later this year, and getting this game in pre-alpha is a must! You will get all updates, and more importantly, all DLC for the low low price of FREE! When this game is finished, I beleive it could be the #1 FPS on PC. If thats not incentive enough, I don't know what is.			"

								I absolutly loved Interstellar Marines before the Early Access Update #2 arrived.  Everything about the game was perfect!  Now, the game is in Update #8 and I don't like it anymore.  Most if not all the things I loved about the game have changed.  The game mechanics need a lot of work, (Aiming, gun shot recoil, taking damage).  The developers are too focused on aesthetics like being able to take off your mask or how the screen bobbles up and down as you walk or run.  I've experienced the game when it was fantastic, (before update #2) and when it wasn't so great, (after update #2).  The original gameplay of Interstellar Marines is what keeps me looking back at this game.  If it never becomes what it once was, I will not be playing this when it is released.  I will recommend this game (only if) the developers get it together and work on the basics. It was 5/5 stars but now it's 2/5 stars in my book.  I WANT MY INTERSTELLAR MARINES BACK :'(Now to change course a little bit, I do recommend going here http://www.interstellarmarines.com/ to see what the developers have in mind for the final stage of the game. This link will take you to their home page where you can play the game in a more accurate setting.  These games are web-browser based.			"

Early Access Review
								Personally, for an early access game, it's fairly engaging. However, pros and cons do exist here, and I do feel they should be addressed.Pros:1) GREAT atmosphere. Personally choosing which directions to go, what weapons to have out, and what to do seemed more than filled with it's fair share of tension on a solo mission. You know the enemy is dangerous, and taking it out quickly is essential as they can more than easily take you down with their bonzai-like charges or sudden gunfire in your direction. Even frightening at some parts for me, though not too much.2) Lovely graphics. Personally I was impressed with the graphics and how realistic they made everything seem.3) From my experience, the community is decent. The first time I ever played a multiplayer server, I actually got great people. They were friends, and we all used teamwork to get past difficult objectives. They were friendly to the new players and happy to lend out a hand.Cons:1) Lack of community. Out of a good number of 10-15 servers (Give or take a few), usually only 2-4 of these have players in them at any given time. Admittedly very annoying.2) Only two weapons? I was hoping for a bit more weapon diversity, as though the two weapons obviously serve different purposes, their usefulness in close quarters combat against these bonzai charging robots can be panic filled when they close in. Not too annoying when your comrades can simply press 'E' to instantly revive you, but when players are fairly close together, this can lead to disaster.3) Lag. Admittedly my computer is not exactly a gaming device that's beefed up or such. But even when attempting my best to lower graphics options (Which was also nearly useless) I felt that on larger maps my progress was slowed down to a nearly unplayable rate as my FPS dropped to an average of about 15. Bleh.Obviously not the perfect review, but if the lack of players doesn't turn you off and your computer is better than some windows 8 laptop, go ahead! This game is well worth the buy. "

I like it and can see it going far. Only things it needs is BOTS, a Campaign, melee damage and blood from bullet wounds. Oh and more guns :/ only the SMG so far. But the game is still in its beginning and gets updated with new stuff a lot. Just needs more players and more stuff I guess :/, otherwise its good.			"

								This game is amazing! If you like heart-pounding, chaotic firefights in the pitch black, a storm, or just a normal day then this game is for you. Keep in mind, this game is early access so not all its features are available yet but watching the game improve with every update is part of the fun.			"

								I see a lot of potential in this game. It is very early in the development, so there are some bugs. It has great sound effects and it sounds. But the texture is quite bland. There is only one weapon available and you cannot customize the weapon or your character. Personally while playing, the frames per second are low making it barely playable. I await future updates to fix these problems.			"

								If you like some old style games then this is it. The aiming is almost unneeded and you hav unlimited ammo. It's pretty much an old school shooter with great graphics. Also on that note theres only 1 active server that Ive experienced. It's good fun, but it needs a more active community or at least bring a group of friends with you and you will have a lot of fun.

								Actually, surprisingly, a very solid shooter with tight mechanics and very, very good optimisation.Only con would be not enough content or weapons right now, but if they make all the weapons feel as nice as the two they have, it will be amazing.Levels load in seconds for me... Literally, a few seconds. Constant framerate of 75 (even though one of my cards is dead right now thats on par with CS with two cards, and looks better) If the server has good ping, the shot recognition feels VERY good, theres no kill cam so I cant call ""BS"" on any kills but I didnt feel cheated at all (LIke i do in CSGO when i run around a corner but the 64tick server still thinks im out of cover, or my shots miss if i'm on the other end) Definitely worth keeping an eye on if not buying. At its sale price right now of 7 bucks, its a steal, full price at 20 bucks, good value even in its current state (Two weapons, but lots of maps and AI survival modes)I say this not because it shows promise, but because it has delivered. as of right now you have a tactical team-based shooter with some cool mechanics (Like respawning on a cap) some serious immersion, and great tactical shooter moments.... seeing how i got duped and paid $100 for the broken shooter that was battlefield 4, this is worth every penny			"

								Okay let me just say this game does what few games actually do. Scare me. Sure other games can give you a couple jumpscares but all the horror levels I have playedd are permadeath. No respawn. You learn to fear for your life in game more and more the farther you get. Your character is also not too tanky so a couple of hits and your deadI give this game and 8/10 currently as there are still some issues such as slightly buggy stairs and the Ai sometimes gets caught on small things. Overall though considering its still in alpha my expectations for this game is a 9.5-10/10 when all is said and done. Graphics are quite good. Another minor negitive is there are only 2 weapons both of which are auto fire. I may just have failed to discover how but if there were ways to change from auto to burst or semi firing on the rifle that would improve the gameplay significantly in my opinion.To rate my experience for this alpha though 10/10 would weep like a little girl in a corner again			"

								A good game overal with the gameplay, but when it comes down to the rest of teh game it can at times fall short.The game is somewhat based on a futureish time frame, so I would expect to see more tech than just a cool HUD and robots...What the game lacks in graphics it makes up for in diffictulty. When I started playing I expected it to be slightly harder than any other shooter (thus the MARINES in the name) but, I would have to say that the normal mode was a bit too ""hard"".I say ""hard"" because the game itself wasn't difficult, the robo-guards were just inacurate yet when they hit you you were basically dead. There were several occasions where I was simply walking around and a guard randomly saw me across the map and killed me in two hits. So overall I would recommend this game, it was a lot of fun, it just needs a little touching up and more futuristic gear (If that is the feel the developers are going for)			"

Going on seven hours of game play and haven't had a crash or incountered any actual bugs that have interfered significantly with game play. I find the graphics to be very good espeacilly when my very middle of the road PC can run it with all settings on max with what are good frame rates for my system. If development continues at its CURRENT pace I believe the potential is here to provide us with an excelent game. I am very much looking forward to the co-op game mode becoming part of the game. "

Once they get some more weapons, maps, and flesh out the animation a bit better it will really start to shine.

								It is a bit early to write a reveiw about this game, due to it being in Early Access. Still, for being in Early Access I think it's a great game to play! I feel the game excells when playing with other people online, due to the freakish way the game is played; in a good way. There are both pros and cons to this game, as I will list a few of them below.Pros:- Simpy frightful! You'll find as you play that you have no idea what to expect. Robots seem to come out of no where, which can really creap you out; and with little, it's hard to see them from a distance.- Almost realiztic! You notice quickly that there's no aiming assisant, which I think makes the game a lot more fun to play. There is a Red Dot Sight, as well scoping which will help you to aim.- Anothing amising thing which I enjoy is your amount of health! Every player has so little that 2 bullets, or melee attacks will kill you, making it seem a lot more relizticCons:- The option to paly survivle doesn't seem like survivle. The goal of survivle is to ""servive"" for as long as you can or for a certain amount of time. Here they have you complete objectives instead of surviving.Multiplayer is also a blast and fun to play. Just be careful, you only have one life!Interstellar Marines9/10Can't wait to see what else they add and fix to the game!  "

								Backed this game before it was on steam. It was the first game I was truly excited for. But the focus on multiplayer has caused the decs to stray away from their original plans, which was a tactical and strategic singleplayer sci-fi shooter. don't get me wrong, multiplayer is a good thing, but if the primary focus was a singleplayer experience, the focus should not have been on multiplayer so much. Yes it's nice to have something to play, but more should have been turned towards the fundamentals of the game. The couple of missions available are a great teaser to see what this game could have been like, but after a couple playthroughs, they get old quick. I hope they find a publisher or an investor and make the game they wanted, but until then, there is not much point to playing this game. I wish I could say otherwise. I am truly disappointed.			"

								I absolutly loved Interstellar Marines before the Early Access Update #2 arrived.  Everything about the game was perfect!  Now, the game is in Update #8 and I don't like it anymore.  Most if not all the things I loved about the game have changed.  The game mechanics need a lot of work, (Aiming, gun shot recoil, taking damage).  The developers are too focused on aesthetics like being able to take off your mask or how the screen bobbles up and down as you walk or run.  I've experienced the game when it was fantastic, (before update #2) and when it wasn't so great, (after update #2).  The original gameplay of Interstellar Marines is what keeps me looking back at this game.  If it never becomes what it once was, I will not be playing this when it is released.  I will recommend this game (only if) the developers get it together and work on the basics. It was 5/5 stars but now it's 2/5 stars in my book.  I WANT MY INTERSTELLAR MARINES BACK :'(Now to change course a little bit, I do recommend going here http://www.interstellarmarines.com/ to see what the developers have in mind for the final stage of the game. This link will take you to their home page where you can play the game in a more accurate setting.  These games are web-browser based.			"

								A very good start to a what seems to be a promising title--------------------------------The above review was made just shy of 3 years ago. And I still stand by the statement, ""A good start"". Because as of now, that’s all it seems to be. A start. This game has fallen into development hell. Even though there has been numerous updates to this game, they have been minor from a player stand point. Bugs were fixed. Maybe some textures were fixed. But as far as substantial, significant additions to the game, like new maps, new weapons, new game modes, new enemies.... not much has really happened. I follow them on Facebook, and they post the updates they are planning on. One update they had......they added a compass to the helmet HUD.....a compass....... This (small) addition did absolutely nothing to the gameplay. Another one, they gave the bots new skins. And added a CO2 meter. These are nice and dandy but very minor. Now look, I completely understand that this is a small development team. Im sure the guys are very talented in their skills. I know that they do not have a huge budget so things will take time. I completely understand that. But in all fairness, this game is just moving waaaaaay too slow. According to Wikipedia this game was announced in 2005! 2000 freaking 5!!!  And what has happened since then? From a consumer point of view, not much. Seriously. Where is this game?

			Interstellar Marines is a video game unlike any on the market. The designers at Zero Point Software are embarking on a revolutionary journey, changing how video games are designed.		

This game showed a lot of promise. As I stated nearly 3 years ago. I know the development team is facing many challenges such as funding. But in all honestly, from the minor updates to slow development, I think one of the issues is bad direction/management. I think they focused on the minor, non essential details of the game and spent waaaaay too much time on them. This game showed a lot of potential. It really did. Unfortuantely, this game will be uninstalled.			"

								Overall, it's an alright sci-fi FPS. The controls are fine, and the game dynamics are generally pretty great. One thing I didn't like was the lack of a objective reviewer or mini-map of somesort. When the next objective is relayed to you by voice, that is the only time you will be briefed on what you should do. If you failed to hear it, well, tough luck. You'll have to guess your way to the next objective. The different game modes are amusing enough. Elimination and coop provide extra entertainment and even the single player campaigns are worth playing through. The Neurogen episode is a particular favorite, as it incoroporates a certain horror element into the game. Everything is generally pitch black and you are left with just your torch to guide you through much of the game. But the best part is the psychotic androids which have gone berserk and are running around aimlessly throughout the corridors and rooms of the space ship. The sound effects help greatly, to instill a tiny sense of fear, mainly of the 'unknown'. The footsteps of the androids seem frantic at times and hearing them improved the atmosphere. When the androids see you they often run off to hide behind something and wait for you to come closer. Then they charge you with everything they have. It's great.			"

								Interstellar Marines is pre-alpha, it promises a lot and comes short so far (written on 11.02.2015 in case this review gets outdated)Positives? Movement is pretty solid, the two guns that are available feel pretty nice to use and it doesn't seem to be glitchy, floaty... It's immersive with what little variety it has.OH.The only real negative that stops the game completely is the fact that there's a LIMITED AMOUNT OF SERVERS and no way for you to setup a dedicated server as far as I know. If you want to do a full coop party of friends, you'll have to join a 3/4 server with reasonable ping, commit mutiny and ""force"" other players off the server. Oh, don't worry- that's the developer's fault for ""focusing on developing the game"" (from the forums) instead of making sure that people who bought the game can actually play it with other people.ENEMIES:The current enemies in the game are other players (multiplayer) and running robots that act like ""sneaky"" zombies or carry guns (co-op/singleplayer maps).DIFFICULTY:On lower than ""Hard"" difficulty, the game can feel a bit sloppy to be taken seriously. ""Realistic"" difficulty (maximum difficulty, above ""Hard"") makes enemy AI kill you in one or two hits, be it by gunshot or by a robosmack to the face.STEALTH?! I LOVE STEALTH!Eh. That's not really a thing, unless stealth to you is a ""suppressant"" that attracts half the robot population towards your location after you've killed one stray robot minding its own business. In multiplayer, there's a lot of maps with day/night cycles and weather effects that dirty your mask. You can actually take off the mask with H, but then all the HUD elements dissapear. This WOULD be very useful during rainy storms if you could tell your teammates from your enemies...OTHER THAN THAT: during the night in multiplayer, lights go on! Shoot them out! Stealth = darkness.I want to buy this game and I recommend it because it seems like a lot of fun. Just know that you probably won't get to coop with your friends since those servers are almost always occupied and that you need to go through the same painful process since servers have NO mapchange once you've exhausted the map 10 times in a row. I really hope they bring something interesting to this game later!			"

								The cooperative tactical gameplay is pretty cool, can't wait to see the System Shock role-playing and half life story-driven elements that the developer claims that this game has. I also can't wait for reasons to keep coming back to this game (outside of re-recording footage over codec problems):

								Promising but flawed. The weapon handling, maps and atmosphere are nice. Not nice is a 100 second respawn timer though. Pure boredom every time you are dead. Kills the gameflow. I guess the devs don't only want an old school shooter, but also want to repeat the mistakes of old.Speaking of repeating old mistakes, there does not seem to be a gamma slider... do the devs not know you can just adjust gamma anyway by using windowed mode and adjusting desktop gamma?

								Overall the game is quite alright, it's fun to play it can really bring out the competetive side in you which is always really nice.Sadly the teamkill system is really annoying, for example if you are shooting at someone and a team mate runs in front of you resulting in you killing them you won't be able to kill that enemy you where shooting at because you will do no damage for 15 seconds, and for some reason this 15 seconds cooldown of no damage doesn't work against team mates so you can kill your whole team at the start of a round but if a team mate runs infront of you as you're shooting an enemy then you're screwed cause you're not getting that kill.Also the spectate system when you die is really annoying as it force switches you to the next person and there is no way of stopping this so if you're playing with a few friends and you want to watch them after you die you can forget about it, sometimes it does this the second you swap back and sometimes you get to watch your team mate play for about 15-20 sec tops before it force switches you. And the most annoying part about that is the fact that it sometimes switches you to a random player not the one next in line so you're gonna have to cycle throught to find your friend or that one team mate you wanted to watch.Other then that there isn't much to complain about more then that they really should add more guns, some type of granades, nightvision goggles would help a lot and add some more maps, but it is still early access so I do think that all of that and more will come in time. So far the game is really cool tho and I'd say it can be worth the 17 euros the game will cost at full price.			"

								*sigh*... When i first saw this game. It was an interesting idea. It was going to be a hardcor, survival coop shooter but instead of facing the generic zombies...you face Shark Lion Hybrids. An the animation and short videos on them were terrifying. here are a few photos of this creature...http://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interstellar-marines.jpghttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/615022620957779120/A71661F7DE4D39900AB658446618FD15148B6646/But ever since its reveal, they havent done anything with adding content or info about the shark hybrids. All we got are robots because its ""simple and easy"". There turn around from doing something unique and interesting. Just went to another generic semi-realistic shooter.But no lie, i bought the game all because there trying to make a realistic coop shooter with added survival elements by adding Land Shark Hybrids. It is a very scary creature to come across....but we have to deal with ""generic robots"" for now.Until they release content with the sharks and add real survival elements like they were going for...i wouldn't recommend it at this state. Especially its September and these guys havent updated since May. "

AI is too hard, but I guess that'll improve our skills when against real players. Pacing is a bit slow, but in a good way. You get to observe your environment more carefully.  But since it is only an early-access, the developers seems to be very promising and a lot more content is bound.Overall, the game is a 8.5/10.Graphics: 7.9/10Gameplay: 8.9/10Enemy AI: 7.3/10Environment: 9/10CO-OP: 10/10 "

								Wow, this game is amazing. Awesome graphics and VERY realistic mechanics. This game makes things very difficult from the environment spontaniously changing from pitch black night to day (not the most realistic things) to your helmet getting fogged up because you've been sprinting (which you can fix by raising your mask). Now if you do buy this game keep in mind that at the moment there is only one gun and very few maps but this is also an early-access game so they are still adding things into the game. But the multi-player has very little lag and still manages to look increadable.			"

								Ok this is a re-do since the game has some changes one being customization; These can be aquired by completing pve missions, winning a pvp match(or just participating I don't play pvp much), and participating in the Hell Week Event. PVE is still weak due to a small map variety and mission types. PVP got some love but still playing the same five or six maps gets repetative but it's more skill based and promotes aiming more since no one has shields and a head shot is your best chance at getting a quick kill. Now weapon choice in this game is laughably small with there being a pistol, sub-machine gun, and assault rifle ready for use. Hopefully the developers get the money and backers to further develope the game			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game seems to be getting along quite well, however it is on extremely early access which is apparent with things such as a lack of crouching, or lowering of the weapon whilst sprinting etc. (I Imagine leaning will also add more to the game) means that the game feels relatively fast paced at this moment in time compared to how it will be later.Because of the early access nature of the game, it is quite possible that something may go wrong in future development. However, the initial game, or at least what we can see of it is fairly well developed, with immersion factors in the recent update 7 adding quite a lot too the game. For starters, it brings about a reconcilliation between standard ""Game"" factors, and immersion breakers. IE: Most games will use hit detection via a little ""X"" over the crosshair. Marines however, does this by placing a small square over the enemy bodypart that you hit and only appears if your HUD is active. (Your HUD is controlled by your helmet being up or down and armour health/HP. Too much damage will disable it). Which is not only a unique feature, but really makes you feel like its an immersive futuristic experience.In fact, I'd say one of the parts they've really nailed on this game is the immersive experience, the fact that when it rains and my visor is up, I get rain drops splatter onto my helmet, or the fact that I have to use my laser sight to hipfire efficiently. It just feels good, and for someone who is a lover of Milsim it makes the game far more valuable and memorable too me.This game so far has amazing potential, and I look forward to seeing how it gets along. That being said, I recommend you wait a short while before buying, what we have now is brilliant, but it is quite barebones and so the later product can change in a multitude of ways. However if the devs keep it up the way they are, then I whole heartedly recommend the purchase and if you feel like you have cash to splurge, and want to try it now then don't let me stop you! The devs have been active, and I have no reason to doubt them, its obvious they are working hard! Truthfully its been awhile since I've seen such a polished game in early access!			"

								It was originaly a single player game with land sharks, scifi, and a spooky setting. Right now we have a boring shoot robots co-op game. The enemys all look the same and gameplay is just so boring. It's probably never going to be finished and even if they do it will never be the interesting game promised to most people who own it. "

								I would not go as far as to say Interstellar Marines is one of a kind, its not, Everything it does has been done better before. However there simply are not enough slow paced stealth shooters out there to discount one like this. I like Interstellar Marines, I like the look, and I like the gameplay.  It does have a few issues though, at least for me.  I experienced a lot of lag even on the lowest ping multiplayer servers. and I also stuttered and lagged often even when my ping was only around 30 or 40. This only happened in multiplayer though and single player ran smoothly for me, even if it did quickly get boring.  There is not much content as it stands now. In my opinion now that the free week is going (2/12/15) the community may pick up a bit, giving the devs the boost they need to start working on the game more.  I have seen Interstellar Marines around for what seems like a long time, maybe even years and i was never interested in it until the free weekend. I am glad I got the chance to play it, even if it did not wow me enough for me to purchase it.   I still recommend it to you guys though, if you are looking for a good Early Access shooter, a Stealth based Shooter, or just for a shooter with an indie feel.			"

								Visually, Interstellar Marines is beautiful; blurring and lighting effects are gorgeous. The audio is great as well, with lots of environment sounds to listen to. I don't have a good rig, but I get around 20 frames on 100 ping. Not bad. As far as gameplay goes, that game's not bad... generally. I mean, there are some nice features like running reloads that always come in handy. Movement feels pretty fluid, though there's no proning, which can be annoying.Immersion is very well done, with an actual animation for attaching a weapon's suppressor. You can see your helmet, and can raise and lower it, which I love. You just feel like you're an Interstellar Marine in space; it's awesome. I once played a game where we were in a large cargo bay, and happened to pass a large window looking in space. Pausing to look through the window, I saw earth. Standing there, looking through the window at our slowly orbiting planet, I was just in awe. It felt so real, like I was actually in space looking down on plant earth. On the dark side of earth, I could even see the millions of pinpricks of light the showed populated areas. I probably stood there for a full minute looking an earth and space, before my squadmates got my attention again.Now, for weapons. There are but three weapons available as of now, an assault rifle, a combat shotgun, and a submachine gun. They're all fun weapons and are visually gorgeous, but... there's only three of them. The assault rifle is basically a designated marksman weapon, because it has an unremoveable 4x optic. The combat shot does meager damage, about the same as the SMG near as I can tell, and that combined with semi-automatic fire makes it an unpopular weapon. This can be remedied by buffing the damage a bit, which ought to be done anyway, because it's a combat shotgun, The SMG is fine. Using automatic on the assault rifle and SMG is unrealistically innaccurate. Maybe things are different in the 22nd century, but you aim goes all over the place, and you really have to work the mouse while firing to land your shots.The multiplayer is good, but I personally enjoyed the co-op; a four man team advancing through an abandoned space station fending off attacks by defective robots. It's pretty rad.In the end? IM is a pretty fun game. Things can get a bit repetetive, but in general there's a lot of enjoyment to be had in outer space in the 22nd century. I've had the game for a few days, so I don't know what update frequency is like, though I've heard it's not stellar (pun intended). I hope to be proven wrong.			"

								I would only get this game (like most games I play) if you have a couple of friends to play it with. This is not a solo game however. Your always in multiplayer, and the coop campaign is great. I still get scared for some reason hahaha. I wish they foucused on the coop aspect of the game and not the pvp portion, because the coop gameplay has so much more potential, and could be so original. To be honest, this game will not go anywhere if they continue to foucus on pvp. The coop portion is the only thing keeping it afloat. I know it was worth my money, but no more than a solid ten bucks, and that may be pushing a little.			"

Once they get some more weapons, maps, and flesh out the animation a bit better it will really start to shine.  Hoping they keep up the good work on this one, would love this to become a mainstream multiplayer shooter on Steam.			"

								A very good start to a what seems to be a promising title--------------------------------The above review was made just shy of 3 years ago. And I still stand by the statement, ""A good start"". Because as of now, that’s all it seems to be. A start. This game has fallen into development hell. Even though there has been numerous updates to this game, they have been minor from a player stand point. Bugs were fixed. Maybe some textures were fixed. But as far as substantial, significant additions to the game, like new maps, new weapons, new game modes, new enemies.... not much has really happened. I follow them on Facebook, and they post the updates they are planning on. One update they had......they added a compass to the helmet HUD.....a compass....... This (small) addition did absolutely nothing to the gameplay. Another one, they gave the bots new skins. And added a CO2 meter. These are nice and dandy but very minor. Now look, I completely understand that this is a small development team. Im sure the guys are very talented in their skills. I know that they do not have a huge budget so things will take time. I completely understand that. But in all fairness, this game is just moving waaaaaay too slow. According to Wikipedia this game was announced in 2005! 2000 freaking 5!!!  And what has happened since then? From a consumer point of view, not much. Seriously. Where is this game?


YouTube™ Video: Interstellar Marines Trailer 1 

			Views: 101,575		

			Interstellar Marines is a video game unlike any on the market. The designers at Zero Point Software are embarking on a revolutionary journey, changing how video games are designed.		

This game showed a lot of promise. As I stated nearly 3 years ago. I know the development team is facing many challenges such as funding. But in all honestly, from the minor updates to slow development, I think one of the issues is bad direction/management. I think they focused on the minor, non essential details of the game and spent waaaaay too much time on them. This game showed a lot of potential. It really did. Unfortuantely, this game will be uninstalled.			"

								Wow, this game is amazing. Awesome graphics and VERY realistic mechanics. This game makes things very difficult from the environment spontaniously changing from pitch black night to day (not the most realistic things) to your helmet getting fogged up because you've been sprinting (which you can fix by raising your mask). Now if you do buy this game keep in mind that at the moment there is only one gun and very few maps but this is also an early-access game so they are still adding things into the game. But the multi-player has very little lag and still manages to look increadable.			"

								Ok this is a re-do since the game has some changes one being customization; These can be aquired by completing pve missions, winning a pvp match(or just participating I don't play pvp much), and participating in the Hell Week Event. PVE is still weak due to a small map variety and mission types. PVP got some love but still playing the same five or six maps gets repetative but it's more skill based and promotes aiming more since no one has shields and a head shot is your best chance at getting a quick kill. Now weapon choice in this game is laughably small with there being a pistol, sub-machine gun, and assault rifle ready for use. Hopefully the developers get the money and backers to further develope the game			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game seems to be getting along quite well, however it is on extremely early access which is apparent with things such as a lack of crouching, or lowering of the weapon whilst sprinting etc. (I Imagine leaning will also add more to the game) means that the game feels relatively fast paced at this moment in time compared to how it will be later.Because of the early access nature of the game, it is quite possible that something may go wrong in future development. However, the initial game, or at least what we can see of it is fairly well developed, with immersion factors in the recent update 7 adding quite a lot too the game. For starters, it brings about a reconcilliation between standard ""Game"" factors, and immersion breakers. IE: Most games will use hit detection via a little ""X"" over the crosshair. Marines however, does this by placing a small square over the enemy bodypart that you hit and only appears if your HUD is active. (Your HUD is controlled by your helmet being up or down and armour health/HP. Too much damage will disable it). Which is not only a unique feature, but really makes you feel like its an immersive futuristic experience.In fact, I'd say one of the parts they've really nailed on this game is the immersive experience, the fact that when it rains and my visor is up, I get rain drops splatter onto my helmet, or the fact that I have to use my laser sight to hipfire efficiently. It just feels good, and for someone who is a lover of Milsim it makes the game far more valuable and memorable too me.This game so far has amazing potential, and I look forward to seeing how it gets along. That being said, I recommend you wait a short while before buying, what we have now is brilliant, but it is quite barebones and so the later product can change in a multitude of ways. However if the devs keep it up the way they are, then I whole heartedly recommend the purchase and if you feel like you have cash to splurge, and want to try it now then don't let me stop you! The devs have been active, and I have no reason to doubt them, its obvious they are working hard! Truthfully its been awhile since I've seen such a polished game in early access!			"

								what a garbage game. it looks neat and the controls are nice, but f me it's like it was designed by someone who doesn't even play games. in addition to nobody ever playing because it's not anything special, there are only 2 or 3 missions that i've seen, and the level design is just as bad. you have to open a door every .75 seconds by clicking a small button, the ai tries to shoot you through the floor, and in other times walk right past you, and there are dozens of pointless rooms to go in and get nothing from. no items, not hiding places, just pointless areas to get lost in, oh and there is often no direction where to go, and if you're in a fight and not paying attention to what the cliche'd robotic woman voice guide says, you're sol just wandering around doing nothing.this is why common sense is necessary for game and level design. and character design... look at those idiotic looking soldiers, supposedly the most advanced space marines of the universe.

								This is a decent beta shooter; not a complete game but surprisely good kinetic engagements with AI. It reminds me of playing lone wolf mode in Rainbow 6 3. If you're a big FPS fan then you will appreciate the little things that really make a shooter fun to play like switching from semi to full auto, flashlight on and off (AI reacts strongly), and solid shooter mechanics. The multiplayer needs work but then again so does the multiplayer on every AAA game on Steam. If you're looking for a fun shooter and aren't an uptight prick like most people writing reviews then buy this game and have a few hours of fun.			"

								There is absolutely nothing to do in this game, as it stands.  There's sandbox modes where you can walk around the map, but the map is completely empty and uninteresting.There's multiplayer, but it's empty most of the time.  The advertised feature of the game, co-op, isn't even implemented yet.  There's presently only two guns, no customization, not even a working HUD.At this time, there is ZERO reason to buy this game.			"

								This has grown to be one of my favorite shooters to play. I love the game and it has really grown on me. There are adding some more missions there are only two now but it is a lot of fun to play in a group of friends. I really recommend you getting especially when it goes on sale in 4 pack. keep up the good work devs.			"

								Right now it's EXTREMELY basic, but you can see what this game will turn out to be. The maps and changing weather are amazing. The game right now is a lot of fun and it keeps getting better. The developers are always talking with their players and getting their input. This is a great game being made by great developers. Please note this an alpha. It's barebones and right now it's pretty much the map changing effects is the only thing that's finished. There's only one gun right now and there isn't even crouching, but this game is still really good. I mean really good.			"

								Interstellar Marines looks extremely good when I first saw it. The details are pretty well done and so are the sound effects. This game has tended to have some slow moments which can be frustrating. Guns look amazing and this game feels very realistic. This game just gone bad due to the fact that ever since 2010, you've been just shooting AI robots. It gets boring and Team Deathmatch isn't much fun either and niether is co-op after beating it once or twice. This game is just boring and it was able to fool me it buyng it becuase it looked so good and it DID have a positive review.  There isn't much people to play wih. The lobbies are always empty and thers only like 50 people total online. Its not enjoyable and even though it has a pretty decent presentation, its not engaging enough to keep playing.I'm sorry Interstellar Marine, but I will not recommend this game to anyone.

I like it and can see it going far. Only things it needs is BOTS, a Campaign, melee damage and blood from bullet wounds. Oh and more guns :/ only the SMG so far. But the game is still in its beginning and gets updated with new stuff a lot. Just needs more players and more stuff I guess :/, otherwise its good.			"

								I purchased this game back in 2013, and basically kick started this game via buying the Spearhead edition.I must say this is a big disapointment that this game will not see a single daylight anytime soon because the devs are no longer working on this project.The game has a strong element of coop and intense fight, low health, high damage guns.Graphics are great but do not meet the 2017 graphics gen, more of ~2013 where it begun.A strong key element is enviroment cycle which makes the game more interestig, why you may ask?well you have to know the map good if you are playing at night when suddenly lighting stikes and blows your cover.Good weapon sounds, and ragdoll physics.I do not recommend this game only because the are no people which are playing the game, basically all the 8 dedicate servers are empty, better save the money on a different game that has future.I will update this review in much more details in the future, stay tuned.

								The Neurogen Incident is a good addition to this early access game.Overall, since I first bought the game, this team has made significant improvements to the game. At first the game didn't grab my attention much more than any other PvP. But since the additions of the single and coop modes, I've actually started enjoying playing the game.Update 12/19/2015Though there are naysayers, the game has enough content for a first time player at reasonable price. I'm sure many spend more money at a fast food restaurant.If someone has tired of playing the game, maybe he needs to do something different.			"

								I've been a Spearhead supporter since this game was a shooting range that ran on your browser. Hehe. I guess you either get it right or you don't. And as simple as that prototype was, it left me at awe. I have played shooters all of my life. From CS, Unreal, to MOH, COD2, MW and all of the Battlefields. The only thing that comes close to the level of authenticity in animation and visuals of this game is perhaps BF4. But IM still manages to strike a completely different and authentic feel that no other game has ever captured. With all the planned features and all of the things that they have created so far. I am greatly impressed. I really wish all of the best for this game and I want it to thrive and grow. I really am enjoying the co-op modes that have been added, and I am now seeing greater potential in this game. I have never, for a second, given up on Zero Point Software. I wish them the best of luck and hope to see this game in its full form, however long that might take. Great things take time, especially when you're not shackled by a Publisher. As a gamer, if you are looking for a shooter to satisfy your thirst for good emersion, you have arrived at the right place. You just need to be patient and let the game grow at a healthy rate.			"

								A great and ambitious game concept that is propably never going to see the light of day. When I first saw the prerendered ""trailer"" of the game I fell in love with the idea, the artwork and everything (I mean WALKING SHARKS how awesome is that?!).I was really exited when I found out the game recieved proper funding and even made it on to steam.But that exitement didnt last for long, because after a couple of months I realized that ZPS bit off more than they could chew.The development process is painfully slow and every ever so little step is sold as pure gold. I remember one video on their facebook page where they implemented ""quite a complex movement and cover system"" and bragged on about how awesome it is for TEN MINUTES, when it was just your basic-run-of-the-mill  walk-run-sprint-duck-movement.But thats only one of the many factors that made me lose my trust in the completion of the game.Another thing that boggles me is the fact, that the game has been on so many sales by now that propably every person who had just the slightest interest in the game bought it for a few bucks. So even if this game ever sees the light of day, AND its the game they promised AND its appreciated by the gaming community I dont see how there is any more money to be made because almost everyone interested in it allready owns it.I for one have not bought the game (and at this point I am rather glad I didnt). I played the so far released ""content"", and I did partake in the free to play weekend (but even then I hardly found any populated servers). But at the momement the game isnt more than a ""tech demo"" for the unity engine.And after the latest PR stunt they pulled (by now they have deleted the video) I have lost all hope in the game and the sanity of the team behind it.Guess the ""hell week"" was the prelude for the development hell the game is going to stew in once ZPS have run out of $$$			"

We tried for fifteen minutes playing server roulette trying to get in the same game before a server filled up and couldn't.

								So it's free weekend. My friend and I want to play coop together but can't because there's no private servers, private hosting, or the ability to join a game as a party. We tried for fifteen minutes playing server roulette trying to get in the same game before a server filled up and couldn't. If you're making a game built for co-op, you better make sure two friends or more can play together without such a fuss. It's just the worst system I've ever seen.			"

								I don't know why so many people have been hating on this game. I believe it's a great game and I'll just put some negetive reviews down and explain why I think they're wrong.Negetive review 1: Development is slow.Well, of course it is! It's an indie game with very realistic mechanics, and it's a very pretty game. Can you expect them to be rushing out updates every week? We need to give them time. Rating the game negetively and causing less people to buy it might make the devs abandon it, and nobody wants that.Negetive review 2: The game is crap.I've seen this review on someone with 0.3 hours in game. The game is getting updated, new gamemodes are coming, you can play with difficulty, you can play with friends, all kinds of things! The game has aspects of horror, aspects of hungergames-like things (Wargames), I don't know why someone with 0.3 hours would have nothing left to do in this game. At least explain why you think the game is crap.Note: I will most likely update this as I see more types of negetive reviews.			"

								This game has some great features, can be really fun, and has some great promises if the devs ever get the publisher they want and need. The problem with that is that it is really doubtful that they will ever get that publisher.The game is still fun as it is right now, especially with friends; Just be warned that it may never leave early access.If you do end up getting it, make sure to play less than 2 hours before deciding whether or not you really enjoy it, because steam probably wont refund it after that.

								This game is a diamond in the rough, but I believe, truthfully, that it is a superb concept with tremendous potential.I write this review as of the precipice of the release of update 25, which the devs say may happen tomorrow. I'm considering upgrading to ""Speahead Addition"" to help support the devs, who, by the way, are in dire need of support.It is a tactical game with eight maps. It has four or five coop missions and servers for all of them. It has fun multiplayer and servers up in all major regions, although you might want to get a few people to come and play with you, just in case you can't find many other players online.It also includes a survival scenerio called ""Hell Week"". Think of it as tactical fps hunger games. As of now there are three weapons, and assault rifle, smg, and pistol. Update 25 will add in tons of camos and skins which can be unlocked through CP points and leveling up. If you buy this game, know you are in it for the long haul and that you will need to find some friends to play with.With all of its faults, mostly from the struggles of development, the last thing Intersellar Marines needs is another negative review.

								Okay, I'm not bashing the game. It's just my opinion, based on the current state of game. 1. It's nothing but L4D2 with sci fi robots or Dead Space with Coop running around in mazes, mostly dark, chasing shadows.2. Weapons are pretty limited (only 2), so don't expect much ""warfare"" yet.3. The servers are mostly empty for me (I'm from India), so I get only EU servers and not much activity.4. If I am lucky, and do find a server sometime, it's only the 4 person coop, no PvP mode. I was more interested in PvP, but it's not there yet.5. The missions are pretty dull, as I mentioned, chasing robots and killing them or collecting ""Keycards"". Not very fun.6. The game gets laggy even on powerful systems, since the map isn't optimized well, so expect frequent FPS drops.But,1. The game is in Early Access stage, so yeah the content is VERY VERY limited, and you are paying to support the dev.2. More is to come in long term, but for now I personally do not find it very interesting. 3. Urmmm, I'm never buying another early access game again. This is just sad that you can release anything out of the door with barely any content, but atleast I can hope that I'm helping the devs so yeah, that's fine by me.At the current state, I do not recommend this game. Get your friends to play it maybe, then it could be fun.			"

								This game is one I am hoping will one day see the light of day and get the recognition it deserves. It has a new Scifi feel to it and from what they have planned for the direction they will take this game in, it will be a must buy. However, there are not a lot of features in it now as it is still in very early alpha. (There is a load more features than when I bought it but someone new might not think so). What I am trying to say is, this small team of indie developers needs all the support and credit they deserve. And when people say that this game has been in development for 6 years, they are wrong. This game was originally supposed to come out in 2008 (I believe.) for console but sadly ZPS went bankrupt and were forced to cancel the game. This is a reboot of that franchise on an entirely new engine (That looks amazing graphics wise) and has only been in development for maybe 2 years. But considering that this is only an 8 or so person team, I am thoroughly impressed. If you are looking for a good scifi simulation shooter to pass the time then look no further. And imagine how happy you'll be when this game finshes? That way when the time comes you can say: ""Look at this game. I supported it. Great job ZPS!"" In all honesty, I play it at least 3 times a week. I say it is very good for an early alpha game and the direction they are heading is going to make it a lot better. They have a few singleplayer missions which you can play coop on, multiplayer TDM (which not many people play for some reason, but I digress) and Hell week which is essentially if you mixed The Hunger Games with guns and robots. Its an awesome PVP/PVE experience.  "

Early Access Review
								This game is fun. I'll just put that out there to start off. From a personal standpoint, I love the entire concept of it. A real gritty, tactical FPS. But before I go off on a tangeant like that, I'll sum up the pros and cons real quick:PROS:• Excellent gunplayLike, seriously. The weaponry is so satisfying. I got this game way back, back when there was just one weapon - the SMG. Even then, it was awesome. Now they have added two new weapons; an Assault Rifle, and a Pistol.. Thing. Either way, there's just something very satisfying about managing to headshot someone down a corridor, all sneaky beaky like.• EnvironmentsFrom the few maps there are, already it's clear a lot of time and effort is put into things. The attention to detail really shows, with some of the more lush/open maps (such as one that randomly changes setting every now and then) being extremely well done. The layout is also rather cool, as communicating with a squad and moving through a building feels very, very satisfying.• The Suit/UIFrom passive noises, to the dynamic of the HUD projected onto a proper model of the visor, the in-game UI feels very realistic, and looks badass. After being hit several times, the suit HUD even reacts, malfunctioning. This gives you a sound muffling effect as well, as if all electronics just shut down. And it pays off, resulting in a really immersive experience. The best part though? There's a key that lets you raise and lower the helmet visor - meaning if you wanna play without a HUD, you can.• AICombat AI is rather reactive; it could do with being better, but as it stands, it is still rather formidable and entertaining to play against. Even alone, they can be challenging. Countless times I've gotten to the end of a section, with only two combat training droids to go, only to be flanked by them at the last second. Not fun, but a testament to how much you have to pay attention in this game to noise, as well as visuals.CONS:• Not much contentAt the time of writing this review (03/10/2016), the only real missions are; a handful of ""Search and Destroy"" style levels where you have to shoot and destroy all combat training droids in a map, A few missions where you have to trigger switches while avoiding combat droids, and two story missions - one being where you have to break into a secure compound and extract information, the other where you have to extract information from a science lab station. While both are cool, the game does get stale after a while, however multiplayer PvP is definitely fun (although I suck at that).• Slow development timeFrom what I've heard, the game only has one full time developer due to financial issues. While that is rather.. Well, disappointing, it does testify as to how good this guy is. It's gonna take a lot of time for new content to be worked on (and at this rate, the game to be finished), but over the past couple of years there has been a few new additions - a couple of maps (rather large ones), and two new weapons. This definitely isn't a game to play if you want it right away, right now.• PlayerbaseThere tends to not be as many players nowadays, most likely due to the slow development time. This game isn't going to be finished any time soon. This does mean that there is only one or two full matches on at a time, if you are lucky, and they tend to be PvP. If you want to play on Co-op, then let your friends know; you are highly unlikely to find anyone online.• Server HostingWhile most servers tend to be really, really good, there are a few issues. The way server hosting works is, instead of having the ability to host your own server, you join an empty server and claim it as your own. This means you can change settings (such as password and player limit) and then you basically are happy as Larry. While that system works, it (used to be) very, very frustrating if you just wanted to play co-op with friends, and ended up with three other random people joining. And then your friends end up hosting their own, and the same goes on and on.SummaryThis game is good as it is, but it isn't exactly a full game. At the current price, I would recommend it. However, if you are after a game that is going to be done soon, or prefer not to be patient and see the development process through, I suggest looking elsewhere. This game has a lot of potential ahead of it, and while a lot of setbacks have overcome the developers, I am sure that given time they will make something very playabe, very decent, and very fun.That and the helmet feature is f***in awesome.

								As much a I love this game, even after this short time playing, I can conclude a general review about this game.The good: *The maps, they're really well layed out, and the multiplayer ones have a lot of functionality.*Skill level, this game DOES require skill to play against other players, and it was quite fun for the 2 matches I played.*Has singleplayer, multiplayer, and plenty of gamemodes to do stuff in, that was a surprise.There were a few more good minor thigns, but nothing to include in the list.The bad:*Ai pathfinding is horrible, to many times I've seen the AI walking aginst a wall, or going the opposite direction into a wall.*Single player missions suck, the first mission, infiltrating the compound, requires you at first to know the exhaustion system, pretty neat. As you play through it, they actually introduce you to new enemies! A +1 for it. But that's where it ends. In the same mission, I was in a building, shooting enemies and taking cover. Of course, a locked door is behind me, the one I need for the mission, guess what? Either an invisible enemy (in game) comes out of it and gets an easy shot, or he was able to glitch in there.*No save points in missions. As I continued on after that, going thorugh it all again, I got farther, and guess what? Died falling into the world, mission restart... Enough said.*A ton of world glitches and clipping. Yes, it's early access, but if I can simply crouch next to a wall and see outside the world, it NEEDS to be fixed. And countless times I've fallen out of the world :/.*Two weapons.... This game has been in EA since 2013... Put some more weapons in it please.*Slow updates, maybe around once a month, and before it was around 3 months. I understand it is a small team, but you can probably manage to do more.Other than countless other bad things in the game, I need to go now. I really want this game to improve, but right now it's not buyable. Do not buy it until the devs do more or until its out of EA and good. I hope to see this a good game.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: This is a pre-release review, as of August 2015.TL;DR: This game sucks.  It's still pre-release, but after 2 years of waiting for it to show any noteworthy signs of improvement, I'm skeptical that it's ever going to be truly playable.  Don't spend more that $5 on it until after it's fully released and gets some good reviews (that aren't obvious plants by the developers).I bought this game in 2013--just after it was released--because the description, videos, and screenshots indicated that it was going to be a rewarding single-player and multi-player experience. I paid more for it than some FPS games that I've gotten over 200 hours of fun out of, because it looked like it would turn into a fun, peudo-realistic FPS, both online and offline. Sadly, 2 years later, the graphics still look shoddy, the multiplayer is still one-dimensional, and the single player campaign is basically unplayable. For example, you can't save during the single-player campaign, so if you die, you get booted back to the beginning of the mission, and missions can be quite long, since a lot of stealth is involved. Stealth doesn't work like it should, either. If you shoot a bad guy in the head with a silencer, and nobody is around to see/hear it, sometimes, the alarm goes off. When that happens, bad guys don't come through the gates, get airdropped, walk on from the edge of the map, or any other sensible thing; they just spawn in silently in random places and come after you. So, now that walkway you spent 5 minutes clearing so you'd be able to scout around has enemies on it, even though you had a clear view of all the ways they could have gotten onto it from.Linux support is one reason why I bought this game. However, 2 years later, it still doesn't work in a playable fashion. (The other paragraphs of this review pertains to the Windows version, which I've been playing on my other hard drive.) If you put the game fullscreen and start a mission (online or single-player), you can only look up, and when you move the mouse, it immediately reverts your view to a lovely panorama of a completely uninteresting sky or ceiling. This is a known bug having to do with the supposedly cross-platorm engine, Unity...and has been for quite some time. You can edit an obscure config file by hand to make it work in windowed mode, but who wants to play an FPS in a window?Physics and movement are STILL screwed-up. I could sort-of understand jumping and crouching not being implemented for the first year of public play (although...why?), but even now, you can only sometimes jump over low railing, rocks, etc. that come up to your character's knees. Also, when you shoot a bad guy, sometimes he goes flying off into the sky, because, obviously, that's how people go down when shot. Sometimes, when you're crouching between two obstacles with ~3 feet of empty space in front of you, bullet holes will appear in the wall-that-doesn't-exist in front of you when you're shooting or being shot at.The one positive thing I have to say about this game, so far, is that your character's body exists and moves realistically. Shooting recoils realistically, and reloading looks like what you'd see in a YouTube video of a skilled weapons instructor--not too fast, and not too slow, with bumps and clicks in all the right places. There are still only three guns, none of which are actually FUN to shoot (they don't make a satisfying/realistic ""bang"", don't have realistic smoke, make electric ""sizzles"" instead of bullet holes, etc.), but they do have some nice options on them, such as attachable suppressors, toggles for fire speed, light, laser, and so on.I get that the devs are spending a LOT of time and energy trying to make it realistic (as much as an enjoyable video game can be), but I think that they're focusing on the details to the complete exclusion of the sorts of things that make a first-person shooter fun to play. It's obvious that the developers love the game they're making enough to be totally meticulous about the stuff they think is cool--and that's great--but in order for everyone else to have a ""love of the game"", they need to ignore some of those figurative trees and get around to planting the rest of the forest.I've used a LOT of beta software, and played a LOT of early pre-release games; and few, if any, have been this bad after two years of public release--and NONE have been this bad for so long after the point when they started to actually charge money for them.  $5 for this level of quality I could understand, but $15?  It's still not a lot, but that price point means they're competing with the likes of Killing Floor and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which are vastly better games than Interstellar Marines.  Honestly, if it were free-to-play, it probably wouldn't be played, as it is, now.  If this game starts to become worth playing before I entirely give up on it, I'll change this review, accordingly.

								I'm kinda in a strange situation here. The game has given me one of the best coop experiences I have had in FPS action so far but as other people are also pointing out the devs have been a bit slow in  providing new content. Multiplayer is dying (unfortunately), you can still  find a handful of people playing coop and deathmatch but that's all.So what do I  do? Telling you  not to get this? Isn't this a way to kill such a tremendous game that this at some extent already is and is/could most probably become having enough funding? So my recommendation to you is  to BUY this game. Support the devs. In the worst situation that no singleplayer is being delivered there are still some great matches going on currently that imo justify the 15 euros totally, After all  Coop only needs four people each time and I've always been successful finding them!Believe me you won't regret this. Stealth mechanics, environments that change, day/night transition, cooperation with other people, what else would you want? I've spent a lot more money on big production games that are not worth as much  as this one imo.UPDATE 1A couple of things I really like about this game:- Day/Night  transition during  match- Interchangeable environment during match- Stealth dynamics- Pay attention to sounds. Slighest steps might mean that someone is lurking you ;-)- Coop required. Not frequent spawning  means that you  actually  have to stick around your mates that will revive you if you get  shot down (if they don't they are on their own - too bad for them!)Check out this short gameplay video below to get what I mean:


YouTube™ Video: Interstellar Marines Coop Multiplayer 1080p60fps 

			Views: 195		

			Interstellar Marines is one of my favourites. Intense fps action with a realistic twich. The goal is to clear 40 bots of the map.

								Tell you what, if you want a taste of that sci fi co-op experience you've always dreamed about, this is it. Interstellar Marines really capitalizes on immersion, making you feel like you're a legit space marine training to be the doggone best unit this side of the Milky Way. I've spent hours running through Neurogen incedent with my bros and friends, every second worth it.Now, with all that said, it's a taste, still far from a full meal, so if you wanna get excited hit that buy button, heck hit the 4 pack button (that's what makes it most enjoyable), yeah it'll taste great but you're gonna be starving for more for a long time and nothing else will satisfy that hunger.

								Despite it's clever attempts of realism there is nothing catching about this game.The scenary is dark and drab and there is no brightness control.Despite the game being ""still in development"", you get the feeling that it would have been good ten years ago, then you remeber titles like SWAT and start to wonder if that is really true.

								Ten years in developement and this is what we get? A bot shooting demo? I was so excited for this when I saw all of their tech demos. You have two guns that have infinite ammo so the only thing you have to collect are key cards. Where are the god damned shark monsters I was promised TWO years ago? They where predicted to come out at the end of last year. An update every 2 months? How many people are working on this thing and how many have quit? I sure would love to see this finished but as of now NO thank you.			"
