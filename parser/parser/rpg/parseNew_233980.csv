												Unepic is an old-school indie RPG that’s rough around the edges but still has a lot to offer.  You play as Daniel, a typical nerd who suddenly finds himself either hallucinating or somehow transported inside the tabletop game he’s been playing—he’s not sure which.Soon after, you are exploring a castle full of deadly enemies and traps, searching for the exit.  The dungeon is divided into segments typical of a Metroidvania, requiring you to power up, level up, defeat an area’s boss to obtain a key so you may progress to the next area, and so on.  The boss battles themselves are well-crafted and interesting, except for one that effectively forces you to drop your items on the ground, which was a terrible idea. You’ll meet a reluctant companion very early on who will remain with you throughout the game and serves as the other half of most of the dialog and story.  The dialog tends to be on the humorous side and tries, maybe a little too hard, at incorporating some nerd humor and pop culture references into everything you do.There are many secrets to be found within the walls of the castle; shopkeepers and quest givers to meet; pets to recruit, who will follow you around and offer unique abilities; and in-game challenges to complete, which are actually quite challenging.  A robust magic system, based on reagents and eight schools of magic, is in place along with alchemy and your typical melee and ranged skills and weapons.  Leveling up will let you distribute stat points and skill points across these as you see fit, with harder difficulties rewarding you with more points to distribute as well as the ability to save your game manually.Unepic does have its flaws: Other than the humor not being for everyone, even people who typically don’t get hung up on graphics may find the game to be ugly and, while the lighting can be nicely done, the minigame of wading through the darkness to light all the torches can become tiring, as can climbing ladders on every screen.  In spite of this, a solid RPG lies at the core and it’s obvious the developer put a lot of work, and love, into making the game.			"

												A Metroidvania game with distinctly strategic combat that encourages you to think outside the box.  It's part RPG: you can equip weapons, armor, and potions, and when you kill enemies you gain XP. When you level up, you get skill points that let you use better gear.Where this game differs from other Metroidvanias is the combat, which is very deliberate and feels almost puzzle-like at times.  If you try to hack and slash in Unepic, you'll do little more than die horribly.  You're encouraged to carefully pick off foes and try different weapons and tactics.For example, daggers are fast-hitting, and hit hard when used against enemies from behind.  Swords do better against organic beings, while maces crush armored foes.  Axes are the middle ground, doing average damage to both kinds of enemies.  Polearms are great for poking dudes you don't want to sit next to (enemies with poison HURT).  Using magic (or at least bows) is mandatory, as some enemies won't let you fight them in melee.The game also has some punishing boss fights that creatively abuse game mechanics.  One telepathy-based-boss will use his mental powers to force you to suicide by using your damaging spells against you.  The solution? Dump all your magic essences in the bank (except your healing ones) so that he can't make you do anything bad.  But be careful to also dump your teleport items, or you'll be sorry when the boss hits low HP :)The writing/story of the game is a paradox: both thought-provoking and incredibly juvenile.  One moment you'll have a thoughtful discussion with a ghostly hitchiker about the castle you find yourself stuck in, and the next your character will be a complete jackass, taunting someone who's having an existential crisis.  The protagonist sometimes acts generously and other times is motivated by complete greed.  It feels very inconsistent, though a few moments of the script really shine through.The ending of the game is a significant twist, but also has a boss fight that some will find immensly irritating - it's a real challenge of your skills.Overall I'd recommend Unepic.  It's a surprisingly deep game for having been made by only one dude, and while you may be put off by some of the juvenile dialouge, it can be a real treat gameplay-wise so long as you don't try to hack and slash your way through it.

								UnEpic? Anything but. The only reason this game by Ninja Gamers chose this title is due to the fact that Blue Sky Studios licensed EPIC before they got the chance. Because trust me, this game is everything and more compared to your everyday role player. This platformer/RPG is a hack and slash blast keeping you on your toes, not only with mesmerizing gameplay but an authentic story line that continues constantly throughout the game.There are so many different options when it comes to this game its incredible, and almost a little bit too much to take in at first. But don’t worry, everything becomes fluid after only a few short minutes of gameplay, and the controls are easy to get familiar with. Not your average platformer, UnEpic comes with its own crafting system and recipes that you must learn to make certain potions. They also integrate this in with the main characters magic abilities, whereas you must obtain and learn each spell. Whether it be an award from a quest or buying the tome directly from one of the games multiple item shops. The weaponry is awesome, with various choices ranging from staffs, axes, wands, swords, maces, and more. Each weapon sometimes unique with its own special attribute, leaves you well armed while on your adventure.You play as Daniel, a video game developer, huge fan of sci-fi, and a novice RPG player. In the middle of a RPG he is transported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination, and that the world he was thrown into couldnt logically be real. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for the ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is possessed by a dark spirit that can communicate with him, but not control him. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn, Daniel finally discovers his goal: kill Harnakon, the master of the castle.From the second i heard about this game and downloaded the demo I knew it was destined for greatness. UnEpic is one of those games you can sit down and play for hours, or just a few minutes while waiting for that pepperoni hot pocket to cool down. The story will keep you intrigued from the second you pick up your controller to the moment you put it down, and if you’re anything like me, will continue to plague your mind while at work. During the week I bought UnEpic I found myself dying to punch the clock so I could quickly get home and get an hour or two in. Its games like these that are not only fun to play, but addicting from every aspect, making gaming something to get excited about, and look forward too.Sometimes developers leave out small details that can make or break a game. That’s certainly not the case when it comes to UnEpic. Details such as paying attention to your weapon and armor, because like your character, they also take damage and need to be repaired to function properly. This is done through visiting the blacksmith in the item shops, where you will also be able to buy newer weapons or stock up on projectiles. Crafting “recipies” take place in the castles kitchens, where the cook will be able to sell you the vital essences that each potion requires. While dredging through the castles sewers leaches become attached to you dealing damage, and are stored in your inventory, so until you remove them you continue to lose health. In my opinion its details like these that put UnEpic in  a category of its own.When it comes to something like “replay factor” this game is much like any other RPG. Although, with several of the different capabilities that set it aside from others, it makes it tempting to run through yet again. I find when it comes to games like UnEpic, I will beat it on the normal difficulty setting first, then try my hand at hard. This is something that the Diablo franchise engraved in me, as I am sure many other gamers have been affected by. Sometimes at the end of a game you are left wanting more, and I find varied levels of toughness help give the game that extra added edge that changes everything for a gamer. UnEpic cured this by adding in the use of a multiplayer mode, allowing you to choose several different ways to continue your “UnEpic” journey.Five different modes make up multiplayer, including, Co-Op, Deathmatch, Conquest, Race and Survival. Each of which have their own cut scene introductions that are unique to what mode/dungeon that you are playing. They begin with the main character Daniel sitting at a table with friends playing a role-playing game complete with a Dungeon Master narrating your every move. You start off alone if you choose or with other players, and fight your way through each different level. There is also an option to build your own dungeon, depending on how far you’ve gotten in the Conquest mode of multiplayer. The only downfall I find with UnEpic’s multiplayer option is the inability to play as your single player character, but again, as I said before this only adds to the replay factor.What else can I say? UnEpic offers so much and is perfectly packaged, a game of this caliber is essential for fans of platformers, RPG, and action hack and slash. You have so many options at your fingertips in this game, and that is what sets it aside from all the rest. From the dynamics of gameplay, the creative and compelling story and intricate detail in the graphics, UnEpic is worth every penny and won’t let you down.			"

Early Access Review
								Unepic is an amalgamation of two of my most favorite gameplay styles, Metroidvanias and slower, methodically minded titles like Spelunky, or to a greater extent, Demon and Dark Souls. Unepic melds the two into a challenging and hilarious adventure that will easily last you upwards of 20 hours while you explore the game’s dungeons.The story follows a tabletop gamer who suddenly finds himself in an enchanted tower filled with ghouls, goblins, and all manner of beasts. He quickly becomes possessed by a nameless dark spirit who finds that he is unable to control our hero! Worse yet, he’s stuck inside his body until our hero’s death! What could have been little more than a driving force for Unepic’s protagonist quickly becomes one of its strongest qualities, as the hero and spirit are able to communicate with one another, and they do so often. The dialogue between them is witty and hilarious, and the back and forth caused me to laugh out loud on numerous occasion.Beyond the platforming, Unepic features a healthy dose of varying modes of combat. This is where the more methodical nature of the game comes into play, as many run-ins with the enemies and traps each dungeon possesses require patience and the right tool set to keep from a quick death. The shear amount of items at your disposal is impressive, and many items carry benefits most suited for specific situations. Besides the weapon variety, there’s a plethora of equipables, skills, potions, recipes, and spells that you can find, buy and earn through quests given by NPC’s littering the castle.The combat itself is admittedly slow and clunky, but this only adds to the more strategic pace of enemy encounters. You can’t just run in and attack; many of the enemies you’ll face possess the same reach and even more ferocity than you do, and attracting their attention without a plan will get you killed. On higher difficulties, this is amplified, as beyond being stronger, enemies have a far greater range of sight, and many can attack you from a distance, and interrupt your own movements. On the highest difficulty, you even lose the several moments of invulnerability that comes after each hit, meaning that you lose any hope of rushing Leroy Jenkins style and coming out alive. It’s such a superb feature that I’m honestly surprised that I’ve never seen something similar before.Unepic is superb. Make no mistake, this is one of those rare titles worth more than the asking price. If you’ve ever enjoyed Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, you will thoroughly enjoy spending hours at a time on this game. If you’re one of the few who loved Demon/Dark Souls, you’ll find no better 2D substitute. If you’re like me, and adore both styles of play, then rejoice, because you’ve found the ultimate combination of the two. Unepic is hilariously crass, filled with pop culture references, and provides a several dozen hour long adventure filled with secrets and sidequests. You’d be a fool to pass it up. This review is based solely on the finished single player experience. There is an unfinished multiplayer mode that I’ve yet to sample, and I will edit this review with my feelings on it if/when I try it out. "

												Contradicting its title, Unepic is an epic 2D side-scrolling RPG with a touch of platforming elements.You play as Daniel, who gets teleported into a mysterious castle during a pen-and-paper RPG session with his friends. Soon enough, Daniel finds himself possessed by a sinister entity who unvoluntarily becomes his guide throughout the journey.  At first, Daniel believes that this whole mishap is just a hallucination and acts as if he was playing a video game, which leads to genuinely amusing dialogues filled with pop culture refferences (World of Warcraft, Star Trek, Star Wars etc). But well-written dialogues is just one of Unepic's positives. The locations are distinguishable enough from each other and, if you like 2D graphic,  visually pleasing. Definitelly not what you'd call ""monotonous"".Controls feel just right most of the time, with just a few design flaws (for example taking damage cancels your targeting, which can get annoying in some situations).The game's difficulty is fairly ballanced. You can play on Easy, Normal, Hard or Hard++ and whichever difficulty you choose, you'll get more or less what you expect.Easy is super-easy. Normal and Hard are the well ballanced ""middle course"". Hard++ gets more serious.Unlike many other games out there, Unepic also managed to find a good compromise with providing information to the player. They do a good job of explaining what's what at the early stage, but you don't get the feeling that they're holding your hand.Another thing that deserves to be mentioned is the voice acting. All the voice actors did an excellent job. All in all, Unepic is an incredibly well done indie game, definitelly worth playing :) "

UnEpic is Epic, no doubts. It all starts when I was looking for something similar to old Castlevania series... The search came up with this game. At first I was not sure about it, but decided to buy - it was worth it. About the game mechanics, UnEpic is a platform RPG. The in-game map is filled in with monsters as you enter each new room, and some important locations aren’t even labeled. Every room is shrouded in darkness, it is up to you to manually light torches fixed around every room just to see where to go. Enemies are incredibly unbalanced, and it’s much easier to survive using projectile weapons than melee ones. UnEpic gets really hard sometimes, don't underestimate it! But still it's really addictive. "

												When you look at those pictures, you may thing: ""it's just another small and silly game"". But don't be fooled, this game has really big content and you need more time to finish it than on most modern AAA titles. Maybe the story doesn't pretend to be very serious, but this is very good piece of code.RPG elements are very strong, there are a lot of character statistics, many various items like weapon, armour, potions, rings and all what is necessary in true RPG. And you need to manage all those details very carefully, because this game is quite difficult so you will need to try many times to beat some monsters.VERDICT:If you're a fan of good old-school indie games, this is must try for you.If you're a fan of RPG, you should try. You may be surprised how strong this will suck you up.Like this review?

Early Access Review
								I'm not sure why it took me so long to get into UnEpic, and I've just got to say...WHAT AN IDIOT I AM!God damn, in all honesty - I would describe this game as my own Dungeons & Dragon's Lite. I've never really played D&D, however, I've heard various people that I've come across regale me with their Adventures having good times with good folk'...er' good people.Being a Lone Wolf myself, this game inspires Adventures within the same context that is often described to my by the aforementioned D&D players, without the good folk'/people part of it! I mean, you can always play Multiplayer, however, I often play the Single Player campaigns, thus the sheer awesomeness of this game since it caters to my bias/relevance.Now, with all of that being said, I cannot really say that the Customization Options are as in -depth as D&D could be - since I'm sure a lot of D&D players had gotten quite upset that I'm referring to this as my D&D Lite - but that in no way takes away from this game as a whole! The Customization that is offered is still pretty awesome within it's own sense. With all of this being said though, I'm pretty sure the people reading this want to hear stuff about the Gameplay other than my own ramblings on what this game resembles.The Graphics are quite retro bit-esque and I tend to really enjoy that sort of thing - so for me this isn't a big issue - but I can see how certain players may tire of this sort of thing when it comes to the next-gen stuff...That being said, if that's your cup'o'tea then clearly, it's not relevant to your own bias.  It's a 'Dark Themed' game when it comes to the Setting as it IS SUPPOSED to be in a Castle somewhere, however, with that being said, it still gives off this colorful sensation - without being too weird about it.The Gameplay itself is quite reminiscent of various Side-Scrollers I've grown up with - from MMO's to other Single Player games - so for me it really isn't an issue. There are things that aren't relevant to my bias, and that would include Farming/Grinding various things in a lot of games. Having said that, there are times in this game where you will have to grind and farm various ingredients, going to-and-fro, back-and-forth from room-to-room looking for those Bats and their Bat Wings, or looking for those Satyr's and their damned Intestines, but all in all, I think that's what adds to the charm of the game. One needs to be prepared for the devastating Traps placed everywhere, or for all of those various Monsters that will either Poison you, or just beat the crap out of you!With everything else, one has to ask what of the Sound? Well, for me again - and keep in mind this is a very biased review considering I enjoyed...nay, am still enjoying the hell out of this game - it's not bad! A lot of games these days have tried to over complicated various Telegraphs - those Attacks that are shown to you - with Circles around your feet, or various Shapes that co-ordinate with various timings making it much easier to see these Attacks, and have stopped using Colors/Sounds to Hint these Telegraphs for you! Think of Ocarina of Time for example, within the text of said game, you would see various words highlighted in Green/Red/Blue/etc. that would provide the Hints for you as to where you were to go, and not have everything laid out for you. In UnEpic, you'll actually HEAR when you've been spotted, or when you've been seen and you'll have to make sure that you pay attention as it will also indicate when you can/will lose all of that 'Aggro' and not get bested!Whew...that's a lot to talk about, but I think I have one last thing to review for UnEpic. The Graphics for me personally are awesome - some may not like it, - the Gameplay is quite appealling to me as it's not truly a Turn-Based style and has it's own Side-Scrolling action/platforming elements - and again, this may not cater to everyone, - the Sound for me once more is still quite enjoyable...but I think the thing that really puts it over the edge (and bare in mind, this is coming from someone who doesn't pay a lot of attention to this particular portion of MOST games...and when I say that, I mean I rarely pay attention to this portion in a LOT of games) is the Story.The Story itself is freaking amazing. Well...not so much an amazing concept of a Story when it comes to what the Plot is. The Plot can be seen as something that's probably generic in a lot of Adventure games - especially when you think of the D&D-esque type Adventure games. You have a Hero - one that you're in charge of, so you're the Hero - who's on a Quest to do stuff! Stuff that generally involves killing a lot of Monsters, or Mobs, and then Bosses...you get the idea. That generally sums up any game really, lol. What really makes this thing amazing, and shine, is the delivery of said Plot/Story.One can take the everyday occurrence of a Hero on a Quest, and turn it into something marvelous by embedding comedy, drama, horror, or even sheer stupidity within the concept! The amount of times I've laughed in various places of the dialogue in this game has been...well numerous! I thoroughly enjoy comedy, and you can't ignore the classics - granted again this is biased as I'm a 24 year old Male - of Fart Jokes, or Crap Jokes (literally.) The give-and-take of the Duo on this Quest - our Hero, and one of his current enemies - is just something that gels well within the game and I would argue, sets a certain tone/mood for the entirety of the game. You get invested in the Characters - both of them - throughout the journey as you come to learn more about not only themselves, but the whole strcuture they're in!Well, I can really go on and on about this game for every little thing as I've enjoyed it so much, but right now I think I'll leave a few more words here for those who are still on the fence about this game - but please bare in mind that I'm probably going to be biased as I've enjoyed this game thoroughly!If you don't mind the Side-Scrolling action Gameplay, nor the Retro bit-esque Graphics, or even the concept of Grind/Farm that you will more than likely have to go through...then please, by all means pick up this little gem of a game as you'll find yourself laughing/roaring through certain portions of the game, and probably feeling the ambience that the general game provides!

												""Wow, that end is really cool!""UnEpic delivers 100%: combining modern ""nerd game"" parodies with a metroidvania like gameplay. Here are some keywords if you are considering to buy it:- Castlevania kinda game- Lots of gear, spells and weapon upgrades- Very difficult game, it will challenge you and force you to use the skills in order to complete the game (played on hard+)- Original and funny, they use alot of parodies from star wars, star craft, world of warcraft and even DBZ.- Quests are hard but rewarding- Completing it 100% was fun and not a drag- 30+ hours to complete single player and there is even a multiplayer with unique maps- Unique graphics: well polished graphics which fits the theme of the game (the store page pics don't give it credit).An important point which is important to know if you want to play this game: go a range (frost/fire) kind of build, melee really is♥♥♥♥♥♥end game and you need range in order to complete the game (it will be hell if you don't since you can only respecc once in the game).CONCLUSIONI didn't like the looks of the game in the store page pictures... but DAMM I was wrong. I enjoyed the trail and error parts and it forced you to play better and make no mistakes. For an indie game they did one HELL OF A JOB. I would strongly recommend this game for anyone who likes the keywords mentioned earlier. "

												Unepic is metrovoidvani type 2d rpg exploring action game. The main protagonist is a gamer. This means you will get plenty of pop-culture references from the likes of Star Wars, WoW, Futurama and many more. The leveling up process is very nicely done, you can improve your abilities in pretty much everything, weapons, armour and potions.  The loot drop system follows games like Torchlight's colouring system, and your inventory can and will get very messy. Lots of side quests with some really clever ways of being able to complete them. There is more than one way for most things here. This is a real game for gamers, I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

If you have any interest and it's on your wishlist you must make it your next purchase.With the platforming and RPG aspects both done extremely well, the amount of content, creativeness, thought and effort put into the game is only more appreciable when you learn this was almost exclusively made by one guy.I've yet to experience the co-op multiplayer too!Ps - Wow, the end is really cool.

												Finished Unepic. ""Finished"". Will come to that later.Premise is simple but well executed with plenty self-aware humor and nods to many cliches and franchises. During a D&D game-night with friends you get sucked into a real dungeon or rather castle. And boy is it a castle indeed. It's huge. Separated into several areas with unique themes and enemies. You slowly get to explore the castle, open up new areas in your journey to meet the master of the castle Harnakon. Each area has a boss fight which drops a key opening a previously locked area. Besides the main quest each area also harbors a Pure Spirit with a quest. These are particularly interesting since the loot is a whole new character skill which opens the path for various spells and skills. On top of these there are also more menial side quests abound which net you either gold, a companion pet or a special weapon. All in all, there is always something to do once you go exploring a new area. These quests sadly are almost always very similar in that you need to collect certain elements in the near vicinity and thus can get repetitive. The rewards make them still worthwhile.The way you beat the plethora of enemies in the castle depends on you though. From classic melee weaponry to staves, potions to spells, the options at hand are enormous. You will need to decide early on which playstyle to choose since enemies become more powerful as you explore further and the necessary stats to wield apt weapon, spells and armor increases as well. Thankfully there was a side quest that netted me a one-time item to respec. I got stumped at a certain boss for good after having neglected Bow stats. This aspect, the stats and immense amount of spells, swords, maces, axes, hammers, bows, robes, armor, potions, staves, wands and their each respective stats you can level up surprised me by sheer depth. It was fun to change pace from melee combat to magic based combat. Weirdly enough Shields are a total no-show. A shame since melee combat ends up mindless button mostly.The boss fights were usually the highlight of each area. They are all very unique not only visually but in their regular and special attacks which makes for a fun and fair challenge even while dying many times. For the most part. And this is where the grand finale comes up again. It's a blunder. A dud. A total wreck. Everything you learned up to this point gets thrown out the window. Suddenly you find yourself under time pressure. Not only fighting a boss but going through a whole area filled with enemies. But that's not even the worst part. You also get suddenly control over a second character where you have to fend of enemy waves with some light strategy/tower-defense elements. This especially does not work well with the game. Having two dozen characters have an all-out war is not meant for this viewpoint. You don't see what is happening, who is friend or foe, even where your own character is. Most importantly it is not fun. The best moments in the game are boss encounters where you have to time attacks, run at the right time and repeat. These fights give you control, clarity and the time needed for the right tactic. The final fight is a rushed catastrophe compared to that. You never feel certain what is happening with all the character switching, strategic NPC placement and time pressure.  And when you die, you start the whole area from start. No thanks. If it's not fun, I'm not game. So I still call this a finished game since I got to the end. All in all, Unepic is a fun and surprisingly deep and big game with passable combat mechanics. This won't be a good time for many I assume. Movement, combat they all feel not overtly satisfying but it's definitely a case of greater than the sum of its parts. Give it a try. You might like it like I did and get close to 30 hours of a good time out of it.			"

												You know what the problem is with fantasy parodies? The task seems to be too easy. How hard can it be? A bunch of old guys with long white beards, couple of mentally disabled protagonists, dark overlord behaving like an angsty teenager — there you have it, add a few butt jokes and we’re good. And when you look closer it turns out there’s not a lot of more than a mix-up of♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, fart jokes and lots of people “hilariously” falling for whatever reasons. When the genre itself is balancing acrobat on the string of heroic attitude strained upon an abyss of mindless self-repetitive nonsense, it's so easy to make a parody that is just bad example of the genre itself. I think you guessed what I think of UnEpic’s script. It’s a story of pimply geek Daniel, teleported into the dungeons of castle of the Dark Overlord right in the middle of D&D session. And if that doesn’t give you enough notion, this magical transportation happened when he walked to have a leak, because he drank too much beer. Upon arrival our hero makes contact with some dark spirit, it ends up with spirit being trapped in protagonist’s body (or rather mind?) and capable of nothing more than talking. And that he does a lot! Mostly sarcastically, and rarely speaking the truth. Believing that he’s having a very realistic hallucination our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist starts his quest, which is of course nothing less than slaying the biggest villain here. And so it starts, the mix-up of♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, and fart jokes and quests which quite bluntly task you with ♥♥♥♥ing an orc; and ex-virgin geek is happy to do it.So, if UnEpic couldn’t give you anything besides this rather unartful humour it shouldn’t be even worth writing about. But thankfully from a merit of a game it’s no joke. The game won’t win a prize for the most sophisticated world, but it sure is vast. There’s no shortage of easily missable side-quests, different enemies and varying pieces of valuable equipment. But while actually there’s not a lot of need for trying out some magic or ranged weapons, you sure can experiment a lot. But hey, no every game can be Transistor and give you a meaningful stimulus for trying out everything. Sometimes the joy of toying with varying mechanics is enough of a reward for itself. What sure is absolutely mandatory for easy game progression is crafting and collecting all sort of magical scrolls, wands and ingredients for making potions. Power-ups help quite a lot, especially on those hard-hitting bosses, who usually aren’t very tricky, but require a bit of a precise movement which isn’t something that can be easily achieved considering monstrous control scheme (and I don’t even want to know into a what more horrible mess it become when game was ported on Wii U).All the downsides of the game are tolerable in the end, when it comes to really superb level design, with a slow but interesting progression path. The castle slowly turns from Terra Incognita into your playground, where you casually go for a walk for another pack of so valuable satyr intestines. Then there’s this key and that key, and new area, and new enemies which require careful planning before you rush off into the battle. Monsters are quite powerful, have the same reach as a player and often enough they output more damage, while being invincible to some types of attack.UnEpic looks, feels and plays a lot like very old metroidvania, and even contains homage to The Maze of Galious, 1987 game by Konami for MSX and Famicom; developer calls it the main source of inspiration for a game. This retro-feel sure is nice, it has a substance of real love to those games, and while sometimes it can be a bit rough to get in to, it sure knows what to do once the player got its pace.			"

Early Access Review
								UnEpic is a great game that I've been having fun with since it appeared in one of the IndieRoyale bundles last year. I've been waiting for it to come to Steam, because, frankly, it deserved to be on here. It's an amazing (Metroidvania-like) platformer with RPG elements, and it has some funny (but also annoying/childish) dialogs in it. The world of UnEpic looks equally amazing thanks to the fantastic lighting in it. Along the way you'll find or earn gear that makes your character stronger, just like any other RPG basically. There are sidequests and bossfights, secrets to find, torches to light, you name it. It's a big world and completing the game will take you probably somewhere between 15-20 hours. That's long, if you ask me, especially for a price this low.Only thing that truly annoyed me was the fact that it saves randomly, and it never shows an indication on when it's exactly saving. Not a big problem, but there's one boss fight that requires you to drop quite a few items. It was during that moment that I had to quit and the game saved my location, but not the items on the ground. So when I resumed I lost all of those items. 'Frustrating' is the word I'm looking for here. I hope it gets fixed before the official release, or that it allows you to manually save your game, instead of the game doing this for you. Ok, ok, enough rambling about something no one cares about.Verdict: UnEpic is an epic game that needs to be experienced by all gamers out there.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Thieves, thieves, and oh, more thieves...It's very good value at $12.99, but even better if you wait for holiday discounts, it's very, very fun for people who enjoy the likes of Maple Story and such.Surprisingly, it really lacks in the amount of bugs you see in many games, most of the updates are mainly just to improve the game by adding various supports. If you somehow lost quest items and other important stuff and started panicking, don't worry, just find a discrete spot and lure thieves with valuables to their doom, it's not a game bug.			"

												Yeah, the game has lots of RPG elements and references to movies and other video games. There are also funny and enjoyable voice dialogs.The graphics and sound aren't something special, but they are not bad at all either.The gameplay is easy to learn and there are a lot of things to customize. Key shortcuts or notes on mini-map are very convenient. There's also a variety of cool weapons, lots of abilities, spells, scrolls, pets and artifacts, unique weapons and specials that can be bought with rare UN points from challenges. The enemies have strengths and weaknesses accordingly.The difficulty is normal to high, but eventually you can move on. Many areas require good reflexes and there are moments that test your patience and they may get you angry. You will die a lot or you'll have to try over and over again to pass them. Generally, all the castle areas have the same main quests and goals. Good thing is that there are some mini-quests and secrets in each one, which add a little bit of variety. Note that there is a limited save system and a punishing anti-cheat mechanism. I suggest you backup your save files often. They will come in handy later near the end (eg. the different endings or in my game, when I had a pure fighter class and I had to kill distant Wyverns with a healer elf supporting them and I didn't have strong projectiles to harm them fast enough).However the minor issues, the game is very addictive, with cool RPG, platform and action elements and enjoyable dialogs.

								To start, I'd like to say Unepic has a lot of hilarious humor to it. I don't regret what I paid for it; for as far as I was able to get it was worth the price of admission. However, the game part of Unepic is very lacking. Most of the issue I have with the game is its repetition and its boss fights. The environments, while decorated differently, are all very samey and monotonous. The interest of exploration is lost about an hour into the game leaving you with a very samey combat system. The humor and story kept me drilling through the same dozen enemies for another dozen hours.The boss fights finally did me in though, 10 hours into the game there is a boss you simply cannot fight unless you have strong melee, 15 hours into the game there is a boss that a melee-centric character cannot fight. And, after playing 20 hours as my chosen class, to have progression stopped unless I completely changed the way I played for one fight was the nail in the coffin.You had potential Unepic but 2/5 for you =\			"

												Note: I haven't finished the game yet, and I'm not even close; but I thought I'd review this game anyway, because I plan on finishing it and it'd take a lot to change my current opinions about this game.First off I love this game, its humor down to its exploration to how everything is delivered, I'd say this game is a definite buy if you like references, funny dialogue and or metroidvania games. TLDR; A lovely metroidvania game with nice personality, characters, and dialogue. Always makes you want more, with very few downsides. Its worth the purchase on or off sale, I've had a lot of fun with this so far. P.S Thanks Mike!Positives:   - Dialogue: Its nicely put together and makes you want to see the next lines. The interactions between the characters are amazing.   - Humor: full of references across the board for ""nerds"" I guess, but you're bound to understand at least one of     them in this day and age (I'm not really.. up to date on anything, and I got a lot of the references and laughs)   - Simple, but challenging:Nothing really complex, enemy patterns, to weapon types being effective or not so effective on specific enemies.    - Enemy variety: Okay variety of enemies, all with different ranges, weaknesses and strengths.   - Secrets: Lots of nice secrets that you can find(May be a positive or a negative, Not sure, depends on the person but I love it)   - Characters: Man, these characters are hilarious, this kind of goes hand and hand with the dialogue. Just love these characters, can't help to like the character I'm playing too. Hes pretty funny as well.   - Combat system: Although a bit of a double edged sword here, at times this combat system seems nice, but at others it seems pretty gimmicky. I personally like it, but it feels like you have to change play styles on the fly a lot.  Negatives:   - The soundtrack: To me, didn't feel memorable at all. I can't really remember much, even after recently just playing it.   - Combat system: I feel it is a bit gimmicky, but its not all bad. I think just some status effects are pretty brutal, but besides those its still pretty good.   - Jumping system: This just feels hard to use, and a bit awkward at times. Its not terrible but most games usually grant you the option to redirect your jump. Its okay, I think its just more realistic if anything.  Conclusion A great game that teaches you to remember your surroundings and punishes you if you aren't cautious. It has hardly any negatives to it besides a few nitpicky things about it. I think the only real draw back to this game is it isn't accompanied by a great sound track. Besides that, this is a fantastic game with lots of personality and I love it. I got this as a gift, and I enjoyed it immensely, I think its worth a buy during or even without a sale.                                                                          P.S Thanks again Mike! I really appreciate reviewing something great like this.			"

												Games that strike a perfect balance of ""brutal"" and ""fair"" are hard to come by. Role-playing games like Dark Souls punish so mercilessly that some consider the rewards too few in between countless deaths and frustrations to be worthwhile. Not everyone finds that kind of torture fun.One little game from Spain takes that challenging trial-and-error gameplay, makes it manageable, and blends it with the style of Castlevania, where every screen holds fresh hordes of enemies and traps, as well as shortcuts to make navigating a colossal castle drastically but not infinitely easier. UnEpic is the RPG for Dungeons & Dragons nerds who ever wished they could teleport away to a fantasy realm of dark priests and reanimated skeletons.A newcomer to the pen-and-paper game, Daniel leaves his table of friends for a quick break that turns into a 20-plus-hour long adventure when the bathroom turns out to be a portal to a mysterious castle.Daniel is much more fluent in the language of video games than tabletop RPGs, which is where UnEpic's humor comes from. Possessed by a demonic spirit upon entering the castle, he gives his new companion a nickname and goes along with what he thinks is a drugged-beer-induced hallucination. He uses his own logic to survive by embarking on quests he's not supposed to and making up stories to manipulate the creatures and spirits of the castle. He tells them he's Saruman or Jean Luc Picard or an agent of the great Harnakon, the castle ruler, so that he can earn their magic and eventually find a way home.As they explore, players complete a castle map and can jot down notes about each room. One of the earliest items you acquire is the most useful: a “halo” that you can hotkey so it teleports you directly to the hub of the castle, where you can recover health and save the game. This is what curbs much of the difficulty and prevents it from becoming overwhelming. As players venture to new areas – the mines full of goblins, the catacombs riddled with undead, the gardens grown thick with dangerous plants and bugs – they can zip back to safety as soon as death looms near and then bank their progress. Even dying only sets you back a little way, as the game frequently autosaves your position.This system keeps the game from becoming frustrating, for the most part. With each level up, players can distribute skill points into different weapons and stats, and the options only increase with every new gained ability. The problem is, overcoming some bosses and enemy situations is dependent on a mix of strengths, but you won’t know what they are until they’re needed.I started out switching at will between swords, maces, polearms, and bows, using whatever one best fit my current purpose. Polearms were good for attacking stronger enemies while keeping them at bay, and bows served me well until I could learn magic. Heavier weapons like maces and axes can break barrels and boxes that conceal coins and items, but swords are quicker. I pumped points into these and other specialties only to discover that I didn’t need some of them later in the game, when I could only afford to concentrate on developing select skills. Instead of continuing to swap tactics on the fly – a refreshing approach – my priorities changed so that I finished the game mostly with axes and a bunch of wasted skill points. Worse, you only get one chance to respec.I made it halfway through without experiencing the sweat and vulgarity of frustration, until reaching a boss that was stupidly hard. Neuron – a giant floating eyeball that casts mental spells – arguably requires the most resources, time, and persistence of all the bosses, but he was the first of several annoyances. Among them are tedious quests, ruthless bosses, and enemies with inconsistent respawns.Aside from these changes, I like the gradual, incremental progression of UnEpic. I don’t fear death here like I would in Dark Souls, where demise means the loss of hard-earned souls, and the game doesn’t grease my palms with sweat like it would in an intense platformer such as Super Meat Boy. Yet it’s just as enjoyable if not more so. New areas are daunting at first, but by the time you’re ready to face the boss, you know them backward and forward. That’s a real feeling of accomplishment. Some scenarios are needlessly hard, however, like the final challenge that splits your attention two ways and costs considerable time and energy to complete. Redistributing stats once may not be enough to carry some players through the game.UnEpic also features a multiplayer mode where you can partner with other players to try out cooperative dungeon maps or player-versus-player deathmatch or races. The pool of players seemed so small when I joined, though, that the matching system didn’t work as well as intended, and it would force me into quests that I didn’t want or that weren’t right for me. I felt like a burden on the higher-level players in my party.For what it is, UnEpic is incredibly robust and never once feels boring. There’s a ton to do and see, from learning new magic to completing side quests and lighting every torch in the castle. It’s much more pure adventure than story, although the game has plenty of both.Recommended "

I loved it really hard and would totally recommend it to a friend.PROS:* The graphics are amazing. I love this 8-bit style games and if you love it too it should count as pro* There are two different views from the camera (I played the entire game 'unzoomed')* The controller support is amazing. I played with diferent controls and they were all fine.* The audio is pretty good too. Each area has its own main audio and the game has english audio for most dialogues.* No bugs at all. On my gameplay (~31h) I didn't had a single bug or problem caused by bad programming.* There are many nerd/geek jokes and references trough the game and this is awesome.* The end is particularly interesting. You should play it to see. The cinematics are cool too.CONS (They are Really silly):* Some abilities are 'necessary' to finish the game (It's not that bad because I got stuck in a single room because I didn't learned some ability trough the game)* Can't copy save or save in another slot. If you're one of those players that save in a new slot every time you save be aware that you'll not be able to do this.			"

												A rare mixture of clunky movement/attack controls with fun intellectual gameplay.  What I mean by this is I really don't like the ""feel"" of your character... like jumping and attacking.   But it's a very immersive system that really takes a lot more into consideration than most side scroll games.  Inventory feels clunky at first also, but the more you see the engine can do, the more you grow to appriciate why it needs to be that way, and how being a little clunky really helps compliment the overall point of the game.  I've never considered a side scroll game to be like a paper and pencil role playing game, but this one does it (I don't mean the obvious humor thematic tie-in, but rather the mechanics, but they both compliment each other).  The game is imensly meta, which I'm not normally a fan of.  But my personal tastes aside, they do pull it off well.  If you are looking for something different, and enjoy learning different systems and differnt types of puzzles, then this is a very good game to check out.  But for sure this is a game for people who want something different.  I'm very happy with what the game gave me through my playthrough.			"

The fighting system is simple but still challenging. The bossfights are amazing and there are alot of them. Tons of weapons and spells, which you need to specialiced, which gives this game much replaybility. Tried Multiplayer once with some random people, worked pretty well. But I think it's funnier with friends. The Inventory is a little bit ""strange"" for me, but nothing I couln't handle. It's like the inventory from Terraria. Music is OK, not more or less. The Story is unique and funny. The dialogues are funny and very well dubbed. Graphics has it own charm. Gameplay is pretty challenging. There are a few moments, when I turned this game frustrated off. But still coming back for more. 8,5/10			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a very Metroid/Castlevania type of game (2D platformer). Unepic follows the traditional 2D platformer model, which it does a fantastic job of by the way. It also has nerdy references  they drop quite a lot, along with some quirky humor which is funny at times but stale on others. It only adds to the games charm though as this is a great little gem that should be played to any one who likes those old style RPG platformer games.			"

												UnEpic is a 2D side scroller game that was developed by one single person over a period of two years!I first saw this game on Steam's Greenlight group and voted 'Yes"" to it. I forgot about it for a while and then saw it was in Early access. I had this game on my Wishlist for a while and eventually decided to purchase it.The Single player game is completed but I found a couple issues where the voice wouldn't come through and it was just the text. Other then that the game is completed for single player and is very enjoyable.It starts off with a group of friends playing a role playing game and then one of them has to leave the table and mysteriously finds himself in a dungeon. Starting off with only your lighter to light the way you will come across a spirit who possess you and add some conversation along the way.Their is many references to movies and games through out and the first one is Chester Copperpot!The game is playable with the Xbox360 controller and was also made to be played with it. The developer did an awesome job in making this game and also to the little things that make it enjoyable to play.I spent three hours so far playing the game and found that there are in game achievements to get that add to the fun.There is also a healing spot to replenish your health and remove any afflictions. The healing spot will also save the game to.I have included a video of my first 25 minutes of play so you can see what its like.UnEpic is a fun and enjoyable game. I recommend it because it really is worth a play!ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː

												If you want an epic experience, ignore the title and buy this game. Right now.TLDR:Refined retro-style graphicsGood humor, option to switch between adult humor and.. safer humorPlatformer, simple combat system with flexibilityLots of items, weapons, and spellsRogue-like atmosphere, but maybe not mechanicsSimple RPG skill tree that doesn't take hours to masterUnEpic, at first glance, is a platformer with CGs and very simplistic, almost retro-style graphics and UI. The graphics may look subpar compared to modern gaming, but remember that the game is based off of Metroidvania, 2D hack and slash with more emphasis on action than aesthetics.When you start up the game, you get a cutscene of a couple of guys playing Dungeons and Dragons, with nothing but an overhead lantern and a ton of beer. Next thing you know, you're in a medieval castle filled with traps, monsters, and loot. The rest is up to you.UnEpic is a great game. Gameplay wise, you have simple yet complex with a basic ""space to attack"" and arrow key movement. Throw in about 10 different weapon types, pets that assist in combat and out, potions that have various effects, and an expansive (it's not that bad) character skill page. You now have a game that combines the best of rogue-like, RPG, hack and slash, and platformer.As for the protagonist, you play as Strider, also known as Aragorn II, son of Arathorn and his companion Zera, the wight of-Nevermind, your name is Daniel. You're a gamer, a sci-fi fanatic, and you have a sharp tongue for sarcasm and inappropriate jokes, especially at the expense of the equally as sarcastic spirit that tried and failed to possess you. Expect every encounter with friend, or foe, to make you smile at least once before blood is spilt.The castle itself is a labyrinth of rooms that, thankfully, do not change constantly. Explore, fill in your map and make notes on what's here, what's there, where your quest door is- Light up rooms full of monsters and treasure, and a ton of breakable barrels. For the completionists, grab every chest and light every torch. For the hunters, destroy every monster in your path with the arsenal of weapons and magics stuffed in the side pocket of your jeans. Expect alarming encounters with big bosses like dragons or worms, and swarms of smaller minions like.. dragons. And worms.Collect materials, brew potions, find gold, buy loot. You want candles? You want swords? You want books? Zoran, Zorak, Ubuntu, and Fedora have got you covered.Do menial tasks for handicapped goblins! Ever wanted to kill the puppy-version of Sindel? How about look for a silver ring in a dark room? How about go rescue an ice elemental from a boiling cauldron?Buy this game! It has singleplayer and multiplayer, the latter of which I have not tried but it looks awesome. Set aside a lot of time, however. Postpone that Dungeons and Dragons game with your buddies until next week. But whatever you do, don't go to the bathroom with the lights off.			"

												This is a game I am very conflicted about. I bought it because I wanted a really good metroidvania type game, and trust me that there is some great metroidvania content in here, but there are a few things about this game that just grated on my nerves too hard and soured what could have otherwise been a very positive experience.OVERALL:Map/exploration: 9/10Items/Loot: 8/10Secrets: 7/10Character Building: 9/10Combat: 5/10Story/Characters: 4/10Humor: 1/10PROS:Huge 2D metroidvania style map to exploreLots of items to find (adds a D&D element to the metroidvania formula)Lighting the torches in each room makes for a surprisingly fun gameplay hookBoss battles feel satisfyingContains secrets (mostly behind secretly breakable walls)Lots of sidequests and bonus challengesCONS:COMBAT:The ranged combat is decent (though not being able to aim more vertically to hit flying/floating enemies can be a slight annoyance), but the melee combat is an exercise in frustration. You won't understand how frustrating when you're first starting out and merely hacking slow, passive slugs to death. But once you start encountering toughter, faster, more aggressive enemies, that's when the problems begin to truly rear their heads. Here is a bulleted list of the issues I had with the combat. They are bad enough in isolation, but in aggregate they are even worse:Every attack by every enemy inflicts knockback on you no matter what. Yet none of your attacks inflict knockback on any enemy ever. They are solid as a rock, while you are batted around like a cat's toy.Enemy attacks interrupt every action you take, whether it's swinging your weapon or drinking a potion. Your attacks can stun an enemy if they are not currently attacking, but your attacks do not interrupt enemy attacks.If you are fighting a melee enemy, sword vs sword, you'll find that for some reason the protagonist swings much more slowly than most enemies, which further allows them to easily interrupt your attempts to attack them. Add the knockback and interrupt to this, and you're in for a real pisser.Nine out of ten enemies in the game inflict a status effect on you if they hit you (poison, burning, frozen) and status effects stack, exponentially increasing the effect. Status effects are a key element of RPGs, but it's usually a little more rare.Given all of the above, you'll find yourself trying to use tactics that avoid direct melee combat (e.g. backstabbing and ranged) specifically because the double standard on the knockback and interrupt is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥that it's frankly not fun nor cost effective to use direct melee. Add the enemies that explode in a huge blast radius when they die, insta-killing you or instantly inflicting 4x status effects, and you'll begin wondering why you even carry a sword in the first place.You could, of course, drink yourself silly on health potions. But I feel like health potions are a thing you use to compensate for mistakes or missteps, not something you drink to damage sponge your way through knockback city.""HUMOR""Oh yes, I am most definitely putting it in quotes. The protagonist you'll be forced to play in this game is the most annoying and repulsive tw*t you will ever meet. Prepare yourself for a lot of poop, fart, and d*ck jokes of the most childish and puerile kind. And don't get me wrong. I like childish humor and silliness as much as the next person. For example, South Park has a lot of jokes about poop, farts, and sex, but the difference is that South Park is actually funny. When UnEpic makes its poop, fart, and sex jokes, it feels like a literal third grader's attempt at humor. It wants very much to be a funny game with funny dialogue, but instead it just comes off as annoyingly immature. Even worse, the intolerable a*hole of a protagonist fancies himself the cleverest man on earth and insists on making ""funny"" quips at every juncture (while congratulating himself on his own brilliance, of course), meaning you'll have to listen to his ""jokes"" (or tediously tap the skip button) fairly regularly.Maybe I wouldn't mind the protagonist if he actually seemed like a character. Like if he actually seemed like just a character who was written to be puerile or written to be an arrogant, self-satisfied prick who you would rather punch in the face than speak to. But what makes the problem worse is that he's not a believable character, because he is so inconsistent. One second he's making a joke about how he just farted or whatever (real comedy gold); then the next minute he's asking a female NPC seven times in a row if she wants to have sex, telling her how horny he is, how hot she looks, commenting on her genitals or whatever; then the next minute he sees a plant and makes what he thinks is a clever joke about growing marijuana, etc. Then after all of that, a dialogue where he brilliantly outsmarts his demonic possessor with reverse psychology and an Odyssean wit. The end result is that he seems less like a cohesive character and more like a vessel into which so many painfully immature fantasies have been dumped.I might have thought this character was my kind of guy in the 7th grade, but I am a grown man. How am I ever supposed to beat this game when nothing makes me happier than killing this unlikable♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again? He's the worst.			"

												Addictive Metroidvania game that leans more towards the VANIA end of the spectrum. I see a lot of complaints about the brutality of the game, but that's implicit in the title and the mocking DnD-style story. That said, I did spend loads of time backtracking and grinding because I Halo'd back to the start to save and heal myself (especially when on fire or poisoned).The game is a grind because it is difficult. Made me think of Circle of the Moon for its difficulty. In the moment, I didn't mind this. I played loads over one month and when I came back to the game... I just didn't want to play anymore.You have to be a gamer that derives a lot of satisfaction from overcoming difficult odds, grinding, and knowing that your exploration will be hindered by getting your butt kicked very very often. I enjoyed this experience at the start, and probably would have finished the game if I hadn't have taken the break.Or maybe not. But all I know now is that I don't feel compelled to finish the game, and I can't recommend a game that I don't want to finish.			"

												I just bought UnEpic this morning. I was immediately drawn in. After an hour of playing, I was hooked and played for a few more hours. I love all the jokes and funny references. Game play isn't overly complicated. I am settling in for the evening to play for a little longer and figured I would take the time to post a review. I highly recommend this game and would have been glad to pay full price for it if I had known about it before I found it on sale at Humble. Buy it, you won't regret it!			"

												This game is a unique RPG adventure. The gameplay is similar to  Castlevania: Symphony of the night. You explore rooms and fight monsters. and more of the castle gets unlocked and opened up as you explore. it has some low brow humor, and sometimes the humor can be decidedly raunchy. but this game is easily one of my favorite games ever now. I can assure you that you will enjoy it. It's a very fun title.			"

								An excellent campaign that lets you build a large variety of characters to tackle the games many challenges. Multiplayer maps to continue the adventure and perhaps try new builds, with friends! A level editor to try and stump your friends or recreate classic levels from other franchises. This is a massive amount of content especially considering the price. Cannot recommend ENOUGH!			"

												UnEpic is a fun 2D/Metroidvania/RPG hybrid.Your character is a guy who is playing a tabletop RPG with friends when he has to use the restroom. After heading into the dark bathroom he suddenly starts noticing strange things while looking for the lightswitch. After pulling out his trusty lighter he soon realizes he is no longer at his friends house. He is now in some sort of dungeon which he believes is the result of his friends putting ""some kind of psychotropic♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in his beer. Needless to say, not everyone will love the characters in this game. Their dialog isn't always the greatest, but this game is so full of references to other games that it mostly makes up for it. If that is your thing. The game has full voiceover for almost all of the dialog. Even inspecting most items in the game has voiceover and IMHO I think it's not too badly done. At least for most characters I've encountered so far. Not sure if any languages other than English has voiceover yet.The gameplay consists of switching between different weapon types to deal with different types of enemies. Flesh targets are weaker against swords, armored targets weak against maces (also maces break barrels much faster than swords), daggers do extra damage from behind, thing like that. You can also use magic spells in this game that you find in the form of tomes around the castle. You first copy them to your spellbook then you can cast them using the different color essences of enemies you have defeated.Personally I have really enjoyed this game so far. I got it on Steam sale but even the regular price is very fair for it in my opinion. There is a lot to do in this game and admittedly I haven't finished it yet. The castle is very large and as you progress through it you must also light all the torches in each of the rooms to fully light them up and be marked as explored on your map. I'm thoroughly enjoying my time in this game and am also enjoying the regular updates that have been coming out whlie this game was in early access. I would like to see another game from this developer.Will update review if anything changes by the time I finish it, but I don't really see that happening as I'm having a lot of fun with this game. 8/10 - Fun Metroidvania with RPG elements and a pretty decent story.

												A rogue/dungeon crawler with cheesy humor and relatively well-balanced gameplay with custom builds. If you love games like Rogue Legacy then you must buy this one as well.Interface:My first impression of the interface from the screenshots was that it would be clunky and complicated. However, it’s actually pretty easy to use and aside from that annoying quest log (It changes it's active quest all the time...) the interface is very well done and not confusing at all. The inventory management can actually be done with a auto-sort function instead of manually having to adjust items to fit them in yourself.Also most of the singleplayer dialogs are narrated and the voices are well chosen.Balance:People usually claim that spell casters is powerful however I only find this true for multiplayer once you reach level 5 or higher. Spellcasters become pretty overpowered at this point since there is no requirements in multiplayer to unlock abilities unlike single player. Completing certain areas or quests in single player is the only way to unlock abilities.  Alteration for an example is a magic ability you cannot invest in until you complete certain quests. Melee class is feasible in singleplayer as long as armor upgrades are being worked on otherwise you could be overwhelmed. Replayability:Challenges and multiplayer are the biggest replayability factors since the game lacks a new game+ mode. Luckily the multiplayer is extremely hard if you try to solo it and even with 2 players it can be really challenging if you don't fully optimize your builds and the difficulty curve in multiplayer-maps, the difficulty feels just about right. You must grind your level, essences and gear in multiplayer just as in singleplayer. That will keep you busy ;).Multiplayer:I missed the female protagonist a bit and the multiplayer code is really bad. I mean, it works without bugs and without crashes but even with the tiniest amount of latency (like 50ms) you still lag HORRIBLY. You get delays that are like 1-2 seconds long and you get randomly teleported across the screen and projectiles and such are all calculated from the host without any leniency for lag so you can guess how that will be... The game's code does not feel optimized for multiplayer at all.You can also create your own dungeons but your progress (experience, loot and such) is not saved there, so not many people want to play your dungeon. You can't alter your own house/town.There is sadly no local co-up as an option to play with your friends in the singleplayer dungeon.You always have to spent at (the very) least 4 points in healing no matter what build you take. There is no other alternative in multiplayer because the potions-skill is singleplayer-only and relying on random heal drops is not all that great.There are mostly US people online and 80% of the games are password protected. If you are from EU/ASIA/AUS/etc. then you will most likely have to find a friend to play with you because the lag otherwise would be unplayable.My conclusionI bought it for around 3 bucks and found the game to be worth more than what I paid for. The game is really well made and you can clearly see that the developer invested a lot of time into this game to fully perfect it. It's also pretty much bug free.Some sections of this review were rewritten by Falem "

								UnEpic is a metriodvania with a twist.Its a game where a guy is playing dungeons and dragons, went to the toilet and appeared in a castle that he thinks is a dream.The melee style of fighting is pretty basic but magics and skills become more complex and powerful. The games got single player campaige is fun and its humour can make laugh but the games real strong points lie in the multiplayer.Multiplayer is replayable and is quite fun with others, the replayablity comes with the loot and the loot is the key to getting better. There's pletty of maps to choose from so the multiplayer doesn't end quickly but if you do complete the multiplayer, there is PVP and VS maps that you can test your might against other players which can bring in quite Epic deaths and kills.There is some downsides I admitIt can feel GrindyIt can feel annoying at times while you die constentlyIt can cause fightsBut in the end you will forget all your worries when you finally get all that loot you worked so hard for in your hands...Overall Its a awesome game that i feel that everyone can play, though some people will have a easier time than others.8.5/10 I would probable give this game if i could.

								I started playing UnEpic yesterday, and had to mention how great it is. I normally wait till I beat a game before I make any kind of review for it, but damn is this game good. It's a Metroidvania-style game with potion crafting, character stat leveling, spellcasting (haven't got up to this yet), environmental traps, and Diablo-like loot-drops (white, blue, yellow rarity items). The dialogue is very comical and has many references to other common games and movies, like Lord of the Rings and Warcraft 3. Right at the start, your character gets possessed by a wraith, but the possession fails, leaving the wraith to bug you for the rest of the game as an alternate conscience. This leads to plenty of good banter between the wraith and your character. There are save points in the game, just like Castlevania games. So, if you die, you will load back to your last save. There are also 4 levels of difficulty. I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet, since the game is currently in Steam Early Access and the devs are still working on improving it. Great game.			"

								Surprisingly fun and enjoyable. I admit, at first I didn't think I would like it. I thought it would be too meta, and the art style didn't really mesh with me. After finding the zoom button (LT/L2), it was much more enjoyable. The interface seems really busy, but you don't really focus on the outside elements as you do with the actual game play area. The writing isn't the best, but it keeps your attention and progresses the story in a humorous way. There are lots of references, which is a type of humor I enjoy, but sometimes it seems like a little too much. A controller is an absolute must for this game, I couldn't imagine using just a keyboard. If you enjoy Metroidvania type games, I definitely recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a Metroidvania done right, in a gaming world where this style is dwindling seriously (and that's a shame). This much should tell any amateur how good it is.I've had several bursts of laughter and many snickers a the scenario. It's not quite easy, and you can always crank up the difficulty for added challenge (not even talking about the actual in-game challenges).  It's pretty nice looking especially with the system that makes you light rooms up.Don't let the Early access game deceive you either. The added co-op part is what's in early access, the solo game is completely finished (and has been for a while before arriving on Steam) and well worth playing in itself already.			"

												Ignore the low play time above. I played this game a lot before buying it on Steam as well.Could not recommend this game more highly. It's a fun, well-designed, game that is easy to understand, simple to play and have a blast with, but challenging at the same time. Voice acting is nice, humor is great, but the dangers ar real... well, real for a video game. The interface is clean and logical and it plays and menu-navigates great with a 360 controller. A LOT of big studio's UI designers could learn a lot from this small, dedicated indie company out of Spain. Well done!Again, if the trailer looks fun to you, buy it. There is a demo but the full version has better sound and visuals and play. Still the demo gives an accurate representation, at least enough to see how you like it. Totally worth the full price. Crazy good steal for less than that. Treat yourself and help a small developer that stands behind their game. Buy it. You'll enjoy it.Happy gaming,M13			"

								The first two thirds of the game are great. A simple classic game play which expands as new types of magic are unlocked makes for a fun and challenging experience. Unfortunately changes which don't make things more difficult but simply more irritating ruin what was otherwise a great game towards the last area.  If you have the patience for the end, or don't mind leaving the game unfinished, the game is worth playing. If not I'd give it a miss.			"

												This is a really charming RPG. At first it seems a bit odd, but once you understand how the spells, potions, crafting, melee, pets, equipments and the world works. It's great. You get a lot of skill points to spend so you don't have to aim into only one direction. I would say you could spend points in 4-5 categories and be strong. I went Sword, Fire, Healing, Life, Armor, and a bit in some others. There is a quest where you can respect mid-game too.The game has tons and tons of cool easter eggs/references about games, movies and more. It keeps the story interesting. The story has it's own sence of humor too. Audio's good, but not great.I think some parts of the game were really tedious to go through though. Without spoiling anything, there is a part where some crows can steal your rings. Kill it and you get it back. But, if you freeze the crow, the crow breaks and the ring too, so it's gone. I think this is really bad design. Rings are not common so you don't wanna lose them. It doesn't even tell you it's gone too. You are just wondering where the hell is it? Aniway, I guess I was just really salty to lose 1 ring... But in the end, it didn't hurt that much.7/10 I expected nothing from this game and discovered a beautiful RPG			"

												Amazing game with lots of humor, and very fun to play with your friends in the multiplayer mode. The basic gameplay of the game is going through dungeons/castles and fighting monsters and finishing quests. Some of the quests in the single player mode get kind of repetitive, but it's fine because by the time you get to the quest person, you'll probably have all or most of what you need to complete the quest (this is only for the quests with the golden spirit things). Otherwise, it's a funny, entertaining game. There are many different types of fighting styles to pick between; oddly enough, there's no shields in the game at all. The single player story has quite a bit of crude humor, and the story at first isn't too intruiging, but as the game progresses, you'll really want to know more about Zera (the shadow) and how and why you got into the castle or whether or not you're just tripping balls. Overall, very fun game.			"

												UnEpic is a humorous Metroidvania style game with a lot to offer for the small price it asks.As for the story, the game places you in the shoes of an everyday guy who is suddenly transported into a dungeon where everything is trying to kill him. This includes the spirit that has attempted to possess you and is now stuck in your body until your death. The plot isn't anything special, but it's enough to keep you going, and the witty humor really helps pull you along.As for the gameplay, it's much like Castlevania (think SoTN), but with a much deeper rpg elements. You can choose to use magic, swords, axes, whatever you please. Each weapon type performs differently against the various enemies you encounter. The combat is simple in its execution and yet complex in the choices given. As far as content goes, there is a good amount to be had here. Not only is the dungeon given quite large, but this game has Steam workshop as well so that you may play other people's content if that's your kind of thing. Add all that with some multiplayer and you'll end up spending many hours on this game.Overall, I'd recommend this game. There's a lot of content and you can tell the developers really put their heart into it. This game is a steal for its price and if Metroidvania games are your thing you would be shooting yourself in the foot by not purchasing this.			"

								I'm not a platformer nor a hardcore RPG type (I like action-RPG's like Deus Ex, but that's different), but the Unepic just cought me. First it looked interesting from videos, so I tried it (I downloaded the ""demo"" from the official page) and realized that I WANT IT, IT'S AWESOME AND FUN. So I bought it on GOG. And a few weeks ago I was able to activate it on Steam (the moment I've been waiting for). Everybody should buy this awesomeness, it's absolutely worth it.			"

												After spending almost 40 hours playing this game and nearly completing the singleplayer mode, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, if they won't first do some research about the game.The game is not that bad until you  get to the point where you almost need some of the skills. Sadly you can spend all of your skill points to melee skills and the game doesn't tell you that there will be a lot points in the game which are nearly impossible without ranged skills. You also can get some ranged pets which will shoot for you but in the end of the game their damage won't be enough.Also if you want to complete some of the challenges in the game you have to play the game again from the beginning. With the points you get from the challenges you can obtain some items which you cannot get without those points.I think the developer knows how the game is nearly impossible to complete if you choose ""wrong"" skills in the game and that's why you can buy an item or complete a quest to respec your skill points. To be honest I don't understand why there are so many ""useless"" skills then if the game almost requires you to choose some specific skills. You don't really know where you should put your skill points until you reach some point in the game where you need those specific skills to continue.And.. I played this game on normal difficulty. Probably the game would be as impossible on easy too if you picked wrong skills.			"

												Platforming mechanics are broken. The character jumps high but not far. You cannot control the character during the jump. You cannot automatically grab a ladder during the jump by simply holding the Up button - you must press the Up button in the very moment the characters passes a ladder in the middle of a jump. Nowhere near Castlevania or Metroid precisive platforming mechanics. Battles seems not balanced to me too. Enemies are uninteresting in terms of design. Overall graphical design is decent and even atmospheric but it's also somewhat generic and doesn't stand out.The level and platforming design on the other hand are good and interesting. Bosses are interesting. The role-playing system is interesting. Many classes, spells, skills and other stuff. So many posibilities. And on top of that the story is fun and voice acting is good.I bought it to play with my friends but the flaws in platforming and battle mechanics killed the interest for me.			"

Colorful and unique charaters, random loot generation for enemies, and a unique perspective into the ideas of Gary Gygax lead to hours of fun in this game.No seriously, don't approach this with the standard fantasy game ideas; you will literally have your hat, and lighter, handed to you over and over again.

Something simple enough to be played occasionally but with a little depth in the gameplay.I've mainly played it multiplayer and it's just awesome. The dungeons are various and interesting despite the 2d graphic style, with many secrets and stuff.The gameplay looks simplistic but you actually have a vast array of possibilities, different weapons and spells to choose from and to earn throughout the game. It can also be very challenging it might take a while to get the grasp of the mechanicsI wish there were more games like this ++			"

I bought this on whim that I might like something to play when I got bored - holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was I wrong.  This isn't ""something to play"", but rather an epic adventure through a D&D style rpg with tons of loot and enemies.  Considering one guy programmed this, I am very impressed.  This developer knew his♥♥♥♥♥♥when he set out to make this game and it really shows.  If you're here for graphics (or hate platformers) then ♥♥♥♥ off; this game is not for you.  This game is for everyone else.When I started the game I thought to myself, ""meh, this'll be a few hours of fun"".  Wow, was I wrong... I have been neglecting my work and friends for a few days now trying to beat this damn thing.  If you want a real challenge then pick something above ""normal"" difficulty, but you will not do the game justice if you play on ""easy"" (it's boring).  I plan to play this game at least twice to try out both my mage build and my necromancer/warrior build.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!?  BUY THE GAME FFS!			"

								This game is one of my favorite Medriodvania style games. Its *awesome*. You are a stoner-like dude playing D&D with friends who gets sucked into an alternate dimension when you go to take a leak in the bathroom. As you can imagine, theres a lot of gamer humor (including one section where the hero has sex with goblin chicks - of course it doesnt show anything.) The dialogue had me LOLing many times. You have a companion trapped in your body, an evil spirit who is trying to get you killed in any way possible. This leads to all sorts of amusing situations.It has an awesome inventory and item system, and levels like an RPG so you get stronger as you progress. Theres also magic and all sorts of things you can collect and spells to learn.The graphics are good, if a bit small, but this in no way detracts from the awesomeness. If you think a game about a gamer being sucked into an alternate demension wouldnt be complex, guess again. The spell/skill/ item system is amazing, the layout of the game huge (but easy to make your way around in due to teleports.)Overall, if you are a fan of this style of game this is a must have. And even if you aren't, its still a great game. Get it.			"

												After a first glimpse you'd say it's just a simple platformer with some RPG elements, you'd be wrong! Game is unexpectedly complex and deep in it's story. You control teenage ""Everyman"" who find himself in a world of D&D after an RPG session. You must fight you way back to the real world defeating castle guardians and, a the end, the demonic master of the castle.Very refreshing game with lots of humor and challenge! Play it! :)			"

												Cons:-Controls (the combat system above all) are not so responsive-Grinding is very boring and unsatisfying-Levelling is very very slow (I was level 15 when I finished the game)-Enemies in the second half of the game has very annoying strategies-Some situations requires specific skills to not be impossibly hard-You can easily be stuck because you need a certain skill-The more you reach the ending, the more the game become frustrating and boringPros:-Maybe, the best Metroidvania on Steam-Deep RPG elements-Very humorous plot-Sidequests are worth playing-A giant amount of items and weapons with different statsThis game was so close to the perfection that I'm sad to put, in this positive review, the negative aspects.I was waiting for the perfect Metroidvania for PC, and this is without any doubt the best that happened to me in years:A Metroidvania deeply focused in RPG elements.However, the perfection of the title starts to fall down just after the first half of the game, where enemies become annoying to fight, strategies become straightforward and the personal skills and abilities of the character have a very good probability to be unuseful in every situation.Also, the low responsiveness of the combat system and physics make the grinding for levelling a true affliction, considering, also, that enemies varies strategy so often that you'll have always a problem fighting because you don't have the specific weapon/spell/potion/skill.So the game fall more and more into frustration and boringness.The story is very humorous and I appreciated it a lot, and the structure of the map and side quest is very well done.Also, lots of items have very cool effects that affects a lot the way you play the game.Overall, this game is a must, especially for those guys that are waiting for a SOTN-like on PC.

												UnEpic is a Metroidvania style game in a D&D setting with weapons, magic spells, and enemies from the fantasy genre.  The graphics and interface are excellent, however the controls sometimes get in the way of the difficult battles and platforming required to navigate the huge castle.  Although everything about this game is charming and detailed, I found myself getting frustrated by constant deaths and getting lost.  However I still recommend the game especially if on sale.PROS+ Unique RPG/D&D take on Metroidvania genre+ Attractive graphics, good sound/music, and decent voice work helps immersion+ Multiple ways to level up character improves replay value+ Tons of weapons, items, spells, and recipes to find+ Large inventory and great menus leads to a supportive, useful interface+ Raunchy humor kept me entertained+ Level Editor and Workshop support means potentially endless replayabilityCONS- Imperfect controls leads to frustrating situations (controller is a must)- Easy to get lost (ability to make text notes on map helps a little)- Navigating huge map can cause irritation (expensive teleportation items help)- Constantly respawning enemies, while great for grinding, get annoying- Found myself Rage Quitting more than I thought I would- Game crashed to desktop on multiple occassions			"

								UnEpic is Metroidvania done right. Huge castle to explore, various weapons & armor, multitude of spells to master, potion formulas to discover, nonlinear RPG upgrading system, clever platforming, both ranged and melee combat, both X-Input (360) and Direct Input (Logitech and most generic) gamepad support, multiple language options, a bit of 'geek' humor, pop culture references, a relatable protagonist, interesting and funny NPCs... The list of goodies goes on and on. More than worth the $8 (USD) asking price.			"

Early Access Review
								There aren't many games that make me want to start them over and over again until I get my character set-up just right, but UnEpic is one of them. This game is a blast from start to finish, and has that Metroidvania feel to it along with a dash of nerdy humor. There are plenty of tongue in cheek references from Space Balls to Futurama, Army of Darkness to Star Trek and Lord of the Rings. I love the opening scene too.Gameplay itself is rock solid, with options for all styles of combat, from dagger to spell. The only thing I would add is a block function, as it can be annoying to have all these weapon and armor drops but still end up taking damage due to a mistimed step (especially against some of the Ghost Armor enemies later on in the game). The difficulty level isn't brutal, you just have to be on your toes and know what you are getting into from the gate. I recommend tinkering with it on Easy before making the leap to Hard or Hard+. Character customization is handled through a skill point system, much like any tabletop RPG would be. You can keep skill points as long as you like, and I recommend only really increasing your Constitution score until you figure out what style you want to use. You gain 5 points per level, though the Hard and Hard+ mode give you 6 or 7 respectfully. The game has a rock paper scissors feel to it, in that certain weapons are more useful against certain enemies, i.e. Hammers vs Skeletons and Blades vs Living creatures. You will still damage enemies, but there will be a noticable difference in how much damage you are dishing out against the wrong type. Eventually, given enough levels and higher end gear, you can use anything on anyone however. The boss fights are huge spectacles that remind me of Super Metroid or Castelvania IV. Giant, screen-filling enemies serve as 'Guardians' to each area, and all have unique challenges and fighting styles that take getting used to. Learning through trial and error takes patience, and you'll get sick of the death music after a while, but the feeling of winning makes it all worth it. There is also a challenge system which increases replay value dramatically. Challenges reward the player with UN coins/points, which carry over between characters and save files. These points are used to buy novelty items, unique weapons and a special orb that will allow you to redistribite your points one time (which you can also get via a quest, so technically, twice). I ran into an issue of losing all my unlocked but incomplete challenges when playing offline, and that is very frustrating. Once you unlock a challenge with a character, you cannot unlock it again, so I have to start a new file to get access to the ones I had listed but didn't finish. That's the biggest flaw I've found so far.I'd like a little more polish on this game before I'll call it a go to, as there are elements of the inventory which annoy me (not having the ability to manually arrange items, with a controller at least, being the biggest) and there are some vague quests that will end up with you having to shell out hard earned gold to get augury scrolls just to finish them (the search for the spirit's name springs to mind. I cleared that Library dozens of times until I figured out where it was). But the overall product is  well done, and with a few more revisions will be complete.There is a multiplayer element, but I have yet to try it out, as the single player campaign is more than satisfying. I say give this game a shot, the worst you do is lose an hour or so on a weekend, and at best you find a suitable old school game to keep you coming back for more.			"

								I wasn't sure what to expect with this game but I decided to take a chance on it during the Steam winter sale.  I'm glad I did.In short, the controls are simple, the graphics are adequate for the style of game, the dialog is fun, and it can be played in short bursts.In long:I was a bit surprised by the controls as the game appears to be a port from a console system.  The Steam version is keyboard  and controller based but you can use your mouse as an alternative when browsing through menus.  Moving is easy for common movements but trying to perform precise movements can be difficult with the keyboard; which was my primary input device.  Fortunately, I haven't come across any instances of this except for the one time I was trying to jump off a ladder and land in a specific spot.The graphics are good for this game.  Stylized and cartoony, they provide decent illustrations of the objects they represent.  My only complaint is that some objects don't occupy the same physical space the sprite does.  In some cases, this resulted in my attacks being off even though contact appeared to be made.  I was able to learn which sprites were off, though, and adjusted my game play for it.  However, this is more a slight annoyance at worst as it's only a few sprites where this seems to occur.Starting the game prompts for an generalized age range.  I don't know of any body in the ""teen"" bracket that would willingly select it unless their parents were standing over their shoulder when they made the choice.  I don't know what it does for the dialog though as I chose the ""adult"" version.  My choice resulted in a few ""F"" bombs and some other crude language but nothing excessive.  The voice acting is passable and doesn't clash with their respective image; dark and foreboding sounds dark and foreboding where geeky and small sounds geeky and small.  It's not oscar material but it works here.Depending on type of game you select (newbie, normal, hardcore), activates specific save methods.  I can't attest for anything other than newbie as that was what I selected to get a feel for the game.  That mode has checkpoint saves and a save location that you can visit to save at anytime.  The checkpoints are not noticeable though and I didn't know if I had passed one until I resumed a saved game.  It's not long to reach the save spot and there's an item later that allows you to instantly teleport to it, so it's not too bad.All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.  Granted, I haven't gotten very far in the game yet but its been fun so far.			"

								UnEpic is a roleplaying dungeon-crawling game. It's a story about Daniel, an old-school tabletop RPG player, who mysteriously finds himself in a medieval castle after going to the bathroom during a gaming session. Once he arrives there, he tries to figure out how he got there, and how he can return to his world.For starters, the castle that Daniel has been teleported to is massive. If that wasn't bad enough, the castle is full of creatures and has seven guardians he must defeat before he can defeat the lord of the castle, Harnakon, and find a way to go home. While pursuing that goal, you can play Daniel however you want, and there is even a character sheet vaguely reminiscent of a Dungeons & Dragons character sheet that lets you build him however you would like. Want to be an axe-weilding barbarian? Or maybe a spellcaster is more to your liking? There are plenty of options to explore in this diverse game. But enough about story and character development, let's get to raw gameplay.The game plays as a 2D Platformer and is actually very well designed. The levels are built in such a way that you could run through them accomplishing all your main objectives and still have loads of material to come back to later. It also features a gate system that leads to a travel hub for quicker transportation to locations that you have previously reached. Combat is well thought out and requires careful attention to small details, like status ailments, and leaves you completely in the dark as to whether most enemies are almost dead, as they lack a health bar. The games small amount of bosses are well-made and put up quite a struggle. These fights are few and far between, but make you feel rewarded when you beat one and have a shower of gold coins fall from the heavens.The RPG aspect is heavily emphasized in UnEpic. There are frequent inner dialougues and dialogues with other characters like Zera, merchants, and all the random NPCs that you could ever want. There are quite a few funny conversations and references to other things like Star Wars, Futurama, and Lord of the Rings, just to name a few. The game also has great multiplayer. There are Coop and Vs. game modes that you can play with your friends (or strangers) with characters you specifically create for online play. The cooperative campaign is completely different from the single-player campaign and follows the group playing an RPG instead of being IN an RPG.All-in-All, I'm very satisfied that I bought this game and recommend it to any of my friends (or anyone else who likes what they've read).

								UnEpic is still in Early Access yet it feels polished all the way through and is one of my favorite games played so far this year. It is a a RPG/platformer with well executed Metroidvania exploration. The game has a very entertaining and unique story that is complimented by superb voice-acting for nearly all of the dialogue. The interaction between the characters is very humorous and really keeps the game fresh and builds up the characters' relationships. Playing never got boring as there is always more of the castle to explore, weapons/spells/skills to experiment with and secrets to find. For a nearly 20 hours game, it's very impressive the game stays interesting. I was also thoroughly satisfied with how unique the ending of the game was handled and won't forget it anytime soon.I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, so I fully recommend this game, even at full price if you like this type of game. Definitely pick it up on sale.			"

												UnEpic is a 2D dungeon game at its finest. The traps in this game are at troll level which I never encountered in other games before lol. The level up system ingame is not bad but you can not cancel the skill you distributed. (Reset your skill points is possible later ingame) The skill list covers every rpg fans needs! From mage, warrior, thief to alchemy or a mix of those the choice is yours and you can have a pet later ingame which doubles the fun :) The multiplayer game is different from the singleplayer game. A lot of new content was added in multiplayer: New weapons, new items, multiplayer maps and new end bosses. I highly recommend this game for every rpg fan out there! Thx for reading :3			"

												I recomend this game, I don't recomend playing it Hard on the first run. It is very challenging and quite frustrating, it was the only thing I had to play (I may have abandon the game otherwise) so I keep up and became very rewarding.The game is plenty of weapons, armours, potions and spells. Many different enemies. Each weapon has it's benefits over certain enemies, but you can only afford to develop a handfull of skills.It's nice to see the character grow and easily crush the enemies that on the beggining of the game were so difficult.The last area of the castle was frustrating, my character was a tank, but against a handfull of mages out of reach was imposible, I had to wander the castle for low level spells I could afford to engage them. I couldn't finish the game, I am not going to spoil it, but I quite didn't like that they change the game mechanics at the end, maybe that's where the name of the game comes from AND FALLOUT 4 IS HERE!!!! so bye bye UnEpic.

								Awesome RPG platformer/metroidvania made mostly by a single developer, incorporating elements from some forgotten classics. It is hard and deep. Probably not a game for casual players or people who can't stand crude humor. This Steam version is definitely more advanced than the original version I played before, because the developer had been busy adding more and more features requested by people, including me :)			"

												First at all, i didn't finish the game yet, but at the half way to  beat up the bad guy, i'm surprise how good can be a ""one man made game"" could be. I began on easy mod, because stupid difficulty and anger are not cool to enjoy a game for me, the first time.Shortcut for magic and weapons are cool, the lock is cool, the farm system for magic and capacities are cool. And to fonish, voices are cool, Zera and The one unlucky guy with his lighter are pretty funny. Ton of joke, ton of sci fi elements. And for some of his vulgarity, it's surely my fault because there is two setting and i choosed que +18 because i'm not anymore a child. Buy it if you like metroid vania, with some rpg features. Because it is very fun. =p			"

								This game is a really solid and fun experience. It has something, that keeps you playing and playing. The keyboard controls are snappy. The gameplay is excellent. The game is a lot of fun. The MP is completely different from SP, since it's based in different maps with objectivesYou can say there are 2 games, SP and MP. MP is still work in progress. I do hope that this game gets all the hype so MP comes strong. You can tell fast enough all the care put into the game, from few minutes / hours played. I do hope they come out with audio in english at least, since t the game with spanish audio gains a lot. I higly reccomend this game.			"

								UnEpic is still in Early Access yet it feels polished all the way through and is one of my favorite games played so far this year. It is a a RPG/platformer with well executed Metroidvania exploration. The game has a very entertaining and unique story that is complimented by superb voice-acting for nearly all of the dialogue. The interaction between the characters is very humorous and really keeps the game fresh and builds up the characters' relationships. Playing never got boring as there is always more of the castle to explore, weapons/spells/skills to experiment with and secrets to find. For a nearly 20 hours game, it's very impressive the game stays interesting. I was also thoroughly satisfied with how unique the ending of the game was handled and won't forget it anytime soon.I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, so I fully recommend this game, even at full price if you like this type of game. Definitely pick it up on sale.			"

								[This review only covers the single player campaign]UnEpic is one of the greatest Metroidvania games I've ever played. The gameplay is simple hack'n'slash / spellcasting fare with a lot of traps and monsters to make sure you dont spend too much time alive. The dialogue can be a bit of a mixed bag with some of the jokes being absolutely UnFunny. That being said, I found the main storyline to be quite engrossing. The dialogue between Daniel and Zera is awesome. As the story goes on, you realize that Daniel has a mature side and Zera isnt as perfect as he claims to be.This game really does so many things right. If you're into Metroidvanias and dont mind some terrible humor, you should certainly look into purchasing this game.			"

												I purchased this game on the last big sale in 2015.  Finally got to play it in 2016.  Really good story in my first hour of playtime.  I mainly use an xBox controller to play, but some keys you still need the keyboard, which is ok.  I love the cutomizining of shortcut keys on the gamepad during the tutorial.  Wish all games had that feature instead of trial and error or major reprogramming.  Great game so far!			"

This game was not a disappointment.PROS:*Great comedy geared towards its audience*Interesting Storyline*Completely customizable characterCONS:*Learning curve can be hit or miss. If you know these types of games, it should not be a problem. If you do not, welcome to a great genre but be patient.OVERALL:This game was almost exactly what I had hoped it to be. I know I am only a few hours into the game (lv5) but I will update if I believe it is not worth the buy. One reminder though: it is still in development. With all this in mind, and what I have seen so far, it is a definite buy.			"

								If you like variety in combat, then you'll love UnEpic. You'll distribute skill points to specialize in various aspects of combat, whether you're using standard ranges or melee weapons, scrolls, potions, familiars or whatever. Progression is a bit uninspired in that it relies on you finding keys (as opposed to special jumping abilities and whatnot), but the combat keeps things fresh.There's also an element of stealth to the game. You can sneak up on most enemy types, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll go down easily. Every so often, you'll happen upon a new enemy type that really throws you for a loop, especially given how numerous they can be at times. It's worth noting that the level design in this game really suits the enemy distribution well.			"

								This is a review in progress. I have just started unepic and can say first impressions are fantastic! I put the game into the highest difficulty right away for 2 reasons; every game I play that is rpg based I want it to be as hard as possible for challenge and longevity, and in this game it actually rewards you for being on the higher difficulty with more skill points! Aside from that the first feature that made me go wow was the ability to open your map and write something in it for each ""square"" section. This may seem like a small feature to some but to any veteran rpg players this is HUGE! Why has this never been done before in a metroidvania type of game or any for that matter you may ask? If you did ask THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER. The map function is actually what made me save, quit the game, and head straight to writing this review!Review Part 2 : So 12 hours into the game and can honestly say my opinion is still the same. The game is fun, plain and simple! Good gameplay, fun story, entertaining dialogue, and some original boss fights. Lots of small features in the game help to make it alot of fun, including lilghting all the torches in the castle, challenges that gain you UN currency which can be spent at the UN shop, and secrets galore! If you are on the edge about buying this game, get off it and do it already. When I purchased it the game was 2.49 it will probably be that way before the end of the summer sale and on every sale bi-anual sale at some point.

								Wow, I just finished Unepic's single player and I am blown away.  This review is just for single player.  I chose to play on hard mode to make it a little more similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all time favorite games.  The difficulty progressed at a good rate and It proved to be a good challenge while not being so difficult that I lost interest.  I had to put the controller down a few times due to frustration but never more than a couple minutes and I always wanted to come back and beat that next boss or get past that next room.The story was good and I enjoyed how the main character related to his situation.   I'm also happy to say the voice acting is well done, especially for the main characters.  They play their rolls very well and never feel like they are just reading off a script.  Wow, the end is really cool!  It had me worried for a second but overall came back with some laughs and I felt good with it. The music was exceptional to me.  It looped very well and never got annoying while I was running around dissecting everything in my path, which also sounded great.  It felt completely in place for each area of the castle and was one of the main things that made this game bring back the nostalgia I have for Castlevania: SOTN on the PS1.  Other things like items falling on the ground, lighting torches, squishy enemies, and shooting waves of fire in front of you all sounded great.  I did encounter one bug where sometimes the background music would start playing more than once, creating kind of an echo.  This went away after getting in combat (because combat music took over) or going to a different area with different, or no, music and wasn't a huge issue.I'm a sucker for the 2D/3D style that Castlevania: SOTN is known for.  While I don't believe Unepic makes use of any 3D the shadows and lighting are excellent and do an amazing job at bringing depth to the game.  I like the style of the characters/enemies and the castle is a treat to wander through.  Everything is well animated and beautiful to look at if you enjoy this old school style.   One thing I really enjoyed was having to light the torches in every area.  It's a great touch that adds to the wonder and curiosity of exploring the castle while giving you that great accomplished feeling when the ringing sound plays from lighting the last torch in a section.I choose to play with my Xbox 360 controller which it detected and is set up perfectly for.  The game gives you 12 hotkeys for a controller setup which was enough although a couple times I wish I had one or two more.  Controls felt tight and responsive and I had no problem quickly navigating around the dungeon.  Targeting can be a little tough if there are a lot of enemies but I never felt like I couldn't get past an area because of it.There are only 2 ""bad"" things I feel I need to mention.  First, there is a (4 screens) long room with glowing white orbs you have to avoid.  I found that the orbs will often hit you when they shouldn't as if the hit-box was ahead or behind the visual representation of the orb.  It was one of the most frustrating moments for me as I kept getting ""hit"" when I was more than an inch away from the orb which would take me back to my last save which meant in the middle of the castle because I was playing on hard and a bit of a run to get back there. Second I had originally planned to be a mostly melee character but I found by the end of the game I found I was using my bow almost exclusively.  The endgame feels like its designed only with long range attacks in mind so make sure you have something long range or its going to be very tough.Overall I would give this game a 9 out of 10.  Despite a few minor irritations the quality of the characters, graphics, gameplay, story, music and sounds is way above average and well worth the asking price.  I have a ton of great memories from playing through just the single player and it's one I will come back to every few years to play again and again just for that feeling of nostalgia.If you're a fan of Castlevania style games then do yourself a favor and pick Unepic up.  If its on sale for less than 5 dollars, even if you're not sure about it, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go.  I think most people will thoroughly enjoy Unepic and what it offers and even if you don't it's only the cost of a coffee. "

												Despite the fact that the game is relatively unbalanced, in regard to difficulty of bosses and enemies, it is highly addictive and fun to play. The game contains great amounts of humor with many cultural references, extending from Star wars to Futurama, that give UnEpic that something ""special"" for a RPG game. The possibilities for developing the main character are numerous and each one provides a different aspect in the overall gameplay. The main downside of the game is the imbalanced enemies (and bosses) that force the player to maintain the balance between magic, melee and ranged attacks in order to be able to defeat them. While some enemies (including bosses) have many ways to be defeated, there are others that can defeate only with the use of ranged attacks and/or magic rendering them extremely difficult for melee based characters. Overall it is a highly addictive game that I really enjoyed it.			"

								Wow, I just finished Unepic's single player and I am blown away.  This review is just for single player.  I chose to play on hard mode to make it a little more similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all time favorite games.  The difficulty progressed at a good rate and It proved to be a good challenge while not being so difficult that I lost interest.  I had to put the controller down a few times due to frustration but never more than a couple minutes and I always wanted to come back and beat that next boss or get past that next room.The story was good and I enjoyed how the main character related to his situation.   I'm also happy to say the voice acting is well done, especially for the main characters.  They play their rolls very well and never feel like they are just reading off a script.  Wow, the end is really cool!  It had me worried for a second but overall came back with some laughs and I felt good with it. The music was exceptional to me.  It looped very well and never got annoying while I was running around dissecting everything in my path, which also sounded great.  It felt completely in place for each area of the castle and was one of the main things that made this game bring back the nostalgia I have for Castlevania: SOTN on the PS1.  Other things like items falling on the ground, lighting torches, squishy enemies, and shooting waves of fire in front of you all sounded great.  I did encounter one bug where sometimes the background music would start playing more than once, creating kind of an echo.  This went away after getting in combat (because combat music took over) or going to a different area with different, or no, music and wasn't a huge issue.I'm a sucker for the 2D/3D style that Castlevania: SOTN is known for.  While I don't believe Unepic makes use of any 3D the shadows and lighting are excellent and do an amazing job at bringing depth to the game.  I like the style of the characters/enemies and the castle is a treat to wander through.  Everything is well animated and beautiful to look at if you enjoy this old school style.   One thing I really enjoyed was having to light the torches in every area.  It's a great touch that adds to the wonder and curiosity of exploring the castle while giving you that great accomplished feeling when the ringing sound plays from lighting the last torch in a section.I choose to play with my Xbox 360 controller which it detected and is set up perfectly for.  The game gives you 12 hotkeys for a controller setup which was enough although a couple times I wish I had one or two more.  Controls felt tight and responsive and I had no problem quickly navigating around the dungeon.  Targeting can be a little tough if there are a lot of enemies but I never felt like I couldn't get past an area because of it.There are only 2 ""bad"" things I feel I need to mention.  First, there is a (4 screens) long room with glowing white orbs you have to avoid.  I found that the orbs will often hit you when they shouldn't as if the hit-box was ahead or behind the visual representation of the orb.  It was one of the most frustrating moments for me as I kept getting ""hit"" when I was more than an inch away from the orb which would take me back to my last save which meant in the middle of the castle because I was playing on hard and a bit of a run to get back there. Second I had originally planned to be a mostly melee character but I found by the end of the game I found I was using my bow almost exclusively.  The endgame feels like its designed only with long range attacks in mind so make sure you have something long range or its going to be very tough.Overall I would give this game a 9 out of 10.  Despite a few minor irritations the quality of the characters, graphics, gameplay, story, music and sounds is way above average and well worth the asking price.  I have a ton of great memories from playing through just the single player and it's one I will come back to every few years to play again and again just for that feeling of nostalgia.If you're a fan of Castlevania style games then do yourself a favor and pick Unepic up.  If its on sale for less than 5 dollars, even if you're not sure about it, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go.  I think most people will thoroughly enjoy Unepic and what it offers and even if you don't it's only the cost of a coffee. "

								At its core, this game is about exploring dungeons.  If you like that kind of game play, you should definitely check this game out.  The story starts out with a group of college guys playing a game of Dungeons&Dragons.  Daniel goes to the bathroom, and while there the lights go out and he suddenly finds himself in this castle.  And so the game begins! (Note that you do not need to be a Dungeons&Dragons person to enjoy this game; you just need to enjoy exploring dungeons.)I've already logged a handful of hours in the game and am enjoying it very much.  I've also played one of the multiplayer dungeons by myself and enjoyed that quite a bit also.  There are of course also boss battles too.The game also has an editor so you can build your own custom dungeons, though I haven't played with it yet.I haven't had this game super long yet, but I'm loving it so far!

												A very, very mixed bag of a game that I very begrudgingly recommend, divided down the middle due to how obnoxious one may find one side.The most blatant issue the game has, and is frequently pulled up for, is the oft spoken of story and characterization. If you don't enjoy the typically trite college American humour akin to Scary Movie or its spin offs, or banal referential 9gag type stuff be wary that this will be an incredibly trying experience.If somehow you can ignore the abysmal excuse of a narrative there is a lot to be gained in Un-Epic. While there may be Metroidvania comparisons this reminds an old fart like me more of the old Codemasters games from the C64 / ZX Spectrum days, games with HUGE maps of static screens and maze like structures, forcing you to backtrack to find a whatnot for various reasons. It reminds me more of these things than a typical Metroidvania as there are a number of rather banal side-quests, usually with good rewards, to plough through. This may sound rather poor, but the exploration and seeing what exactly the game has to offer is its real pull. The encouragement to explore is enhanced by its rather nice lighting system, encouraging you to fully discover the world by slowly lighting each section torch-by-torch, light-by-light to illuminate the unseen darkness in a similar way to how undiscovered areas in RTS are obscured by the fog of war.All in all if you want to play something that encourages exploration similar to the old C64 games with a nice pacing (which those games rarely had), this is quite a good experience. Just be wary of how awful the plot is.			"

								강력하게 추천한다. 왜냐, 첫째로 공식한글화임. 상점에는 안나와있는것 같지만, 언어 선택이 무지하게 다양하다. 한글화에 대해 좀더 얘기해본다면, 무려 ""공식""인데도 불구 심영대사라던가 ""뻐큐머겅!""""현실은 시궁창""같은 대사들이 터져나와서 한국에서 만든 게임을 플레이하고 있는 기분이 들 정도.다음으로 그래픽인데, 정말 깨알같다는 표현을 써야할거같다. 부드럽고 귀엽다! 한마디로 고퀄이다. 고퀄? 이게무슨 고퀄이야? 하는 사람들을 위해 다시 말하자면...신경쓴 부분이 보인다는 거다. 게임 흐름은 고전이지만, 옛날 게임같은 올드한 느낌이 전혀 안든다. 전반적으로 음침한 분위기의 그래픽이며 횃불로 맵을 DIY시킬수 있다. 횃불로 던전을 이뿌게이뿌게~ 기분이 좋아진다.셋째 게임성. 말이피료없다. 악마성같은 게임을 좋아한 사람이라면 질러라! 하면 리뷰가 너무 짧아지니까 말을 필요로 haja, 다양한 아이템과 한정된 시야가 이게임 핵심요소! 스스로 만드는 단축키 체계. 친절한 도움말과 단축키 체계는 사용자에게 최대한 편리한 인터페이스 환경을 제공하려고 한 듯 보인다. 그외 장비를 갈아입을때도 깨알같은 현실성에 아빠미소를 짓고있는 너를 볼 수 있을것이다.

												Surprisingly engaging with just the right amount of snark towards well worn RPG trops.  You need some platformer skills to do well in this game.  But the interface is clean, the mechanics are crisp, and the graphics are appealing.  In fairness, I think it's a bit pricey compared to other games of its ilk.  But if you can get it at even a small discount (say, under $10), you'll get value for money.			"

												You can really feel the devs care about this game. And a great game it is. It's both challenging and fun, with a good sense of humor most of the time. It can get frustrating too, especially the rare platforming parts, but overall it's an enjoyable game.The story is interesting, the voice acting is pretty good, the overall gameplay is pretty well thought out. The combat is simple, but it works well within it's set constraints.The game gets more challenging near the end (hint: hope you increased your ranged skills) but nothing that can't be overcome. "

												UnEpic is a challenging and fun MetroidVania style game that has a lot to explore. This game really shines with the number of weapons and hotkey system you can use. It's like classic style Diablo hack and slash with some innovate puzzle solving.			"

								It may technically be early access, but I've seen completed games with significantly less polish than this. Wasn't quite sure what to expect but thoroughly enjoying it so far! A great tutorial that fits around the gameplay, which allows the player to begin the game their way and not be dictated by a preset scenario. New elements of the game are explained as you encounter them and it's an overall very satisfactory feeling. Controls are easily rebindable and it even recommends certain hotkeys through the game which again is a nice touch.The only suggestion I have to date is the jump mechanism which I feel should be adjusted. As it stands, jumping onto a higher platform is a little difficult as your position below has to be ""just"" right. It's be maybe better if the jump height was increased so that the character to make this easier. It's minor, but an idea...Good stuff. ^_^			"

												Unepic is a fantastic game. I play a wide variety of games and Castlevania: Symphony of the Knight is absolutely in my top 5 games of all time. Unepic captures the essence of the gameplay but in a different visual style and tone.It has puzzles and encounters that really make you think about what you're doing and those moments are broken up by lots of fan-service, tongue-in-cheek humor from ""nerd pop culture""Futurama, D&D, Star Wars references just to name a few.This game is as entertaining as it is amusing and I FULLY reccomend it for anyone that is even thinking of trying it. Seriously, buy the damn game right now.			"

												What a great game, really.  Hats off to the devs for creating it.  I have one big gripe, which I sincerely hope is present in UNEPIC 2 (gotta make a sequel, right?).  Two words: ROLL BUTTON!!!.  I get why you went without shields, but you really need to include some way to evade the monsters.  Jumping is not effective in many situations, and the inclusion of a roll button would make the gameplay so much better.Most of the game mechanics have been outlined in other reviews, so I'll just say that the game is a great representation of an action based RPG loosely based around a huge castle that you might find in a dungeons and dragons game.  The best part of the game is the exploration.  There are so many areas to explore with literally thousands of weapons, spells, items, etc. to find.  Combined with a very easy to use and robust potion crafting system, everything just works together perfectly (except the missing roll button!).Lastly, you really need a large screen monitor to enjoy it fully.  The way it's set up, the models are pretty small, but I'm currently playing it on a 40"" HDTV and you can see everything perfectly.Looking forward to UNEPIC 2 with a roll button!!!H			"

												So after 100+ hours of gameplay I thought a review would be nice. I would call myself a casual RPG player and yet I've only played the single-player mode.I played three characters and I enjoyed the game from the beginning to the end!Pro:Funny conversations (with explicit language, depending which age-setting you take right at the beginning of the game)A bunch of easter eggs from famous saga, games, series and movies (e.g. Star Wars, Star Trek, Kill Bill, Metal Gear Solid, Asterix, Futurama, ...) Pets that assist youan unepic ending, that might not satisfy everyone *heh*Cons: or ""what-I-would-like-to-have-for-unepic-2"" advanced graphic settings, the game looked better on my notebook with 14"" and 1.366 x 768 than on my desktop monitor with 1680x1050 ... would love to select my resolution. Currently there is just a checkbox for making it widescreen friendlyachievements, most of the achievements are awesome except gaining 5,000 or 10,000 kills in one round. While on an average gameplay you reach 4,000 kills it feels like ridiculous grinding ... especially, when the kill-count does not summarize the kills from all characters you played. (that would be nice!)Therfore a 8.5 from 10 and thanks for the entertainment! :-)			"

								Very cool, challenging dungeon crawl with modern sensibilities. It's harder than it seems, at least at first, and pretty unforgiving. After about 4 hours I've finally hit level 4, and have no real clue about beating the first boss. Mutliplayer has worked fine for me so far, and running with a couple friends (3 party max) seems the way to go. Well worth the price.			"

												One of the best examples why metacritic can not be used to judge which game to buy and which to avoid. This game gets a 68 / 100 on metacritic but the players love it (atm  95% recommendation rate @ 2320 reviews on Steam). This game is humorous in a very ""Simon the Sorcerer"" kind of way (you'll know what I mean once you start a new game). The visuals are quite good for a 2D game (I prefer playing ""zoomed in"") and the soundtrack just matches that. Even so the controls are quite easy to learn It's also quite challenging at times (took me quite a few tries to pass the room of traps). Love it thus far!			"

												A great game. UnEpic took me by suprise - a well known formula put together with quality gameplay, graphics, soundtrack and humor. It follows a metroidvania game style, mixed together with tons of humorous references of gaming in general. Gameplay is adictive, it manages to be challenging, but not in a bad way. It has multiplayer co-op wich is tons of fun, and has support for user made dungeons given even more value to a fairly high content.Must have.			"

												One of the best examples why metacritic can not be used to judge which game to buy and which to avoid. This game gets a 68 / 100 on metacritic but the players love it (atm  95% recommendation rate @ 2320 reviews on Steam). This game is humorous in a very ""Simon the Sorcerer"" kind of way (you'll know what I mean once you start a new game). The visuals are quite good for a 2D game (I prefer playing ""zoomed in"") and the soundtrack just matches that. Even so the controls are quite easy to learn It's also quite challenging at times (took me quite a few tries to pass the room of traps). Love it thus far!			"

												Game is awesome. It can take you for many hours. Story is nice and funny. Conversations between our player (i dunno his name) and Zera are much funny. Even *SPOILER ALERT** NPC's like Yogurt are funny, because yogurt is unepic version of Yoda. **SPOILER ENDS** Multiplayer gives now many hours too if you have friend(s). with others its not so funny. I really recommend to you guys this game :)			"

												UnEpic is a brilliant (not so) little indie game. We accompany a real-life 'nerd' that gets sucked into a castle full of traps and hostile creatures, trying to find his way out of the 'hallucination', he gets possessed, by one of the guardians of the castle, which doesn't really go too well for both of them. And this where the fun begins.The whole game is kept in a comedic setting, which is upheld mainly by the witty dialogues (monologues?) between the 'hero' and the spirit. There are lots of references and parodies of different fantasy and science-fiction films throughout the gameplay. The story, even though fairly simple, is actually quite interesting and I caught myself wondering 'how will this end?' many time when playing. However, on several occassions, the humour was just too low and a bit cringeworthy (most notably, 'a dream come true' quest, argh!). Apart from that, seeing the two main characters, argue or make fools of one another was really enjoyable.As for the game itself, I was surprised by the sheer amount of possibilities to build your character. One is given plenty of tools to do the job right and can just pick the ones that suit him the most. I rarely replay games, but I'm sure I could play UnEpic again, levelling my character in a totally different way and would still succeed. The game doesn't hold one by his hand too much, so sometimes a little thinking is required, when trying to complete some quests. That said, there are scrolls sold by one merchant in the game that will point you out directly to the places you need to go, if someone would get stuck and wouldn't like to search for the answers in the Internet. Mechanically, the game was ok. The character response to pressing buttons felt a bit weird at first, but I got used to it fairly quick and it didn't bother me at all for the rest of the time. I think, the feeling of unresponsiveness was mainly caused by the fact that the attack animations are somewhat long and that makes attacking and dodging harder. That said, this is not a trick jump, button mashing game, so it's not THAT important. In most cases, the strategy of beating a room/boss is much more important than the execution of it.As I've already mentioned bosses, UnEpic features some really enjoyable boss fights. Every boss requires a different tactics, which you have to work out in few tries usually. And that is usually enough to beat every boss, except one, which I didn't really like, who is really annoying and requires you to, actually, throw away most of your stuff from the inventory or face death. Apart from that one fight, the others are really great and fulfilling.The graphics and music (was there even music?) is a totally different story and this is where the 'Indie' shows. I really can't tell if there was music in the game, if there was, I turned it off almost instantly and used my own playlists for the background soundtrack. On the other hand, the voicing is on a decent level, the characters sounded as one could think judging by how they were depicted. The graphics is, well, not so good, so this might be a chokepoint for some players, who look for some high-budget, 3d, flashy backgrounds and animations. Some enemies/bosses look a bit kitschy, but to be honest, the gameplay and the way story goes makes up for that totally.I've encountered few bugs and crashes, nothing too serious though. Two most annoying were stucking movement and automatic resolution changes. The first one appeared several times to me and even got me killed once or twice, the second one was a bit weird and might have been caused by me pressing some hidden key combination (no idea, couldn't find anything) and was resolved by exiting and entering the saved game. Not sure if others also got those, or is it me doing something wrong. Anyway, nothing too groundbreaking and spoiling the fun too much.All in all, I really do recommend UnEpic, even at the full price. It is a really fine mix of witty dialogues, crude and/or intelligent humour, movie references, difficulty level and boss fights. What's more, it gives you about 15h+ of gameplay (medium difficulty, all quests), which is a fair amount of time, not too much and definitely not too little. So, if you're on the fence about buying UnEpic, take my word and get it, it's worth it.P.S. Wow, the ending is really cool!			"

												Unepic boasts difficulty as its draw, and most reviews here support that. Unfortunately, the difficulty isn't game challenges, puzzles, traps, or enemies.  No, you fight with the game's deliberate design. The game has no replay value, yet success requires that you make all of your important decisions upfront. Did you take frost?  No? The room with a dozen fire-helms will one-shot you 25 times over while you try to whittle them down, destroying your gear, making it impossible to complete the level.  Did you take Axes?  Too bad - the game drops you a dagger.  You can't respec, except too late and at great expense - requiring tedious grinds through completed dungeons, a process you repeat if your new spec doesn't deliver. Annoyingly, clearly a GREAT DEAL of developer time has gone into preventing cheating, even though it's not a competetive game. If only the time had been spent making the game better...			"

Just because I like and recommend a purchase does not mean you have to agree with all or any of what I have said.  Please consider this while reading this review.  The goal is to share my personal opinions of a game, because I enjoy doing so, and in turn if it helps someone with their decision to purchase, then that is wonderful.[/g]ReviewThis is another one of those ones that started popping up all over Youtube, and as usual I had to check it out.Let me tell you I was not disappointed.   If you go into this knowing what you are going into, which is a funny, 2d side scrolling platformer with decent gameplay and some RPG elements, then you will enjoy this game.  You might think it is a simplistic game with a short play time.  While is it simplistic overal in how it plays, it is actually quite a bit deep with it's rpg elements.  The dialogue is clever and enjoyable, and almost always funny.  The gameplay is smooth and plays as you would expect and is easy to pick up.  The experience of unlocking each portion of a map before moving on (Similar to some older Castlevania games or Zelda) is spot on, and it does provide some challenge.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of hours it took to finish this game.  I figured a game of it's type I would finish in around 10-15 hours, but when I finished the game I noticed I had 30 hours into it.  So 30 hours without even noticing, that is absolutely terrific.I definitely recommend purchasing this game for it's high value and low cost.Pros- Hilarious- Great Gameplay- Fun RPG elements- Decent Soundtrack- Good lengthCons- Some possibly furstrating moments (for some?)- None!

												Here goes a quick trip report:This is a great RPG/platforming game - the story is pretty entertaining, and good enough for me to care how it will unfold. (In a nutshell: the hero is a DnD nerd who goes for a pee on game night, and is teleported in a mysterious dungeon...)Combat is as varied as a side-scrolling can make it really, I personally enjoyed it. The difficulty curve is really spot-on too. I never felt over- or underpowered at any point.The exploration/torch lighting mechanic is really neat, and really incentivizes seeking out all rooms and lights out there. The map is helpful in navigating, but doesn't baby you too much either.I thought the storyline worked well with the dev's sense of humor, and a metric ton of references. There are also challenges and special bonus points/bonus shops for the completionists out there.The single player part took me about 25 hours to finish, so it's a far chunk of content for your money!Conclusion: Buy this if the above sounds enticing, and you don't own it yet!Also just a heads up, Unepic has some of the least funny comedy writing in the history of gaming. It's like the writer went ""You know, I really like Family Guy, but you know what would make it even funnier? Adding like twice as much non-sequiter referential humor"".			"

												This game is pretty good I enjoyed it for the most part. When you start out everything is great and so much fun but the further you get the more some of the mechanics just rub you the wrong way.  The combat is responsive for the most part and the castle itself was fun to explore, the best part in my opinion. The characters will not be everyone’s cup of tea but overall fun to listen to and see how they develop. Also the story itself was pretty solid.I would recommend getting this game but don’t feel the need to complete it, especially on the higher difficulties. The payoff is not worth the effort and the keyword for a lot of the game is frustration.Have fun ^_^			"

Disclaimer:I am not a professional video gamer.  I am not a professional video game reviewer.  I am not a professional journalist or writer.  I play and review games because I am a gamer and I enjoy doing so.  My opinons are just that, opinons.  Just because I like and recommend a purchase does not mean you have to agree with all or any of what I have said.  Please consider this while reading this review.  The goal is to share my personal opinions of a game, because I enjoy doing so, and in turn if it helps someone with their decision to purchase, then that is wonderful.[/g]ReviewThis is another one of those ones that started popping up all over Youtube, and as usual I had to check it out.Let me tell you I was not disappointed.   If you go into this knowing what you are going into, which is a funny, 2d side scrolling platformer with decent gameplay and some RPG elements, then you will enjoy this game.  You might think it is a simplistic game with a short play time.  While is it simplistic overal in how it plays, it is actually quite a bit deep with it's rpg elements.  The dialogue is clever and enjoyable, and almost always funny.  The gameplay is smooth and plays as you would expect and is easy to pick up.  The experience of unlocking each portion of a map before moving on (Similar to some older Castlevania games or Zelda) is spot on, and it does provide some challenge.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of hours it took to finish this game.  I figured a game of it's type I would finish in around 10-15 hours, but when I finished the game I noticed I had 30 hours into it.  So 30 hours without even noticing, that is absolutely terrific.I definitely recommend purchasing this game for it's high value and low cost.Pros- Hilarious- Great Gameplay- Fun RPG elements- Decent Soundtrack- Good lengthCons- Some possibly furstrating moments (for some?)- None!

												So I bought this game about a week ago and I've enjoyed it. The Multiplayer Dungeons and Dragons Scenarios are great, the sound is enjoyable and the many many traps will leave you laughing at the randomness, especially when playing Multiplayer. Me and a friend got onto Multiplayer aroudn the same time and we've been going through the scenarios. With in the first level we were just getting started and eventually we started to realize the DM was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who got off of us springing his traps. Never the less, despite the many deaths the game has kept us laughing and working together. My biggest problem with the game are the glitches that prevent you from doing what the game wants you to do, such as lag issues starting you in danger of the next map, and the inability to toggle the targeting feature on or off which we have yet to figure out the cause.Despite that the game is a blast, we love the references and are enjoying the game quite a bit.

												UnEpic is actually quite epic. If Dark Souls were a 2D platformer, it would probably feel similar. The difficulty on UnEpic is satisfactory and the element of surprise is always welcome, not to mention the amazing gear progression, skills, spells, potion recipes, character sheet and the unique realistic sense of humor found on both single and multiplayer campaings - the multiplayer being even more fun. Controller support needs minor improvements (like in game map support and multiplayer lobby tweaking), but despite that this is a must play to RPG lovers!			"

												That's a bit of a though one. I recommend the game in general since it's story is funny and the meteroidvanian rpg has some really cool bossfights and moments. But it really disappointed me in the end because the mechanics just changed for the last part of the game and you played something like an rpg rts, it's hard to describe. Imagine you get the disappointment for which Brutal Legend was responsible again, just at the end of a game. So yeah, I recommend the first 80% of the game without hesitation, but the end really sucked. Would only buy on sale because of it.			"

												Hi Everyone,I would try to bore you not with the usual review about this game.I would rather like to express what i think of the publisher instead.In a world without magic and with too cold-hearted industry driven sod. Fran deserve the honour to be regarded as a human, in the most genuine way your hearth will find. He've done a really funny game, entertaining in more than a way, he made it so that you'll end up finding the game mirroring something in your real gamer-life, for me it was the master at the beginning of the game that looks exactly like a friend of mine, but most importantly, as a publisher he cares for his customers and nowadays that's truely UnEpic.I would treat him to a beer or two if i could, but since i can't, i'm going to buy a copy of his other game asap, and support him the way an HAPPY customer should... Hands up for Fran!!			"

(REALLY RECOMMENDED).You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller.Has 4 different difficulties. Easy to Hard ++About the game.You are a teen that is played a Board game. You are going to the toilet and suddenly you are in a huge castle. You have to defeat bosses, killing enemies, solving quests and having alot of joy in the game. There are hidden areas/secrets, chests and other item dros. Your character can level up. Each monster has their own power and weakness. This is a truly entertaining game and it's very addicting to play. Becareful of traps and other hidden things! There are save stations and shops.Has funny text and conversations.Good story line.Good soundtrack and music.Decently long game.Good Quests.Ingame voiced over + Text Dialogues.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 10/10			"

												I've had this game since early access back in August 2013 (proof would be my achievements) before voices and weapon skills were added, which made a huge differance.I replayed it from start recently, after getting near the finale and found my build was insefficent, and wanted to hear the voice acting from start. It really helped set in the immersion of the setting than text reading back then.The story is alright, has a plot hole or two in it, and is sorta put to pause in some parts of the game, but it's good half way in before it becomes a bit non-exsistent for awhile.Gameplay is smooth, gives you many different ways to play it and what ""class"" you want to play as with a few alterations to help progress.I'd say this is a pre-dark souls difficulty game, especially at hard++ mode, basically to warm players up for dark souls difficulty of gameplay, if they plan on playing it. It is difficult at first, especially if you don't know what to expect and if there's any work arounds you need to make that you didn't plan to begin with. Only tip I can give is, don't rush through any scrolls or potions you find. Scrolls and some potions are a one-time find per playthrough and should only be used if necessary. Don't rush in spending your points either. You may end up putting too much points in a stat than you needed. Some spells are situational only, same with weapon skills, that you really need to think if you want to invest points, and money, in.The game itself has A LOT of referances that geeks and nerds will notice more than others, some are obvious some are over the head. There's only a few I got, the rest I don't get or aware of.The only thing I don't like is that the quotes and voices for discovering a challenge is a one-time thing, ever, meaning if you found any before voices were added, you had to dig in the Unepic fold and find the voice files that says the quotes and they are indeed amazing quotes that need to be heard/read again. I wish you could rediscover them, but don't plan to re-do half of them.(Thread here for the quotes and what they relate to, but not give locations of them.)I don't have anything to say for multiplayer as I've hardly touch that...-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												A tedious game that tries to make light of the cliche fantasy and nerd culture but just comes across as un-inventive. The combat is so stiff and boxy that most of the time you end up just hurting yourself on the opponent. You can't aim bows, jumping and moving at the same time is a joke and the controls are a mess until you tweak them to 180 from what the developers set. If this game had controls like Rogue Legacy it would actually be quite amazing. Unpolished, featureless game. There are a lot of great ideas and concepts behind ugly implementation and bad, poor design choices uneven gameplay, pace and difficulty. It feels like an indie debut from a very young developer due to vulgar jokes here and there. I suggest think twice before purchasing it, there is a very high chance you will be disappointed.			"

												Some of the humor in this game was funny, but most of it was very painful, or simply references without any actual jokes.Also, I seriously did not appreciate how many times this game changed the enemy types/terrain so that certain builds would stop working. Rather than offer multiple ways to achieve the same goal, the game simply becomes unplayable if you allocated your skill points to skills that aren't helpful in the current area.Tl;dr, middle of the road RPG action platformer with cringy humor and a 100% chance to become incredibly frustrating later on.

								This game is surprisingly cool. I was impressed by the fun factor. If you don't have it, spend the few dollars that it cost and buy it now if you like RPG games.A light touch of humor, and some neat mechanics make the game fun to play.The only draw back is that not everything can be done from an XBox 360 controller. Hot swapping weapons and such since it was clearly designed to be used with the keyboard. Very cool game though.			"

								By far one of the best games I've ever played.Platformers are not always entertaining, especially in a world where most prefer the best graphics developers have to offer. But every once in while, you'll find a gem like unepic. Both Single Player and Multiplayer modes are fantastic and addictive. The single player story is very entertaining, with hilarious references and mystery. The multiplayer mode is fantastic as well because it gives you the feeling that you're playing DnD with you friends, and is especially fun if you wish you knew how to play DnD but don't feel like learning (like me).So if you're someone like me who prefers 3D Action/RPG games like me, a platformer like this may not look too appealing to you.

												Fun sidescrolling metroidvania style game with some good references and cultural humor. zoidberg runs by in a part of the game.  that cracked me up as it was totally unexpected. you'll die a lot getting the hang of it until you begin using the bow or wands more at points. but the exploration is nice and the things you find like the yoda-like guy are pretty neat.  character customization is very flexible you can pop the points you earn leveling up into various skills, which will determine what you can equip and use and how well as weapons had skill level requirements.  some of the skills I remember being making potions, spellbooks, wands, gun-types like a laser pistol an achievement point vender sells (I think the pistol fit into the wands skill), swords, axes, the types of armor etc. it's on the monster daily very cheap so worth a grab. it also has online play, but I never tried that though I think some workshop maps are designed for it.

												I have fallen in love with this game! It has multiple endings so you can replay without it getting boring and a really funny storyline. The pop-culture references are on point.

												This game is VERY good, especially for the mere price of $12.99. Many games that use this 16-bit Metroidvania style play on your nostaglia, but ultimately give you a sub-par game. One that becomes devoid of fun the second the nostaglia wears off. Due to this many of these games are like 5 hours or less in total, so that they don't over-stay their welcome. As you can see from my playtime I did NOT touch the multiplayer at all and I logged 40+ hours. I admit to starting over once to build a better character once I learned a bit about the game, but otherwise that was mostly all gameplay.The game is fun, humourous, and (now that it is out of early access) filled with awesome voice acting.If I could give one tip, it would be play it with a controller. The keyboard controls are decent, but I found it much easier to use a controller ... and more fun since it is modelled after a day when controllers were your only option.			"

								This game when I bought it was fun but I lost intrest. I have restarted playing it and the improvments that have been made are amazing. Apon release there was no voice acting but now there is and I must say it is very good. All the diologe is either funny or dry but mostly funny and fulled with references to pop culture.The leveling in this game is awesome. It reminds me of playing D&D with my friends on friday wheighing the pros and cons of what I am going for and what would help me and my play style the most. I know there are many games that have leveling like this but its just something about the charm of this game that has me attatched.I give thsi game a 8/10 its almost perfect but there are some problems and glitches here and there.

												I'm having a hard time summing up everything I love about this game.I will say that it took me a minute to get into. It seems cheesy at first; got that ""making fun of tropes makes me just a trope thing"" at first sight but it's really just pleasantly full of geek references if you like that sort of thing (I thought it was worth playing for it's Golden Child references alone). Full of potty humor, yes, but I have to admit it grows on you. For the most part I found it tastefully cheesy, if that makes sense.I dunno man, great exploration, every level is its own different, very stylized thing, good difficulty curve.Actually lemme just sidetrack there for a moment: the game was meant to be played on its hardest difficulty, and it even rewards you for doing so. How many other games do you know where you get more skill points per level for playing on the harder setting? Brilliant move. Parts of the game will certainly frustrate you but it's always a matter of learning and knowing how to do it, not a matter of ninja keyboard dexterity.Though I would recommend obsessivly remapping the keyboard in whatever manner is optimal for you.And I don't particularly love the ""trick boss"" as I found him a bit too trial and error, but I respect what the developer was going for. But if you really hate it, just read online about how to beat him and save yourself the headache.Do yourself a favor, play this game, and play it on hard ++.Just make sure you put some points in maces to stop those hordes of skeletons in the catecombs.

												Wow, the end is really cool!With roughly 30 hours of content (give or take, depending what's your approach on challenges/achievements), the single player is really captivating and interesting. The ""Deadpool"" approach of 4th wall being constantly broken (the nature of the game, not a spoiler!) works surprisingly well.The game plays excellently with a controller (did not try keyboard at all, so can't comment on that), the combat works really well (the only issue is targeting - you lose target if you take damage, and it does not remember last target, so at a certain point in game it's a bit spammy - however, you do not need targeting for 90% of the game, so it's fine) and there's definitely enough reason to replay it (various endings and character builds).My only complaint would be that it's a little too melee/ranged focused in the beginning of the game, so by the time you get to a point where a mage build would be viable, you're already 10 feet deep into building your character for melee or range. Can't really experience a mage build until either second play-through by going out of your way to neglect building your character for a while, or by resetting your stats (which, word of warning, you only get one free chance at, so save up some money for spells, robes and staves if you plan to make use of it).Overall, a great game, and I strongly suggest it to anyone who's interested in Castlevania style side scrollers. Time to try the multiplayer aspect of it with a friend of mine, will edit this in the future if it's necessary to.Edit for Multiplayer:Yeah, no, don't, just don't, and whatever you do, make sure that's not something you'd try first. Between the consistant lag that reduces the playability to near zero for almost everyone in the party and the lack of entertainment you get off the main game, it's just not worth it. Multiplayer doesn't feel like UnEpic, it feels like just a random, rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥, dungeon explorer game. Thought this might be something to play with a friend, but no, just don't. Not touching it again unless major improvements to servers are about.			"

								If you like throwback-style dungeon crawlers like Temple of Asphai, this game is clearly a call-back to that age in execution, style and form. Highly recommend. For newer players that expect a bit more in regards to aesthetic polish, be slightly wary, this is more of a love-letter to an earlier era of dungeon exploration than I think it fairly lets on.			"

								this game can be hard, but dont let that deter you!  this game offers a great narrative drived RPG experience that is deep and entertaining.  The dialogue is light hearted as the protagonist progresses through the story, each encounter offering more humor withought becoming repetitious.  the character development also offers a number of hooks to become invested in either the player character or its unlikely side-kick.The gameplay itself can be described simply enough, but the mechanics behind it offer so much more.  the ability to craft the character via the detailed (but not overwhelming) character sheet allows players to customise to their play style.I have read a number of reviews and a lot claim that the game is unbeatable with specific builds - This is not true.  with any customisable RPG there will be benefits and difficulties to character choices - this only forces the player to think about the encounter a little more to overcome their own weaknesses.  I built my own character around swords and maces, and when magic was required, I either invested stat points into the fields I needed to get by of turned to my inventory as usually there was an item or two that could prove useful - this did not solve the problem, but made it managable and in essence - beatable.The ending is truly a gift worth working towards, the story culminating with an air of freshness offering yet another experience aside from the rest of the game but without reinventing itself.The Art-Style is neat and the music atmospheric making this a game that I have already told friends about and more than happy to recommend to gamers that enjoy RPG's, Character customising, action-platforming or amusing story			"

												This is a pretty darn fun game, quite so based on Dungeons and Dragons, unfortunately it has the biggest flaw of a DnD group when playing multiplayer... consistency and the lack of fun unless you have the same exact people there. If you don't have 1-7 other guys to play with on a weekly basis or so I would not recommend it for multiplayer. Skill builds can be quite confusing and there is a bit of repetition needed grinding the first or second area, but you can redo your skill build in the third area, the strategy involved in some of the later areas and player created areas can make this  a gem if you've got a small group.The singleplayer is okay but I wasn't huge on it personally.

The in game tutorial is one of the best I encountered, and the level desing is brilliant. You have tones of things to explore, but everything is within your reach. And most of the time you win battles not because of your weapon or spells, but because you learn something and became better - and you know it.Don't miss on this game - its wonderful			"

												This is a dungeon crawler type game with the gimmick that it has a dungeon master, or narrator, if you don't know what that is, actively changing the game as you play it.  The joke is that the DM is a jerk, and keeps adding in instant death traps and things out of nowhere just to kill you and laugh at you.  It is pretty hilarious at first, although if you don't play tabletop rpgs, it might be less funny to you.The problem is that after an hour or so, the joke gets old.  You're playing a very average game which occasionally kills you arbitrarily, laughs at you, and sends you back to a spawn point.  At that point, you start to lose interest.Worth a couple bucks maybe for the laugh value, but not worth full price.			"

												Definitely a MetroidVania, but my personal experience was that it's imitating the wrong things and not going the extra miles. Perhaps it gets more creative later on, but all I saw before me were generic weapons, generic enemies, generic environments, nonexistant music and a sense of humor that's nothing but reference after reference, strung together with no reason other than to be references.Maybe if the controls were better and some of the other gameplay elements were polished I would let this pass as okay, but the game makes no effort to impress early on and presents itself in a way to make me think it's not going to get better. If it does, perhaps it should have put some of that creativity in the beginning. I've played dozens of Metroidvania games and I've been doing tabletop roleplaying for over a year, and even at low levels there are opportunities to showcase interesting creatures, unique weapons and cool environments.UnEpic truly does live up to its title. I wish I could get a refund for this or at least get rid of it from my library for good.			"

												An awesome RPG game in the form of a platformer. Kind of like the old school 2D Castlevania games but with much more of a focus on RPG elements. Can't really think of another title that's such a neat mashup of the two genres. The single player part of the game is well-polished and seems like it is reasonably lengthy. It's also well-written with a good sense of humor in the dialogue with numerous references to other games and pop culture. I know it has an unusual name but don't overlook this gem!!			"

												Last quarter of the game becomes broken and rage inducing, but I push through. Get to the final area, it's 10 times worse. Doubt I'll finish it because of this.

												You can play it, and it can be fun, but it takes some effort to enjoy it. It reminds me a little of din smallwood in the style of the setup. Like the author made a place and means to make a cool game in their mind, but then didn't really get around to developing it into one. That said, there is the opporutnity for people to make levels and a sort simplistic 2-d light rpg game as part of it, but it just didn't ring with me and fell flat.			"

												I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to any but the most desperate of Metroidvania fans.The ""humour"" is constant and everywhere, which can be good if it aligns with your own sense of humour, or can be insipid and irritating if it does not.  Do you like juvenile díck jokes? Juvenile drug jokes? An a-hole main character with little to no redeeming qualities besides making díck and/or drug jokes? A contrived ""I must be tripping/dreaming"" denial that goes on for way, way too long? If you answered no to any of the above, I implore you to stay away, because those are honestly the best qualities this game has to offer.  (vvv more below vvv)The (English) voice acting is generally passable, though there are a few times you can tell the VAs weren't given proper direction because they'll pronounce the same word differently in the same conversation with each other, and there are a couple points where the production quality was lacking and it almost sounded like a fan dub. Overall it's not too bad, though.The actual gameplay, however, is where the game seriously starts falling apart; the controls are a bit stiff and take some getting used to (jumps are not adjustable at all; you will always jump exactly the same height and distance, making platforming sections either painfully boring or painfully difficult dependent entirely on whether the developer decided to give you their standard half-body-length margin of error or cut it down to pixel-perfect); the combat is slow and boring, despite there being many weapon types (they all feel pretty much the same--attack speed, range, even animations--making the game way more about raw stat values than personal play style preferences, and making you wonder why the game forces you to choose a weapon group to spend points in to raise your proficiency when it all seems so arbitrary, especially when the game throws out the window any sort of sense it had been making before, when it starts giving you daggers that are stronger than axes of comparable level); enemies, while having many different appearances, tend to fall into very general categories (runs-at-you, shoots-at-you, doesn't-move-at-all, or ignores-you-and-patrols), making the already slow and boring combat now also tedious; boss encounters are incredibly boring, having very basic attack patterns you learn in just a couple seconds and essentially being damage sponges with unfair expectations of positioning using the stiff and monotonous jumps to avoid 30%+ attacks.Now I know what you're thinking, if the story and combat aren't very good, then the exploration and level design must be, right? Because otherwise what's the point of a Metroidvania game?  I'm sorry, but the exploration is equally dumb and boring; along with jumps that never change you get movement speed that never changes (regardless of whether you're wearing light, medium or heavy armour) and zero movement-based abilities (no sprints, no walking, no lunges, no ripostes, no dodges, no double-jumps, no floats to slow descent and give you a way to reach a far-off platform, nothing)... So, what stops you from just going to the end of the game right from the beginning? Locked doors, which you get the keys to by beating bosses. That's it.  Sure, this is essentially the same thing as blocking off the next section of the castle by a double-jump-height platform, but those extra ways of navigating are what opens up level design possibilities, letting you hide powerups or items in early areas behind things you can't get by until later, letting you spice up later zones with different layouts than earlier ones because now you can move in all sorts of new and interesting ways, but this game doesn't have any of that.  Once you unlock a door to a new section of castle, you can fully-explore that section right now, meaning the only reason to ever enter a previously-beaten section of castle is if there's another locked door in it to get to another boss that holds another key for another locked door somewhere else.And I'm not even going to get into the absurdity of the leveling system this game has, where every level you're given a set number of points you can use to increase attributes, with the only respec option being incredibly costly and late-game, and things not even being shown as possible options until you unlock them.  Meaning at level 8, after you've already invested seven levels of points into different stats and you have a plan for how to distribute your stuff for the rest of the game, you're given a whole new stat that you'll suddenly need to put points into.  And that happens multiple times throughout the game.I have really been nothing but disappointed with this game.			"

												I was really on the fence here.  The reason I finally went to ""not recommended"" is because the frustration outweighed the positives.  There's a lot to like, if you're very forgiving and not easily annoyed.  Can't say I am.  Really not sure why so many consider this a gem.  I was playing on normal mode with a PS3 controller.  I'm almost halfway through the game.Pros:-Long quest(I didn't finish)-fully voiced-tons of items and secrets-pretty well designed levels-decent music-nice easter eggs-sprites are pretty well done-levels are designed well for the most part.  I like the teleport room, allowing you to return to previous areas without having to walk all the way there.-Map is well done, allowing you to take notes-Can be quite addictive once you get the hang of it.Neutral:-difficulty ramps up pretty fast.  -no hints given for secret walls-sort of random where you respawn upon dying-The humor wasn't funny to me at all, but some might like it.  I found the protagonist to be an obnoxious, pompous, fart joke spewing turd.  The excessive swearing doesn't seem natural, and I'm someone that swears often.  I did like a few of the jokes aimed at classic games though.Negative:-enemys always fire faster than your spells-Status effects are brutal.  Two fire ball hits and you're toast.  And the ones that stay in your inventory are super annoying.  You'll open your inventory to get rid of one only to get hit again by the time you do.-button assignments often don't work.  Mostly with spells-can't aim past 45 degrees up.  -Backgrounds are pretty lackluster.  All areas, while different, feel very similar.-aiming reticle keeps going off, forcing you to re-aim and get lit up by fireballs-spell casting and potion drinking animations are too long-certain wands have 20 shots and cannot be refilled-excess quest items can't be sold and clog your inventory-jumping is just off-hard to describe but it's just not fluid like Castlevania games are.-never granted special abilities like double jump- all ability enhancers are temporary.  New areas are unlocked by keys rather than a new ability which is far less fun.-can't respec skill points until you get some item.  The skill point system is just a mess in general.  And you not only need to pump skill points to use that armor/weapon.  You need to be that level as well.  The skill points should have been to enhance your character, and your level should dictate your ability to use certain weapons.-far too heavily reliant on potions which you must put skill points into to make.  This means you're weak with lots of good potions, or strong but screwed if you're low health.-My controller has the down button permanently pressed in menus.  Only in this game, and only in menus. Super annoying when the game doesn't pause in menu.I know I just gave a lot of negatives but the game does have a wealth of content and is as addictive as many ""metroidvania"" games.  I just felt too often that the odds were stacked against me for no reason and it totally hampered my enjoyment.  I would suggest trying it for a few hours and returning it if you have the same issues.  Steam will refund if you don't exceed 5 hours of gameplay.I got to the Neuron boss, almost had him beat after draining/pouring out most of my potions only to have him teleport me to the save point in the beginning.  Of course I saved by accident.  So now I'm potionless unless I grind for ingredients and levels so I can craft better potions.  Of course I had to slog back to his lair to collect all the ones I had to drop so he wouldn't make me pour them out(which he does).  He also silences you so you can't rely on heal magic.  Not a hard boss if you're prepared, but when one try drains all your resources...♥♥♥♥ that!  Overall: 6.5			"

												My long winded review keeps failing to post so I'll make it quick:Pros:- Weird and unique story was appealing.- Decent boss design.Cons:- Rigid solutions to problems near the end game, while insufficient amounts of ways to respec.- Most of the ""difficulty"" is ""repeat the last 15 minutes because you made a mistake"" or ""you didn't know that instant death trap was there"".- The rest comes from things like ""a jester messed up your weapon, spend 20 minutes killing weak monsters to fix it""- You won't beat this game if you're a poor multi-tasker, as right at the end they add RTS/Tower Defense elements.- Bad play control and basic things like equipping and removing weapons are sluggish, since they tie to the animations.- Complete lack of manual aim, forcing you to use auto-aim for monsters that fly around. (resulting in many irritating misses that a skilled player with manual aim could avoid) The auto-targeting system also makes it extremely difficult to get the desired target. This makes that difficult ""final dungeon"" I talked about an absolute nightmare, because there are monsters that have a circular pattern, effectively defeating auto-aim and forcing you to find very narrow attack windows while the clock is ticking.I don't mind difficult, but it needs to be fair to the player and polish what needs polishing. Some minor changes could be a huge improvement.			"

								UnEpic starts with you sitting with some friends playing some D&D, when you announce that you need to use the restroom.  While in the bathroom, the lights go out, and upon lighting your lighter, you find yourself in a dark castle corridor.  Thus is the setting of UnEpic's story;  an ongoing question of whether this is all going on in your character's head (he assume's his friends slipped drugs in his beer) or if you've actually been teleported somewhere else.  How that story resolves, however, shall likely remain a mystery to this writer, as sadly, UnEpic is exactly that.The gameplay uses the tried-and-true ""Metroidvania"" formula to present you with a side-scrolling Action/RPG where you can choose to be any number of character ""classes"" by way of which weapons, armor and spells you prefer to upgrade; though if you chose anything other than a potion-making Warrior with only a slight dabbling of magic, you chose poorly and will likely have a very hard game ahead of you.  And thus enters the very first problem with UnEpic, even if you know how you want to play the game, it doesn't matter unless your choice meshes with the design of the game.  The game sort of makes-up for this by offering a quest that gives you a reset of your spent skill points roughly halfway through the game, but even that reeks of too little, too late in this pseudo-difficulty-based game.Just what do I mean by that?  When I say ""pseudo-difficulty"" I'm generally referring to the practice of making a game artificially harder by testing the player's patience rather than by testing the player's skill.  In this game, it comes in the form of every section of the dungeon having it's own hurdle to deal with.  Whether you're in the Catacombs where the game floods you with enemies (of whom you can only hit one at a time while the others are free to swing at you freely), or in the Halls where the majority of enemies take zero recoil and deal massive damage with their attacks, there isn't a single area in UnEpic that was a joy to explore and conquer.  Rather the game felt more like a slog.The only reason I made it as far as I did in the game is because I wanted to at LEAST beat the game; but I can't do it.  It's not for anything actually ""hard"", so-much as I just got sick of dealing with all the hurdles.  There's a fun game buried somewhere in all of that code, but sadly the developers don't know how to bring it out.  They were so hell-bent on making the game ""harder"", without actually knowing how to make a game challenging, that they've buried whatever fun might be had with UnEpic under a landslide of bothersome gameplay and bosses that often feel more like battles of attrition than actual tests of skill.

												This game is not fun. It's got the skeleton of something fun, but the designer just straight up ruined it with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just off the top of my head:- You get 1 relatively cheap character respec, and after that you're basically screwed.- The above wouldn't be so bad, except that 4/5ths of the way through the game, there is a boss that can only be hit with ranged attacks. If you've spec'ed a melee character...- A boss that randomly teleports you back to the central save point, forcing you to navigate back. Great thanks, real fun.- A status affliction that lasts 30+ seconds and causes you to constantly drop whatever weapon you're holding- Enemies that transform your weapon into a piece of junk, with a prohibitively high cost to change it back- Invisible enemies that can only be seen with a limited resource potion (unless you've spec'ed into potions).- Those same invisible enemies steal your weapons, so even if you wanted to just run past them, you're forced to fight themI put up with all of that garbage and more until I got to the final ""boss"", which was just the stupidest♥♥♥♥♥♥in the world. Not fun, not gonna do it, no thanks.And don't even get me started on the script/dialog. I'm the sort that usually rolls their eyes at people who complain about unbearable characters in games, but good lord this game is just beyond the pale. Even you insist on punishing yourself with a playthrough of this game, trust me and just skip ALL dialog.			"

												Honestly it almost hurts to have to rate this game down. The entire game leading up to the end is absolutely AMAZING. But the ending is so terrible and cosmically unfun that it ruins the entire rest of the otherwise spectacular game.The ending I'm reffering to (without spoilers) has you using a god awful game mechanic of swapping between two places at once and micromanaging two nearly impossible battles simotaniously. Even worse? It's got a damn invisible countdown timer. (By this I mean the difficulty ramps up over time until you are guaranteed to lose.)Without spoiling the ending (Which I can only spoil story-wise since the gameplay sucks so badly it's past spoiling and is flat out rotten already.) I can't divulge more details. But suffice to say it totally ruined an amazing game for me. I'll never finish this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

The tutorial alone is broken and getting the hang of the game is really painful.Bug reports are being ignored, because the developer focussed on his new project.Aside from that, I find the lacking character customization a huge letdown. I'd love to play a female character, but sadly I cannot.Further, the game ""allows"" you to ruin your own experience by demanding a certain character build. If you - for instance - only skill in melee skills, then you'll be stuck further down the line.In summary: The game is unfinished, riddled with bugs and won't ever be fixed.

												UnEpic is a totally un-unepic experience. I put 31 hours into this non-epic epic and all i have to show for it is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trading cards. Digital ones.The story begins as the young adventurer is awoken by his mother. You then must follow a standard rpg style text adventure to perform simple daily tasks, which include, but are not limited to, finding your pants, putting on said pants, taking out the garbage, and farming lots of gold on the MMORPG that you play religiously (ironically, it is called MOM; Murderers of Mancroft).You must simultaneously manage your character's many wants and needs, which include hunger, thirst, bathroom breaks, desire to live, coolness, attractiveness, hygiene, height, body mass, desire to eat worms, aptitude in particular water aerobics situations, breakdancing, being the homecoming queen/king/gendernonconforming-leader-person, hair, meta-game awareness, ludo-narritive cognisance, and general viscosity.After about 23 in-game hours, Ludacris, yes the rapper, shows to put you in your place. It was, hands down, the best this game has to offer when this event triggers a streets of rage-esque minigame starring Luda AND YOU!!!The fun doesn't last long however, as you quickly realize you are running low on breakdancing willpower and you have eaten too many worms.Overall, I give this game, a solid thumb up the developers' collective♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I like the idea they had, I just don't like the execution of it. Just got past the first boss only to get poisoned to death by undodable snakes, three times.  This wouldn't be so bad if the boss fight itself wasn't so terribly dull (or a decent autosave feature, I mean if I'm going to die this much, at least autosave after I beat a boss).  Honestly if my character had any method of defending himself (outside of just standing there and swinging more) this would be a significantly more interesting game.  As it is the fighting feels like D&D where the fighters just stand there and swing until someone dies.   If this was a conscious design choice I don't really agree with it. The other problem i've noticed is the main character isn't terribly likeable, I mean sure he's got some ♥♥♥♥♥in' references but he seems rather douchy.			"

								UnEpic is a great fantasy RPG platformer built by a single developer.  It has decent artwork, funny writing, and a lot of hidden complexity.  The bosses and some areas can be unforgiving until you figure out a good strategy, at which point you'll be amazed you didn't figure it out sooner.  The effort the developer put into this game can be seen in many nice little elements.  For example, your progress through each room is saved in the form of torches that, once activated, stay lit permanently.			"

												I really hated this game. I played 2 player with my friend who asked me to get it.The game opens terribly, with characters unlikeable on purpose, but the job there is done too well. A stereotypical troll DM tries to give the player a bad game session.The controls are dull and the combat feels like a challenge, rather than something that flows easily. Your HP sucks, so every encounter is dangerous and the path isn't revealed, so you can round a corner into a sword in your chest. All the while, the DM/narrator laughs at your failures and picks his nose.Many points in the game we were both stuck to find the path forward. The path forward after 15min of trying to jump into the abyss for a solution turned out to be ""get really to that wall at the end of the platforming (no, closer than when you tried that already 15min ago) and THEN search for a hidden wall"". You know, instead of a door.We came to our first boss. It was a poo. It was literally a giant poo the size of an elephant. It doesnt move, you just jump into the room of death and when you attack it, it shoots smaller poo at you, which kills you. If you try to kill the small poo, the bad controls will guide you into them and kill you. If you evade the small poos, every hit you inflict on the poo will spawn a small one. It takes well over a hundred basic attacks to kill it. You see why this plan sucks.The game spends your first 40min trying to make you hate it. And it succeeded too well. There was nothing fun, funny, or any sense of progression.			"

												Worth buying? Not if you like to play your game, your way.UnEpic is a game which has made some design decisions I disagree with intensely. For example, you only get the most skill-points on level-up when you're playing on the super-hard game mode, which among other things actually disables the autosave, making it entirely possible for one keyboard mistake to cost you two hours of your life. But without those two extra skill points per level, you're always going to be hurting for skill points, lacking in enough points to do what you want to do.So, I tried to do what I always do: bust out CheatEngine and give myself enough skill points to where I felt comfortable playing. Only then, however, did I realize that owing to early whining about cheating on the forums, the dev has instituted absolutely draconian anti-cheating measures that will wipe out your save games, and cooked them into both singleplayer and multiplayer, rather than, say, going with VAC, or instituting a system in which your client determines if you're playing with a cheater and allowing you to make the decision to not play with them or to continue to play with them.So, is UnEpic worth it? Not if you like to play by your own rules. Not if you want to play for the story and happen to be somewhat bad at platformers, and in multiplayer, especially not if you like a game where you can be free from unreasonable death and respawn-grinding extremely difficult mobs.

												I thought I'd enjoy this but found the mechanics and grinding aspect off-putting. The game has many hours of game play which is a plus but a lot of those are spent trying to figure out where you're going or back tracking to level up to do the next part. This game seems to punish those who want to 'figure it out as they go' in terms of stats, you'll find yourself quite hamstrung if you didn't pick a focus and tried to go all around with your points. There also isn't a good variety when it comes to the best weapons and unless you're psychic knowing what you'll find first and last so you can specialize in time is daunting. To add fat to the fire, if you decide you'd like to cheat (for sake of getting through the story and not having to stress over points) your character just dies. The developer is very against it. For me that's a deal breaker, it might not be for you.			"

												When I got this game on Humble Bundle, it seemed pretty good. The Single Player campaign has voice acting, potion crafting, stores, and item binds. If this game is on sale and you only want to play SP, it seems fine.The multiplayer is an atrocity.The very first level has countless BM instakill traps, mitigated at least, by the only penalty to death being respawning at your last checkpoint (which may be uneven with your teammates' due to the coffin system), then running all the way back. It also has a part where you must use the knowledge they NEVER SO MUCH AS HINTED AT that some walls vanish when struck, a boss that will surely kill you if allowed to get off its one attack, which it likely will unless you take the battle at a dreadful grind, and a lesson that in MP, all of your restorative items vanish between dungeons.MP also made much more clear and frustrating a couple of overarcing issues present in Single Player. First of all, the weapons are NOT equal. Axes are pretty useless, which made it a problem when, while attempting to type, my friend permanently put all of his points from levelling up into axes. No confirmation, no undoing, no respec until much later in the game. Use axes or waste the points.Multiplayer is just miserible. The level design is atrocious, a single misspec is easy to make and ludicrously difficult to repair, and at high levels your top-tier gear can be easily permanently destroyed or stolen.			"

												The frustrating and bad outweighs the good - and there is good, to be sure. Controls are the chief issue: they're floaty and slow. This matches the snail-strapped-to-an-anvil pace of the game pretty well, but makes each death due to boring mechanical challenges that much more dull. (Dodge the rocks! Now do it again! And again! And now do it all again for achievement point currency! Traps! You like traps? How about traps that randomly respond differently? Will the spear trap hit you if you stand on the edge of the button, or not? Who knows! How exciting! Have fun Haloing back to the save point and slowly walking all the way back! Want to hop off that ladder onto the nearby ledge? Good luck, chum! Want to duck? Too bad, there's a ladder, down you go! Want to jump? I just told you about ladders, bro! I told you!)There rapidly comes a point where you recognize exactly what you need to do to get to where you need to be, but no longer have any interest in progressing because of how tedious it is. Throw in janky melee combat and a far-too-limited RPG mechanics system, and you end up with something... well, you can't say the title didn't warn you.Much of the game can be summed up by one of the opening scenes: there's obviously cursed gold lying around. You can pick it up, if you want. If you do, you do not fight a demon, or invoke a penalty, or trigger some wacky conversation halfway on into the game. You just slowly die, without the ability to drop the gold because the game hasn't given you the ability to put things down yet. And then you go all the way back to the start of the game. It's not unfair, it's just dull, and more interested in punishing the player with boredom than being exciting.On the plus side: the writing is a potential strength, if you like reference humor. Most people seem to. Voice acting isn't the worst. Some lines aren't voiced, apparently at random, but most of it is, and it's done with decent quality (though the main character sounds fittingly like a nerd). Big plus: you can wear eight rings. That is two to four times as many as most RPGs allow, and accessory slots are like crack for RPG players. The game can be cute - as in, ""nearly clever"" - fairly often. The graphics are excellent for the genre, and I quite like how lighting is handled. The hotkeys are not at all bad, either, and the menu navigation is a breeze. It really comes down to the controls, I found: if they were a bit better, the game would be much better.Ultimately, this just wasn't the action-dungeoncrawler I was looking for.			"

												Bought this game in the steam sales but I wished I didn't bother. Enjoyed the game right up until my first challenge in the game. From what I gathered, you need to complete these special challenges to get special coins to spend at special vendors. Nice idea I thought and I was keen to find my first challenge and earn some coin. After spending many many hours over the past week on the first challenge in this game, the boulder challenge, I decided to delete the game from my steam folder today. Why, because I simply didn't enjoy spending hours of my precious spare time waiting to be 'lucky' by this totally crappy implemented challenge. A rinse and repeat, load and reload, keep trying till you eat your controller challenge and only when you get lucky enough to fluke your way past this challenge 'might' you find some enjoyment out of the time you spend on it, thanks but no thanks. Perhaps if this was the final challenge or closer to the end of the game, I would have over looked or understood the nature of this challenge and either move on to something else or spend more time on it in order to complete it and the game itself. But as it was my first challenge and there is no way to learn, predict or progress through it without being complety blessed by luck, I felt that this was poorly implemented and far too early in the game to get such a 'silly' challenge. I watched several Utube vids on this challenge, incase I was being a noob, but nearly all comments agreed this challenge can only be done by being very lucky, the few who managed to finish the challenge said it took 500+ tries, @5-6 hours on 1 challenge and that in my mind, is not fun in any shape or form. I simply do not want to invest any more time into this game as I fear the other 'so called' challenges will be anything like this, I really do not want to know or find out.I have been playing games since the days of Pong, played the best and the worst, hardly ever bother writting a review, which is usually a positive review of a game that I really enjoyed, but this imo deserved a negative review from me. I may have been unlucky, this challenge might be the hardest challenge in the game, maybe the rest of the game is the best ever but with me, first impressions last. I feel like I wasted enough of my precious spare time over the past few weeks on this one game, with 75% of that time spend on just this one challenge alone. I didn't get much enjoyment nor satisfaction from this purchase. I enjoy most games with challenges if they are based on logic/progress/learning/clues/skill with gradual increase in difficulty and an incentive to complete it. Anyhow, my experience with this game has left me with a vile taste for both the game and its developers. I shall be very cautious with any future products from them and probably make a point to avoid games made by them as I fear it will contain similar game mechanics which I personally do not enjoy.My 2cs.

												I purchased this title via the Humble Indie Bundle 14. I fealt due to the overall vibe of the product going to the ""good old pen and paper RPG roots"", I should play it with the keyboard. The control scheme on the keyboard feels very clunky. While it is possible to rebind keys, previously assigned keys aren't overwritten and one cannot assign keys to the mouse. This may be on purpose given the overall setting of the game... It is still a usability nightmare.It's unique selling point, as far as I can tell, is the overall tone of nerdy jokes, meme references, and the overall intention of being funny. During the initial gameplay session, I if at all giggled slightly. No I mean, really, this game is as funny as, quote, ""I am Arathorn ..."" No sorry, can't continue here.The combat mechanics are ... basic. They felt button-mashy and not very rewarding.Is there anything I like about the game? Hm. Yeah, the animation when you light torches etc. looks a little like you are peeing at something. ""Hrhr, peed torch on!"" (giggles) was, I guess, my biggest enjoyment throughout the 1st 30ish minutes playing UnEpic. /UnInstall			"

												I know why this game has a low Metascore! For every good thing, there are a several annoyances meddling around making the game bad.Let me make this clear: NONE of the annoyances are optimization-related. My computer ran it fine with no lag - etc.Also, when I bought the game, ""Metroidvania"" was one of the tags and that's what made me buy it. I'll be reviewing this game with a baised that it's suppoesd to be Metroidvania.Obviously, it's not Castlevania. Again, it's not Metroid. It has basic Metroidvania qualities for backtracking and grinding. but that's about it. Hilariously, I feel that the game hurts itself by using that label. Here's something it does wrong: Your mobility is bad. Seriously people! What kind of Metroidvania character can't jump twice their own height and have almost no control about their trajectory? Fun fact: giving us a double jump doesn't mean you've cleared that hurdle. The earliest challenge I found was hilariously difficult to get to because it was just a simple jump with a zero-tolerance for error on when you pressed jump. Pro-tip: that's not a challenge, but a repetitive waste of time.Speaking of repetitive waste of time, that brings me to the challenge itself: Never centralize challenges on luck. Doesn't matter if it's just one little challenge. It's a challenge and anyone, even players who don't go for 100% completion, would want to try to complete it. Failing a luck based challenge does NOT mean that the challenge is difficult or challenging, but it'll have the demoralizing effect of a real challenge anyway. In Metroidvania games, ""Skill"" defines a challenge and luck is NOT ""Skill.""I get that we're supposed to be playing some stereo-typical ""nerd"" with questionable stamina and physical abilities. Let me ask you this: what's the sense of being in a ""magical"" world to the point that you drink potions, heal via a creature that lives in some pocket dimension, use magical equipment and magic spells, but never improve your own body beyond having better equipment and items? Yes, I know there are potions that increase your walking speed, but that's not solving the issue. That's literally like drinking alcohol; temporary solution. Also, potions lasting 30 seconds, 60 seconds... even if it was 5 minutes (hyperbole), that's limiting. I guess it prevents game-breaking if you choose to go into potions and all, but I get the feeling that you're about to start charging me micro-payments so I can have fun with the game. To me, the feeling of micro-payments in a Metroidvania game is a sign that the Gaming Industry is entering a Depression. I.E.: It has hit the bottom.You know in good Metriodvania games, the defining feature is that if you're about to beat the game, but feel like trolling the enemies from 10 dungeons ago for giving you a hard time? Here's a common way: go in there and just wreck them! Here's a better way: de-equip everything and wreck them ANYWAY. That's a cathartic element in Metriodvania games and you can't do this in this game. The entire point is riding on the main character being... well, himself. With that, the concept of Metroidvania falls flat on the WORST possible facts of the genre. Backtracking is NOT fun. In games like Metroid and Castlevania, it's made that backtracking IS fun because discovering and reaching that point you couldn't before while killing the enemies by the equivalent of looking at them really hard gives a sense of acheivement. The line ""I'm better than I was before"" is another defining feature and this game somehow lacks it. How? Cheap enemies.Now, I'm not going to complain about this game being cheap with certain enemies because:a) I didn't have enough of a problem with it.b) I believe it'll be covered by others.Same thing with the multiplayer: I don't care for it, so I'm not reviewing it here.(Note: if you see the ""time"" reading only ~4 hours, something happened with my steam, so I lost a lot of data in a whole bunch of games (thank goodness my TF2 items are okay!!!). This one got hit along with the achievements (somehow...), so I'm reviewing it before I uninstall.)Stake-into-heart Attack:I kiiiiinda regret buying it. That's a first for a game I got during the Steam Summer Sale. I'm thoroughly disappointed because a few different decisions during development and I'd actually love the game. Main decision that set it on the path to receive my hate: It's a test of patience rather than skill. If you want me to use a non-Metroidvania example, then here: Dark Souls is a test of skill. I beat Dark Souls in a week. (It wasn't NG+ or a second character or something, but my first character with no prior experience in the game series.)			"

												Despite some of the bad reviews, I decided to give it a try, but my partner and I were extremely disappointed. I love these kinds of games, but this one is just not well put together. It's incredibly frustrating in a way that has nothing to do with challenging combat or complicated puzzles. The frustration comes from dynamics/mechanics in the game that make the game constant meaningless work with zero payoff. This game has a lot of potential to be fun (I really like the character sheet aspect and even the general feel of the game), but after just two hours of gameplay my partner and I couldn't stand it anymore.

Early Access Review
								There is two part to this game : Solo and Muli.Solo is a good adventure, fun to play, fun story, a bit of humor (mostly scatological or pop culture winks) and a good scenario. A great metroidvania with 3 littles flaws :1) Combat system is horrible. Can't dodge, can't kite (beside 2 very slow creatures in the game). You either kill from afar before they reach you or you slugfest them to death while chugging healing pots and rejuv spell. Jump are awfull, weapons animations are clunky, spells must be done standing and are interupted by anything. Pets (free moving and firing companions) are often the best source of dps/CC you will have.2) Skill system is so 1980 it's wearing a mulet. You get 5 skill points per level. There is 5 melee weapons skill, 3 ranged weapons, 1 constitution, 2 armor, 1 potion skill and 8 magic school. You NEED to max 1 melee,  the constitution, 1 armor and one ranged or magic. So you have 1 points to spare per level. You'll never experienced most of the magic (especially since you must wait till the end of the game for the last ones to be introduced). Same with the weapons, if you favored Sword, you won't be able to equip this great hammer you found. And the skeletons will laugh at your pitifull damage to them. Incidentally, if you didn't take holy magic or bludgeoning weapons, skelletons will be a pain to handle. Is it logical ? Yes. Is it loyal to the D&D tabletop secondary edition alinea 4 appendix 25c ? Yes. Is it enjoyable ? No. And if you invest some points into every thing, you are bad at every thing. So basicaly, choose a few (five or six) spend all your points there and say goodby to other unless you decide to reroll. But the gameplay is poor and only driven by the story so the replayability is low.3) It's really hipster tabletop RPG vs video game RPG. It's mocking video game for it's inconsistency and logical flaw (you can't arm an organless skelleton with arrows, you fool) and it's fun. But it's missing the point of videogame as Gameplay > Logic. So this game is hardcore. Not difficult, but strict and rigid. It's a fashion statement.All this are the minor flaws of the single campain. But it's great, it's fun. It's enjoayble (even this horrible stupid last level from hell).  Great scenario, great plot twist. I spent hours on this.The big pill of horse manure is the multiplayer part. Basically, you remove everything that was great in solo (story, pets, non linear exploration and backtracking), you keep all that was not fun (combat system, skill attribution), emphasise them and create new hurdles.-you now chain small linear dungeons with no link between them execpt that you find the key for the next one on the boss.-you must grind bosses 3, 6 or 9 times to buy spells for magic school were you allready spent points but couldn't find books.-you die constantly and must walk from last check point to you struggling friend for 2 minutes.-Lot's of brutforcing certain pack of enemies, slughfest, die, revive, run, slugfest, die etc.-you weapons and armor decays on death loosing 5% efficiency every time.-you can't repair in dungeon and must quit and restart dungeon from scratch.-repairs are expensive.-spell regents are expensive.-to get money, you will have to grind previous dungeon.So, you reach the cimetery, full of undead. None of you specialized in holy magic ? You are doomed. You can't just grind a bit and spend 3 points in holy. You must have some pro cleric or you wont pass. You will slugfest skelettons, die a bit, be less effective, die a bit more, be even less effective, die a lot etc. Then your armor/weapons are completly useless and broken. Go repair. It's the same when learning boss patern. You die a lot, you mage progress in learning how to deal with it but you do less damage each time and die faster each time.There is no ""fight smarter"" in this game. You can bring the correct weapon/magic school to the fight (by rerolling mostly) but the combat system is so clunky that you can barelly dodge missile and not dodge melee at all. Slugfest and bruteforce all the way.I spent lots of time playing this game solo and overcame the mechanics because the story and exploration was good. We spend some time playing it in multi but at some point we saw that it's was all badly constructed and grindy.Too bad.			"

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME unless you want to spend hours upon hours dying, spawning really far away from where you died, catching up to where you died, and then repeating the process. This would be such a fantastic game if each enemy wasn't a freaking mini boss!! The creators decided that every enemy should take 10 hits to die, when you die in just a few. and there is no way to dodge their blows when 5 skeletons run at you at once. Your only strategy becomes: do some damage, die, come back, do a little more damage...etc So time consuming and tedious! I wish I could get my money back for this game. It is unreasonably hard. I gave this game 16 hours of my life, and kept trying to justify playing it, but it has wayyy too many roadblocks and speed bumps in game that suck the fun out of it.			"

												It's so close to being a great game, but the controls whether you choose keyboard or controller, are terrible. The platformer physics aren't any good, either. The traps are all intentionally un-funny and ""this obviously isn't going to do what you think it will, but it will screw you over beyond your control regardless"".If you are playing online, even if you both have great connections, expect just enough lag that the person connecting to the host is unable to hit quick/flying targets or dodge fast moving obstacles like minecarts.The net code is bad. The gameplay is OK. The loot is pretty standard. The level up/skill system is pretty limited. Some of the bosses are absurd in a tedious / zerg rush style, not in a satisfyingly difficult style.It's not the kind of game where you die and you know that it's your fault. So many of the deaths are simply because the game controls are clunky, or that the boss fights just have so many random elements to them that you can never avoid taking damage. Any sort of healing or scroll takes time to use, so that just makes it ever more frustrating.			"

												I got this game as a gift without really knowing about it nor wanting it.It has to be one of the worst gaming experience I ever had.

The humour is horrible, the theme is not only outdated but something I'd never want to see used in an RPG and the interface is akin to having someone scratch his nails constantly on a blackboard.Took us about 45 minutes and at least a dozain deaths on a multiplayer session to agree to get an instant refund and try something else.Would not touch this game with a ten foot long pole again.

												This game is decently fun for a while, but then a boss just breaks the entire thing. It mind controls you to slowly chip away health all battle, but then it amps up and makes you use spells (especially if they have a high blast radius and you're against a wall) and poor all of your potions onto the ground!That was bad, but then right before it died it forces you to use the Halo, aka, the item that BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE HUB AREA! Maybe the game becomes incredible after that, but this boss is so infuriating I don't think I'm willing to pick it back up again.			"

												This game could have been great fun.Until it  has a boss that litterally forces your character to empty out you hard worked for potions that you prepared for the boss fight while keeping you from moving and draining your life until you die.Until then i even had really fun with the boss fights, they were rather imaginitve and although the battle system was simple it was a great fun.I loved the challenge the game posed to me till then.I once lost 10.000 XP in Dark Souls. That wasn't nearly as frustrating because at least i knew it was my fault for being dumb a moment earlier as well as not using the XP earlier.But ♥♥♥♥ this Boss design. NEVER force me to loose stuff i made while i litterally can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it, while it forcey me to EMPTY OUT MY ♥♥♥♥ING POTIONS. Recommendet?

								Unepic is a bad game. The title is surprisingly fitting in that there is nothing epic about this game. The gameplay is lackluster, being bogged down by clunky menus and controls that are require too much work to get a good configurations. The story is shoddy, filled with unlikable characters and completely unfunny references to the stereotypical nerdy works.Is there potential for this game? Well, yeah, any game has potential. But this one requires a lot of work. The controls need to be made more responsive and smooth, as opposed to the slow controls that currently exist. As the game is now, it seems like a shovelware version of the Castlevania series.			"

								Do not buy this game.  It starts off as a fun little Metroidvania RPG, but after a while, it starts getting needlessly frustrating.  A boss that, through trial-and-error, forces you to drop nearly every item in your inventory just to even have a chance to beat it (when inventory management is already a chore).  Common enemies that ruin your weapons, forcing needlessly long grinds to restore them.  Not to mention the dialogue tries entirely too hard and ends up as a somewhat insulting satire of the very gamers it was trying to endear to, and the lines that aren't insulting are just bland.

												Grade: C-Almost like Castlevania, but with it's set of flaws.  Pros:1. Intersting story.  2.  It's nice if you play it for the multiplayer. Cons (mainly when playing this game solo):1. The customization may seem great at first, but at one point you'd realize weapon balancing is funky in different areas/boss battles, and by that point either you'd want to roll a new character or have to respec.2. Pets are hard to manage for no good reason, and there's no way to level them up. In Castlevania, pets are either invincible or they cannot be targeted by mobs... not in Unepic. Your pet will die in later stages, and they cannot be unsummoned/summoned on the fly because then they lose their energy charge.3. The game suffers a fundamental problem in character actions - too many actions for a simple game. For example, instead of setting an AI behavior for heal potions (i.e. heal with lowest/highest quality), the game requires you to map one button to one function only. That may seems fine in the beginning... at one point you'd have so many items and weapons and spells that you can use it starts to look stupid. Castlevania's Symphony of the Night and later series features tons of characters action... all being performed on a game pad. Do we really need 20+ hot keys for a 2D action game?4. So areas gets harder after you ""open up the gates."" It's meant to be part of the story progression, right? But some areas would get a lot more harder because all the mobs can aggro you once the gates are lifted... and they stay that way.5. Some boss moves you cannot dodge with skill, it's almost luck based, i.e. raining down magic randomly.			"

												How do I say this....Unepic isn't fun.  It's an attempt at being ""meta"" and ""clever"" without actually being ""meta"" or ""clever.""  The design of the game is so simplistic and straight forward that you'll be an hour into it and expecting more depth to come about, but it never happens.Save your money.  Buy one of the million other games just like this but better instead.			"

												UnEpic can be fun. The script is amusing, which can be difficult for such an overworked genre. The jumping was well done as is the use of magic (has to charge, which means you can't just tank through battles). Some enemies are frustrating, sure, but that makes it a challenging game. What really killed it for me is the battle against Medeox. Its just an absolutely ludicrous fight. Killing the heads is easy enough, but working down the eye without getting petrified is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight. This game is dead to me.tldr; The game was fine until Medeox. I vote NO, only because I don't plan on finishing.			"

								This game at the core makes sense.. and then you play it and realize that it is nothing more than a big bully, trolling you along the way, laughing at your misfortunes.. The coffin system (rez point/graveyard) in this game also makes sense at it's core.. in till you play the game... Do you see a pattern here?  The controls are odd and not very user friendly in my opinion (even on an x-box gamepad I have been told..) and the ability to customize your controls are very limited. When you die in co-op multi-player, (trust me you will..) the tedious walk back from whence you came brings back not so fond memories of my WoW days.. dying in a dungeon and having to walk my ghost a$$ back to the entrance from a graveyard on the other side of the zone.. All in all, this game is not worth a purchase, avoid like the plague. You have been warned.			"

												[Update] I have contacted the developer and received Feedback to the missing multiplayer:- The Multiplayer for Linux will be available when the Linux-Version is released on Linux.- The developer said he would fix this misunderstanding on the website.- Thus, the negative criticism to the missing multiplayer is not relevant anymore.- My negative experience ingame is unchangedOld Review including ""missing multiplayer"":------------------------------------------------------------------------I haven't played such a bad game for years.I bought this game from their website and wanted to play it multiplayer with a friend.These reasons stopped us:- Mutliplayer does not work in the linux version. This was not mentioned on their website, but will be introduced with the Linux Version on Steam.- The game is not ""challenging"", but frustrating-- There are many ""death pits"" which a player cannot identify beforehand.-- Monsters kill you in 2 hits, but require 20 hits to die-- Most monsters outrange you by far, leaving the bow as only reasonable weapon-- Casting spells takes VERY long, making it ridiculous to cast spells.-- Boss fights do not require skill, but endurance. You repeat a pattern for ~5-10 minutes.This is a prime example of very bad game design for me now and I am very frustrated to have bought this.The trailer was AWESOME. The game... sad.			"

								This recommendation must be qualified heavily. The game is not unfair, but it does not like you. Adapt, or suffer. It's one of the few I've ever seen with a single player campaign anti-cheat. You are expected to play the game its way. It's not... bad, and technically, you could grind xp to overcome some poor skill point expenditures... but.The humor is... technically present. A lot of jokes are references and callbacks to things that were funny in their original setting... but don't make sense here, and are not even jokes. One entire sidequest is lifted from the plot of The Golden Child. Great movie, but word-for-word re-enactment of Eddie Murphy from the 80s is not proof of writing chops. It's plagiarism.After finding myself wondering if I was doing a few bits right, I looked up what more was to come in the game. And I'm disappointed. After the ending, the game shows one character ordering skeletal minions to♥♥♥♥♥♥and kill a player daring to complain about the crappy ending. The skeletons point out that's biologically impossible, and instead get to murdering. So... the authors know the endings are bad... and threaten the player for daring to speak out.I have a problem with that. I have so many problems with that. The gameplay's not so good as to make up for THAT.			"

								The game is not bad, a metroidvania of the old school, a lot of different items, a good story with a lot of humor.The problem, the game have some important bug that do not allow you to finish it if you encounter this error.Normally, I can understand this is a indi game and needs more time, but my annoyance is because the programer invert a lot of time in anticheat system (for example avoid save editor can be used for solved the problem that the bug originates) instead a game you can finish it.Please, note that my point is not center about if is good or bad make a very complex anticheat system, is about programme a very complex anticheat system in a game where after 9 hours of play it, you get stuck and need start for the begining again.

												Okay so I'm probably going to finish this game anyways since I hate unfinished games, but please, if you're looking for a good medtroidvania that's not too much of a hassle to complete, and with good references to older games and geek culture without forced cheap jokes, please go play Treasure Adventure Game, it's free and Unepic definitely isn't worth 13 bucks, at the very least if you hate retro pixel graphics, wait for Treasure Adventure World's release.I remember being really interested in this game's theme of some D&D player being sent into a castle for adventures, there's a lot of time between when I first heard of Unepic, the moment I got the game, and when I installed it on an old computer on Lubuntu (at least it works on most OS, that's a plus). What I didn't expect was how boring and how cheap the references to geek culture are.First of all, the gameplay. A good Metroidvania is supposed to be based on quick thinking, and/or on puzzles during levels to proceed further. As far as I've been in this game, Unepic does not have any of these. The battles are slow and usually mindless button mashing and mediocre ""infiltration"" (more like ""running behind the guy while he's not looking""), they're mostly bad because they're easy to figure out, but one simple mistake can get you a game over. I mean it's not even a ""git gud"" difficulty level because most of the enemies are really easy to fight, it's simply that you usually have to go back to the save point and redo the level aaaall the way, which makes it quickly boring. And don't get me started on the bosses, they have easy to counter but anarchic patterns, which can make them either way too easy or way too hard (with no inbetweens) regardless of the boss. And that's not how a boss is supposed to work.The graphics are okay, I mean it's not something you'll remember, but it's not fugly either, the music is mostly okay, but sometimes it tends to be actually annoying, especially if it's used to highlight crude dudebro jokes.That's where I'm getting at: the writing and most of all, the jokes. Most the geek references are actually forced unfunny jokes that are used to cover up the lack of creativity from the dev. Like one of the characters is literally Yoda, you can earn a special type of cash from challenges that can be used to buy stuff from well known franchises. Heck, even the joke when you kill your first enemy is an overused MGS joke that feels way out of place... It's like watching a bad episode of The Big Bang Theory.And it wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't so unfitting, I mean I saw merchants with linux distribs as names, one of them, called ""Ubuntu"", told me that he didn't give away free stuff and only sold it (I spare you the racist misspelling, because of course the character being black, he obviously can't speak correctly; as racist as Tintin in the Congo).On top of that, besides the ""geek jokes"", the protagonist acts like a virgin preteen who tries to hit on every female character in the game (not like there are a lot of them). Best way to make half the players (if not more) stop relating to the main character imo. Not only did I have to read his dull lines about wanting to bang one merchant, but there's literally one side quest that consists of killing one mob then have sex with a couple of female goblins - it's not even elliptic, you have to move your character to the goblins' rooms and awkwardly watch the bed moving behind curtains while cheesy music is playing. That's forced heteronormativity at its finest.One good point I did notice: not a single bug in sight. Maybe that's because I haven't played enough, but the game seems pretty well wrapped up in this regard.TL;DR: the jokes aren't funny, the game is pretty boring, you won't miss anything by playing another game instead.

												As a disclaimer, I'm pretty picky with my games.That being said, I played this game for a few minutes, and was instantly turned off by it. It's certainly not my style of game. I'd much rather play something that can grip your attention, and plays like an RPG. They try to be amusing with comments about typical RPGs, but a game is a game. Dungeons and Dragons PnP isn't Skyrim, and it's not meant to be. The opposite is also true. This game may appeal to some, but not to me.			"

The game tells you that u can kill the merchant for loot... you can not do that.4.This game infuriates me like no other.5. What u couldnt program coins to be picked up by the player automatically, but arrows do..6.At a certain u arrive in a screen with 16 clesed gates.. nothing else. Everytime u try and open one gate. IT LITERALLY SAYS TRY ANOTHER OF THE SAME GATE TO GET ON THROUGH. YES I TRIED ALL ♥♥♥♥ing 16. Nothing works.You should pay people to play your game, not the other way around. I had a few hours of spare timle earlier. I almost smacked my laptop in the face. VEry Fun Game this is.PLs Don't make another game ever.			"

												Negative reviews say that the game design for UnEpic is bad... because they got owned by that boss... that somehow 'takes' control of your character. That's only  because they didn't understand the mechanics under the fight. I'm not gonna spoil the fun but EVERYTHING is manageable in UnEpic ! It presents a challenge for newcomers and for almost every fight.The solo campaign is rewarding and you won't be stripped of your items for no reason or because the developper did a bad job. No no. You may not kill every bosses on your first try, but you will learn - and if you think there's no way to beat one of the bosses, you probably didn't think it through.I completed the game on the hardest difficulty wearing nothing. With a sword only. I couldn't have done that if the game was hard for no reason at all. The game designing behind UnEpic is great - has some really great ideas, innovative ones - it had been a while since a boss fight blew my mind. I loved the game so much that I went on Twitter to tell the developper that I really enjoyed his game. The only downside is the music, which is not as great as the game itself. Some sound effects are a bit odd but not bad at all - just not that great.It is hard and challenging and has stuff that you've never seen in any other games. Story, dialogues and voice acting are great and funny. The ending is totally crazy as well as the plot. I didn't like the multiplayer as much but I came back for new playthroughs to the solo campaign many times. I can only recommend this :)			"

												Uno de los juegos mas adictivos y originales que he jugado. Y encima español!!! Cuando comence a jugarlo no tenia muchas espectativas puestas en el, pero sin duda se merece todos y cada uno de los euros depositados en el. Para completarlo al 100% vas a sudar sangre (yo aun no lo he conseguido). 8.5/10			"

								I don't play platform games, I don't usually enjoy them. And I honestly surprised myself when I purchased UnEpic. But the idea seemed original and kinda cute, and caught my imagination...well, let me tell you, this is not your usual platform game! I bought it tonight, and started playing it thinking I'd be bored in the first 15 minutes. NO WAY! This is an EPIC platformer, one that even non-platform players can get into. The ""dialogue"" is great, the graphics are cool, and I'm really enjoying this little ditty. And at the price Steam is offering it for right now, I recommend this game highly if you're looking for some mindless fun. Definitely a great stress reliever!			"

								This game is awesome. It plays a lot like Metroid. As you explore the castle you learn new abilities and are able to explore further from there. Your main objective in each area typically includes carrying out a task for one of the gods to learn a new type of magic then defeating the area boss. Then there are typically a few side quests in each area. All fairly typical stuff. But what makes this game unique is the dialog. Its clever, hilarious and entertaining as hell. I think any veteran gamer who likes games like a metroid/RPG dungeon crawler will like this. Its difficult but rewarding.			"

								Trendy satyrical spoof story with a taste for low brow humor.Simple gameplay that provides a number of hours of entertaining adventure.Difficulty that ramps up throughout the game by way of increasingly annoying enemy mechanics.Bosses are more than easy, with perhaps one exception.  Their patterns are so formulaic that a player can often jump into the battle just to test it out and defeat the boss without being fully prepared.Entertaining for people who enjoy platformer rpg's, point allotment level up systems, and parody humor.  The game does perhaps the best attempt at breaking immersion I have ever encountered. Although by the end it is mostly annoying and many of the branches of development beg for some balancing work.

								Only a few hours in so I am hoping that I will be able to update with an even more positive review, but this game is a must for anyone who enjoyed games like Metroid, Castlevania or many other older side scrollers. The updates seem steady and helpful in improving areas of the game as well as expanding on already great features. I am VERY impressed with the quality of this game developer and UnEpic is a great game. I can't wait to see what comes next in their improvements. I am proud to say that I have played UnEpic. The combat system is simple but smooth and the difficulty curves for the game are great. The occasional discussions between characters is nice to break up the time you spend crawling through doungeons. The shops and inventories are easy to use and I LOVE not having to take my hands off my keyboard to swap to the mouse during the game. Everything is laid out in a fairly intuitive way allowing for a very comfortable playrthrough. BUY THIS GAME. You won't regret it ""MORTAL"" hahahaha! (Zera from UnEpic)			"

								Surprise, this game is actually Epic! Strange that, yes. The game takes a modern stab at the Action RPG Platformer from the days of yore. You'll explore a mysterious and deadly castle as a flippant youth straight out of a DnD session from which he presumes his friends have drugged him--he thinks he's hallucinating. Plays like Faxanadu, with a current-level capped skill point system, multiple weapons, and the freedom to build how you please while experimenting with weapon loadout combinations that suffice to cover the varied weaknesses of the enemies at hand. UnEpic is full of tongue-in-cheek humor and doesn't mind borrowing from other IPs by including totally-who-you-think-they-are-but-not characters like Yoda, and Zoidberg. Most of the time the protagonist even ponders the resemblance aloud. However, these are done well enough that they come with a chuckle rather than a groan. Definitely recommend this for fans of the NES era platformer RPGs and doubly so for those that can pick it up for a few dollars.			"

								After only a couple hours playing UnEpic, I feel compelled to preach its uberness.  I know, that's not the typical language in a review, but it's that kind of game.  The gameplay itself is nothing particularly ground-breaking, though it's very well-designed and implemented.  It's essentially an RPG platformer, with a relatively standard combat and leveling system.  I'd comment on the magic, but I haven't gone that route yet.  So far, it's complex enough to have some depth, but simple enough that you don't feel like you need to minimax or precalculate before leveling up a skill.The controls are decent.  It's a little annoying to navigate the menus with the keyboard.  You can use the mouse, which works just fine, but it's really not a mouse kind of game otherwise.  Also, going into the menus doesn't pause anything, so you better set up those hotkeys in advance!Despite having relatively standard gameplay, the game feels extremely solid.  A lot of indie titles often feel like they're just one glitch away from crashing and losing all of your progress.  Some have quirky animations or random pauses that break the flow and remind you that they're not AAA titles.  This one has none of that.  Everything feels perfectly smooth, so it never distracts at all from the best feature...The dialogue.  Without spoiling too much, let me just guarantee that if you've grown up on geek culture, you'll love the humor in UnEpic.  It's easily the funniest game I've played in a long time, and the main reason I like it enough after less than two hours to write a positive review.  When the protagonist starts decorating every conversation with references to Star Wars, Tolkien, and Warcraft, you'll know you're in the right place.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to shoot some arrows at this skeleton...

								Great 2D RPG with only a few minor flaws. I am having a lot of fun with UnEpic, mostly due to the hardcore RPG play style combined with a humorous and engaging story line. Tons of items & attributes to keep any RPG fan entertained. The only flaws I find are that you cannot hit multiple enemies with most melee attacks (even if they are right on top of each other) and some the movements could have been slightly more polished. However both of these things are out shined from many other successful and enjoyable game mechanics.			"

								I'm not gonna lie. I was thrilled when I heard about this game. So I bought it on the first day. The single player mode is nice, and fluid. There aren't any harsh difficulty curves for someone who just wants to have a nice time. The music is also well composed, but its nothing special. The graphics are nice, and it's easy to run on old machines. The plotline is funny (mostly due to the references it makes), and it has good boss battles. However the multiplayer is a bit dissapointing. It's not so much the gameplay than the poor map design. Most of the base maps are fine... assuming you have at least 2 other people with you. This   especially goes with the first map since there is one part that requires you to kill enemies in 3 seperate parts of the room. There is also a map designed for 1 person, but what breaks this map are the slime mobs. If you are low level this will be hell to get through. Especially halfway through when they can crowd a respawn coffin, making you start all over again.7.5/10			"

								This is an awesome tongue in cheek humor game based loosely around the theme of Dungeons and Dragons. Loads of fun to play and explore. I heard about this game when it was on Kickstarter and played the demo. It was great. Craziest bit is that it was designed by I think 1-3 guys from Spain. Loads of fun and replay value. If you like Dungeon RPG games this is for you. I think most people relate it to Castlevania.			"

								Humorous storyline with a certain draw to it's mystery element, it made me want to keep playing to see just how everything unfolded in the single player. The multiplayer is equally as amusing and added a certain Diablo aspect in it's lobby based adventuring, while still maintaining good level/map based character progression with a decent amount of secrets true to the game's inspiration. For it's pricing this game holds quite a few hours to have a fun bash at solo or with friends. My only gripes are that some of the combat is repetitive, and one does need to grind in the multiplayer to feel strong enough to deal with some of the levels.			"

								  I have owned this game since it was purchasable alpha.  I have played it to death, and I'm SO happy it's finally on Steam.   Unepic is an amazing platformer / rpg hybrid game that should define the genre.  There is so much to the game, I especially love the way it feels, and looks.  The story is totally not serious and I find it amusing.    The character building is great and unique.  I find it so hard to stick to a build and save points, but you can make any type of guy you want.  I am currently a axe fighter, who wears clothe robes and uses only fire magic.   Oh and did I mention BATTLE PETS?!?!   PLease get this game if it interests you. I have followed the dev for a few years I guess, and he has worked hard, so active in the community and will help with problems even if your the only one to have that prob.  He has WORKED for his money and I hope he gets a bunch!! My Fave INdie for sometime now.			"

								I don't see how this game can only have a Metascore of 68, It should be 80ish. Also for an early access game you would never know. The game was very playable and fun from day one, it just keeps getting better. This by far is one of the better Metroidvania games I have played in a long time. I had already finished they game prior to the 1.47 patch and with all of the new content and voice overs I just started from scratch again. You will not regret purchasing this game IMHO $9.99 is a steal.			"

								Tonight I got through Unepic. This game is big and unlike most games out there. The sidescrolling exploration RPG genre, if there is such a thing, is pretty much limited to the Castlevania series, and even then, depending on the title you get more or less RPG out of it. Unepic allows you to specialize in several weapon types, armor or robes, health and several schools of magic, all of which have obvious gameplay benefits. Only a few of them feel like ""must haves"" giving room for quite a bit of player choice. The Hard++ mode is very, very difficult, somewhat to the point of feeling a little unfair at times, but like all good and difficult games, it required me to change my strategy, rather than just ""do better,"" an essential quality.The story is irreverent, and at a few places early in the game, even a little insensitive or perhaps offensive depending on the individual. However, it takes what seems like a throw-away premise and turns it into a story that actually develops in surprising ways.Ultimately it took me a supposed 22 hours to get through it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was quite a bit longer considering the amount of hours not accounted for with all my repeated deaths. The quantity and breadth of content here is surprising. Rarely do I play an indie game where I think to myself ""Wow, they really couldn't have done anything more."" They really have a ton of varied content here and was surprised at the variety of enemies, level scenarios, bosses, tactics I was required to learn and master, and ultimately a huge ending that uses just about every skill you know, and requires you to learn new ones, in order to beat it.I really can't think of the last time I played a game with this much breadth in its mechanics, and if you like complexity in your action games, you're probably going to love Unepic. If you're not so much into that kind of complexity, I recommend Unepic anyway, just play on an easier difficulty than I did.I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I probably will.			"

								An excellent 2D RPG! Great humor, plenty of quests, lot's of items, and at the time of writing this, multiplayer is currently in alpha with people currently playing it. To make things clear, the main game is already finished. The ""Early Access"" part is only for multiplayer, which is still in the works. That's not to say the main game won't be getting anything new, but the multiplayer is the sole reason UnEpic is ""Early Access""Exploring the Castle is great fun. Each zone is unique, with it's own unique look, feel, and the enemies that inhabit it.Magic is fun too. A large variety of spells to choose from. My only gripe with the magic system is that if I want to specialize in a certain school of magic, I have to go through the main story in order to get to the point where you initially get that magic. I'm not sure how it works Online, since I haven't played that yet(wanted to finish story).Each zone has multiple side quests you can discover and complete. Each one has it's own little story.There's also multiple pets you can find that will aid you someway in battle.Overall, it's an amazing RPG, definitely worth getting at any price. Along with Online Multiplayer, and the ability to create and share your maps with friends, gives this game a lot of replayability.EDIT(12/25/13): It has been 6 months since I initially wrote this review, and much has changed. While there was partial controller support when I first wrote this, there is now full support, making the game very comfortable to play with the controller, and the keyboard controls are also great.There's is now also voice acting for the vast majority of the game. Some generic environment dialogue has yet to be Voiced, but all Story Dialogue, both Main and Side, are all voiced, along with the tips/tutorial.			"

								Trendy satyrical spoof story with a taste for low brow humor.Simple gameplay that provides a number of hours of entertaining adventure.Difficulty that ramps up throughout the game by way of increasingly annoying enemy mechanics.Bosses are more than easy, with perhaps one exception.  Their patterns are so formulaic that a player can often jump into the battle just to test it out and defeat the boss without being fully prepared.Entertaining for people who enjoy platformer rpg's, point allotment level up systems, and parody humor.  The game does perhaps the best attempt at breaking immersion I have ever encountered. Although by the end it is mostly annoying and many of the branches of development beg for some balancing work.

								Only a few hours in so I am hoping that I will be able to update with an even more positive review, but this game is a must for anyone who enjoyed games like Metroid, Castlevania or many other older side scrollers. The updates seem steady and helpful in improving areas of the game as well as expanding on already great features. I am VERY impressed with the quality of this game developer and UnEpic is a great game. I can't wait to see what comes next in their improvements. I am proud to say that I have played UnEpic. The combat system is simple but smooth and the difficulty curves for the game are great. The occasional discussions between characters is nice to break up the time you spend crawling through doungeons. The shops and inventories are easy to use and I LOVE not having to take my hands off my keyboard to swap to the mouse during the game. Everything is laid out in a fairly intuitive way allowing for a very comfortable playrthrough. BUY THIS GAME. You won't regret it ""MORTAL"" hahahaha! (Zera from UnEpic)			"

								If you can stand cheesy humour and gamurr references galore, this is actually a really good metroidvania. The UI is the first of its kind in the genre, boasting interesting and really PC-spesific features (hotkeys, customizable windows, etc.). The weapons also adds extra layers of meta game, because the various weapon types don't just vary in speed, damage and other common stats. You will have to build your character wisely, because putting all your points in a singular weapon type is sure to fail as soon as you go up against an enemy with strong defenses against it. You also have pets and spells and armour and potions and scrolls, and all that good stuff.The RPG levelling system is deep and allows for much experimentation. The visuals are decent, the music is good and the story is pretty uninteresting.A coop multiplayer mode recently appeared in the main menu, which I'm looking forward to trying out.			"

								Surprise, this game is actually Epic! Strange that, yes. The game takes a modern stab at the Action RPG Platformer from the days of yore. You'll explore a mysterious and deadly castle as a flippant youth straight out of a DnD session from which he presumes his friends have drugged him--he thinks he's hallucinating. Plays like Faxanadu, with a current-level capped skill point system, multiple weapons, and the freedom to build how you please while experimenting with weapon loadout combinations that suffice to cover the varied weaknesses of the enemies at hand. UnEpic is full of tongue-in-cheek humor and doesn't mind borrowing from other IPs by including totally-who-you-think-they-are-but-not characters like Yoda, and Zoidberg. Most of the time the protagonist even ponders the resemblance aloud. However, these are done well enough that they come with a chuckle rather than a groan. Definitely recommend this for fans of the NES era platformer RPGs and doubly so for those that can pick it up for a few dollars.			"

Early Access Review
								I started this game when it was just subtitles.  Since an upgrade patch to add voice (at least in English), I've found I enjoy the feel of the game more.  Gameplay is pretty good, though the controls can be clunky at times...directional jumping and bow/spell targetting can be annoying, but overall gameplay is pretty smooth.  Lots of styles of combat to explore, but I limit myself to melee.  The magic system does look to be pretty good.  The storyline and breadth of the game is well done, if off-colour at times.  Juvenile and vulgar humour, but then I tend to like that sort of thing.  I have not completed the game yet, but I am definitely looking forward to the last stretch.  This review only applies to the single player mode...I have not tried multiplayer.			"

								This game... this game costed me a lot more than 50% off of a 7€. I have severe neck pain, my fingers can't stop shaking and i lost the Windows key of my laptop's keyboard. This game is as brutal as it gets, for a classic metroidvania title. It's hard, unforgiving, challenging, fairly funny, interesting, addicting... yea, i guess it's pretty fun. that is, if you're like me and for some reason start a HARD++ run with the intention of doing a 100% run from the get-go... On normal mode it's quite alright, sorry for scaring you if i did :DAs a man who grew up with Castlevania, later on with the DS versions of the game (yea i like those), i can appreciate this game. Don't pay attention to the 68 that metacritic has given this title - if you like what what you see in the trailers, i guarantee you'll have an amazing time playing the game - it's a metroidvania platformer at it's best, with clean visuals, untraditional storyline, good, if not too ronchy, sence of humor, and some really unque bosses.And hey... it's basically a castlevania with *yet unfinished* multiplayer. That's as good a reason as any to buy this game, even full price.			"

								Very nice game. Reminds me somehow of my pen and paper rpg games.Even if you are not and RPG genre addicted, the game mechanics is very intuitive and easy to follow.The best part of the game for me is that the dungeons you play in single player mode and multiplayers differs from each other.So, if you are playing alone or with friends the game brings you different experiences.

								UnEpic? I think it is the game that recreates that feeling when you were in your early teens and started playing games. It's great and on Steam (and almost for free). The game is not that easy, which is nice but you actually die quite a lot as resources are scarce.Retro 2D graphics - WHICH I LOVE. Too many gameplay aspects are ruined today due to 3D-mania.Good controller support - so no more carpal tunnel syndrome for me.			"

								This is an exploration fantasy-themed 2D dungeon crawler with platforming elements, maybe? I don't know every term to affix this game, but it sure is very fun. Its strong point is its humor, the setting itself being rather humoristic from the start as you impersonate some guy who plays D&D with his friends, then suddenly on his way to the bathroom, he finds himself in a castle. Plenty of references along the way, and even though I haven't finished it by the time I write this review, I simply have to recommend it to everyone.			"

								Oh my god guys, buy this game. It has drug humor, unlame references to other video games, a relatable protagonist. All I expected was a metroidvania with rpg elements and instead I got a legitimate roleplaying game. The stealth is really satisfying in this game. The shadows are amazing. The characters are great, and the character that serves as your Na'vi is trying to get you killed, so instead of just giving you the info you need his words just make you aware that you need start thinking. Really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game. Reminds me of playing games at daycare in the mid 90's.			"

								A D&D player gets teleported to a mysterious castle. Once there, he realizes he must fight his way back home. This is a 2D side scroller, ala Mario, set in a D&D world with a solid mix of humor, action, and story. Although, admittedly some of the humor will make your eyes roll as they quote movie after movie. Well over 20 hours of game play, and that's just the single player game. Lots of new gimmicks for this genre. Some are pretty annoying until you get past them, and can then appreciate it. Also, that ending. ""Wow, the end is really cool.""Definitely give this one a chance. I'm looking forward to a sequel.(No review of the multiplayer as that part of the game is still in beta.)			"

								I have several things to say about this game. First, this game has definitely made it to the top 5 games I've ever played, and my list includes such classics as Final Fantasy IV, Chrono Trigger, and Earthbound. Second, the gameplay is awesome. It takes a while to get used to the weapon & skill switching, targetting, and figuring out what you want/need to spend your skill points in, but once you do, it's a LOT of fun. Third, about replayability. I'm a ""game beater"", meaning I beat a game and move on. With Unepic, I fully intend to finish the game with my Spear/Bow hybrid, and then go back and do it all over again 100% Magic based. I'm not usually one to play a game again, but this game certainly deserves it. This game is TRULY epic. The storyline, the gameplay and the inside jokes... I cannot recommend this game enough.

								  I have owned this game since it was purchasable alpha.  I have played it to death, and I'm SO happy it's finally on Steam.   Unepic is an amazing platformer / rpg hybrid game that should define the genre.  There is so much to the game, I especially love the way it feels, and looks.  The story is totally not serious and I find it amusing.    The character building is great and unique.  I find it so hard to stick to a build and save points, but you can make any type of guy you want.  I am currently a axe fighter, who wears clothe robes and uses only fire magic.   Oh and did I mention BATTLE PETS?!?!   PLease get this game if it interests you. I have followed the dev for a few years I guess, and he has worked hard, so active in the community and will help with problems even if your the only one to have that prob.  He has WORKED for his money and I hope he gets a bunch!! My Fave INdie for sometime now.			"

								If you like metroidvanias you will probably like this. It is reminescent of castlevania, but the combat is very boring and repetitive. It's still decent enough to be played if you like the style.The torch lighting mechanics is very unique. YOu get to light the castle up as you progress, neat,As for the writing, you would expect a sarcastic nerd being sent back in time to have lines that make you constantly cringe. But no, here it's surprisingly well written, impressive even. It offers no replay value, but the normal adventure is long enough, and the bosses are unique enough, one of them is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tough, but it feels good when you beat him.Get it. 8$ is worth it.

								If you can stand cheesy humour and gamurr references galore, this is actually a really good metroidvania. The UI is the first of its kind in the genre, boasting interesting and really PC-spesific features (hotkeys, customizable windows, etc.). The weapons also adds extra layers of meta game, because the various weapon types don't just vary in speed, damage and other common stats. You will have to build your character wisely, because putting all your points in a singular weapon type is sure to fail as soon as you go up against an enemy with strong defenses against it. You also have pets and spells and armour and potions and scrolls, and all that good stuff.The RPG levelling system is deep and allows for much experimentation. The visuals are decent, the music is good and the story is pretty uninteresting.A coop multiplayer mode recently appeared in the main menu, which I'm looking forward to trying out.			"

								I've beaten the single player mode and I think it's a pretty fun action RPG platformer. The story is okay, the customization is simple but deep enough for me, and there isn't much grinding needed for the lower difficulties. Bosses are interesting, they're not just upgraded mobs. There is a bit of crude humor to this game which may not be for everyone.			"

								Despite an interface that takes a little getting used to, I am finding this game to be a fun and funny simple platformer.  There is a good bit of diversity in how you can build your character, so it will fit many different play styles.   There are also excellent mechanics allowing you to get back and forth in the game so there is little wasted time running all over the place just to visit a shop or heal your character.Definitely worth the price of admission "

Now put that in to a platformer and you've got UnEpic. It's a blase to play with friends, and comes complete with ridiculous enenmies, terrible jokes, pop culture references, depth, customization, and death. Lots and lots of death. You will die multiple times every level, especially online where you can't rely on your friends for anything!Great game, worth every penny.			"

								An excellent 2D RPG! Great humor, plenty of quests, lot's of items, and at the time of writing this, multiplayer is currently in alpha with people currently playing it. To make things clear, the main game is already finished. The ""Early Access"" part is only for multiplayer, which is still in the works. That's not to say the main game won't be getting anything new, but the multiplayer is the sole reason UnEpic is ""Early Access""Exploring the Castle is great fun. Each zone is unique, with it's own unique look, feel, and the enemies that inhabit it.Magic is fun too. A large variety of spells to choose from. My only gripe with the magic system is that if I want to specialize in a certain school of magic, I have to go through the main story in order to get to the point where you initially get that magic. I'm not sure how it works Online, since I haven't played that yet(wanted to finish story).Each zone has multiple side quests you can discover and complete. Each one has it's own little story.There's also multiple pets you can find that will aid you someway in battle.Overall, it's an amazing RPG, definitely worth getting at any price. Along with Online Multiplayer, and the ability to create and share your maps with friends, gives this game a lot of replayability.EDIT(12/25/13): It has been 6 months since I initially wrote this review, and much has changed. While there was partial controller support when I first wrote this, there is now full support, making the game very comfortable to play with the controller, and the keyboard controls are also great.There's is now also voice acting for the vast majority of the game. Some generic environment dialogue has yet to be Voiced, but all Story Dialogue, both Main and Side, are all voiced, along with the tips/tutorial.			"

Lots of tongue in cheek tropes about table top games.There is a real world money component that isn't exactly advertised, but won't give you anything game breaking (a few pets and stuff).If you like metroidvania, but always wanted to play it with some mildly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people trying to get you killed because they are too greedy to keep from setting off every trap in the dungeon, this is for you. It's pretty worth it at $8			"

								This game is just ridiculous fun. It brings back an air of nostalgia playing a PnP game of D&D with my friends and dealing with an unruly DM. Only by telling the game story like this could they make switches that do nothing but kill you in front of a a group of chortling goblins make sense. It channels in the best parts of a Castlevania/Metroid style game and still is able to be fresh and challenging. Kind of almost reminds me of Terreria in a way too without the sandbox gameplay.Playing with a friend almost requires voice chat, but is well worth it. There is one level in co-op where you are blinded and have to lead your teammate through an obstacle course with a series of voice commands. Just wow I've never seen a game attempt something like this it is wholly unique and just another way this game truly does not live up to it's UNepic title (if you catch my double negative drift)!

								This game is everything you (may not) have heard it is, and then some.  Truly, this is a gem among treasures, a game that's hard to put down, inherent with solid gameplay, and unexpected but welcome intelligent and witty humor - a combo difficult to pull off, yet done well, effortlessly presented in such a way that I found myself  buying into the character as though he had life.  The approach is original, and the design is unique; a perfectly crafted masterpiece, complimented with inuitive, and responsive controls, all wrapped up in an 2-d (old school) side scrolling adventure.  It delivers a visual style fitting of itself, almost as though it created the style as well, rounding out the package and value even more.  It's simple, yet elegantly crafted, with small details and nuances, it can make an old school gamer smile, that old.... warm smile, a bit of 'thats cool,' from the days when we used words like ""rad;"" for whatever reason this game nailed something nostalgic, and tapped that old school love, in these modern times.  There is a reason this game is considered one of the top 10 indie games... ever.  If there is a game worth your time, this is likely it.  Simply put, this game is 15 dollars of happiness. .   .    buy it.  I guarantee you will find yourself smiling, I'm just curious how long it will take you to realize it.			"

								After only a couple hours playing UnEpic, I feel compelled to preach its uberness.  I know, that's not the typical language in a review, but it's that kind of game.  The gameplay itself is nothing particularly ground-breaking, though it's very well-designed and implemented.  It's essentially an RPG platformer, with a relatively standard combat and leveling system.  I'd comment on the magic, but I haven't gone that route yet.  So far, it's complex enough to have some depth, but simple enough that you don't feel like you need to minimax or precalculate before leveling up a skill.The controls are decent.  It's a little annoying to navigate the menus with the keyboard.  You can use the mouse, which works just fine, but it's really not a mouse kind of game otherwise.  Also, going into the menus doesn't pause anything, so you better set up those hotkeys in advance!Despite having relatively standard gameplay, the game feels extremely solid.  A lot of indie titles often feel like they're just one glitch away from crashing and losing all of your progress.  Some have quirky animations or random pauses that break the flow and remind you that they're not AAA titles.  This one has none of that.  Everything feels perfectly smooth, so it never distracts at all from the best feature...The dialogue.  Without spoiling too much, let me just guarantee that if you've grown up on geek culture, you'll love the humor in UnEpic.  It's easily the funniest game I've played in a long time, and the main reason I like it enough after less than two hours to write a positive review.  When the protagonist starts decorating every conversation with references to Star Wars, Tolkien, and Warcraft, you'll know you're in the right place.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to shoot some arrows at this skeleton...

								Great 2D RPG with only a few minor flaws. I am having a lot of fun with UnEpic, mostly due to the hardcore RPG play style combined with a humorous and engaging story line. Tons of items & attributes to keep any RPG fan entertained. The only flaws I find are that you cannot hit multiple enemies with most melee attacks (even if they are right on top of each other) and some the movements could have been slightly more polished. However both of these things are out shined from many other successful and enjoyable game mechanics.			"

The combat is simple, but the range of potions, scrolls, spells, weapons and more make it intriguing.  Oh yeah, and it has boss fights and pets.  Highly recommended!			"

								Not your average run-of-the-mill 2D RPG, but this is a good thing. This game is awesome, and hits on all the right notes: humor, action, magic. What else could you ask for! I give it an 8 out of 10. Certainly not perfect, but well worth anyones time.			"

								This is an awesome tongue in cheek humor game based loosely around the theme of Dungeons and Dragons. Loads of fun to play and explore. I heard about this game when it was on Kickstarter and played the demo. It was great. Craziest bit is that it was designed by I think 1-3 guys from Spain. Loads of fun and replay value. If you like Dungeon RPG games this is for you. I think most people relate it to Castlevania.			"

								  I have owned this game since it was purchasable alpha.  I have played it to death, and I'm SO happy it's finally on Steam.   Unepic is an amazing platformer / rpg hybrid game that should define the genre.  There is so much to the game, I especially love the way it feels, and looks.  The story is totally not serious and I find it amusing.    The character building is great and unique.  I find it so hard to stick to a build and save points, but you can make any type of guy you want.  I am currently a axe fighter, who wears clothe robes and uses only fire magic.   Oh and did I mention BATTLE PETS?!?!   PLease get this game if it interests you. I have followed the dev for a few years I guess, and he has worked hard, so active in the community and will help with problems even if your the only one to have that prob.  He has WORKED for his money and I hope he gets a bunch!! My Fave INdie for sometime now.			"

								Humorous storyline with a certain draw to it's mystery element, it made me want to keep playing to see just how everything unfolded in the single player. The multiplayer is equally as amusing and added a certain Diablo aspect in it's lobby based adventuring, while still maintaining good level/map based character progression with a decent amount of secrets true to the game's inspiration. For it's pricing this game holds quite a few hours to have a fun bash at solo or with friends. My only gripes are that some of the combat is repetitive, and one does need to grind in the multiplayer to feel strong enough to deal with some of the levels.			"

												UnEpic was alot of fun and great value for the price.  It can be punishing but if you are cautious and save frequently it isnt that hard.  The last couple zones can get frustrating but once you get the hang of them it is just about not making mistakes.  Just make sure to have some sort of ranged and melee option.			"

												I had fun, for a while.  This is an old-school platformer rpg game.  It has a nice sense of humor, but after getting fairly far into the game, the boss fights became very tedious.  You needed to do percise manuvers over and over to beat them.  IE: Climb up a ladder, jump to  rope which you slid down only to fall at the right time on a moving boss only to have perfect timing for your weapon swing.  It just got so tiresome I gave up.   The normal mobs were not really a challenge (past the low levels), it was just the bosses and some of the puzzels that were a challenge.For the money I spent and the time I played it, it was worth it, but Ill never finish it.

A Diamond in the Rough An entriguing way of doing a Metroidvania with an action D&D approach. Sadly It didnt pull me in at first coz the videos looked to vague. Even with the reviews I still put it off.... Man was i SUPRISED!!! 20 mins into the game and i was hooked. Sucks that i waited soo long but glad I caught it on a sale(again) and when i was looking for a change of gaming scenery. Its Fun, Addicting and SIMPLE. More like Castlevania mostly. The humor of the game is bit cheesy and some of the dialog is a little corny but gets away with it due to the theme of the game. Several ways to build your hero too. which means more playthoughs to try different play styles AND even has multiplayer for you and your buddies to enjoy an UnEpic game together... UnEpic is charming little game with heart and satisfies the retro gamers			"

								""I find it challenging to find flaws in my experiences with UnEpic. Both the graphics and sound do what are needed to be done, yet neither are distasteful nor lacking. Exploring this particular world may not be the most interesting pastime available, but it is an addictive one, and you shall find yourself constantly longing to scour one last room before closing down the game. As an Early Access title on Steam, Meneses is continuing to adapt and evolve his creation, and is most welcoming of user feedback. Taking all aspects of Daniel’s journey into account, it’s difficult not to enjoy your time spent here, and with the additional features to be added at a later date, UnEpic only aims to become the opposite of what its name implies.""For my full written review, check out Critical Indie Gamer at www.criticalindiegamer.com/2013/08/unepic-review-pc "

Early Access Review
								Unepic is quite an interesting game, it is a side-scrolling platformer, an RPG, a dungeon crawler and a riot to play with your friends!In order for me to properly write a review for this game though, I must go over the basics; in the single player adventure campaign, you play as Daniel, an ordinary gamer who decides to play a game of Dungeons and Dragons with his friends, now what Daniel doesn't realize that he's in for the RPG of his life! But you must be wondering; What method do they use to transistion from this to that? Quite simple actually, they do it in the exact same way as the book ""Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" did it, but being transported there while being in the bathroom (Okay, maybe not 1:1 like them)!As I understand, the single player adventure is like your standard dungeon crawler meets RPG with quests and challenges. This part of the game focuses on writing alongside the gameplay as you would expect. To be completely honest, I didn't play very far into it to realize where Unepic's magic truly becomes Epic for me.That magic I refer to is Unepic's Multiplayer.As you would expect, this portion of the game isn't going to be really story centric like the single player campaign was made to be, this is where you play to just enjoy the sheer fun of the game that is Unepic.Unepic's Multiplayer has to be probably be one of the most intriguing online experiences I've experienced with friends in quite some time. You can play the multiplayer with up to 3 other players, which any of you can build your characters in anyway you can imagine with the skills provided in the old school RPG level/skill-up system through as I write this up to seven dungeons of well designed deceptive hell for any newcomer to the game or the type of game Unepic is and that's only the ""Unepic Maps"", there are going to be more in that section and more in the Official Maps section that get made by the players themselves as well!Mind you this game isn't exactly perfect either, it does hold some particular quirks and bugs as well, but nothing game breaking, such as in-session trading for items found in a dungeon level, meaning any items you wish to possess or trade to your allies has to be done right then and there, otherwise those items will become bound to your character.If you're a fan of games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Baldur's Gate and Maze of Galious, then you will feel right at home with the way this game is played, provided you can handle the platforming on top of the already challenging dungeons just filled to the brim with stone blocks, boulders, fireball, spike and monster traps all waiting to turn you into a bloody pile of flesh on the floor. This game does not hold your hand by any means, you must figure out what will do what, works with what and how you can overcome the challenges up ahead, for if you don't, then the game will complete you instead in how difficult the actual boss fights can be.Just to provide perspective to someone wishing to potentially buy this game.I bought this game during the 2013 Steam Winter Sale and I've easily played on and off for around 70+ hours on just multiplayer alone as I've gathered friends to play the game with.I probably should've mentioned this much sooner, but even if you complete through all the official multiplayer maps (Unepic and ""Official"" Official maps), you can then design your very own dungeons for you and your friends to play, maybe if you're lucky, you'll even have your masterpiece of a map turned into an official map for all to play and be ravaged by your devilish designs! There are even more ways to play the game, there are modes for Deathmatch(PVP), Capture the Flag, Survival (Not Complete yet, but imagine an endless gauntlet) and even good ol fashioned Racing.The game truly proves in its own gameplay that it is inherently fun to the audience it's made for.My only true complaint is that the actual online multiplayer for the singular adventurer is going to be rather held back comparably to that of someone who can bring friends along in a quiet, private session as the online multiplayer does suffer from most players sticking to their usual clicks and playing privately, leaving little room for public play as an available option.I recommend this game for the price it runs, if you truly feel unsure even after all of what I've said, then wait until it is finished, imo the game is worth it as it is at its current content featured.

												UnEpic is great! 8/10, for sure.In a nutshell:This is a great casual sidescroller, with a stunning atmospheric soundtrack, great controls, solid platforming and enough gameplay to keep you playing for many, many hours. The voice acting is top notch and the plot (while not exactly unique) was sufficiently interesting enough to keep my attention.However, the dialogue itself is extremely cringeworthy. The writers may have tried to come off as endearing and clever, but the overuse of 'nerd culture' in the dialogue was enough to make me switch off the voicing halfway into my playthrough. The graphics aren't anything to phone home about, and they can start to grate on the eyes after a while. Also, if you're looking for something exceedingly tear-your-hair-out difficult, UnEpic is sadly, not your game.			"

												Very early to review, only 1.7 hours in.  First Impressions:  Slow start; like most RPGs, they can't just overload you with action/spells/weapons while you're still learning the ropes.  It's expected.The dialogue is interesting most of the time.  It's funny and entertaining.  The controls are a bit wonky.  I ended up playing it with an Xbox controller since it felt more fluid.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game so far.  I will continue to play this.			"

When I press play, it goes to the loading screen but when the bar fills it just crashes and gives me an error telling me to post on the forums page.

												EDIT:   31 hours in, Hard complete. I stand by my original review, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Here's a warning though, it WILL have you pulling your hair out, rage quitting and yelling profanity at the screen. These are the qualities that make it a good game though, it will not let you just sun around with a sword and slash everything till it dies. You can try, but you'll die. You actually need to think to complete some of the later stages of the game, but there is almost always more than one tactic that could be employed.There is a certain boss that people are crying about on the forums, frankly I found him to be one of, possibly the best, boss in the game. Why? Because he is ****ing irritating as hell, has a ton of cheap tricks and you will have to reload earlier saves the first few times you face him unless you pick up on the very, very tiny hints to his abilities or read up on him. Why does this make him a good boss? Because I had to change my boxers after finally killing him, it was that damn satisfying.This game does not cater to the new generation of whiny gamers who want to be handed everything for repeatedly bashing a single button. It is a throwback to when games were brutal and were designed to stop you completing them, not help you. Personally, this is the type of game I love.Old review:I normally don't review, but UnEpic has earned this one fair and square. Hands down one of the best games I've played in the last year.I've played 9 hours, almost straight(damn real life commitments), so far. Playing on Hard and completing everything I see. Despite this game's name I can assure you, it truely is epic. It costs almost nothing and from the rate I'm going, I'm looking at 25-30 hours for a full complete, including the secret challenges, at a guess.Combat I haven't found to be repetative at all yet, there are tricks to beating certain enemies but often the layout or other enemies mean you have to adjust your tactics. You can't just run around fireballing every monster, or whacking it with a sword.The game has a ton of character and some of the cutscenes have had me sitting here laughing so much I've had to hide in a save spot till I could calm down.I would have been quite happy with this game if I paid £15-20 for it, to get it for about £5 is unbelievable. You can tell this game was made by someone who wanted to release a great game and actually enjoys this genre, not by a corporation trying to cash in on what people want.All in all, this game delivers in every respect.

												I had fun, for a while.  This is an old-school platformer rpg game.  It has a nice sense of humor, but after getting fairly far into the game, the boss fights became very tedious.  You needed to do percise manuvers over and over to beat them.  IE: Climb up a ladder, jump to  rope which you slid down only to fall at the right time on a moving boss only to have perfect timing for your weapon swing.  It just got so tiresome I gave up.   The normal mobs were not really a challenge (past the low levels), it was just the bosses and some of the puzzels that were a challenge.For the money I spent and the time I played it, it was worth it, but Ill never finish it.

												Wow, the end is really cool!(when you finish the game, you will understand me (-: )This is easily the best game I played this year and definitely one of my top ten. OK - top twenty. It feels little bit retroish, but it's a modern game - a nice graphics, variable environments but most importantly - very balanced gameplay. I read several negative reviews on the steam and I was little bit afraid, because almost all of them started with ""this is awesome game, but only until you reach the laboratory"", or the tower, or other later parts of the game. They said that the monsters become unbalanced tough and if you spend skill points into wrong skills the game become unbeatable. I didn't have this experience. I went slowly through the game, making all the quest, taking everything (and it did NOT feel like grind - it was pure fun for completionist like myself (-: ) and I really appreciate that the game become little bit harder towards the end.It wasn't impossible at all. For example - you will discover armored knights and with your current skill, they will kill you with 3-4 blows and you wil kill them with 5 blows. When you stand directly in front of it - yes - it's impossible to win. But when you climb the ledder blow him once, return, wait little bit and repeat this - it's no problem. Does it sound boring? I have to kill 10 or 15 knights like this. Than I get better mace and the knights wasn't problem any more... When standard knights was ok, knights with poison spear become challenging. But I found out, that by jumping you can avoid all of their attacks. And so one - there is always some ""technique"".Oh - and I have to mention, that there is an orb that will reset all your skills - so there is no problem with unwisely spended skill points.Sooo... Nice graphics, perfect control (don't be discouraged by screenshots - all the menus around the screen is really clever), interesting environments, unique bosses, balanced dificulty curve, rewarding gameplay (when you return to the earlier stages and kill almost anything with 1 blow, you can feel the progress of your character) etc. This is really good game and I would say, that's even better than la-mulana (and for me - that meens a lot (-: )Some hints, if you cannot decide where to spend skill points at the begining:- I invested in sword, mace, armor skills always to max limit - this melee approach works rather good- I invested only 6 points to fire (for good use of fireball) and not to any other magic skills - I used the fireball to reach distant creatures or in a boss fight (you will kill big tree with fireball really easily)- 10 points in potions, but I make only 5 of them (-:- excalibur is the best sword in game- hammer of the paladin is the best mace- this 2 weapon is all you need (-:- there is paralyzing pet in special retro level - it's the best pet I think. But you will get it very late - until then frog was my favourite because it kills all the annoyng flying thinks that is hard to hit with melee.- very good potion is potion of regen. You are almost invincible with it. If you have 2-3 large potions of regen, big brainy boss is really eeeeasy- last level was little bit chalanging, but I read somewhere about bow of corrosion. I didn't use a bow in a whole game, but I reset my skills (with orb) and max bow skill, use this bow and the level was funnily easy.- you can find save files in userdata subdir of steam. There you can create copy of your save file if you like to try something before final decision. I used this 2-3 times... "

												When you first start playing this game it is really fun.  The nostalgia of these old games, and esoteric sci-fi pop-culture references is lost due to an overly crude character and poor story writing. Story: 3/10  I do not want to spoil any of the 3 endings but they are all terrible so just do not play this game. Gameplay: 3/10  It starts out fun but it does not end out fun. Music: 7/10Pro: 1.	It starts out giving you that classic Castlevaina feel. 2.	Challenging boss fights. 3.	Interesting spells that have interesting uses… but they have bad limitations.  If you play this game blind you will not know where each specialization is going towards so placing your points in a wrong stat can hurt you alot.  4.	Daggers are fun and add a very well done stealth element in the beginning of the game. Cons:1.	The main character dialoged is full of nothing but pop-cluture references to the points and most of the time he comes off as kind of a sexist pig.  It is not witty enough to be funny and kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥y. 2.	BALANCE- This game has the worst balance of spells.  Because it tries to do too much level system falls flat.  I get that you can only specialize in a few things but this game needs to consolidate the system.  3.	The spell learning system pacing is very off. For example, you only get access to the great healing spells at the end of the game instead of mid-way when it could actually be useful. 4.	There are too many stats than are poorly done.  It would have been better to combine a few spells and stats OR do an entirely different system.  5.	Towards the end of the game you need to target specific enemies to attack but sometimes you will target your own allies.  This will frustrate you to death.  There is no reason for this to EVER happen. 6.	Spells mostly affect individuals but most of the time you need to target groups. Not enough Area effects. You cannot shoot down OR in an arc.  You are very limited. 7.	Thoughtless puzzles you do not really have to think about. 8.	The pacing of the leveling system depends where you are and is inconsistent that could lead you to grinding for hours.   "

												Part platformer, part ""rpg"", UnEpic is an schlocky Metroidvania game filled with crude humor and ""geek culture"" references.During a night of DnD, the player's surrogate character the protagonist finds himself trapped in a medieval castle filled with the standard fantasy tropes. The self-aware plot does little to add or detract from the game which consists mostly of you killing the same dozen critters (pallet swaps and all) as you explore the various themed areas of the castle. Each kill nets your character exp and items in the same old way as every other rpg on the planet, and you can distribute your stat points to the various abilities according to your play style, though the ""variety"" of weapons consists mostly of the same attack swings between maces, axes, and swords only with varying speeds to differentiate between them. This will lead you to quickly find out that there's little real difference in your weapon choices but which weapon is fastest, as stun locking the rank and file minions is what dominates the game. That and long range sniping with spells or bows from outside of the enemy's line of sight.The controls leave something to be desired and will lead to some very cheap deaths, particularly when it comes to ziplining across pits of insta-kill spikes.The graphics have little impact on the game, with objects, creatures, and scenery being just well defined enough so that you don't confuse anything for anything else, and is all portrayed through limited animation.Overall the game works just well enough to avoid being bad, but doesn't particularly do anything well enough to warrant praise. Being an indie title released quite some time ago, it shouldn't be hard to pick up for a few bucks and if you're a die hard fan of the genre, it'll take you a day or two to complete.			"

												I really enjoyed this for the first 15 hours or so, but the last few areas went from clever and challenging, to cheap and tedious.  Quests became very redundant after a while, and the skill system started to show its limitations pretty hard as you got to the end.Story is fun enough, but the ending is lame, and the severe lack of variety of magic weapons is amazing.  I found maybe 2 magic axes (the melee weapon i focused on) the entire game, and a legendary/named axe that was severely outclassed as soon as I leveled up.In the end, i feel kinda....meh about it.

												One of the best story-driven, metroidvania RPGs I've played to date. This game seamlessly combines old game style with modern mechanics and manages to keep you on your toes. You rarely feel that you've been cheaply killed by a trap. The game is very difficult, but also completely fair. The graphics are great and very well made for it's simplistic style. The game also offers you several, valid, playstyles. Melee? Sure! Magic? Yep! Range? Awyes! Backstabs? Yup!Add in GREAT writing, tounge-in-cheek humor and brain-tickling puzzles and you've got yourself a brilliant game. I heartily recommend this one. Get it, you won't regret it!Also the ending is REALLY COOL!			"

												Unepic is an amazing game. It mixes Just the right amount of humor and a dark creepy feeling to keep you engaged for hours on end. The controls felt a little awkard at first, but that was mainly because it was used to the typical WASD control scheme, but you get used to it very quickly. Many times have I told myself, ""I need to do something else."" but I always need to know what is in the next room. Seeing a whole screen, full of rooms pitch black when you first enter it, bit by bit lit with the torches and other light-holders is an amazing feeling. The ghost trapped inside of you is halarious. Always trying to get you killed so it can be free to roam the castle again by trying to trick you into taking cursed items, my advice to you: You will stay alive longer of you ignore everything he says.

Early Access Review
								Note:  although this is an early access review, the single player mode is 100% complete and implemented.  I have not tried out the multiplayer yet but it looks very promising.This game does so many things right, which make its flaws all the more annoying.  I loved the exploration, lighting all the torches, making notes on my map.  The frustrating aspect comes from some design decisions made by the developer.  The biggest thing is there is a boss about a third of the way through the game that is impossible to fight from range (among other annoyances, but I won't spoil those in this review).  Later in the game, there are bosses impossible to fight in melee.  I wouldn't be as annoyed by this except you can only respec once in the entire game.  Even after respeccing you have to drop loads of gold to get the new skills, equipment, or essences (for casting spells).  If you're going to play this, definitely multi-class.  I made it through with swords, maces, and bows.  In particular, you can find a hidden bow about 2/3rds of the way through that will easily carry you to the end of the game.  I can see pure caster characters being fairly strong as well, but you might have to grind more for casting mats.Anyway, I will give this game a thumbs up.  It has a lot of charm and brought me back to the feeling of classic NES/SNES metroidvanias.  Pick it up if you're a fan of the genre.			"

								Great fun, reminds me of the old school castlevania games in terms of 2D maze like rooms with a degree of freedom and loads of customisation, you don't have to pick a class, you spend the skill points where you want.  Careful not to spread them too thin of course because the later level enemies will quickly feed your rear end to you!  Highly recommended.			"

								Don't look at the metacritic score, it's soo wrong, trust me.I was hesitant too at first to buy it, but I haven't regretted it ever since. The 2D style is usually not my thing, but it just doesn't matter in this game, 'cause it's just so awesome. I was sold in 2 minutes playing it. The story is funny, the dialogues are hilarious and the ironic nerd-mocking humor makes me crack up every  time. The gameplay is great and satisfactory, there's a loooaad of weapons, spells, items, pets that fight for you, you name it. I haven't finished the game yet, but I already spent quite a few hours on it, so the game duration is really long for a game this price. Sure, it's early access, but that doesn't show, tbh I didn't even know that, untill I read it while writing this review :D The base price is just not too much. It looks indie and simple, but trust me, the game is much more than that. OH yeah and there's also multiplayer!Pro's: - hilarious- combat- items, weapons, etc...- RPG & skill system is easy to get into- hours and hours of fun - feels like a finished product- great variety in enemies, dungeons, characters,...- map & notes system- impregnate orcs....uhmCons- sometimes too time consuming to complete a sidequest- you're screwed if you don't take notes on the map- multiplayer sometimes laggy and underpopulated8.5/10 A must play!

												*****Slight vague spoiler pertaining to the end*****TLDR: Game is solid and enjoyably nostalgic, but the ending is a big FU in difficulty and unexpected strategy which can be nearly impossible if you failed to stat correctly. I was suggested this game while it was dirt cheap. So of course, I bought and started playing. It also made my fancy tickle by being available on linux so I could play it on my Chromebook. I was thoroughly enjoying the game there for a long time. I went through and found all the secrets and developed my character into a solid tank-ranger. I find magic to often be a cheap way to play many games, as it is usually overpowered. As well, to change things up from my usual game playing selections... I chose to go hammer/halberd combo. Come the end... I realized the mistakes that I have made. I already used my item to stat reset and am currently SOL at the end. Since I didn't use magic (literally at all unless absolutely necessary) I struggle to use the alternate guy's heavy magic. I can sprint with my main guy pretty well, but I've never actually been able to beat the end. I just can't keep either one to survive long enough. When it comes down to it, I really did enjoy this game, but the end is so incredibly unexpected with it's difficulty. There is really nothing in the game that seems to compare to the frustrations that the end will bring. After investing a few hours into attempting the end (and seeing the same friggin cut-scene video over and over again) I simply gave up and haven't gone back. "

												This is one of my favourite games on Steam, and I can definitely say it's in my Top 10.Everything about it is perfect, from the combat to the dialogue, the story to the enemies. It manages to be both serious and incredibly funny all at once, and I found myself caring about the characters a great deal before I was even halfway through the game. I didn't really expect to be so taken by the castle and the characters, but here I am a year later and I still fangirl over everything. Also, the maps are beautiful, and the music fits in perfectly with every setting! SO GOOD. Also, I have to say that the voice acting was great-- I don't think they could have picked better people to voice everyone.Y'all should play this game.			"

												Great game, until the last stage, which was a completely difference pace than the rest (Last level was like a mini game what the heck?)Everything up to the last stage was a 9/10 platformer with plenty of RPG elements and feel to it.The last level took it from 9/10 down to 7/10. The last level had a timer on it and essentially forced you to rush the last level. Not that enjoyable. Also the final boss was extremely lackluster.At any rate, I would still recommend this game.

												I knew this game for many years and was being amazed at first glance.It reminds me of an 16Bit Amiga game, its style is quite retro, without being sloppy.However, it surprises you with gameplay similiar to SNES Metroidvania games.Furthermore, the developer has made significant improvements in the last 12 months,making Unepic to one of the best indie titles available.10/10 (though i hope this doesnt stop the developer from improving this game)			"

												This game is overall  fun, witty and generally a good play. Learning the enemy weaknesses will provide a good amount of challenge, as will the numerous bosses. It has several well desgined features, such as the map, and levelling system (even if it could be a bit more forthcoming with those levelling points!) I played most of the campaign before I looked online for the ending (there's a decision bit and I wanted to see what impact it had.) I would reccomend to al future players not to. DO NOT LOOK UP THE END OF UNEPIC!Other than the occasional platfoming area, I absolutely loved this game, and am looking forward to subsequent playthroughs. I also arpologise for any spelling mistakes I may have made while writing this comment. If you are looking for a fun game to kill quite a lot of time, Unepic is certainly a good play through for you.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game. The controls are tight and responsive, and the story-line is engaging and maintains interest.It is a good MetroidVania sidescroller, like Symphony of the Night, but without as much backtracking (unfortunately). It is VERY good in that the devs realized that wandering all over the map just to get from A to B isn't exactly fun--there are many teleportation options in the game, and that's great. This is one of the finest uses of my gaming dollars that I've encountered in the last decade. I look forward to anything further from the development team!			"

												The game is fun and entertaining from the start as you farm money, quest for legendary items and search for hidden corners in a map! However the later part of the game is just very one sided. For a start, bosses. Literally the only bosses that I could kill using melee was the first worm and the eyeball. The rest was just a magic spam. Secondly, weapon balance. Seriously the bow damage and magic damage difference is just far far too much to the point that I never used a bow the moment I learned my first magic ability. Thirdly, healing. What kind of game doesn't sell potions? Crafting potions asides, why can't I even craft multiple potions all at once?? Its not like monster would come into the caldron room and stab me. And finally, autosaves and manual saves. This is the first offline game I've seen without a manual save which can be very frustrating when you have to walk the previous 2 maps just to get back to where you died because autosave happens in like every ?? minutes. Overall, if you're a melee lover, I won't really recommend this game as half the time, you'd get knocked down from a cliff if you try to smack a target guarding a chest there and so on. But if you're a magic lover, go ahead and get this game, you won't regret this.			"

												This game is fun and I found myself playing till the end. The game is not perfect. Some sections feel like it is dragging on however this evaporates when you reach the next section. The platforming in the game sadly does not feel right - the platforming becomes an issue in some of the tricky platform sections.However I found to my delight that I had to create a balanced character to be able to finish the game. You have to use most of your arsenal against a room of varying types of bad guys. It was not as simple as ""hit that guy with your sword"". "

If you have a couple of gaming friends (up to 4) then this is a must have for lan parties no doubt. And making your own campaigns can be fun too, but oh man those prebuilt multiplayer campaigns are over the top fun. I wish they had kept developing on this game and released more campaigns as dlc or something.. seems like there is so so much more they could squeeze out of this.			"

												First off, the game is, by and large, good fun. Two of the bosses are uneccessarily unfair and difficult to fight, through no fault of the player... It's due to poor design, instead. Be neither afraid nor ashamed to search online for solutions. That and the tedium that sets in towards the end of the game keep this from being an excellent game. Overall, though, I enjoyed the selection of weapons and spells, the varying enemies, and the fact that you can play most of the game in the playstyle you wish. My first run through was a sword and archer specialist and that served me well for the majority of my time. The humor was tolerable enough, at least on the 12+ level. I hope to see more improvements from the developer, as long as they learn from the few mistakes made in the original game.			"

								I actually find myself enjoying this. However it is much more entertaining if you have friends to play with rather than playing solo. That's not to say the isn't good just as a single player title. The format is very similar to old school Metroid/Castlevania (as the description points out). You will find yourself occasionally getting frustrated by some of the old mechanics, like trying to jump back away from a trap, only to still land on said trap because you hit the ceiling and didn't move laterally. I hate giving scores, but I will say this game is certainly for afficionados of classic game play styles. If you enjoyed metroid or castlevania, and want a game that has a lot of detail while at the same time not taking itself too seriously, you'll find fun in this one.			"

												This game is really fun if you like fun games and don't care alot about graphics.  It provides a challenge all the way through due to greatly varied enemies and challenges throughout.  Also, the game was made much easier over time, but is still challenging on hard.  The story is a joke and had me cracking up lots of times.  There are tons of different weapons and spells.  If you have any common sense and have played rpg games before, then you will be able to manage the skill point system by simply picking one combat skill to keep leveled up and just save the other points for overcoming challenges.  If you are dumb and always spend all your points every level and have a bunch of overlapping skills, then you will have to grind to get points to overcome challenges.  Most of the later challenges can be overcome in multiple ways as well if you just think.  I like that this game encouraged thought and the use of more skills than just a single combat skill like most other games.  If you don't like to think or plan a little, you may not like this game since you will probably get stuck.  The only part that I thought was messed up was the end battle since it doesn't fit the style of the rest of the game.  I recommend slowing the game down using software to beat the last battle since you will fall or get knocked off the platforms and not have enough time.  One bad thing doesn't ruin the game though.  This is a great game and is a good deal when on sale for $5.00.  I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for it though...			"

I enjoy the kind of humor they've put in place,since your character is a real geek, there's lots of reference to video games,movies & popular culture. So far so good, for 13$ I think it deffinetely worth it with the single player only but there's more to it as you can play it online too, co-op or pvp, official campaign or fan made maps !			"

Decided to give it a go because I had a couple hours free and I liked the sound of the advert... 30 hours later I'm still playing, addicted and deperate to finish. Amazing dialogue between the main characters and game/nerd references all the way through that make you smile. Good puzzles involving having to use different weapons to destroy different types of monsters adds an element that some RPGs don't have. And not to mention and ending that you just don't expect.Definitely recommend, and I am looking forward to trying the multiplayer mode! :)			"

Around 10 hours through and have only explored 33% of the castle. Having a lot of fun with this one when I want to take a break from more tense games. Picked it up in a humble bundle, but definitely worth the $13 asking price when not on sale.			"

								Cool Game. It brings back the old DOS game memories from my IBM 8088 back in the 80's. Its worth it for under 5 bucks. I don't like how I couldnt bind some keys to movements or actions. Some of us use the arrow keys for movement. But most keys around the arrows are not bindable, my one major complaint. Old school is one thing, but get with the times.			"

Now put that in to a platformer and you've got UnEpic. It's a blase to play with friends, and comes complete with ridiculous enenmies, terrible jokes, pop culture references, depth, customization, and death. Lots and lots of death.

								An excellent 2D RPG! Great humor, plenty of quests, lot's of items, and at the time of writing this, multiplayer is currently in alpha with people currently playing it. To make things clear, the main game is already finished. The ""Early Access"" part is only for multiplayer, which is still in the works. That's not to say the main game won't be getting anything new, but the multiplayer is the sole reason UnEpic is ""Early Access""Exploring the Castle is great fun. Each zone is unique, with it's own unique look, feel, and the enemies that inhabit it.Magic is fun too. A large variety of spells to choose from. My only gripe with the magic system is that if I want to specialize in a certain school of magic, I have to go through the main story in order to get to the point where you initially get that magic. I'm not sure how it works Online, since I haven't played that yet(wanted to finish story).Each zone has multiple side quests you can discover and complete. Each one has it's own little story.There's also multiple pets you can find that will aid you someway in battle.Overall, it's an amazing RPG, definitely worth getting at any price. Along with Online Multiplayer, and the ability to create and share your maps with friends, gives this game a lot of replayability.EDIT(12/25/13): It has been 6 months since I initially wrote this review, and much has changed. While there was partial controller support when I first wrote this, there is now full support, making the game very comfortable to play with the controller, and the keyboard controls are also great.There's is now also voice acting for the vast majority of the game. Some generic environment dialogue has yet to be Voiced, but all Story Dialogue, both Main and Side, are all voiced, along with the tips/tutorial.			"

								This game is just ridiculous fun. It brings back an air of nostalgia playing a PnP game of D&D with my friends and dealing with an unruly DM. Only by telling the game story like this could they make switches that do nothing but kill you in front of a a group of chortling goblins make sense. It channels in the best parts of a Castlevania/Metroid style game and still is able to be fresh and challenging. Kind of almost reminds me of Terreria in a way too without the sandbox gameplay.Playing with a friend almost requires voice chat, but is well worth it. There is one level in co-op where you are blinded and have to lead your teammate through an obstacle course with a series of voice commands. Just wow I've never seen a game attempt something like this it is wholly unique and just another way this game truly does not live up to it's UNepic title (if you catch my double negative drift)!

								This game is everything you (may not) have heard it is, and then some.  Truly, this is a gem among treasures, a game that's hard to put down, inherent with solid gameplay, and unexpected but welcome intelligent and witty humor - a combo difficult to pull off, yet done well, effortlessly presented in such a way that I found myself  buying into the character as though he had life.  The approach is original, and the design is unique; a perfectly crafted masterpiece, complimented with inuitive, and responsive controls, all wrapped up in an 2-d (old school) side scrolling adventure.  It delivers a visual style fitting of itself, almost as though it created the style as well, rounding out the package and value even more.  It's simple, yet elegantly crafted, with small details and nuances, it can make an old school gamer smile, that old.... warm smile, a bit of 'thats cool,' from the days when we used words like ""rad;"" for whatever reason this game nailed something nostalgic, and tapped that old school love, in these modern times.  There is a reason this game is considered one of the top 10 indie games... ever.  If there is a game worth your time, this is likely it.  Simply put, this game is 15 dollars of happiness. .   .    buy it.  I guarantee you will find yourself smiling, I'm just curious how long it will take you to realize it.			"

												Unepic is a very surprising game.At first glance it really looks like nothing special, however the gameplay relatively soon pulled me right in. It's a metroidvania style 2D game with a strictly defined area map system. It also has quite an interesting story and dialogue, it is self-aware and that makes for some interesting plot points. It is very lighthearted and tries to be comedic, which it somewhat accomplishes. The humour often comes off as crude and childish, plus there are way too many references in the game.For me where the game really shines is the gameplay. It can be quite varied, with your character having the potential to do any type of combat, and you have one possible reset in the second half of the game if you think you want to specialize in another area. Just be sure to stick with the game, since in the beginning you have a very limited skill set which does start to grow, however a bit too slowly for me.I thought the room design was well done and varied throughout the whole castle, which helped in differentiating the areas and keeping your experiences fresh.Sadly there is not a good quest tracker in the game, all it displays is a checklist of your objectives without any further detail. If it's a long quest that you didn't manage to finish right away you might even forget where is the location of the quest giver. Thankfully there's a scroll that you can buy which instantly teleports you to the quest giver, but there really should be no need to buy separate scrolls just because the game doesn't provide you with a good enough overview.Similarly the map is lacking a lot of information. It is possible to put your own comments for each room, however that gets tedious and you don't have the insight into what is important during your first playthrough. There isn't much needed to vastly improve the map, just a couple of icons and maybe some short description of the area, so that you don't have to resort to browsing the internet as to where you should go next because you have no quest and on the map it appears that you don't have anywhere else to go.And that's also one of the biggest faults of the game, it doesn't give you enough information which leaves you to blindly try and brute force it until you give up and look it up on the internet. As before this could've been easily avoided with just a little bit more information.I wouldn't call the faults of the game actual faults, they're more like annoyances. Anyway, I am glad I stuck with the game, and as a result I had a lot of fun with it.7 / 10			"

The controls are tight and responsive, and the story-line is engaging and maintains interest.It is a good MetroidVania sidescroller, like Symphony of the Night, but without as much backtracking (unfortunately). It is VERY good in that the devs realized that wandering all over the map just to get from A to B isn't exactly fun--there are many teleportation options in the game, and that's great. This is one of the finest uses of my gaming dollars that I've encountered in the last decade. I look forward to anything further from the development team!			"

												This game is beautiful. This is how most casual (emphasis on ""most"") would react and act if they were sucked into a Dungeons & Dragons Universe. Each skill is used for something (that's right guys, no more useless skills that you regret leveling later.) Also each weapon is useful for something. Dagger does bonus damage from stabbing in the back, polearms have longer reach, sword swings slightly faster, maces/axes can break hard objects, bows can be used to either pick off enemies at a distance or you can shoot one, get its attention and draw it over to you and dispatch it quietly as to not alert the other enemies. spells actually require materials to use (and you have to learn/earn the ability use each element of magic) The references to other things (such as LoTR, Golden Child, Star Wars) are somewhat subtly put in (whereas some of them are shoved in your face and you are like ""Yeah i get it. you are trying to make a reference""). Rather than just being a generic hack and slash, loot collection game this actually has a story. and the side missions are actually worth doing! they give you things that aren't required for the main story but make it easier along the way. For only about $12 this game is well worth the price.			"

If you manage to connect, it's completely laggy and imbalanced, but you probably won't get that far because the multiplayer is buggy af.  Overall fun and worth playing, but it gets a downvote because of the busted multiplayer.			"

												In a world of many metroidvania type games, I really feel like this one stands out. The RPG elements are very well done, I'm genuinely excited to get new items,weapons and abilities. The progression is very well balanced and challenging on hard.  It plays very well with a controller. Gameplay is always first in my mind when it comes to games like this and UnEpic doesn't disappoint. The controls are tight and responsive and I rarely feel like I'm dying from anything other than my own failure. The humor is light and leans toward the pop-culture/dorky side of things (which I actually like :P). I have greatly enjoyed the time I spent in the game and will definitely get back to it soon.			"

								Good platformer with some nice complexity (but still simple enough to be fun). Suffers from a slightly inane sense of humour at times and a dislikeable main character (he is 'that' guy) but can be humourous in parts. ALso has slight balance problems: switches from very easy to very hard in places with very little middle ground.Overall a flawed but fun game.			"

								Unepic is grand.It plays well, has great humor, interesting story, character progression doesn't feel forced or plain or cheap and since the last update the combat is even more interesting.The aesthetical design feels very natural to the game and meshes well with every part of it.What the singleplayer experience doesn't do very well, is teaching you what the next boss encounter will do.While most of them are pretty straightforward, Neuron for example is the one you will spend alot of time on.You will get really frustrated with Neuron until you experience the ""yeah i get it"" moment, if you will experience it at all, and beating him will be really difficult unless you read a guide online, because the game doesn't foreshadow his mechanics anyhow. Putting Enemies around the area that selectively reverse your controls, make you randomly chug potions or shoot random spells, at a lesser frequency than the boss would've been a solution to this.Another negative is if you are playing on maximum difficulty, Skeletons will be your worst nightmare. At all times DO NOT FIGHT THEM WITH AN AXE. The problem is that the Axe swings too slowly, and there are alot of Skeletons usually coming your way. They will stunlock you and you won't be able to do jack crap against that and die horribly. But that's the maximum difficulty for you. Invest some points into Hammers because the game reimburses you for that anyway (by giving you more skill points).Nevertheless, the rest of the singleplayer is great and alot of fun.If you are done with singleplayer, better grab a friend and play the multiplayer!With the recent addition of Architecture, you can also make your own multiplayer maps.

								Took about 30 hours to finish the main campaign and it was worth every minute.  Entertaining/humerous story, good character customization, challenging but not cheap, good variety of enemies and reasons to use different weapons/abilities.Magic is limited by a drop (various colors) called essence, which made it seem more precious then a regenerating mana bar, but not so precious you were hesitant to use it.  Healing was a bit hard to come by so when fighting to the next check point every hit mattered, which reminded me somewhat of the original final fantsy.  You can hearth back to the save point at any time which heals you so you don't get stranded with no health, but you need to make it to a waypoint to really advance.Enemies do respawn but not gratuitously, around 5 screens will stay cleared which prevented combat from getting too tedious.  Pets are extremely useful but also very vulnerable and it costs money to ressurect them which meant using a pet or not using a pet (and which pet to use) was a legitimate decision.  Lighting all the torches in a room, which is then marked on the map, gave a good sense of completeness.    My only real complaint was the shortage of hotkeys.  With a gamepad you get 12, with a keyboard I think you get 15 or 20?  I used a gamepad and 12 wasn't quite enough.  The game does not pause when you go into your inventory or spellbook so reassigning keys on the fly isn't practical.  In most cases this wasn't a problem, but for bosses occasionaly it meant getting owned, and coming back with a couple different abilities/items on your hotbar.Speaking of bosses, most of them were pretty good, there's something like 7 in total plus a couple mini bosses.  Their difficulty surely depends on how you've built your character, one in particular gave me a lot of trouble because I had no way to cure poison.There's also a dungeon editor and multiplayer campaigns if you're craving more after the campaign though I haven't tried them.

								Bought (too) many games in the Summer Sale including UnEpic which I foolishly left uninstalled, thinking it would be just another Rage-Quit, early access bug-ridden type game. 13+ Hours in two days (one, Monday, supposed to be working!) and I simply cannot quit.Not sure what it is but it has something that keeps me waning to see just-a-bit-more. Even when I thought I had found a bug, it turned out to be my lack of understanding (and some pesky thieves). Developers suggest 20 hours of adventures in the single player game, well at my skill level that may be optimistic  - more likely 30 hours +. Added to that multiplayer and the Workshop and I believe you will get value from this title and a lot of fun.			"

								Despite the resurgence of popularity in Metroidvania-style exploration games, few games take a bold approach the way UnEpic does. Throwing a mish-mash of pop-culture humor into a lighthearted trek through a dungeon, UnEpic's ten or so hours of gameplay are ripe with puzzles, traps and all the usual D&D shennanigans you've come to love and expect out of medieval fantasy.This being said, UnEpic isn't perfect. Boss fights like Neuron are downright infuriating, and some game mechanics like invisible, flying enemies, rooms full of poisonous enemies and a lack of antidotes slow down the pace of the game's last act considerably.UnEpic is anything but, and despite its flaws, shines through as a diamond in the rough.

								I actually find myself enjoying this. However it is much more entertaining if you have friends to play with rather than playing solo. That's not to say the isn't good just as a single player title. The format is very similar to old school Metroid/Castlevania (as the description points out). You will find yourself occasionally getting frustrated by some of the old mechanics, like trying to jump back away from a trap, only to still land on said trap because you hit the ceiling and didn't move laterally. I hate giving scores, but I will say this game is certainly for afficionados of classic game play styles. If you enjoyed metroid or castlevania, and want a game that has a lot of detail while at the same time not taking itself too seriously, you'll find fun in this one.			"

However, you have to play this game with sounds on, The voice acting makes this game even more better then it already is. Srsly, play the first time with sounds on.The character development in this story is great, the character movement is soo fluenlty and good.The story itself is cliché but we metrovania players wanna explore a giant ffing castle and defeat a big baddy in the end.However, the ending itself is AMAZING..Why are you guys still reading? srsly, go play this game.Pro's:Voice actingCharacters and developmentBig Array of weapons and spells+10 hours of gameplay when rushing everythingHumor that's uniting all the fandoms into liking this gameSmooth running, movement feels realpetsDat endingCon's:Low amount of ""buffs"" on weapons (i saw like 4)Epic weapons reliant on perks in that slot, so you can't always use themOne weapon type is far supreme then the othersa lot of backtracking on the final stage if you fell			"

												This game just ticks many things I personally like in a game. It's probably not for everyone, though.-metroidvania. It has lots of screens, and quite a lot of room on each screen. While this makes the protagonist pretty small, it's pretty fun once you're used to it. I find myself exploring things much more than in other metroidvania games.-different weapons that actually serve a use. I most other games, you just stick with one or two weapons. Here, the correct approach differs from the enemy. This has a drawback when it comes to leveling, but I like the idea a lot. And you'll need all those shortcuts.-a storyline that somehow both mocks and pays hommage to roleplaying and games. All the meta-references that break immersion in a pen and paper RPG work remarkably well here.-decent level design. with all the unlockable shortcuts, sidequests and torches to be lit, there's always something to do. More than once, I lost track of the direction of the main quest but just went out to do other stuff. It's rare to see that in a platform environment.So...I'm apparently ten hours in. I don't have much of an idea how far I am or what's left to discover, but I just enjoy playing the game (even when all I do is explore a part and then teleport back to the starting point when my health gets too low). I don't think this sort of game is for everyone, but it certainly won me over. :-)			"

												The basic gameplay of UnEpic is solid but boring RPG combat. The main character is very unlikable. The RPG system has all the basics you'd expect, but adds nothing special. The combat is dull and annoying. Enemies are too easy if you have the right skills, but if you don't it becomes a very slow game of attack, retreat, heal, repeat. There is a lot of backtracking. I might have enjoyed this game as a vanilla RPG game, but the addition of the awkward humor and the ""nasty nerd"" main character makes it an unpleasant experience.			"

								If you are a fan of Castlevania, this game is for you! Combining the retro feel of old Castlevanias and the gameplay of newer ones like Symphony of the Night with lots of Easter Eggs and Mature Comedy produces UnEpic. This game is fun, funny, and has a great story line (thus far only 25% into the game). The main character is hilarious, witty, clever, and greedy making him the perfect protagonist in this crazy plot. The combat contains elements not found in many games such as weapon types and resistances, weapon skills, spells, potions, scrolls, and more! There is even an online version to the game that I haven't gotten to try out. I think they were aiming to make it feel like Castlevania Harmony of Despair.Again, if you are a fan of the Castlevania series, you can't go wrong with this gane!			"

								Pretty good game for what it is. Player-created maps / workshop support adds unlimited playthrough potential. Most maps recommend 3 players - so hopefully you have some friends to play with, but we've managed with just 2 of us.Really only 4 gripes...1) No direct link to workshop from library - have to visit the community page to find it.2) Not a ton of workshop content (note: this is due to the player base, not the devs).3) Player models look insanely similar. Ocassionally you will lose sight of your person and think you're controlling someone else.4) Only partial controller support. This is a title that should be fully controller implemented - but every now and then (like typing /dice, browsing menus, etc) the controller simply does not work or can't access everything in that menu.Edit:Adding #5.5) Abundant number of spelling mistakes are present in the cooperative ""unepic"" campaign set of maps.

								Amazing Game for RPG gamers. Your a slacker, teleported to a castle and you think your going crazy, but your just going to play along. :)   The dialogue is cleverly written and the encounters, etc. are well built. It's definately old school, but it's got good pacing and a very enjoyable run. There are a few bosses and encounters that are quite challenging so it's got some kick at points, but nothing you can't handle after a few tries.  I'd strongly recommend any gamer pick it up to enjoy. :)			"

												A fun and strangely addictive platformer RPG; the graphical style and inventory management reminded me a lot of Terraria (although UnEpic is not a randomized open-world game like that). I appreciated the ability to add notes to the in-game map, a feature so few games have.It's humour invokes plenty of pop-culture references (and amusing guest appearances)... but be warned: the humour is sometimes surprisingly juvenile... the f-bombs, racial stereotypes and lewd sexual situations seem jarring sometimes in this environment. (There is an option to say you are under 16 years-old when you first run the game, which may actually fix this complaint if it removes the edgier stuff...)			"

The castle is fun to explore and the game mechanic which has you lighting the lamps in each room gives you a real sense of progress. The player character's kind of an obnoxious misogynistic nerk and the inventory system's a bit clunky, but it's a fun and well-paced game that's kept me playing for about 20 hours so far.

												My main grudge with this game is that it gives you many options, but limit the ways you can progress on several key locations.

While it seems to encourage experimenting with all kinds of tools, the inability to reset skill points as necessary makes the game rather against its point.			"

												This game is overall  fun, witty and generally a good play. Learning the enemy weaknesses will provide a good amount of challenge, as will the numerous bosses. It has several well desgined features, such as the map, and levelling system (even if it could be a bit more forthcoming with those levelling points!) I played most of the campaign before I looked online for the ending (there's a decision bit and I wanted to see what impact it had.) I would reccomend to al future players not to. DO NOT LOOK UP THE END OF UNEPIC!Other than the occasional platfoming area, I absolutely loved this game, and am looking forward to subsequent playthroughs. I also arpologise for any spelling mistakes I may have made while writing this comment.

												This game is an action RPG 2D adventure game. It has an interesting story about a roleplayer from our time getting transported to some huge castle, with mysteries, mosters and magic. Many regular tropes get challenged in the story which is especially interesting if you know a lot of typical geek references.The gameplay is insteresting and fun, you level up and it feels rewarding when you find secrets or beat a boss.However there are two huge downsides:1. Game breaking bugs which make quests impossible to complete. I've only found this on sidequests, however it is so extremly frustrating when you run around for 2 hours looking for a quest item, to finaly realize that it was where you found it the first 5 minutes... but you could not pick it up due to a bug.2. The level up system is never explained what the different skills does. This means that, especially if you whant to create a wizard, you may place points in the worng places, which does not seem to be possible to change later.The downsides are unfortuenately too large right now to big. If fixed I would recomend, but as it stands I do not recomend.			"

												A very good metroid / castlevania like game, stuffed with humor and good dungeon dweeling.The story, although simple, is fun to go through, with interesting characters and most dialogues are voice acted (it adds alot to the game, as you might guess).The game is very difficult but doesn't feel unfair, you always know why you died, and strategy wise, there is a good range of possible weapon and strategy you might use to win (although using some kind of range attack is a must, I personnaly play a fire sword mage). No matter which strategy you choose though, its effectiveness will always be tied to your personnal skills as a gamer, and that's very important for those who play at the highest difficulty (In most of the games, if I see a 'winning' strategy, I'll basically disregard every other aspect of the gameplay and go on owning the content with it)There are secrets and hidden challenges, as well as sidequest you might want to get into to improve your chances of surviving.The music is great also, and the graphics are a mix of vector (during dialogue) and pixel art.Best 2$ I've spent in a longgggg time.

												Since this game was advertised as a Metroidvania style game, and I have enjoyed that genre a great deal in the past I figured I would give this game a go. Sad to say that it seemingly takes the worst aspects of the genre and drops what makes games like Castlevania great.The combat and platforming are very sluggish, leaving little room for dodging or complex maneuvers. The game does accommodate this style of slower more deliberate gameplay, but it leaves little room for interesting enemy dynamics or platforming puzzles. The mechanics never really felt natural as I played, though the difficulty never rose to the point where I had to hone my mechanics or knowledge of the game even on a higher difficulty. The boss fights are pretty simplistic since the game does not expect you to be able to move a great deal. The RPG aspects generally just randomly help or hurt you rather than truly encourage different styles of play. If you decide to go into axes vs. maces, the only real difference will be some enemies take more damage from one. I ended up just saving up points for if a challenge presented itself and I needed to skill differently rather than develop an actual character. The writing is quite awful, perhaps some of the worst I have seen in a game (a quick note to writers, a reference is not a joke), with the low handing fruit of nerd jokes making up a majority of the humor (think Big Bang Theory). So the writing ranges from cringe inducing references (having Admiral Ackbar say “It’s a trap”, literally), to just lazily having Zoidberg run across the screen. The art design is not particularly inspired, with sprite design looking closer to stock images and backgrounds with very little definition or dynamism.There were a few good aspects to the game that kept it appealing for a time. The exploration was crafted with more care than the other areas mentioned above, with a cool lighting mechanic to encourage discovery. The magic system is pretty intricate and has some good ideas tucked in there (though there was some required grinding involved). Overall though the exploration action platformer genre is getting quite light these days, but there are better titles that are not weak in so many areas. I am really disappointed in this title considering its promise. "

								Great Oldschool game with many modern jokes. The Developers really got humor; you can choose between several different languages: the developer is not a native English speaker and he kept his first English translation as an optional ""UnEnglish"" language before they had a ""real"" translation.You can play in many different ways and combine the skills as you like --> be an axe-wielding telepath/pyromancer or a crusader-like Necromancer if you wish. My first character is a Swordfighter/Archer/Transmuter/medicore-Healer.Playing different builds and trying to solve the challenges (which reward each of your present and future chars with ""UN credits"" for special items like a ""phaser shooting Spaceship Enterprise familiar"") will bind you for hours and hours to this game.One advice for new players: The first Multiplayer scenario (recommended for 3 lvl 1-3 heros) is frustrating since it contains many unfair traps, high hitpoint monster (feels like 3-5 times more compared to single player) and a hard boss if playing it solo (the jokes are nice though; a mean DM leads a greedy pen&paper group)--> start a singleplayer game first and ignore those ""the game is unfair and the fights are too hard"" Reviews from people that jumped directly in that multiplayer scenario.

								Played for a few hours to check it out.  It's a neat little game.  It almost has an Android phone game feel to it, but don't let the graphics fool you, it's challenging.  It has a Metroid style exploration going for it which is neat, and lots of items and equipment that drop often.  The humor is funny, because instead of playing an Adventurer you're playing a dude pretending to be an Adventurer.  He's a total smartass to everyone he speaks to, making references to all sorts of funny films, comics, and other video games along the way.A few gripes would be that the combat is tough mostly because the jumping mechanic is a little awkward, (controller recommended for sure).  I'm having difficulty remapping the buttons as well because there doesn't seem to be a way to unassign buttons, so trying to assign a button that's already in use actually activates whatever the key does.Another thing that's a little jarring is the overuse of cursing by the main character.  The voice actors are trying their hardest to make do with the script, but really there's no reason for it.  It makes the game come off like it was written by a younger crowd of junior high kids trying to impress an older crowd of high schoolers.  Don't get me wrong, I curse up a storm in real life, but there's a place for it, and it kind of doesn't fit in this game so well.Otherwise, it's amusing and I've laughed out loud a few times, because the references are placed really well and whomever did the translation to English did a great job for their designers.

												This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. It requires you to actually think instead of just going through the motions. Full exploration is rewarded instead of things like Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword where you are forced to do exactly what needs to be done in the exact order that it needs to be done. You can wander around into a place that is entirely too powerful for you and die. It's all very intuitive. There hasn't been a side-scroller this good since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.			"

												I've really enjoyed my time playing UnEpic, and at this point, I haven't even finished the actual game yet. It has a decent level of feeling both grindy and not grindy at times; I had trouble approaching some of the mobs in the game when they were just large groups (especially when they learned how to use ladders), but I felt that the bosses were fair. Bosses in the game were not necessarily long affairs, but slipping up during one of them could prove very punishing. If they were long (>5 minutes), it would be tedious, but I like the balance achieved.There are a few flaws (in my opinion) in this game that I don't think will get 'fixed' for the final product, and in a sense, game balance is one of them. There isn't quite as much freedom as I'd want out of a game like this; the character page looks as if you can follow archetypes such as a mage, but it really won't work for the game as a whole. My character used a balance of range, melee, and magic, and I don't know how I'd fare if I didn't use all three of those. Fortunately, you have enough skill points to have strengths in all those areas. It just means that you, as a player, are quite capable of making a character that might just not be able to stand up to specific challenges.Multiplayer seems like a great idea, and I think the tools used in it show a lot of potential. Better yet, it appears as though the multiplayer is getting the bulk of the attention. Unfortunately, only a really small crowd plays multiplayer; try and get a couple friends to play with you if possible, and it would definitely enhance, if not create, the experience. As of writing this, I haven't quite done that yet. That being said, when I have played with others through finding/making games, I have found the other people to be easy to work with. That might not be the experience across the board, but I imagine that a game like this has less trolls on the multiplayer compared to more popular titles.As for the early access part...I wouldn't have noticed that it was in this stage if it wasn't plastered over the steam page. The single player has always been completely done, and the multiplayer, again, only suffers from lack of players. I could see fear in playing a game nowhere near completion, but the early access was a solid product.All in all, I've played this game for a good amount of time for its price, and I think it makes to be a fun game. It's unforgiving at times, but when it really matters, you can know that you were accountable for messing up most of the time. This game deserves to have a larger crowd, because it's pretty solid; even in its early access. There is a lot of fun to be had.			"

Get experience points while you do so and get higher levels and stats - with each level up you get 3 stat points which you can add to any status, but beware as once submitted points are gone forever.There are many quests to uncover and a hilarious story. Don't miss out! Get this game NOW!			"

												This game is really fun if you like fun games and don't care alot about graphics.  It provides a challenge all the way through due to greatly varied enemies and challenges throughout.  Also, the game was made much easier over time, but is still challenging on hard.  The story is a joke and had me cracking up lots of times.  There are tons of different weapons and spells.  If you have any common sense and have played rpg games before, then you will be able to manage the skill point system by simply picking one combat skill to keep leveled up and just save the other points for overcoming challenges.  If you are dumb and always spend all your points every level and have a bunch of overlapping skills, then you will have to grind to get points to overcome challenges.  Most of the later challenges can be overcome in multiple ways as well if you just think.  I like that this game encouraged thought and the use of more skills than just a single combat skill like most other games.  If you don't like to think or plan a little, you may not like this game since you will probably get stuck.  The only part that I thought was messed up was the end battle since it doesn't fit the style of the rest of the game.  I recommend slowing the game down using software to beat the last battle since you will fall or get knocked off the platforms and not have enough time.  One bad thing doesn't ruin the game though.  This is a great game and is a good deal when on sale for $5.00.  I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for it though...			"

												The game is very fun. It has a great old school feel and look to it. Works great with a controller which i like very much. I have only found one bug that causes it to crash. It involves lighting all of the torches in The Garden. Right after you light it and the skulls pop up it crashes before they start laughing. so if your playing on a difficulty other than easy be careful so you dont lose a bunch of progress!			"

Early Access Review
								Great game. Variable difficulty levels let you choose what kind of experience you'd like. Very similar to castelvania games from years ago. Provides ample challenge, without being impossible. Lots of skills/spells, weapons all have varied damage types and speeds. You can tell this game has gotten a lot of thought.Sometimes monster hitboxes feel funny. It is possible to get into a state where an enemy has slightly longer reach than you, hits you and knocks you back, then hits you again just before you get in range. It feels like even a trash enemy on your way to a boss fight or merchant can take down a lot of health if you get stuck in a cycle like that. Though it is also possible to lock many enemies in a stunned state with your own strikes. So it isn't biased toward one side. Boss fights can be very hard if you don't have skill points in a necessary weapon or spell type, due to the significant impact of resistances.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only just beaten the first boss (on the ages 16+ side of the game and Hard++ difficulty), and have not been dissappointed so far. There have been multiple references to pop-culture, as the description states, and a plethora of humorous back-and-forth dialogue between the protagonist and the spirit that failed to possess him, becoming helplessly trapped within his body. There have also been a few points where I was given options on how to proceed, but to avoid spoilers, I won't go into any details.The gameplay itself is overall pretty decent and reminiscent of side-scrolling Castlevania games, save for the inability to move horizontally while attacking. Due to this lack of mobility on horizontal attacks, I would highly recommend using any weapon with a longer reach or a ranged attack when attempting to fight stationary opponents, snakes in particular (so far) due to their ability to stack poison debuffs on you.If you enjoy side-scrolling, platformer RPGs, then I would recommend the buy, despite currently being in Early Access. I've unfortunately not tried the multiplayer side of the game yet, but hope it's just as entertaining as the single player has been so far.    -- 8 / 10 --			"

								Note:  although this is an early access review, the single player mode is 100% complete and implemented.  I have not tried out the multiplayer yet but it looks very promising.This game does so many things right, which make its flaws all the more annoying.  I loved the exploration, lighting all the torches, making notes on my map.  The frustrating aspect comes from some design decisions made by the developer.  The biggest thing is there is a boss about a third of the way through the game that is impossible to fight from range (among other annoyances, but I won't spoil those in this review).  Later in the game, there are bosses impossible to fight in melee.  I wouldn't be as annoyed by this except you can only respec once in the entire game.  Even after respeccing you have to drop loads of gold to get the new skills, equipment, or essences (for casting spells).  If you're going to play this, definitely multi-class.  I made it through with swords, maces, and bows.  In particular, you can find a hidden bow about 2/3rds of the way through that will easily carry you to the end of the game.  I can see pure caster characters being fairly strong as well, but you might have to grind more for casting mats.Anyway, I will give this game a thumbs up.  It has a lot of charm and brought me back to the feeling of classic NES/SNES metroidvanias.  Pick it up if you're a fan of the genre.			"

The variety of weaponry, spells & crafting is  really nice, and the goive acting is pretty on-par and surprisingly non-grating for an indie title.Props all around to the developers for making an indie title in ""Early Access"" that's more than worth the price.

												Finally finished the game so I can write a review! Damn was I looking forward to that because... YES! That game is great!To sum it up to you:- this is an indie metroid/castlevania like action-platformer-RPG!- go back and forth with your character in a HUGE dungeon- loot, craft and buy/sell TONS of items, weapons, spells...- evolve the traditional way you want (fighter, mage, rogue...) and you better only focus on one- fight very hard enemies and ultra painful bosses from whom you always have to learn and remember the patterns if you hope to survive- hop and jump on platforms, gather keys and check your map- find many optional quests, NPC, hidden challenges so freaking hard to beat- enjoy (or not) the somehow (just a bit) unusual story and its many written dialoguesSaid like that, it sounds like the usual stuff, right? but here is the thing: the game was made by one guy, and its oldschoolness is so authentic that the game is great. If you enjoy the real traditional stuff, UnEpic IS epic and great. It is sometimes as hard as Ghouls & Ghosts, as overwhelming as Super Metroid, and as rich and long as an old Castlevania on NES or a long night table RPG.YES it has flaws. As I said, the game was made by one guy, and you can (sometimes) feel it:- the game is very repetitive but as could be great action games on NES- the story and its dialogues are a bit vulgar, and heavy,  I guess it's the Spanish way (free hit! wink) but I even turned off the voices after 10 hours in the game because they annoyed me and wanted to enjoy a more traditional approach- in that same idea the artwork is sometimes clumsy or even mediocre, but as a board game fan it is something I can look past, and I guess the next game will be prettier- the game is sometimes (rarely) too easy if you find a good build up combo for you character (I was a rogue with a magical dagger and... a huge axe, yeah), and on the contrary it is sometimes (often) much too hard (I am looking at you, last boss Medeox!), but for me and the people who love old-school challenges, what a pleasure it is to yell at a boss that you try to beat for the 19th time and when you finally succeed you get out of the room and get one-shot by a lame enemy before having the chance to save your progress! GRAAAHHHAJHDKJHFJEGFYUGé&""'-(é&""""!!!!?)Overall, Steam says I spent 50 hours on it, the game tells me 30 hours, so the truth must lie in between, but you WILL spend tens of hours on it if you are not a pro gamer. And man, in 2015, spend 40 hours on an indie game just to finish the main story, how rare and exquisite is that?!You used to enjoy Metroid, Castlevania, G&G on NES/SNES and you want to dive into a great, real indie, old school, hard and tiresome action/platform/rpg? I DO RECOMMEND that game!			"

												I cannot recommend this game. Too much of it is broken or poorly designed. There's too much grinding for recipe ingredients, boss battles and other enemies have the artificial difficulty of undefendable attacks that can't be seen coming, getting off ladders is unpredictable and unreliable if you're not at the top or bottom, some enemies are borderline invisible (dark enemies against dark background in the dark), the action can be squint-worthy if at standard (not closer) zoom (and some boss battles and ranged enemies require standard zoom), enemies can juggle you with multiple unstoppable attacks coming in a row. There's just a lot of padding with artificial difficulty and simply unenjoyable ""challenge"" from maybe one quarter or one third of the way in (I made it about halfway).Don't buy this game. Save your money. It's too old to have this many unfixed problems.			"

Achievements have some rewards that can be used in game to tweat and get unique items and pets (sidekicks with different abilities to aid you through your quest) there are multiple playstyles for those who like mages, rogues and your classic tankier options. character progression feels good and it has a noticeable effect in how the game flows.

												This game is beautiful. This is how most casual (emphasis on ""most"") would react and act if they were sucked into a Dungeons & Dragons Universe. Each skill is used for something (that's right guys, no more useless skills that you regret leveling later.) Also each weapon is useful for something. Dagger does bonus damage from stabbing in the back, polearms have longer reach, sword swings slightly faster, maces/axes can break hard objects, bows can be used to either pick off enemies at a distance or you can shoot one, get its attention and draw it over to you and dispatch it quietly as to not alert the other enemies. spells actually require materials to use (and you have to learn/earn the ability use each element of magic) The references to other things (such as LoTR, Golden Child, Star Wars) are somewhat subtly put in (whereas some of them are shoved in your face and you are like ""Yeah i get it. you are trying to make a reference""). Rather than just being a generic hack and slash, loot collection game this actually has a story. and the side missions are actually worth doing! they give you things that aren't required for the main story but make it easier along the way. For only about $12 this game is well worth the price.			"

												Alright, I will admit that this game looked like it wouldn't be that good at first. All I did was browse through the pictures, thought it didn't look to good, but heard good reviews, so I wishlisted it and waited on sale. lo' and behold, a sale. I bought it, put it on, thought the intro was kinda funny, and thought the game would be a bit better than I thought. Then It started, and I thought it looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It honestly doesn't have the best start in my opinion, aside from the banter, which is rather humurous, while also adding to the story and stuff, which is a great part of the game. Fortunately, I didn't just toss it aside with my first thoughts. I kept playing, got a little further, and the game kept getting better. It's an interesting combination of sidescrolling, RPG, and action. 2D skyrim with some features removed if you will. It's got weapons, skills, spells, potions, and all sorts of other parts to the game that make this game great. It should be noted that I'm not rather big at posting reviews, and that this game actually made me think it was worth it to write one. If it's not on sale, it's worth buying, if it is on sale, It's a no brainer.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Metroidvanias, with the one caveat that the story is absolutely terrible. Turn off the voice acting, and skip through the text as fast as you can. It tries to be funny by hammering home the same dumb joke over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. The main player is crude and the spirit is annoyed by this. I GET IT. They're a regular old Odd Couple. The problem is the Odd Couple had jokes, and this just has references to things, hoping the reader might find the references funny. It's a very fun game. It plays a little stiffer than Metroid or Castlevania, but it's more of a slow paced platform dungeon crawler than those games. It feels just different enough to be new. I just wish it had no dialogue whatsoever. Oh, it's also pretty visually unappealing, but that's just what you get with these retro-ish games.			"

It basically is Castlevania. Just with more fun and less serious Dracula-slaying.It felt hard and unbalanced from time to time and there a few people whining about how they couldn't defeat a boss or a level, because they invested their skill points into the wrong stuff.

												This game is really fun if you like fun games and don't care alot about graphics.  It provides a challenge all the way through due to greatly varied enemies and challenges throughout.  Also, the game was made much easier over time, but is still challenging on hard.  The story is a joke and had me cracking up lots of times.  There are tons of different weapons and spells.  If you have any common sense and have played rpg games before, then you will be able to manage the skill point system by simply picking one combat skill to keep leveled up and just save the other points for overcoming challenges.  If you are dumb and always spend all your points every level and have a bunch of overlapping skills, then you will have to grind to get points to overcome challenges.  Most of the later challenges can be overcome in multiple ways as well if you just think.  I like that this game encouraged thought and the use of more skills than just a single combat skill like most other games.  If you don't like to think or plan a little, you may not like this game since you will probably get stuck.  The only part that I thought was messed up was the end battle since it doesn't fit the style of the rest of the game.  I recommend slowing the game down using software to beat the last battle since you will fall or get knocked off the platforms and not have enough time.  One bad thing doesn't ruin the game though.  This is a great game and is a good deal when on sale for $5.00.  I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for it though...			"

												This game is beautiful. This is how most casual (emphasis on ""most"") would react and act if they were sucked into a Dungeons & Dragons Universe. Each skill is used for something (that's right guys, no more useless skills that you regret leveling later.) Also each weapon is useful for something. Dagger does bonus damage from stabbing in the back, polearms have longer reach, sword swings slightly faster, maces/axes can break hard objects, bows can be used to either pick off enemies at a distance or you can shoot one, get its attention and draw it over to you and dispatch it quietly as to not alert the other enemies. spells actually require materials to use (and you have to learn/earn the ability use each element of magic) The references to other things (such as LoTR, Golden Child, Star Wars) are somewhat subtly put in (whereas some of them are shoved in your face and you are like ""Yeah i get it. you are trying to make a reference""). Rather than just being a generic hack and slash, loot collection game this actually has a story. and the side missions are actually worth doing! they give you things that aren't required for the main story but make it easier along the way. For only about $12 this game is well worth the price.			"

												A fun and strangely addictive platformer RPG; the graphical style and inventory management reminded me a lot of Terraria (although UnEpic is not a randomized open-world game like that). I appreciated the ability to add notes to the in-game map, a feature so few games have.It's humour invokes plenty of pop-culture references (and amusing guest appearances)... but be warned: the humour is sometimes surprisingly juvenile... the f-bombs, racial stereotypes and lewd sexual situations seem jarring sometimes in this environment. (There is an option to say you are under 16 years-old when you first run the game, which may actually fix this complaint if it removes the edgier stuff...)			"

												UnEpic is one of my absolute favorite games. Now, it's not one that I'm going to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours on, but that's not what it's meant to be. However, there is still a possibility of that if you get involved in the multiplayer scene and start making maps. Personally my experience is limited to playing the single player campaign and soloing the first multiplayer Dungeon because I couldn't find anyone to play with. The story itself is actually rather surprising later on, and you get hints throughout the whole game that perhaps everything is not what it seems. That said, there are a lot of silly, immature, and even downright stupid things said by the protagonist. Of course, he himself (and the entirety of this game) is a parody of the a-typical gamer (and RPG). If you are looking for something that is both entertaining, in-depth, and doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is definitely a game you should check out.			"

												*****Slight vague spoiler pertaining to the end*****TLDR: Game is solid and enjoyably nostalgic, but the ending is a big FU in difficulty and unexpected strategy which can be nearly impossible if you failed to stat correctly. I was suggested this game while it was dirt cheap. So of course, I bought and started playing. It also made my fancy tickle by being available on linux so I could play it on my Chromebook. I was thoroughly enjoying the game there for a long time. I went through and found all the secrets and developed my character into a solid tank-ranger. I find magic to often be a cheap way to play many games, as it is usually overpowered. As well, to change things up from my usual game playing selections... I chose to go hammer/halberd combo. Come the end... I realized the mistakes that I have made. I already used my item to stat reset and am currently SOL at the end. Since I didn't use magic (literally at all unless absolutely necessary) I struggle to use the alternate guy's heavy magic. I can sprint with my main guy pretty well, but I've never actually been able to beat the end. I just can't keep either one to survive long enough. When it comes down to it, I really did enjoy this game, but the end is so incredibly unexpected with it's difficulty. There is really nothing in the game that seems to compare to the frustrations that the end will bring. After investing a few hours into attempting the end (and seeing the same friggin cut-scene video over and over again) I simply gave up and haven't gone back. "

												Unepic is a fun game. It has several pop culture references that you'll appreciate. While I may not be a fan of the overall ending(s) of the game, it was a fun ride while it lasted. For those on the fence about purchasing it, it's easily worth it's asking price and if it's on sale it's a steal. I highly recommend it.			"

												*****Slight vague spoiler pertaining to the end*****TLDR: Game is solid and enjoyably nostalgic, but the ending is a big FU in difficulty and unexpected strategy which can be nearly impossible if you failed to stat correctly. I was suggested this game while it was dirt cheap. So of course, I bought and started playing. It also made my fancy tickle by being available on linux so I could play it on my Chromebook. I was thoroughly enjoying the game there for a long time. I went through and found all the secrets and developed my character into a solid tank-ranger. I find magic to often be a cheap way to play many games, as it is usually overpowered. As well, to change things up from my usual game playing selections... I chose to go hammer/halberd combo. Come the end... I realized the mistakes that I have made. I already used my item to stat reset and am currently SOL at the end. Since I didn't use magic (literally at all unless absolutely necessary) I struggle to use the alternate guy's heavy magic. I can sprint with my main guy pretty well, but I've never actually been able to beat the end. I just can't keep either one to survive long enough. When it comes down to it, I really did enjoy this game, but the end is so incredibly unexpected with it's difficulty. There is really nothing in the game that seems to compare to the frustrations that the end will bring. After investing a few hours into attempting the end (and seeing the same friggin cut-scene video over and over again) I simply gave up and haven't gone back. "

This game costs like 13€ and was for me more enjoyable than most full price titles.+ Playtime: I beat the game in 25h, not doing any challenges or having replayed, which i'm gonna!+ Replayability: You can skill your Character so differently that there's a huge variation of playstiles, not just melee/mage+ Freedom in endgame to farm your char to powerlevels over 9000!+ Alchemy: Crafting runs mostly on Mob drops like bat wings for healing potions.+ Accessability and ""fast travel"" through the castle via Gates and Teleportscrolls or -magic.+ Steam Workshop!!!+ CoopCons:- first encounter with a  Jester  :D Buy it, play it, enjoy it.10/10 "

												UnEpic is a non-linear RPG platformer. UnEpic begins with the game’s hero, an average guy called Daniel, playing an RPG fantasy board game with his friends. When Daniel heads to the bathroom, the lights go out and Daniel finds himself transported to a castle. Daniel shrugs this off as a hallucination and plays along with the cast of weird and wonderful characters he meets on his journey as fantasy. Daniel learns that his ultimate goal is progress through the castle and to slay its master – Harnakon.UnEpic’s levels look like an 8-bit adventure game, littered with enemies, traps and rewards for the intrepid adventurer. The standard RPG components are in this game like: earning XP, upgrade abilities with points, making potions, learning spells, trading and encounter many different (funny) types of side quests.The game tries its best to poke fun at itself, making jokes about the genre that it’s paying homage to, with nods to the classics weaved into the dialogue between Daniel and Anokra Bash. UnEpic would be an excellent addition to any RPG fans library. UnEpic could ultimately be compared to 8-bit Marmite; if you love RPGs you’ll enjoy it – hate them and it’ll leave a bitter taste in your mouth and hunger for something different.			"

												I have way too many steam games after all the sales and bundles, a lot of which I know very little about.  I saw unepic mentioned a few times on reddit as something people enjoyed, and I was happy to find it in my library.  It's one of those games you might never play without a recomendation to do so, and I'm glad I gave it a chance.If you like symphony of the night, this is a great little game to spend a few days on.   There is a ton of flexability in what types of skills and abilities you can upgrade, allowing for all sorts of fun charecter builds.  I also like little touches, like being able to write notes on the map.As for negatives, there are a few anoying aspects of the game.  Some bosses require ranged or melee, which can mess with your build, and there are some very anoying status effects and late game mechanics that are more pain than inovation.  It's not a masterpiece, but the game is fun if you like upgrading and leveling up.  And wow, the end is really cool!			"

												Played this on Hard++ on my first run-through. I can see how this game can be enjoyable on lower difficulties as there is a wide variety of builds that can be used to successfully get through the entire game. With that said: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON HARD++ IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANY FUN!! If slamming your face into concrete repeatedly for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles is something you're into, go ahead and play this on Hard++. There are only a few specific ways you can build your character towards the last areas of the game on this difficulty. You do get one chance to reset your build after discovering this, but if you are into this game for the variety and creative ways of killing random♥♥♥♥♥♥ you aren't going to have a good time on Hard++. Overall, gameplay was nice (except for a few areas toward the end), story sucks, characters are not interesting. Get it on a sale if still interested, don't pick up at full price -- or just stay away from this one.			"

												I must say that Unepic is quite Epic! The possibilities are vast in this game! There's a bunch of upgrades and skills to explore. The entire game is a wild card! Level design is great and the objectives are never tedious. A must for those who care to enjoy something different. Ah yes... and...Wow, the end is really cool! "

												Enjoyable for the first couple of hours. You know what's fun? Multiple new debuffs each time you move a screen, solely focused on either killing you ridiculously quick or just stealing your items/making you drop them, forcing you to constantly spend time in your inventory/rebinding your gear. And ontop of that, one of the most pathetic excuses of a 'final boss' gauntlet I've seen in a game. Save your money and your patience for much better games.			"

												Very good game. Nice challenges. Lots of funny dialogue. Multiplayer with friends was also fun. And to all those people who are downvoting this game, because they can't kill icegolems with icemagic. (figuratively)This IS AN RPG. You can't expect that you can take anything down with the way you do things!It's about countering enemies that can eat your face and dealing with the unpredictable!Rating as RPG-Platformer: 8.5/10Personal Rating: 8/10			"

												Don't let the name fool you. This game is EPIC! :DNo really, this game has been a huge amount of fun so far. We just finished the second official level and it's great.It got funny traps, nice levels and interesting boss fights.And you can play it all in coop, which is great and I would definitely recommend doing so!Have a look at our playthrough if you want more ingame footage.

												I picked this title up as a random ""cheap"" buy with the view to getting a few hours of amusement out of it and have been pleasantly suprised at just how good a game it is. I'd never come accross the ""Metroidvania"" style before, probably as the original titles never grabbed my interest when they first appeared, but as a gameplay style, it feels part way between an RPG and a platformer (and I'll put my hands up and freely admit.. I've never liked platformers).UnEpic scores because you don't have to be as pin sharp accurate with position to avoid a drop to the immediate death and in any case, death here is more of an midly annoying embuggerance than a ""hurl D pad at the wall in frustrated rage"".The combat rewards thinking and planning rather than button mashing hack and slash (not that hack and slash doesn't work.. it does, it's just you'll get more out of thinking and tactics) and the exploring, challenges and puzzles spice up the variety of tasks.The biggest draws for me though, are the humor, in-jokes and totally inappropriate pop culture references.. The single player game is chock full to bursting with cryingly funny moments and for anyone who grew up with D & D (especially if like me you started with the 1974 original rules) and has ever suffered from the sociopathic DM and his killer dungeon, the whole multiplayer game will have you crying with nostalgic laughter.10/10 for ingenuity, creative gameplay and top notch humor to beat the winter blues.

												This game just ticks many things I personally like in a game. It's probably not for everyone, though.-metroidvania. It has lots of screens, and quite a lot of room on each screen. While this makes the protagonist pretty small, it's pretty fun once you're used to it. I find myself exploring things much more than in other metroidvania games.-different weapons that actually serve a use. I most other games, you just stick with one or two weapons. Here, the correct approach differs from the enemy. This has a drawback when it comes to leveling, but I like the idea a lot. And you'll need all those shortcuts.-a storyline that somehow both mocks and pays hommage to roleplaying and games. All the meta-references that break immersion in a pen and paper RPG work remarkably well here.-decent level design. with all the unlockable shortcuts, sidequests and torches to be lit, there's always something to do. More than once, I lost track of the direction of the main quest but just went out to do other stuff. It's rare to see that in a platform environment.So...I'm apparently ten hours in. I don't have much of an idea how far I am or what's left to discover, but I just enjoy playing the game (even when all I do is explore a part and then teleport back to the starting point when my health gets too low). I don't think this sort of game is for everyone, but it certainly won me over. :-)			"

												At first I really wasn't sure about it since I've got it for nearly nothing out of a humble bundle but after getting trolled by the game and died three time in a row, I started to understand what kind of funny/exploration/rogue-like/DarkSoulesque side-scroller adventure UnEpic was.After two hours, I've unlocked 2 zone,many weapons,a couple of armor pieces,potion recipes and walked around naked while slaying unforgiving enemies & environment, yes you read that right, walking around naked. I enjoy the kind of humor they've put in place,since your character is a real geek, there's lots of reference to video games,movies & popular culture. So far so good, for 13$ I think it deffinetely worth it with the single player only but there's more to it as you can play it online too, co-op or pvp, official campaign or fan made maps !			"
