												I certainly understand why many of my friends have trouble getting into this game. If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, you're probably used to having a full set of armor, a decent weapon or spell, knowledge of basic combat, and a fair amount of gold and potions before you even start exploring the world. Morrowind isn't like that. You start the game by stepping off of a boat in a poor swamp town with nothing but the clothes on your back and a rusty iron dagger. There is no fast traveling (or at least no free fast traveling), and the map can sometimes be confusing. The only way you can find what you're looking for sometimes is by reading vague directions your character wrote down in their journal. In Skyrim, Alduin appears before you even have control of your character. In Oblivion, the emperor tells you of Mehrunes Dagon's plot before you leave the first dungeon. In Morrowind, you don't even learn the main plot of the game until you're a few hours into it, and even then you don't have all the information. Many people would consider these things to be negative, or at least intimidating, but in reality I wouldn't have it any other way. If you can get past the dated mechanics and look, I remain convinced that this is the greatest Elder Scrolls game, and my favorite game of all time. The story is wonderful, the lore might possibly be the greatest in all of fiction, the world is wonderfully diverse and detailed, and there is a sense of freedom and magic that makes even games like Skyrim feel constained in comparison. Another incredible thing is that the modding community is still strong 13 years later, meaning that nearly every problem you could have with this game (including the borderline infamous dicerolling) can be fixed. This game is truly a masterpiece and a must play if you are a fan of RPGs. Although your character starts so low, lower than any other RPG I've ever played, the feeling of satisfaction you get when you win is indescribable. You truly feel like a God, and the NPCs treat you the same. There is a reason so many people still rave about this game so many years later, and while it is intimidating, it is without a doubt worth the effort.			"

												You start playing Morrowind. You pick a race, class, go through the tutorial and dive right in. The controls are a bit clunky and you feel a bit awkward swinging around the first dagger you get. Well screw it, let’s see what this game has to offer. So you go up to the first enemy you see, a mudcrab. You start hacking away at it, only to find that you miss almost 90% of the time. Finally after getting hit a few times you dispatch it. Well, that didn’t go as well as you expected. Then you realize that even when running you are moving at a snail's pace and you are constantly very low on fatigue. You get your hands on better weapons and armour, but you still miss often and take more damage than you expect. Despite all  this, you play on. You get your first side quest, and then you realize that objectives aren’t marked on your map nor are you notified when they are completed. Then you find other tedious things, your magic doesn’t regenerate, there isn’t a fast travel system*, spells can fail, equipment can break, etc. At long last you snap. You run around cursing the day you ever thought it was a good idea to purchase this game in a blood-curdling scream. But for whatever reason you play on, maybe you want to see if you can get the slightest satisfaction out of the money you’ve invested, maybe a small part of you likes the game, or maybe you want to add more play time so your multi-paragraph rant about why you shouldn’t play this game will be taken more seriously.	Then something magical happens, you get a few level ups and your skills improve. You start figuring out how to keep your health up without constantly purchasing potions. You start paying close attention to the quest instructions and find that they aren’t so difficult to follow. You finally start hitting more than you miss and with every hit you land and every creature you slay you get a burst of adrenaline. You grow stronger and start making short work of enemies that once made mincemeat out of you, laughing triumphantly in your sweet revenge. You start moving much faster than you ever thought you would. But that was just the beginning. You then find yourself paying close attention to the side quests and the people of Morrowind and suddenly you’ve completely immersed yourself in a game that has graphics optimized from the N64 era, but that no longer matters. The controls that once baffled you become completely second-nature. The combat that once was infuriating becomes so great you will charge at every enemy you spot.** The magic system that once seemed impossible suddenly seems like the only way a magic system should work. Even the most trivial interactions become satisfying, and at long last all the troubles you had in the past with this game make complete sense.	Unfortunately Morrowind isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. It’s no exaggeration that this game takes a LOT of patience to get into. You begin with selecting races you’re not familiar with and making choices for your character without any knowledge about all they ways they will affect you throughout the game. Then, you are put through a brief tutorial and are thrust right into the game with only an item for the first main quest and a dagger. The rest you will have to look up online or learn through experience. But don’t be discouraged, as this game get’s extremely enjoyable once you get out of the ‘rut’ of the first chunk of the game. Once you finally get a good understanding of how everything works you finally start to see that things that once frustrated you are there for good reason. The customization level of this game is extensive, more extensive than Oblivion or Skyrim. Not that those are bad games, but Morrowind offers a deeper and more challenging experience. You have plenty of classes to choose from, you can make your own class, and you choose a birthsign which can augment your stats or grant you new abilities, further increasing the amount of character builds to experiment with. Overall, if you’ve got a lot of free time on your hands and want to play through an deep and immersive RPG, I cannot recommend Morrowind enough. Pros:	+Very immersive open world	+Plenty of ways to build your character	+Background Music is subtle yet very catchy	+Deep Stat/skill development 	+Rock Solid Gameplay, takes some getting used toCons:	-Takes a large amount of time to get used to gameplay and controls        -Outdated Graphics (Can be fixed with the right mods)         -Sound Effects are a bit lacking (Fixed with Mods)        -Enchanting is the worstDon’t like the lacking sound and graphics of Morrowind? Use this mod compilation, it’s safe and easy to install:http://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/mgso-release/* There is a Fast travel system of sorts. (As Nerf mentioned earlier) The Mage’s guild allows you to warp to any other Mage’s guild building. The Silt Striders (Giant mountable insects) let you ride to almost any town. Also you can use intervention spells to warp you to the nearest temple, fortress, etc. When you get further in the game you can use exotic means of transportation such as jumping/levitating across the entire island. Bottom line is, just because there’s no fast travel doesn’t mean you can’t conveniently get places** Morrowind is often criticized as having a “God-awful” combat system. I have yet to figure out why but the complaint I hear a lot is the fact that you can miss, and early game you will miss a lot. I actually loved this. The higher your agility stat and weapon skill the more often you will hit. This motivated me to try and improve my weapon skills so that I could hit more often. Plus I feel like the health of enemies was lowered to compensate for this. Most of the early enemies will go down in a few hits so long as you're using your most effective attacks. So even early game when you miss a lot fights don’t last too much longer than they would in Skyrim where you hit every time. Point is, the combat system is something I love, but you might not enjoy it.			"

												My opinionated review for: The Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindDisclaimer : I have played all of the TES games in reverse order so my praise for the game is not pure nostalgia. Also most of my time playing this game has not been on Steam, but rather the disc version I bought from a movie & music store long ago. I believe I have put a total of 500+ hours on that version alone.Gameplay: This game is the pinnacle of the TES saga. Every RPG element is here and works well. Upon startup, you are greeted with a rather bland title screen. What makes it so special is the iconic theme of Morrowind that has appeared by variation in all of the later TES games. Clicking new game will send start a skippable intro video and then the game starts. Your backstory is that you were sent to Vvardenfell under the orders of the emporer. This backstory is vague enough for you to be creative with your story, unlike Fallout 3 or Oblivion. You will be awoken by a Dunmer named ""Juib"" who then asks you for your name. This is the character creation process. You will then select one of 10 races, a class, and a birthsign. It is short and sweet enough to not be annoying like Skyrim's god-long intro sequence. You will collect your papers and orders from the census offices and then you're off. No intro dungeon. No forced story. Nothing. This is where most people are lost. They are so used to the handholding from the newer TES games. You will have to read your journal for info. So you open it up and it says to deliver a package to some guy in Balmora? Where is Balmora? Players will then proceed to run around and then get killed by a mudcrab because they don't understand the stat based combat. That is the beauty of this game. Nothing will be handed to you except insults for being an outlander. What would you do in this situation? Ask for directions of course. The dialogue system is made so that you can ask a npc about almost everything that your character knows of. Unlike Skyrim's 3 phrases that nobody cares about, you can ask about secrets,rumors,services,work, about the dungeon you just delved, an assassin that attacked you, and even a weird dream that you may have had. It is very in-depth. There is also a disposition system where you can ahave enemies based on race,guild, or even for the fact that you are a criminal! Not everyone will be your friend, just like real life, so stay close to those who you trust. You have a diverse range of skills that are all useful in their own ways. You cannot master them all, so train wisely! Attributes are availiable as well, unlike Skyrim. This game is a true RPG, so don't expect action based combat. If you wonder why you can't hit anyone, it is because you are not properly trained with the current weapon you are using. It makes more sense if you think about it. Some may say it is extremely boring and tedious, but I say it is fair, seeing how you should not be able to pick up a weapon and automatically start killing with it. If you prefer to stay out of conflict, there is a great alchemy system availiable. You have multiple tools to mess with and to this day, I still haven't fully understood the sytem. There are many other systems in the game but I cannot fully explain them all or we'll be here for days. Art: In order to judge and old game's graphics in a modern day, you must compare other games that came out the same year. Going by that, I say the game looked fairly well. It has a lot to look at and read (tons of books availiable!) and while the animations may be a little unbelievable and robotic, they get the job done. One thing you may notice about Morrowind compared to other RPG's, is how alien it feels. That is the prime charm of Morrowind. Think Japanese culture mixed with Mayan culture. There are not a lot of video settings available, so you may need to download Morrowind Graphics Extender if you want to fully customise the graphics and short view distance and low fov.Music/Sound: This game has one of the best soundtracks ever. Composed by Jeremy Soule, every track is movie quality and always keeps a great feeling inside. It adds to the atmosphere in a big way. The sound design is great as well, although ambience is rather dead, the music makes up for it. The voice acting is top notch, although sometimes non-existent, or maybe I'm just spoiled by Skyrim.Entertainment Value: Like any other TES game, you can sink an infinite amount of hours into it. There is always something new to explore in Morrowind, a new dungeon, new npc, new weapon, etc. I consider it the best in the series followed by Skyrim. If you are an RPG fan and you don't care if you have to put in a little work to enjoy what this game has to offer, you will most likely enjoy what Morrowind has to offer. And if you are not pleased with how the game looks or plays, there is an active modding community available that will fix every issue you have.Score: I love Morrowind to death, so of course this review was biased, but I feel you cannot help but enjoy the land of Morrowind just like me. With Skywind coming soon, we may get another chance to explore this land once again.5/5Thank you for reading.			"

												Morrowind is the only game that I seriously dedicated every bit of 2 months of my life to.It was early 2004...I went on my lunch break at my crappy job and I decided to never return, I was living with a slob of a roommate, we ate ramen, I was using a credit card to get by and I was somewhat depressed. I heard about Morrowind from a friend, who sold me when he said ""It's a rpg that's kinda like GTA in a fantasy setting"" (boy was he dumb)!, I bought it used for about 10 bucks that day, popped it in my Xbox as soon as I got home and began my journey...The addiction was real, ""♥♥♥♥ the job search"" I said to myself, as I also skipped some showers and meals. My routine was as follows: Wake up at about noon, play Morrowind for about 14 hours, sleep, repeat, with a few quick breaks in between of course. I was hooked.   Morrowind amazed me to say the least and took me away from the BS that was life. Sure, some could say I was a ""loser"" during those 2 months but I didn't care and I don't regret it one bit, Morrowind was the most amazing experience I've ever had with any form of art or media. It took 3 long years before I found somewhat the level of enjoyment in a video game (there was Fable in late 04 but it was short lived) that I had in Morrowind, which was Runescape (believe it or not) but nothing came close to my love of Morrowind. I persevered through the game freezes (losing hours of game play), starting over with different characters because I couldn't make up my mind which race I wanted to be, playing entirely in the 3rd person view, and that huge and incredibly annoyingly hard to navigate city (Vivec) while the characters, the level progression system (the sense of getting better with every step), the huge open world, the graphics (I would often move the camera towards the sky at ingame night to look at the stars),.and the incredible music, sucked me in. The possibilities seemed endless with this game, as I could do whatever I wanted (ohhh shiny! I'll take that!) and there were surprises around every corner...I'm just casually walking along and all of a sudden someone falls from the sky and plops on the ground, ""Did that seriously just happen?"" Later, I jump up a mountain only to find a lone orc on top wearing badass armor I so desperatly want to have. ""Can I take him?"" was the question I was asking myself. It was these types of discoveries that made Morrowind so different.   Most of the time I would ignore the quests and just roam the world to see who or what would pop up. Silt Striders were for ""marks"", I thought, as I spent hours traveling the land on foot, making sure to occasionaly jump or swim to level those acrobat and athletic skills. Often I was ever so swiftly r a p e d by a blighted Cliff Racer.      Something this fun had to eventually come to an end, I couldn't stay in Morrowind forever.After 2 months, the journey was over...I finally decided to go out with friends (they begged me) one night. I finally became unglued from the game for a few hours. I had a great time (got to see a girl I was interested in) that night and I realized living in the real world wasn't so bad and that I could make it better for myself.It's almost as if Morrowind played a part in my transition into full blown adulthood, as I was finally saying goodbye to the carefree days of being a child or teen with little to no responsibility, Morrowind was the finale...and it sure was grand!  The rest is history. I got a job a few days later, moved soon after that, and began dating that girl I saw that night. I played Morrowind again a few years later (PC physical copy) and sunk another 80 hours into it, but that was it, I was done, I walked away never beating the game. It already served it's purpose. Although sometimes I deeply miss the characters (Fargoth), the world, the music, and 2004, I can happily say that I am done with the game, a closed chapter of my life,  but I'll always have fond memories of Morrowind. I enjoyed Oblivion and am currently playing Skyrim SE & ESO, but they can't compare. Nothing can compare to Morrowind.Not gonna lie, I look forward to Skywind and I watch the Morrowind store trailer sometimes for that nostalgic trip, and just hearing the main theme song damn near brings a tear to my eye. Like most people who have experienced a most joyous event, my time with Morrowind in 04 evokes pure happiness. Even if it meant that my character's end game was to be deleted from existence after being brutally fisted by a lowly scamp (of all things), I would still relive those 2 months in a heart beat.After typing all of this, I feel the urge to play it, but I'm spolied now with Skyrim's improved engine, and I know the experience will never be the same...2004, unemployed, my whole life ahead of me with just Morrowind to worry about is long gone...but I'm thankful to have had the experience.

												Morrowind is a strange thing to see on SteamYou would be well advised to ignore 99.9% of the reviews here because its most likely someone nostalgic sperging off over how good the game isIf you are truly new to the game, maybe even the series, heres my twist on it.This game requires time, and this game requires patience. Its horribly broken but in such a sweet way that its a million times better than what the dumbed down modern games ever could give you.Its not some Skyrim where you can play 2 hours and get through half of the main story while being lvl 1.Its rather like ""you are not prepared for this, why dont you go and do other ♥♥♥♥ for the next 20 hours and then try again, just to maybe fail again""The combat system is much more rpg like, stats actually determine wether you can hit things or not, so dont be discouraged at the start, the real jewel of the game is the magic system anyway. (Little Advise: Use the trainers, you will need them, and its gold well spent.)And well, its ACTUALLY a world, with ACTUAL characters in it. Its not a one liner that sends you off to the next quick dungeon with randomly generated loot + enemies. You will have to actually talk and listen to people, you will have to actually look around and observe the world, you will actually have to navigate through wastelands to finde some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cave and you will actually get your ♥♥♥ kicked by some troll mage just because you forgot this or that poition. Theres no quicktravel, often theres no ""maybe i can cheese this"", sometimes theres just ""♥♥♥♥, i need to go back and prepare better.""The beauty of this game is that it still whoops your ♥♥♥ after 100 hours of play, and after said 100 hours you still might have only seen a fraction of what the game can offer.Its old, but oh, its so good. Everything the people say about this is true if you just let it happen.So if you can forget about the graphics and some luxuries that modern games have. if you really want to experience a fantasy world with understandable enemies and dangers, if you are tired of being the next and next and the next same generated encounter, then this game is for you. Wander into a cave you dont know and god knows what you will find there.And dont listen to some whacky guide trying to tell you what beginners should do, JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT. Failing is fun.Id pay ♥♥♥♥ing 60€ for it and it would still be a steal by todays standards			"

												Morrowind in my honest opinion is the quinessential entry in the Elder Scrolls franchise. Easily better than the previous installments, and its direct sequel, and a good debate on whether or not it is better than Skyrim. I would be in the camp to say it is better. Skyrim is nothing to mess with though, as it is an amazing game in its own right. Both have their strong points. But the weak points for Skyrim are mainly only things that were not introduced yet until later Elder Scrolls titles. The weak points for the followups would be things that sadly got nerfed later on, to make the games more console friendly. In any event, I think Morrowind is fantastic. And it has after 11 years aged wonderfully. So what Morrowind, and its brethren are, would be best described as a massive open world single player role playing game. A game with a world so massive you could spend hundreds of hours, and still discover new things. Virtually every building and room can be entered. There are full towns, castles, keeps, crypts, dungeons, temples, and a wide assortment of other places to explore. There is a nice lengthy 20 hour main storyline, and a number of side quests that could add hundreds of more hours onto the main quest. There are guilds and factions to join. Friends to make and even more enemies to take on. The other great thing that helps flesh out how huge the game can be would be the player. You can be pretty much whatever you want in terms of class. You can use a wide variety of preset classes, or create your own from scratch. And from there evolve it into something completely different. And there are many races to choose from, each with varying impacts on quest lines and character interactions. You can be a pure warrior. A thief. A magic user. And much much more. You can rob people. Help people. Be the local hero. Be a fiend and murder an entire town. Become famous or notorious. It's all up to you. And of course, like other Elder Scrolls games, you become shunned by being a vampire, werewolf, or carrier of a disease. The level progression in The Elder Scrolls is handled through a number of ways. You can level up by a wide variety of skills. Not just for killing things. You could level up merely by boosting your sneak skill, or acrobatics, or whatever else. And each time you level up, the world scales with you. So enemies become more fierce. But so do you. And not to worry, as along the way you'll discover many new weapons, and magical abilities to mix and match to complete your personal arsenal. One thing I enjoy about the magic is that Morrowind allows you to custom create spells, giving you a near infinite potential to creating the perfect spells.  Visually, Morrowind has aged decently, but with the use of visual mods, the game can look on par with even Oblivion in terms of world detail. Which is not at all bad I must say. In the sound department, there are only a few tracks, but they get the job done right, and are easily going to be memorable for those that play for more than a few hours. 11 years later, and this still remains as one of the best Western RPGs to date. It's never too late to get into Morrowind.Nominated for the 2016 ""Test of Tme"" award			"

												Ah....Morrowind. I hope our ongoing relationship (12 years now!) never ends. I remember our first meeting. I went to GameStop in 2002 with a little extra Christmas money. I was holding you and another game, Shenmue 2, and having a hard time deciding which to take home to my Xbox. I ultimately decided on you and I'm a better person for it.I still think about the first time I stepped off the boat onto Vvardenfell and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. No quest arrow pointers, no direction. I was just supposed to do whatever I felt like. The very idea was mind-boggling and so hardcore. My first trip down the road toward Pelagiad, then on to Balmora, Caldera, and Ald-Ruhn. It was days before I even started the main quest. I rolled a few characters and we had a lot of fun times, but then you changed. Yes you changed, for the better, when you decided to show me so much more with your Game of the Year release on Xbox. The game I had already spent hundreds, possibly thousands, of hours in had nearly doubled in size. I still hadn't even done everything there was to do in the base game, but I knew I would come back evetually, so I moved on the expansions. We had so much fun together. I never imagined it could get any better.But then, I got a PC. Oh, how I never even dreamed of the possibilities. Mods. Mods everywhere. The Unofficial Patch. Better Bodies. Morrowind Graphics Extender. I was never very shallow and didn't mind how you looked, but these and hundreds of other mods, no thousands, showed your true potential.We've had our ups-and-downs. There's been times I have looked through old saves and realized I haven't spent time with you in over a year, but I know you'll always be there waiting. I'll admit I've cheated on you with your younger siblings. I know I'm a terrible person. I fell victim to the sway and promises of Oblivion, but it was too easy. It showed where to go and what to do. It gave me less armor and weapon choices. It tried to limit my experience. It was cold-hearted. While it was fun, it was really just a fling.I went back to you for awhile, but then Skyrim released. Sure it was new and flashy, it looked gorgeous, but that's not what it's about. It was even easier than Oblivion. So after another fling and another lesson learned, I went back to you yet again.I've purchased you 4 times over now (Xbox vanilla, Xbox GOTY, PC GOTY, Steam GOTY) and I've still never experienced all you have to offer.----------Environment: 10 - From the shores of Dagon Fel to the sprawling city of Vivec. From the streets of Mournhold to the Clockwork City. Very few words can describe the magnitude of the environment - sprawling is the first that comes to mind. Go anywhere you want. The sky's the limit. No really, it's the only limit.Controls: 7 - Look up, look down. Strafe left, strafe right. Pretty basic setup. Combat may be clunky, but mods exist to make it better if you want. It's an action RPG, but an RPG none the less. Stat based combat means not everything willl hit every time.Gameplay: 10 - Essentially, Morrowind allows you to do what you want, when you want. Play the game however you feel like. Don't feel like ever completing the main quest line? No problem. You might even forget it's there like I did. Want to kill off an important NPC that's part of the main quest line? No worries there either. There's even a work-around quest line that will still allow you to finish the main quest line if your prefer.Entertainment: 10 - Become a member of the Thieve's Guild and steal your way to the top. Rise through the ranks of the Fighter's Guild and earn your place. Join one of the three political houses for some intrigue. Go on a walk-about and see what there is to see.  You might run into a naked Nord that has been bewitched or you could possibly encounter a group of bandits. There is so much going on in this game, you just have to explore to experience some of the random and crazy things out there.Replayability: 10 - I've spent many, many hours in this game, and have only played a total of four characters. I still want to start a new character at some point. I hope that explains the score well enough.Graphics: 7 - At release, it was gorgeous. Compared to modern games, it's not much to look at. If you're a shallow Hal, there's plenty of mods available to spruce things up a bit.----------If you've never played an Elder Scrolls game before, you have no idea what you're missing. If you started with either Oblivion or Skyrim, you have no idea what you're missing. A lot of gamers agree (no source) that Morrowind is the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series and I agree. Do yourself a favor and get the game.Most important is give it some time. After the short intro scene, you're on your own. You decide where to go and what to do. You decide how to play the game. The learning curve can seem a bit steep, but believe when I say say very simply, it's worth it.----------Disclaimers:- If you're questioning my listed hours on record, I just purchased this on the Steam 2014 Holiday Sale (12/22/2014). However, as listed above, I have spent quite a bit of time with Morrowind outside of Steam. Give it some time and the hours will begin to climb substantially.-No, I'm not truly in love with this game nor do I have some sort of abnormal gamer fetish. It's just a game I love to play that is the top of my personal ""best games"" list. Suprisingly to some, I do actually have a wife and kids.			"

												One of the most epic games ever made. Over 17 years past yet Morrowind has a large active community and millions of fans. One simply cannot explain why =) Morrowind is an Role Playing Game. Abosulety free from story line. After completing initial character creation (5 minutes) you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.But what makes this game playable in 2017? Answer is - Plugins. Thousands of plugins, made by community over 17 years.Texture and graphics enchancing plugins, armor, quests, new lands... this game has unlimited potential for modding. If you still havent tried any mods, do so, you wont regret it!And even without mods you will spent hours just walking in Vvardenfel, exploring, fighting, questing and looting.This game is a legend. A must have.			"

												Like Skyrim? Like being the Dragonborn?Sit back and let me tell you something.Dragonborn is nobody compared to the Nerevarine. Dragonborn needed fast travel, dual-wielding and a Voice-Weapon to get the job done. You gotta walk up the Throat of the World? Nerevarine could levitate over the Red Mountain! Skyrim took so many ideas from Morrowind it decided to drop the act for the Dragonborn DLC and just send you back to Solstheim because Skyrim didn't have enough giant mushrooms and ash-wastes.Nerevarine could enchant rings to make Sauron bow down like a punk. He killed more vampires than the sun. He could float, heal diseases and walk on water, which makes me wonder about the theological ramifications of this game.He slayed more Nords than Alduin.Nerevarine, man.Nerevarine for the president of Tamriel.

												What makes Morrowind special? To me, it's simply the incredibly unique game world. Morrowind is so delightfully alien, inhospitable and most importantly extremely detailed. This bizzare land, where trees are giant mushrooms and people ride giant insects to get around is unlike anything I've seen before. Every aspect of Dark Elf society seems to be represented in this game , creating a game world that feels alive. It's also extremely densely packed with content. This game rewards players who take their time to look inside every nook and cranny for hidden items. You can't take more than 5 steps without stumbling on a Daedric Shrine, Dwemer Ruin or Cave. if you want to experience one of the most detailed gaming worlds ever made, and are willing to look past hardware limitations that were present at the time to experience that world, then give Morrowind a shot.

												Morrowind is one of the first games I have ever played. Thousands upon thousands of hours were plugged into Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon. I hadn't even heard of a ""mod"", and this was the best game I'd ever played. I had so much fun exploring every nook and cranny I could find, I only ever touched the main quest once, then scrapping it after a glitch in the game prevented me from talking to the Ashlanders.Fast forward ~9 years later.I picked up the Elder Scrolls Anthology, downloaded all my games and installed Arena/Daggerfall. I played some Arena, got frustrated, some Daggerfall, got bored, some Oblivion, game crashed within half an hour, played some Skyrim, spent more time tweaking settings than playing, played some Morrowind and... well, I had a good time. I ended up playing non-stop until I finished the main quest--something I was never able to do when I was younger. I gave myself a pat on the back and moved on to Tribunal.Morrowind is, in my opinion, the best Elder Scrolls Game -- nay, the best Bethesda game -- I have ever played. Not only is its artwork and story amazing, but the sheer amount of crap, loot, creatures, and NPC personality is astounding. I can honestly say that Morrowind is the only TES game I can say is completely, 100% playable without a single mod. Not even the official add-ons (although those were fun in their own right). As much as I loved Oblivion with the Shivering Isles, and Skyrim with Dawnguard, I have (after countless hours beating them on the console) had a much less enjoyable experience with them unmodded then I have with them modded. The most mods I have ever thought helpful for Morrowind are the Morrowind Code Patch and the Morrowind Patch Project. Most other mods for Morrowind have felt as though they detract from it for me (especially the MGSO, or the Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul. I have never found graphics to define a game, only to help define a game. The only texture pack I have felt fitting for Morrowind is ""Morrowind Watercolored"", a nice, light-weight texture pack which is similar to the Vanilla), however, I can understand that my tastes are not for everyone, so some people find some Morrowind mods rather enjoyable.Morrowind Pros:+++Great story+++Great Vanilla playthrough++Great job at minimizing hand-holding+Great leveled list and hand-placing items (i.e. makes sense)++Great use of game mechanics for skills++Players can easily RP for this RPG++++++Lots of artifacts, unique items, awesome/funny quests, misc items, easter eggs, the list goes on...+UI is rather convenient+Decent controlsCons:--------Bugs, oh so many broken quests and glitchy issues--Non GOTY edition is a lot worse, I'd reccomend getting the GOTY...--lack of some (fixable through MCP) VERY helpful keyboard shortcuts-A little too much of NPCs saying the exact same thing as everyone else-It is a lot more difficult for people to be a mage than a warrior or vice-versa due to the time-consuming nature of switching to spells and back to sword/spear/mace/axe------Cliff Racers... them annoying buggersThings I really like but some people would greatly agree/disagree on:~~Interesting combat system, can either be a swing-and-miss session or someone dies in a few hits...~~Journal system: I find rather immersive and MUCH improved in the GOTY edition (or simply with Tribunal)~~Difficulty: I find the reccomended difficulty to be perfect, with no need to turn it up so I'll start taking damage~~It's a bit difficult for new characters, as there is very little leveling of creatures/people/items. However, with the right knowledge, you can use this to your advantage...All in all, I'd say Morrowind is a darn fine game.Thanks for reading! Peace!~PikachunoTMEdit: I actually have gotten around to modding for Morrowind -- even working on a few mods myself, and find it a real blast to mess around with the Construction Set, editing things left and right, adding new things, and more. There's so much to the game even after I've beaten it several times now, it's still worth re-visiting in my eyes. I hope other people will get as much fun out of it as I have.			"

												Morrowind could quite possibly be the best game ever made, but it is not for everyone.If you are a person who requires games to babysit you with handholding, then you will probably not have the patience to get into this game. Instead, you will create a character with skills all over the place, run around outside Seyda Neen for a bit, then fight a rat with a depleted fatigue bar wielding a weapon you are not skilled in, die miserably and ♥♥♥♥-post on your nearest imageboard with something like ""miss miss miss"".If you, however, are not afraid to figure things out for yourself, like to explore a vast and dangerous world filled with many secrets that are available to you right from the start with little guidance, and are not put off by reading a fair amount, then you could find a game that is unlike any other you will ever play and may capture you for hundreds of hours.Morrowind marks a turning point in Bethesda's career, before they figured out that going for the wider audience and console markets, aiming for the lowest common denominator and spending more budget on marketing than development will make more profit than making actually good games. Unfortunately, we will never see another game like Morrowind ever again, let alone a successor. Oblivion and Oblivion 1,5 Skyrim are worse in almost every way, and take away more than they add. One step forward, three steps back if you will. Fortunately, digital goods do not have an expiration date, and old games can still be played and enjoyed years after release.The game combines modern graphics with classic functionality. As such, many things will be determined by dice rolls. Many inexperienced players have expressed their frustration when (not) hitting enemies in combat. Let me just say this: it is perfectly possible to create a character who, even at level 1, never misses an evenly matched opponent. Though this is not something a newbie would come up with. Here's a protip: weapon skills and fatigue are important. Like, really important. It is always better to use the rusty iron sword with a high weapon skill over the mace of world destruction with a low weapon skill.Morrowind's main selling point is the open world, which is available to you once you complete the short tutorial. Unlike later games in the series, where you are the center of the universe and the world revolves around you, in Morrowind you start as a nobody, dropped in a world that would exist with or without you.That underwater cave at the edge of the world will not have exactly the same treasure and enemies as the dungeon just across the tutorial town. The chest at the bottom of the biggest and baddest dungeon will not contain a rusty iron dagger just because you were brave and smart (or stupid) enough to get it early. Poor bandits will not wear armor worth as much as an entire city just because you are high-level. The world is there, and waiting for you to explore it. Here, a young thief won't just have to steal silver spoons and forks because that's all he'll find. All the best gear in the game is available right from the start, although well guarded. And it's whispering to you: ""come and get me... if you dare"". Also, people are not mysteriously immortal just because you might need to talk to them later. Morrowind lets you do just what you want to do, without trying to protect the player from his/her stupidity through artificial barriers and limitations.Morrowind doesn't have compass and fast-travel that make you beeline from one objective to another. During your adventures you will inevitably get lost. You were sent to kill someone in a dungeon, and on your way there you find a cave. You clear it, receive skill and gold, and wander off from one interesting thing to another. After a few hours you suddenly remember what you actually came here for. Exploring is half the fun in this game.Being on Morrowind is like visiting another planet, with alien, but consistent and credible wildlife and landmarks. The atmosphere and immersion is second to none, and as with any game, the music plays a major part in it. The soundtrack is simply wonderful, which makes it even easier to get absorbed in the game as the hours fly by. There is nothing quite like reading the ironic shortstory of a skillbook you found at the end of a dungeon, with the crackling sound of a nearby bonfire or the whispering of buried souls in the background, while listening to the tranquil music.You can overcome the challenges Morrowind puts in your path as a strong warrior, a sneaky thief, a smart mage or any mix thereof. Notable is that all of the playstyles the game offers you work reasonably well, as long as you know how to use them. What's interesting is the spell system. Here, mages aren't simple warriors who shoot fireballs instead of swinging a sword. They have about a hundred spell effects at their disposal and can use custom-made spells to do so much more than simply deal damage to enemies.As great as Morrowind is, it does have a few flaws. Most of the quests are simple fetchquests and not very interesting on their own. Given however that not only you'll explore the world as you do these quests, but also the way you rank up in factions, this can be overlooked. Factions will treat you as a simple errand boy when you are a nobody, while you get to slay vicious monsters and claim powerful rewards as you become a high-ranked member.The leveling system with its attribute modifiers may also be viewed with criticism. If you are the min-maxer type of player and want to make your character as powerful as he/she can be, you have two options: carefully select specific skills that govern specific attributes as your major and minor skills, write down all your skill-ups and control them through calculated play and careful use of trainers - or just install a mod that automatically enables the highest attribute modifiers upon levelups and gives you the freedom to play the way you want with the skills you desire. Note that if you don't care about maxing all attributes and simply play for fun or RPing purposes, none of this is necessary.The world, the music, the lore, the atmosphere, the immersion, the depth, the love to the detail, the hand-placed items and NPCs, the ability to mod and so much more make Morrowind my favourite game of all time. It is as close to perfect as a game can be, and I cannot recommend it enough. The start can be somewhat harsh for people unfamiliar with older games, but I'll guarantee that anyone who's willing to spend the time and effort to get into this game will be more than rewarded for it.Due to a few technical issues, I highly recommend playing Morrowind using the following modifications:MGE XE makes Morrowind work on high resolution and in widescreen (remember to adjust the FoV, 91.32 for 16:9). Just disable all the other stuff such as distant land and visual filters. Although there are a number of tools that allow you to do this, MGE XE is the least intrusive one, once set up. It may require some messing around with UAC, due to the way Morrowind creates registry entries for different users.Morrowind Patch Project 1.6.5 beta BTB edit fixes tons of bugs. There are newer ""official"" versions of this, but I've found that they introduce a number of new bugs, while this version works well.Morrowind Code Patch for many bugfixes and convenience tweaks such as removing inventory window size limit or toggle sneak mode instead of having to hold down the key.Timeslip's exe Optimizer also fixes tons of things. Windows may spam you with errors while it's running, but it will work fine if you ignore them (don't click anything, just leave them be).4GB patch increases the memory Morrowind can use to 4 GB.None of the above mods alter the content of the game in any way. They're mostly of technical nature to turn an otherwise outdated game into a better experience in this day and age.			"

												In Oblivion, you are an assistant to the hero prophesied by the stars and the dream of a king, and go on to greatness as foretold. In Skyrim, you are a natural hero born with dragon blood and the innate ability to speak the language of dragons, and go on to greatness as foretold. In each game, along the way, you are seen as the savior of many guilds, groups, and towns, even if they are in conflict with each other in some way.In Morrowind, you are placed in Vvardenfell by order of the Emperor because you match a supposed prophecy. With the Daedric prince Azura's assistance to enact her revenge, you're thrown into the position of fulfilling said prophecy under guidance from the Blades, and by going to the hard work of convincing everyone you really are the prophesied one. You don't know if you really fit the bill, but you'll be damned if everyone else won't believe it.You climb your way up the ladder of each guild or ruling house you join, fighting your way to the top each time. It's a long, hard road through many cracked and broken pathways, but you clamber up the pile of corpses you made with One-Clan-Under-Moon-And-Star wrapped around your finger, and an ancient Dwemer hammer in your hand. You reap what you sow.This is a sign of how different this game is from its successors and predecessors. A story which questions deification, worship, and prophecy; a world wracked by cataclysmic blight storms and the threat of a mortal-turned-insane-god; gameplay that greatly encourages a close eye to character building and leveling; and a plot which culminates in the death of gods and the destruction of that which deifies mortals. This is why Morrowind is so much different than its peers.Is the gameplay to everyone's liking? Of course not. Those unexperienced with character building, and those without the patience to take in the world around you, won't find much to enjoy in this game. That's the key word. Patience. It's encouraged, and rewarded in spades. Don't play this game if you started at Oblivion or Skyrim. There's very little chance that you'll find this an enjoyable experience.For those with the open mind and the patience, this is an incredibly worthy experience that will suck you in and never let you go. Play this only if you know how to manipulate chance and skill to your favor, and how to make your way through a harsh, unforgiving, and challenging world.Bear in mind that this does not come with the Construction Kit.

												Morrowind is the peak of Bethesda's game making history. No question. I have played this game for almost 70 hours and I have never beaten the main questline because this game is so engaging that I get side-tracked every time by the multitude of side-quests to undertake, and with the two expansions, and the fair number of mods put out by the community, I have resigned to playing another 70 before I do complete the story, and I will love every minute of it.If you've played Oblivion and you enjoyed that, you will love Morrowind.If your only Elder Scrolls experience is with Skyrim, I highly recommend that you try Oblivion first, because Morrowind is quite a dated game, but if you do that, then go for it because you will not regret it.PLAY THIS GAME. YOU CAN WEAR CLOTHES UNDER YOUR ARMOR AND ROBES OVER IT JUST BUY IT NOW PLEASE.			"

												Alright, so first off, I didn't really think I'd like this game as much as I do now that I've played it. I didn't really care that the graphics sucked, since it is a pretty old game, but I did hear some new Elder Scrolls players say they didn't like how dramatically different it was compared to the newer games (I'm fairly new, since the first Elder Scrolls game I played was Oblivion). Even though this game is nothing like the newer ones mechanic wise, it's still an amazing game for multiple reasons.- This game is pretty realistic in multiple ways. When you do quests, you have to ask around and find things out in order to complete it, since there are no quest markers. When you get a quest, the quest giver gives you the place/person, but might not go into specifics on where at that place they are (if they're in a town), or they might not even know the name of the person. Everything you know goes into your journal, and you're sent off to complete said quest. If the quest is set in a town far away that you have to get to, there are multiple ways you can do it, since there is no fast travel. You can pay someone to take you by silt strider or boat, or you can go the long way and walk there, depending on where it's at. - The weapon variety is also realistic, along with the way armor is set up. Morrowind has all the basic weapons the newer Elder Scrolls do, along with some others. Staves have been in all the Elder Scrolls games I've played, but they haven't worked like they have in Morrowind, since you can actually attack people with the base weapon along with tossing magic at them with it. You also have some other weapons that haven't made an appearance in the newer games, like Tantos, Wakizashis, Spears, Halberds, and various throwing weapons, such as throwing knives, darts, and throwing stars. With the armor, you can basically have a layer under your armor for normal clothing, and you can put different armor pieces on at the same time. - Many different types of spells and enchantments exist in Morrowind, more so than Oblivion and Skyrim by far, ranging from your usual elemental spells, healing spells, buffing and weakening spells to teleportation and levitation.- The lockpicking and smithing mechanics are very different, with lockpicks and smithing hammers coming in different levels of efficiency. As you level up, you end up finding better lockpicks, but the chance of you picking a lock depends on the efficency of the lockpick if you are a low level in lockpicking. If you are a high level, however, it seriously doesn't matter what lockpick you use. I haven't really dealt with the smithing hammers that much, but I assume it is similar. - There are a ton of guilds that have a bunch of nice quests that you can do, yet they have favored attributes that you need to have at a certain level to progress in the guild. Basically, they favor certain character builds, so if you aren't built for the guild at first, you need to work a ton in order to perform well in the guild, which is realistic.- Morrowind features many intresting and unique creatures that vary in difficulty, but they do not level with the player like they do in the newer games, which can be frustrating to some, but pleasant to others, depending on who you are. All in all, this is the best game of the series and the game that is truest to the Elder Scrolls universe. I completely recommend it to anyone who is willing to give this game a try.			"

												This game literally ruined Oblivion and Skyrim for me. As the old saying goes, once you go Morrowind, you don't go back. Sure, the combat system is annoying- but usually only for the first hour or so on a new character. This game absolutely kills the other two in terms of immersion and roleplaying. Wanna be a redguard Harriet Tubman, freeing all the slaves with your mighty fists and Horny Bracers? Go right ahead. Wanna commit deicide and wipe out a culture's entire pantheon? More power to you. Wanna go on a quest to pick every flower in Vvardenfell? None of the NPCs will think any less of you. This game is- and rightly so- a classic. Every Elder Scrolls fan should give this game a shot. 11/10- Best Game Ever			"

												Morrowind is the swan song of an era. Built in the fleeting early 2000s window of opportunity where there was already enough money sloshing around the industry to support a lavish open world first person CRPG but before the pressure of needing it to sell to literally every last person on earth in order to recoup costs and having to water it down accordingly. The first time you swing a knife that thing's gonna slash down, give every indication of colliding with whatever you were trying to hit, and do no damage whatsoever. Because despite looking very much 2002 (the graphics slightly hokey but redeemed by unheard of draw distances and consistently on-point audiovisual design (yes even the faces dammit)) it's running old testament dice rolls under the hood. There are skill trees for shockingly useless weapon types and the game won't lift a finger to stop you from murdering and/or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off essential NPCs, offering only a little dialog box after the fact asking whether you want to reload a save or continue on your doomed quest. It's not a particularly unforgiving game but it asks that you engage it on its own terms and learn the systems in order to succeed instead of waltzing in like an obnoxious tourist on an all-in package trip to the final boss. If you can manage this, you'll find few videogame locales are as immersive (there's this almost Minecraft-ish internal concistency to the way every object and actor works in exactly the same way and a lot of emergent fun to be had exploiting this) and memorable as Morrowind's Vvardenfell.Oh right and then they ported it to the fledgling Xbox where it proceeded to sell a trillion copies and in one of the great tragic misunderstandings of our era instead of going 'hey looks like console gamers have a taste for complex, immersive CRPGs too' Bethesda went 'oh there's money in open world console RPGs? better make Oblivion simple enough for elementary school kids because all console owners are idiots!'(note: my playtime on the steam version isn't indicative of how long I've actually spent playing as I also own the original CD-ROM release, the Xbox version, the DVD-ROM GOTY PC rerelease plus its Xbox counterpart and I must've logged 300ish hours over the years.)

												Okay, what?Imagine a game where you are the chosen one!Imagine a game where you go on a great adventure quest for wealth and glory!Imagine a game where you make the peasants bow to their king!THIS... IS NOT... THAT GAME!No.Instead, you're a homeless schizophrenic who gets woken up on a prison boat taken to the worst place in the world. Morrowind. A humid and mosquito-infested rotting bog, full of Ashlanders, or Ash-trash, as they're called.As you get off the boat and look around, all you see are sorry poor sods who drink and do skooma all day, while they fish their butts off to make some money as imperial wage slaves. All they want is a life in peace, but they're too much of a bunch of passive trashlanders to do anything about it.You're then shoved into an immigration office, where you'll meet a sorry old oaf who stares blankly at you with a suicidal glare from shipping human garbage like you into Morrowind everyday. After you pick ""Custom Class"", because you're a waste of human resource who can't get a real profession, you're met with an unenthusiastic ""Interesting"", and get kicked out into Seyda Neen.All you're given is a moldy ring, a rotting note, and a ""package"". The note gives you directions to Balmora, which, according to the architecture, seems to be in Afghanistan. You then spend the next 4,000 hours reloading your save file due to getting murdered by Cliff Racers, having their annoying screech stuck in your head to haunt you for the rest of your miserable life, while getting xenophobic remarks from everyone and everything, until you finally reach Afghanistan. To the far south-west part, you'll find a topless old creep who'll let you sleep in his bed with him. You can also pay him so he can teach you wrestling. No, he's still topless.You then drunkedly scribble down his directions in your journal, which are visible by pressing ""J"", to see where you're supposed to go. I'm sorry, what was that? Quest markers? Fast travel?Now those are four words I haven't heard in a long time...After you've wandered around for 600 hours with animations that look like you've pooped your pants and are trying to unstick your buttcheeks from the poop, like every other NPC in this game, you end up figuring out that you can choose to become the ""Nerevarine"".The Nerevarine is supposed to have intercourse with Vivec, a ""Chimbucha"" addict, and save Vvardenfell from some dude called Dagoth Ur, who apparently was his ex-boyfriend. They broke up after having a threesome, or something. I don't... I don't want to know.So anyway, Dagoth Ur is trying to make the volcano erupt and swallow the continent whole. After like 5,400 hours, when you finally become a saint by drinking Vivec's Chimbucha which he claims to have ""personally chimmed in himself"", you beat Dagoth Ur and get to watch the volcano erupt and swallow the continent whole as you flee by holding down the CTRL button to enter sneak mode, and then strafe away with an animation that reasserts your role as a homeless wackjob.Worst 10,000 hours I have ever spent.All the expansions are garbage.This game is a hobo simulator.10/10.

												Morrowind is by far the greatest open world RPG ever, and shows all the potential games like this have.  Beautiful story, so many secrets - and with many quests and dialog thats actually useful, your time will surely be consumed. Replay value is high especially with a quick start vs Oblivion or Skyrim's lame storytelling effort.  Get the Overhaul 3.0 for the graphics if you can't stand them.Where did my life go?			"

												Buggy. Extremely unpolished. Crashes more than Windows XP. Fun as hell. What Bethesda did here in sheer ambition more than overcomes the cosmetic issues. Sure you'll see terrain rocks floating randomly in the air (they still have that issue in Skyrim, actually...), NPCs frequently stranded on staircase corners, and slaughterfish inexplicably wedged into cliffsides. But this game gives you a lot more freedom and choices, something which developers crow about all the time in the industry, but are quite loathe to actually give (cough, everyBioshockgame, cough). A lot less hand-holding as well. Unlike many other newer Bethesda  games, while you can go anywhere, you shouldn't. While there is some mild leveling (most notably in randomly spawning loot) it is suicidal to waltz into a Daedric ruin at level one. You can kill essential characters instead of inexplicably knocking them unconscious. This game is good in that it's not afraid that the player might go off the rails or even break the game. Like a box of lego bricks it says here's the pieces, here's the eventual goal if you want to pursue it, have a go.			"

												This game is way ahead of its time, The story and the detail of this game. The modding community is great too. The developers went all out with this game, no generic npcs, backgrounds to every character, every book is readable, every npc has a unique name, tons of quests, thousands of fantastic mods such as: Morrowind Comes Alive, Morrowind Overhaul, Giants (Monster mod), Tamriel Rebuilt, and Morrowind Bebirth! This game takes a good 50 hours for the main quest on your first playthough plus Tribunal and Bloodmoon which is about another 60 hours of gameplay. I probably had 1000 hours on this game before it was on steam. So what are you waiting for?! Purchase this masterpiece and enjoy one of the best experiences any game could ever give you!			"

The Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindSome of you will notice I have only put in .6 or so hours to Morrowind on steam. I have owned Morrowind (and the expansions) since the days they were released (Morrowind was released in 2002). I played Morrowind the most between its release and Oblivion's release. I only recently bought Morrowind on steam a couple months ago (to finally get a digital copy, I still have the CDs), thus the lack of play time on steam. But make no mistake, I have put many, many hours into Morrowind.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 6.5 Poor Morrowind has not aged well at all. Though not terrible, it is a bit jarring to return to from the beauty that is Skyrim.  However, with the upcoming Skywind project (and currently available texture packs), keep your eyes peeled. Morrowind is well worth exploring, despite being a little tough on the eyes at times. 
(Graphics are not used in the overall score, due to the game's age.)   Gameplay 10 The epitome of an open-world RPG, Morrowind not only pushed the envelope, it lit it on fire and hand-crafted a new one. Classic RPG elements come into play with your skills, leveled up according to you. Quest giver giving you lip? Kill him, take back your items. Short on cash? Steal it from whoever you want, just be prepared to pay the price if you're caught. You cannot go wrong with Morrowind, which captures the magic of another world like no other game out there.   Story 10 A long, arching plot with plenty of diverse character interactions. As you progress, your fame grows, and the world reacts to this. Experience the joy of embracing your destiny to save Morrowind. With countless sidequests and unique zones to explore, and tons of lore to discover, Morrowind has many stories to tell. But most of all, yours.   Multiplayer N/A Sadly, this game can only be enjoyed alone.   Replayability 7 Never has any game absorbed more of my time than Morrowind. You'll never play it the same twice. Once Skywind comes out, expect this number to jump plenty high, as Morrowind deserves your time, and will be even more beautiful than it was when it first released.   Overall 9.3/10 Morrowind captured the magic of exploration and gaming for me. I have extremely fond memories of this game, and highly recommend it to anyone, and everyone. Even without the upcoming Skywind mod, Morrowind is a game you should pick up. Do NOT miss out on the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series, and a legend among games.

												""Whenever you mention this game,someone,somewhere,will reinstall it."" -The Internet as a WholeThis has been said many times about many games. Vampire: The Masquerade. Deus Ex. Thief. Morrowind. That last one is the focus of this review. Is this game old? Certainly. The Game of the Year release came out in 2003. I originally played this on the original Xbox. Has the game aged well? Arguments can be made in either direction; I personally think it didn't age well,but it's still serviceable. Is it fun to play? Depends.Morrowind does not give you a dense tutorial. All Morrowind does is give you the bare basics,and an in-character journal. No compass,though you do get a minimap with a radius of about fifteen metres. No objective markers. No point-and-click fast travel. What does it have? An assortment of spells to aid in mobility; Water breathing,water walking,and levitation from the Alteration school of magic. Mark and recall,ALMSIVI and Divine Intervention from the school of Mysticism. That journal? It can record entire conversations,if you need it. Your character will note down the important details entirely in the first person,as well. All of this encourages you to explore,which is something that point-and-click fast travel and objective markers rob you of. You're told to kill some poachers at a nearby mine? There's a tomb along the way,and you just know you'll be tempted.And that's what brings people back to Morrowind; The joy of exploration and discovery. The thrill of stumbling upon something unpleasant in a poorly lit space. But,exploration alone is not enough to keep most gamers,myself included,hooked. Morrowind truly shines with the writing. True,the game,for the most part,lacks voice acting. But,for a game of this scale,back then,such an undertaking would've been cost-prohibitive. But,almost entirely through text and environmental storytelling,Morrowind will spin for you an entire library's worth of thrilling tales. From in-game books (Try the 36 Lessons of Vivec!),to numerous great questlines (House Hlaalu gets niftay!),to one-offs (Naked Nords!),expansions (Welcome to Mournhold!),and even incidental characters (Thanks for the ring,Fargoth!).Morrowind is a game of stories. A game of plots. It is a vehicle for delivering to you,the player,a story. Or more. If you come into the game expecting flawless gameplay,fluid animations,and a game where you can't cheese the system,you'll be sorely disappointed. The game is far from perfect. But,if you can look past the flaws,you'll find some of the best stories ever,or never,told,and some of the greatest music to ever by produced by Jeremy Soule. And,to cap it all off,Morrowind is made for modding. The Nexus Mods Network started with Morrowind,and has expanded into what it is today.If you want a great story in an alien world,you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with Morrowind.			"

												*Steam time not indicative of actual play time*My Friend MorrowindA Personal Reflection about Why Games are ImportantThe game that has most been on my mind lately is Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I've found myself humming the main theme a few times in the past month or so, and I always feel a saturated pulse of remembered emotion.I first played Morrowind on the original xbox, which I kept alive for years past a natural end using a soldering iron and a dream.  It was a dark time for me, Atlanta in 2000s.  I was working 60-80 hours a week tending bar and barely pulling in enough to pay for my studio apartment, my cats, my phone, my food, an occassional xbox or ps2 game, and enough booze to suppress my as-yet-undiagnosed mental illness.I would get home in the wee hours of morning and play Morrowind, often falling asleep on the couch with controller in hand.  It wasn't the story, exactly, though the story is not bad.  My life was so painful, and I felt so little control over my circumstances- until I entered Morrowind.  Three central characteristics made the game so perfect for my needs. First, the player-guided, emergent, pseudo-sandbox nature of the game's narrative.  I could go anywhere and attempt anything, ignoring or engaging the ""main plot"" however I saw fit.  I remember little about that storyline and I kept playing my character for hundreds of hours after its completion.  In Morrowind, I had agency over my choices, and I improved at the things I chose to do.  When I felt unable to change my world or myself, when I felt unfit for my own goals and dreams- this aspect of Morrowind grew profound, became deeply important to me.Second, the enormous and diverse cast of characters. So many scripted characters going about their own business for their own reasons. So many stories to be told by the many individuals, so many books to be found and read in the world.  Morrowind felt populated by real people, so to speak.  Many of the characters have simple tales to tell that illustrate the vicissitudes and banality and struggle of everyday life.  This is a world in which everyone toils through their labors day by day, whether a hero comes or not.  I saw my life through the lens of toil, and I was comforted.Third, the sheer alien-ness of the world-building.  This is not your typical white-washed, messianic fantasy of a hero's journey set in an idealized medieval Europe.  This is Morrowind, and only Morrowind.  The Elder Scrolls have returned to a more mainstream fantasy vision and I believe they are weaker games for it.  Every step taken in the game was a journey of discovery of new and stranger wonders, and I was in love with each new one.  What better place to find solace from our world than in a world so alien to my expectations?When I catch that music in my head and I get that thrill through my body, that wash of emotions from an immensely upsetting time, I reflect on Morrowind with a sense of deep gratitude for the role it played in my life.  In fact, the experience profoundly affected the way I understand and interact with video games, elevating the process from recreational narrative experience to important literary medium and even beloved and faithful friend.

												Ever wondered why it’s so hard for werewolves, to have a nice dinner with family during the full moon?Why vampires don’t use straws for drinking blood?What kind of mud crab talks?Why travelling by jumping is good for your health?Go no further my friend. All your questions will be answered.The Elder’s scroll III: Morrowind is an open world fantasy role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and published by Bethesda Softworks and Ubisoft. Yeah, infamous Ubisoft. Don’t be afraid though. With mods like Morrowind Overhaul, it really comes alive with enjoyable playability. The main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind.You need a good pair of eyes with this game. Morrowind isn’t about great graphics. Morrowind isn’t about multiplaying with your homies either. It isn’t about perks, or kill streaks. It’s about love. Yeah, you got it. Love. After you have played Morrowind from start to end, all the way, you know why. All those beautiful Dunmer ladies with tight skirts. Those cat like Khajiit broads with their fancy nails. Orc girls with nice biceps. With a excellent story and races like these, you won’t find any trouble replaying your game, again and again. I’m a mage lover. I publicly admit it. I love magic. I love the feeling, when I tear apart crowd of bandits with a fireball. I love when I shine like a diamond after buffs. Morrowind has really good variety of spells, and you can make your own spells too. If you are ambitious enough, you can become the leader of Mages guild, which is always nice. They have nice robes. You didn’t find the answers right? You will my friend. Want it? Get it. "

												Oh, Morrowind. A game where you'll spend countless hours walking through the sprawling foyadas and dreary caves of Vvardenfell. Unlike it's successors, Oblivion and Skyrim, where they bring many of us to worlds that are familiar to us, Morrowind doesn't do that. Instead it brings you to a world unlike any other, the homeland of the Dunmer. From it's lush greens to the west, swampy marshes in the south and east, and deserted and diseased ashlands to the north. The questlines will take you all the way across the massive island, and no doubt will you be spending hours of your time just gazing at the beauty of Morrowind's aesthetics. Granted, it's a game from 2002 and without a doubt the graphics are dated. But with a few mods it will go a long way, and even with Morrowind unmodded, it is still a great game.As for controls and gameplay, they are by far the clunkiest out of the TES series, and Oblivion shares this characteristic as well. The combat is 'hit by chance' and can get awfully annoying when you die five times to a mudcrab or a cliff racer. The protagonist walks and especially runs awfully slow at the beginning of the game, even with just clothing. My favorite thing, however, is the spells. Something that Skyrim definitely does not have and Oblivion could've been better with was spells and spell making. In Morrowind there is a MASSIVE plethora of spells you can use to create your very own spells, i.e. a spell I made called the Potato-Motato whereas it not only burns an enemy, but paralyzes and poisons it (Needless to say, it's pretty awesome, name aside.).Although the music is great, the sound effects are... okay. The voice actors seemed to had sounded very bored and that they were just reading their scripts instead of sounding like they're actually their character. The sound effects are pretty much stock sounds you'd find from any game creator program. The stepping noise is awfully annoying and loud, even on lowered volume.TL;DR It is a great game, and if you are a fan of Oblivion, Skyrim, or both, you NEED to try this game out.			"

												A game soley for people who have patience, a far cry from the other elder scroll's games. You're not going to be kicking ♥♥♥ right off the boat, no. You'll be walking as slow as a sloth, you won't be able to hit ♥♥♥♥, and you'll have to find out where to go, all by your self. At first, I hated the game. I had played skyrim and oblivion earlier, and I had high expectations, I expected a carbon copy of the first two I played. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. It felt awful, and I ran out of patience for the game and uninstalled it due to its extremely hard difficulty early on. I was a total ♥♥♥♥ing casual. Years later, I came back to it. This time, with a clean slate. I lowered my expectations, and I didn't think of the other elder scrolls games. Over 35 hours later on the OpenMw sourceport, and I started to adore this game. Its the best Elder Scrolls game bar none. Far more interesting characters than in skyrim (my boy dagoth ur), and Morrowind already had the disadvantage of extremely limited voice acting. Exploration that rewards the player! Instead of some doofus marking it on your map and holding your hand through out, all you get is brief descriptions of where to go. No Map markers, no compass, nothing. Only crudely written notes in your journal. Because of this, you have the option of meeting and talking to other people, such as city guards, of more clear directions. I can't even recount how many times I accidently wandered into a completely different quest line when I was searching for a temple or a location I was trying to get to. Quests I struggled on at first, became dirt easy because I had gotten full dwarven armor from a random quest I stumbled on. It gives you one of the greatest feelings of progression, almost matching Dark souls and blood borne. The feeling of conquering a dungeon, or finding that puzzle box you've been hunting down for decades is so great. The atmosphere is amazing. Its not boring plains, or forests, its a weird alien and abstract looking world, making it much more interesting to explore than the future installments. To be perfectly honest, I'm kinda puzzled. I love Oblivion and skyrim, but they just feel like steps down to Morrowind in my opinion. Anyway, pick this up. Try not to compare the game to the new installments, and most of all: patience.			"

												In comparison to the more recent Oblivion and Skyrim Elder Scrolls games, Morrowind can be a love/hate relationship for many reasons. You have more skills, spell types, creature/enemy types, more dungeons/places, more quests and NPC's... Think about Skyrim, then combine it with Oblivion, and you still won't meet the scale of Morrowind. Unfortunately in an un-modded Morrowind, many people, especially those that started their Elder Scrolls experience with Skyrim,  will dislike the combat and graphics. For those of you that can't stand dated graphics, there are many mods that can enhance the graphics to match that of Skyrim. There are also mods that make combat play like it does in Oblivion and Skyrim, allow you to smith items, do every day jobs, etc.All in all, Morrowind (with mods in tow) can give you an even greater experience than that of even Skyrim, if only because of the massive amounts of capabilities and options available to you that they removed in the newer games. I highly recommend this game. It is well worth the money, even at full price, and will give you nearly countless hours of enjoyment.			"

												Easily the best in the Elder Scrolls seriesI've played hundreds of hours of Skyrim and hundreds of hours of Oblivion. I thought those two games were incredible. Then I played Morrowind. Morrowind easily blows every other game in the series out of the water. The world is much more rich with lore and feels so much more alive than the other games. The combat takes some getting used to but once you understand how it works it's a much better system than ""spam rmb/lmb at each other until one of you dies."" You need to charge your attacks while weaving in and out of your enemie's range. It's so much more involved.Yes, at the beginning, you will miss a lot of hits, but it's all part of Morrowind's beautiful progression. When you level up you'll begin hitting a lot more of your attacks. You'll feel stronger. Morrowind is all about progression. You don't become super powerful and can kill anything within 5 hours like you can in Oblivion and Skyrim. I've been playing for 15 hours on my current character. He has a full set of heavy armor and a Daedric sword and I still get one shotted by random bandits sometimes. Morrowind is unforgiving. It feels like a hostile alien world. And it's beautiful. This game is still amazing years later. And it always will be. Oblivion and Skyrim are prettier and more modernized but I'll always come back to Morrowind. I can't say the same for Oblivion and Skyrim. Please give this game a chance if you haven't already. It can be difficult to get into and look past some of the dated gameplay, but once you do, you'll never look back.			"

												Morrowind has the most complex map design and world-building ever made.Numeric and objective explanation of this FACT. Morrowind has:1.-The biggest locations density ever included in a videogame. 70 settlements -sedentary cities, towns and villages, ashlander camps, houses and farms- near 400 ""dungeons"", and other enterable places -caves, mines, dwemer ruins, daedric ruins, ancestral tombs, etc-, and 100-200 other locations -ships and shipwrecks, imperial forts, landmarks, etc- and a total of more than 1.000 enterable spaces!  That means far more locations and  interiors than Skyrim or Witcher 3, e.g., in a truly smaller map.Not counting open empty waters, the land area is only about  1.100 cells or 15 sq Km approx. Seems a lot bigger isn't it? This is because an intelligent landscape design -all the hills and slopes, the not-visible content from distance even with ""distant land"" enabled, because landform, etc.- and obviously because the enormous quantity of content too. No other videogame in History reachs the Morrowind’s =~50 places per sq Kilometer… nor the =~75 enterable spaces -interiors- x sq Km.The aforementioned landscape design is very interesting too, with a lot of caves, tombs, npcs or even entire settlements “hidden” by objects or specially by rugged terrain. That helps to increase the ""big island” feel or to reach the MW impressive amount of places or npcs, without seeming overcrowded. Indeed, sometimes we can experience some portions of the landscape as barren or some regions as uninhabited (an illusion!) being actually full of locations, objects and npcs -as no other  game- and this is only possible with a landscape design as MW has.So summarizing: Focus on detail and more content >>>> Bigger maps.2.- The most complex, mature, credible society ever put in a virtual environment. 34 clearly in-game factions, 11-15 of them joinable. The largest amount of original books in a single player game -more than 200 of the 300 total-. An extremely diverse, coherent architecture with at least 14-15 totally different styles, that represent the main socio-politic divisions or pieces of a distant History, and every style with a enormous amount of diversity. Many internal interests, conflicts, traditions or status presented or not by dialogue, architecture or books are present too in subtle details as clothes, names, etc.  Two examples of these subtle world details: 1º Some ashlander-camp dialogue explains you how some old ashlanders left the traditional lifestyle and became sedentary velothi, living with other common dunmers, and some time later you'll begin to link and understand how exist some settlement where the majority of the inhabitants shares personal naming conventions not with other sedentary dunmers but with ashlanders, and this settlement -I won't spoil too much- is the only one of the Vvardenfell towns with a large ashlander style tent too... 2º. Clothes have a highly detailed information of the world. Some clothes are exclusive of specific factions or professions as the different Ashlander tribes, the Morag Tong or Tribunal Temple robes, well that was good but not so special, but in some clothes as these two last specific robes some little decorative texts in daedric script add cryptic messages… that if you learn the Daedric Alphabet can transcript  as mottos relative at their owner occupation! And these details are only presented for world building consistency, without practical, story or quest dependency. When you begin to discover or even ""suspect"" these hundreds of details, the immersion is complete, as in no other video game ever.3.- 2.700 UNIQUE npcs. The largest number of npcs ever included in a single player game. MW has more unique npcs than every other Elder Scrolls -the other 7 non online- + the whole ""The Witcher"" series put together!  With the dlc’s, the unique npcs count reachs near 3.000. Of them more than 1.700 are “friendly” npcs and the rest are hostiles. Every unique npc have a personalized combination of face/hair -only 1300 archetypes, enough to be ""G.o.a.t.""-, apparel, name, level,  attributes, skills, class/profession,  spells, faction and rank, inventory and owned things, etc. The dialogue -about 30.000 lines- exist in shared and unique forms. The unique dialogue is mostly associated with quests, with some exceptions in relevant npcs. The total number of unique npcs owning  different dialogue including quest-related is still larger than most games. Certainly is simple dialogue, without particulary good writing. However Morrowind dialogue is not simply ""wikipedia dialogue"" as critics claim, not only because the shared dialogue is filtered by a big quantity of factors and topics, usually having more than one answer depending on who and where you ask and these new answers not only adding information but presenting sometimes another point of view, but most importantly because there are subtle details that even in the shared/common dialogue makes Morrowind great. For example, most hostile npcs have their own dialogue if you calm them, mostly generic dialogue, but some have unique dialogue or even they can be trainers or merchants, so if you calm them and have a good disposition, you could use their “services”… because hostile npcs “are people too”… Not many games share world consistence features like that.4.-Another brilliant Morrowind’s accomplishment is the originality of the fantasy world building, although tolkienesque altmer/bosmer names, imperials=pseudo-romans or nords=vikings wasn't too original, the totally new creation of the Dunmer and their homeland -not present at Morrowind form in the precedent games-, was something completely different.The main cultural inspirations moved from ""pseudo-medieval-western-Europe"" to a strong mesopotamian and ancient middle east influence -from toponimy, ashlander names, dunmer temples and cantons to some hlaalu architecture and cities, dwemer ghost looks, sacred triads, etc.-, some sort of japanese stylized art –besides katanas-, N. America first nations or eurasian steppes. These inspirations could be cool by themselves, but then, a miriad of really innovative aspects were inserted in the Dunmer tradition, and the D&D cliché of the Dark Elves was transformed into a really new people, with a totally innovative aspects and an alien culture, the Dunmer: The traditional nomadic herders, the ashlanders confronted with their sedentary Velothi cousins, the  ideology and culture of the Telvanni, the original and severe Redoran world, the speculative religious lore about the existence and the possibility of transcend the simply mortal condition, the Dwemer people, this atheistic-scientific reclusive people with a steam-punk-Assyrian vibe and their mysterious vanishing,  of whom we only know by their enemies, the egg-mines, the silt striders and the rest of the insectoid-reptilian big fauna, the Kwama life cycle, the Sixth House, the living gods, these floating zigurats, and the floating moon, the moon sssugarrr, the skooma and the new foods, the never well explained aspects but still very present in the world -the Dunmer Strongholds, the Velothi towers, the common Velothi folk non affiliated to any Great House-, etc. I could add 3-4 points more, but the steam space limitations prevent me from doing.In every aspect, Morrowind is not exactly a “masterpiece” in the sense of ""perfection"" -being the most perfect yet in most the aforementioned features, still is only a ""beginning""-, but the pioneer in most of open world features. Morrowind is the definitive step -after some Ultima, and specially Darklands and Daggerfall- in the definition of a total different genre, the Open World experiences, the simulated worlds, virtual realities.

TL,DR: Morrowind is a great RPG/Exploration game,if you are into open world RPG's and you don't mind old graphics and kinda clunky combat,you will enjoy this game very much.Now that I have played this game for around 70 hours,I think i can have a basic opinion about Morrowind.Considering that I actually moved to Morrowind after playing endless hours of Skyrim,I was actually expecting a bit of a let down on mechanics and dated graphics and how the world works in Morrowind.but that was not the case at all,sure,you need some mods to make NPC's not look like disabled flat faces trying to move around while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in their pants,and also if you want to work around the ""Hit n Miss"" system (which I find quite manageable if you put a little bit of thinking behind skill points usage). But the thing with Morrowind is that you should not expect an instant love reaction when you first enter vvardenfell,world will look ugly,you will get lost the moment you decide to walk out of the first town (which is the case for all TES games),there wont be any quest markers and you will be forced to ask other NPC's for directions,and then you will still get lost.this might feel frustrating at first but as time goes by,you take notice of a mechanic that actually wants you to get lost and rewards you greatly for exploring out of the set path.more than a few times you will stumble upon an interesting  dungeon or a quest starting event while running around and hopelessly trying to find your way out of a valley. sometimes these events will lead to your demise as game has no level scaling,but this actually forces the player to get back out there,gather resources and level up,and then come back to deal with whatever abominations are in the said dungeon which in my opinion,greatly adds to the gameplay value and expands the actual roleplaying aspect of the game.and considering that game world is very big and there are high number of dungeons with interesting back-story for roughly half of them,exploration rarely gets boring and is very interesting overall,in fact,it is the main focus of the game and you will have most of your fun while exploring into a dungeon and trying to figure out its story and finding any possible secret doors inside.Combat in Morrowind usually starts with ""please show mercy o mighty slaughterfish"" and goes to ""get outta my way you filthy Lich Overlord before i shove my big bad Daedric greatsword into your ♥♥♥"".combat gameplay is fairly simple by itself with you swinging your weapon (or throwing arrows),hoping not to miss during early levels while using a few spells to help you in battle and using healing potions in middle of all this.the Mechanic that makes this complicated and quite fun during early levels is that you soon realize that if you don't have the right gear and the right build,anything that moves can run you down in a second.this will make you almost always question your decisions before entering a hostile area or starting a fight and even may make you think strategically and come with ideas like dragging enemies to cities (guards are overpowered as hell) or to other armed NPC's.all of this again adds up to the roleplaying aspect the game and makes you think that you are actually a part of its world,at least for some time.this kind of gameplay however,will fade away after some hours when you get your hands on top level gear.then,normal enemies will become something of a clickbait for you to slaughter and as game has no level scaling(which i think has ups and downs of itself),you will be forced to explore into high level Daedric ruins and high level quests in order to meet a few worthy enemies that can actually hit back before being dismembered,this kinda makes late game exploration viable while making navigating normally through the roads extremely boring.in general,I think combat is not the best part of morrowind as it could be a lot better,and as you progress more into the game,it goes out to be something that you are forced to do,rather than something you want to do .I personally would recommend some combat overhaul mods to make it more fun and keep it from getting boring during later stages of the game.Story,as with rest of TES games,is rather basic on the surface,you will play as a chosen one destined to stop an old evil god from rising again and it will stay this basic if you just follow the quest line and don't dig it any further.but if you actually take your time to read some in-game books and/or delve into online lore of TES (or if you are a TES fanatic),you will almost instantly notice that the game lore is very rich and it can actually make you question Good and Evil and their motivations and how they will affect the game world.not putting all this effort up front for the player to experience and rather putting them behind several layers of gameplay/unmarked quests is what,in my opinion,makes the story on this heavily lore based game,kind of a wasted potential.I spent endless hours going all scholar on TES lore after I played skyrim and I overly enjoy going after all the Lore related easter eggs and reading about history of tribunal and how Morrowind came to be and what led up to the events and of the game and i'm pretty sure many TES fans feel this way too while playing Morrowind or any other TES game.but as a gamer who is not into TES lore that much and just comes to this game to experience ""another"" RPG game,I think story may feel a bit overly basic. it may be just Bethesda's inability to put what they create into the game without making the other main aspects of the game fade out to oblivion,or it may be them (Bethesda) thinking that putting all this up front would make the game feel not as huge and stop the player from exploring the land by ""feeding"" them the actual story. in general,i think the story behind Morrowind is really good but in order to get to the Core of it,you have to run around a bit and find the actual depth of it by yourself.Overall,Morrowind is a great Exploration/RPG game and serves as a very solid entry point for more complicated and Text/Mechanic Heavy CRPG games and is very playable to this day.You may need some mods to make it look pretty and some time to get into it,but when you do,you wont regret the time you put into this beautifully made,Large game world.

If you like games that make you think, games with a LOT of story, games that are challenging and you don't mind the dated mechanics of the game, I recommend this to you. If you have only played Skyrim, do not get this, unless you are willing to try something new and not complain about it. 9.5/10			"

												Morrowind offers a totally unique RPG experience, unique lore, unique gods, and a compelling main story, and side quests. The game hands you nothing, the intro is amazingly short and to the point. Welcome to seyda-neen. Here's how you move around, this is how you pick stuff up, this is how you attack and use magic items. Heres a package to take to some guy. Alright, you're on your own now, goodluck. Done. Compared to oblivions and skyrims handhold carebear experience. This game makes you EARN your worth in their world. No one likes you, no one cares about you. The npcs of the world let you know, you're an outlander, invading their great province of morrowind, ruled by the Tribunal  for 3500 years, their living gods. You have more skills to use in this game as well, from medium armor, spear, axe, athletics, acrobatics, and mysticism. Hand crafted dungeons, with items sometimes placed in high up areas, that only a skill like levitate will allow you to reach (yes you can fly). Play a Levitating Archer, or an Illusion Mage that never kills a soul. Morrowinds classic Diceroll system adds to the complexity of each encounter. You don't automatically score a hit just because someone is standing in front of you, your strength and weapon skill will be rolled against their armor rating and agility. Giving you a more balanced system of progression, and a more rewarding one as well.Overall, this is the best game bethesda has ever made in my opinion. It doesn't try to be some AAA title. It didn't need voice acting to give you a compelling story or have some famous actor speaking for 15 minutes in the game. And it is truly a challenging game, that follows traditional RPG diceroll rules, a system that should have never been scrapped for the shallow combat systems that are now a part of the elderscrolls games.So the question is Outlander. Will you cast down the supposed false gods of morrowind? And become a legend? Or will you never play morrowind because you're a damn Fetcher?			"

												First and Foremost I recommend you download Morrowind Overhaul 3.0 or better. This game is not for the weak hearted or  easily disgruntled. This game wont hold your wee little baby man hands or let you use Jack Sparrows Compass. This is a crawl on your knees, searching every crevice just to finish a quest RPG.  You hate birds? Good! You'll hate them anymore if you play this game. You like to yell in a furious rage when you swing a sword at something but never hit it? Great! Your first some odd level gains will be shown that your journey is just yet begining. Tired of wall climbing? In the Era of the Great Vivic and Dagoth Ur they had yet to purge a miraculous spell known as Levitate. Get use to the idea of riding giant fleas everywhere as well.Now I can sit here and scribe to you of they joys collectiong the three S's. That is skulls, skooma, and (moon) sugar. Or the countless trips to sell  weapons and armor to a mudcrab. The frustration of taking over a shop like Ra'Virrs to enter and find half the items placed gone awry. Fixing your twitch to kill all NPCS in sight as I am sure you did in this great games' successors. The limitless magical artifacts that you will just have stored away. The countless hours of just reading books. I mean seriously read the books, you will read some twisted things. That no eyes will never be able to unsee! Dont forget the pain of clicking every subject when you interact with npcs just to press your luck if you updated any other quests.Yet like any RPG known to the world sure you can make this a long game, a short game, you know...what ever stirs the gumbo. There will be some of you who always just play the main story in games. Power hungry to beat them and get over with it. The hours that can be spent in this game are infinite. With over 11 Factions, you will endure a great struggle. This is a true game based on Lore alone! A vast handcrafted world with countless years of perfecting its beauty in concept and unique dungeons.  Sure you can say most of Morrowind is ugly yet this is the time based era through the storyline. A God spreading his blight across the lands.With all this being said if you can endure the first bump in the road to Morrowind, the dice based combat rolls ( I mean after all this play style was big in the prior era of its release in the PC gaming industry), and not your modern day graphics. (If the graphics are holding you back from this game, just go play your watered down Oblivion or Skyrim ya big baby) You will have a great time with this game. Just remember to use mark/recall, steal a collection of something, spoons, lamps, your pick. Oh and download the overhaul for this game, your eyes wont be disappointed! "

												CAN YOU ENJOY THIS GAME IN 2016?Morrowind may have not aged well with its clunky combat, dumb AI and poor animations, and while mods can improve on many of its flaws, it will still be hard to get into it for those that started with Skyrim. However, if you give it a chance you will discover that there's a lot more to it. Exploration is rewarding, bits and pieces of lore are hidden and scattered around the map and not every detail of the story is laid out in front of you, and discovering it on your own is part of the experience. The lore is intertwined with the plot.Magic will open a world of possibilities. Want to enchant a pair of boots that will make you jump over mountains? You can do it. Want a pair of pants that shoot fireballs? No problem! Alchemy, Enchanting and Spellmaking will turn you into a god in no time, experiment different combinations and you will feel like you can do anything.Skyrim is a bloody good game, but it has given up a lot of the older TES freedom for a balanced and polished gameplay. Morrowind isn't polished or balanced in any way, but that's actually what makes it special: it's a giant playground where your creativity is the only limit.Anything I could write would never bring justice to this game, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece!

This game worth it, every decent CRPG fan should experience this game.I played Skirim, it was too easy, nice but easy, and Skyrim feels tiny close to MW... Also MW have a lot of different ambiences and landscape, a lot of races to interact, etc...I dunno why people don't like combat, it's not ""Mortal Kombat"", it's a traditional RPG, which is based on statistics, and I love it.Welcome to Morrowind, enjoy your trip here, you have plenty to explore, months of reading, years of fun...

												 I picked up Morrowind,about a year ago, after completing all of Oblivion and the story of vanilla Skyrim. For a game from early 2000, there is a massive bulk of content crammed into a seemingly small world. Morrowind is incredibly dense and full of depth, the entire game taking place on an island of the Morrowind province (excluding the Solthsteim DLC segment and Mournhold DLC area)without the Tamriel Rebuilt lore friendly community made expansion which has been in development since before the games release. And then there's combat and weapons,skills and armor. Consider this, Skyrim has three weapon based skills: one handed, two handed, and archery, and two armor skills:light and heavy. Oblivion had different weaponm skill entirely: Blunt, Blade, Unarmed, and Archery, and also only had light and heavy armors. Skyrim used five pieces to an armor set (helm, armor, gauntlest/bracers, shield, and boots), Oblivion used six (helm, cuirass, greaves, gauntlets/bacers, shield, and boots), and in neither game can you wear clothes under your armor, or a cloak/robe over your armor or clothes. Morrowind offers a more specialized variety of weapon skills for more types of weapons (short blade, long blade, blunt, axe, SPEAR, not archery but marksman, and hand-to-hand) and offeres weapons to suit, including (varying for each material): tanto, dagger, wakisashi,short sword, katana, longsword, sabre, broadsword, claymore, dai-katana, spear, pike, halberd, war axe, battle axe, maace, club, staff(the kind you hit things with), hammer, crossbow, bow, throwing knife, throwing star, and dart, each weapon dealing more damage with it's appropriate attack type, for instance; a slashing attack with a mace, is generaly ineffective, but a thrust with a spear or halberd would deal the wepons highest possible damage on a succesful hit (before considering the plethora of stat configuring and calculating). The simple element of having mutiple attack types is more in depth than Skyrim or Oblivion, considering that you can ""charge"" each attack type. Morrowind's armor is another animal entirely having oh so many elemnents, and boasting more types than its succesors, having skills for: light, heavy, medium, and UNARMORED), while allowing the player to mix cuirass, greaves, boots, gauntlets/bracers, pauldrons, pants, shirt, cloak/robe, belt, and skirt all at once (a robe, cloak, or skirt would cover anything underneath it leaving only the helm exposed, but would still enable the armor to be effective), some coming in different variations, all of which could be enchanted with a massive toolbox of effects, including the ever useful mark and recall enchantments which allowed instant teleportation to a marked location, or to mark a new location for later revisiting via a recall teleport. Some features carried into oblivion are birthsigns and stats, including speed, personality, strength, luck, and endurance to name a few, mocking Skyrim's mere Health, Magicka, and Stamina.                               The game is not nearly as pretty as Skyrim, or Oblivion, but it has so much more substance. It's colorful, and the landscapes vary drasticaly. There are tons of spells and enchantments. You can't fast travel to any location like in Oblivion and Skyrim, which forces you to explore the world and to have an adventure, however you want, at your own pace, with your own specialized character. I have heard many people tear down the combat system, but if you stick with weapons you're skilled with you'll be fine, and if you want to get better with a new type of weapon, mudcrabs. Quests do not give direct markers, only directions and the occasional map mark that you can't fast travel to, because the game trusts the player to be intelligent enough to understand ""a short way southeast of the fork in the road"", and doesnt insult you with a gps you don't need. I can't write the ""degree course lecture"" of praise that I have for this game. It does have its issues, and it can be dated in some aspects, but it is an immersive, deep world with a fantastic storyline, and plenty of side adventure. If you haven't played it, I think you'd better had. With the help of the graphics and sounds overhaul to help people used to modern graphics, and Tamriel Rebuilt to expand the world for explorers, this is one of the best Rpg's to date, and truly is a masterpiece.

												I didn't play the main quest until my 14th (?) character.  Some of my characters were just pilgrims or travelers or merchants.   The feeling of getting to know a world that felt truly strange, instead of another medival/roman/lotr hybrid was extraordinary.  I loved skyrim but it felt much shallower and more predictable than this wonderful game.  I am still trying to find something like it.  I mean I'm writing this review just so steam might recommend more games like it to me.			"

Morrowind <TES3> is an outstanding open-world single-player 3D-4X RPG.  The game starts on the island of Vvardenfell in the Dunmer kingdom of Morrowind.  You the Gamer are free to create and develop your Player Character {PC} in many ways to suit your desired play style.  Your PC may be any of several available Races, such as Human {e.g.: Imperial or Breton}, Mer {e.g.: Dunmer or Bosmer}, or Beast-race {e.g.: Khajiit or Argonian}.  You also choose the PC's ""occupation"" such as battle mage, warrior, thief, rogue, etc., and even the astrological birth sign. Through game-play experiences, the PC can develop and improve various characteristice which will enable your PC to prevail as you strive to complete the many quests in the main storyline.  However, you do not have to follow the storyline at all.  After clearing ""Customs"" in Seyda Neen, the PC is free to roam, interact with the many NPCs {non-player characters}, explore the wilds of Vvardenfell, dungeon dive, or even do some of the story line quests as you prefer.TES3: Morrowind has a haunting music theme that I enjoy turning up while I play.  Normally, I keep BGM turned down so it won't annoy me. On the negative side, the vanilla graphics show their age.  Vanilla NPCs are somewhat cartoonish.  Combat initially is clumsy, especially at the beginning of the game when the PC is assumed to be unable to hit the broadside of a barn.  This improves as the PC's combat/magic skills are improved through experience or ""training"" {by paying certain expert NPCs}.  The graphics can be brought up to date through mods that can be found in the Steam Workshop, or at various external websites such as NEXUS.com.There is a large number of mods available in the Workshop or at NEXUS.com to alter almost every aspect of Morrowind to suit your preferences.  Mods may greatly improve the appearance of the NPCs, weapons, and armors, apparel, etc.  My recommendation to the 4X-open-world Gamer is  “Try it ... You'll like it !”, especially at the current bargain sale price !!			"

												Morrowind really sucked when I first played it... then I played it again and again and again and not because I didn't have any other games, but because I told a friend about my character, and he told me about his and they were completely different. I was then interested in exploring all of the possible paths that one could follow while playing morrowind. It became my cult-favorite/alltime-favorite game. Then came along Oblivion which was promised to be morrowind with nice graphics and I played that and hated it. Then DLC came out and I played it again and again and again you get the picture. Soon, I found myself lost in the massive world of tamerial and it became my cult-favorite/second-most-favorite game of all time. Along comes the big bad Skyrim and I was prepared. I expected the game to be dumbed down, and I expected it to be the last ES game that would I ever play. Because, I figured that I'd like the story and dlc but it would lose it's replay value in the dumbing down process. I played it and I hated it then the DLC came out and I hated that too. I managed to put a hundred or so hours into it and felt as though it was wasted time. Then came along 200 hours, and I said that was enough, I'm way over powered, and the game is not much fun anymore. Along comes the modding community to save the day, and that is what they did. I became addicted to modding my skyrim and playing a few levels and modding it more till I broke the game, fresh install, rinse and repeat.Then I used the memory patcher and everything just worked and I decieded that I'd play the game one more time to see if I could tolerate it as an ES title. Now, three different characters later I can say that Skyrim has become my cult-favorite/third/second-all-time-favorite game. I enjoy this more now than oblivion, but chronologically it is third :p Now I've decided to give Morrowind another play-through, right now I'm on the road on my way to balmora and loving it but not for any of the reasons stated above, but because there is a level of nostalgia that is present. I worry that the cliff racers and the terrible combat mechanics will force me to abandon my task. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO INTERESTED IN CHALLENGING THEIR PATIENCE AND THEIR MIND!!

												Time to make a wall of text.Morrowind was not only my second TES game (my first being Oblivion) but it is also personally my favorite. It's sad to see a lot of people be put off from experiencing this game due to things like ♥♥♥ graphics or a less-than stellar combat system. Certainly, the game has it's flaws, but from my perspective it trumps TES IV and V in what it does right. Morrowind is not for the faint of heart who just want to ignore any plot-lines and kill things. The game requires patience and a little bit of creativity to make the most out of it. Being a mage sucks at first because learning spells is really expensive and magicka is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to manage in this game. Being an archer sucks at first because landing sneak attacks is finicky and whiffing all of your shots due to low agility or fatigue can be VERY frustrating. Even being a warrior sucks since melee combat can be a bit of a slog and heavy armor sucks in the early game.But the important thing to remember in Morrowind is not to focus in one particular area of expertise, but rather try hard to excel in all of them. Quickly switching weapons and being able to cast spells on the fly makes being a diverse character infinitely easier and more enjoyable. A good warrior is bound to keep a bow around as a ranged weapon and know a spell or two to work themselves out of a difficult situationBut even more interesting than the freedom of character building is the world building of Vvardenfell. The lack of an omnipotent compass and a map that can't warp you around (gasp) make exploring the world to get things done a mandatory step in any player's journey. No spoilers, but the number of things to distract you as you journey across the island are, for the most part, all interesting and only serve to better you as a character and inform you, as the player, of the ever changing world.TL;DR: This game requires patience, but will lead to a massive payout in story and character growth.

												A beautifully, lovingly crafted story of mortal hubris, the slow reawakening of an ancient evil, and the inevitable corruption of a civilization's golden era. Morrowind has a bizarre, quirky aesthetic and the hallmark of older games wherein you can break the game in creative ways...like enchanting a slip of paper vital to the main questline into a scroll that heals 1 HP. Or killing a god and trapping their soul in a gem that you can proudly display in your stolen home. As an added bonus, the visual aesthetic and variety of weapons and armor surpasses both Oblivion and Skyrim. This game is Bethesda's magnum opus.			"

												Ahhhh, Morriwnd.Even since 2002 (wow, it's been 12 years already), it's been a beautiful, immersive world (especially to me, who started the Elder Scrolls series with Morrowind) where story and sidequests are equally as enthralling to each other as the strange sense of magic you feel when exploring the vast, ash-barren countryside of Vvardenfel.Although while in today's standards, the graphics do appear to have suffered some, that only adds to the pure nostalgia for those of us who have played this when this was the cutting-edge of RPG and sandbox production.  Sure, you don't have many options for hair or face, and yes, the sluggish walk and dicey combat system can be a bit off-putting.  But past it all, when you've finally gotten to that comfortable place where you can run faster than a slug on a Sunday and hit more times than you'll miss, you begin to appreciate the game as more than just a piece of software.  You really do begin to see it as an adventure into a foreign land.  A place where you've never been before, but will surely uncover its secrets in due time.And thanks to the good people of the Internet, mods have been created that help with issues in game, such as the overall graphics (especially NPC and player models, such as the Better Bodies mod) and whatever else you might consider to be a problem or upgrade-worthy factor.  The fact of the matter is, that when the dust has settled and all is said and done, Morrowind still remains one of the cornerstone RPGs of yesteryear, and I certainly know that it'll forever be one of the defining games for the RPG genre.9/10, Thank you based Azura			"

												No matter how far into the future from now it may be, and no matter how many signs of age this game shows... I will always be able to pick it up and play through it again. Why? It's difficult to put into words. But something about Morrowind's universe captivated me from the very first moment I reached the city of Balmora. I really can't explain it. There is a certain ambience that emanates from that particular city. Some people feel it, others don't. Part of me believes that this is the dividing-line between the people that can drop hundreds of hours into Morrowind in the blink of an eye and the people who just can't get into it. Both viewpoints are understandable. The other part of me thinks that maybe I'm reading far too much into a simple video game. Who's to say? The only thing that I can say for sure is that Morrowind is anything but simple. I've played through this game many, MANY times since it's release and I always stumble across something I've never encountered before. It never fails. Sometimes it's flavor text that helps me piece together a story I didn't fully understand before... occassionally I'll find some unique artifact or item that I had never found previously. There is always something out there, subtle or not, to enrich the experience for me even more. And that's part of what keeps me coming back.I highly recommend installing MGSO for Morrowind (old and new players alike). It's a compilation of some of the best mods on the market for Morrowind. It essentially gives Morrowind a facelift. I know some of you may not feel like taking the time to figure the modding-aspect of the game, but when it comes to MGSO you have nothing to worry about. It literally installs itself for you.			"

												I bought this gme the day it came out ont the shelves, (yeah the actually had shelves, i mean in stores, like you actually had to go there to like buy it...and carry it home.) anyway, it was the best game i'd ever played. I had really fine memories of the game and having lost or scratched the cd somewhere along the way I decided to pick it up here when i saw it on sale. I started playing, and got frustrated really fast with some bugs and crashes do to the game having been made for xp and dinosauric video cards. I looked around and found some basic easy fixes, 1 Run in windows compatability mode.2. this somehow disapeared for me a little while ago (must have been a game update or a video driver update (gforce 960), but the game would always start in a kind of semi-window.-Easy to fix just go to options and change graphics pixel settings to any other. You can always change it right back to where you were. its best to do this right before you press the start or load button. there is a options/video option button right there. puts you back ito full screen. Btw running it in windows mode makes it a box up in the corner of your screen. I understand there is a way to fix it, but didn't bother (nexus forums?)3. mousing over items in your inventory or map doesn't work sometimes. -easy fix, just mouse over your char picture untill it shows something you are wearing, and then presto the others work perfectly.4.the mini map stops revealing where you've been.  easy too. pick any point on the map, double click on it and make any kind of notation, go out of menu move your char around a couple steps, and its working again. note though, look at map often this doesn't reveal places yoiu walked while it wasn't working, just what you already had and where you are standing. you can remove the note just by clicking on it.5 (i'm the type of person who used to get horribly frustrated with my son (when he could play games without sitting on my lap) using cheat codes on the legend of zelda. There are a few meta gaming practices/bugs, don't use em it really screws up the gameThose were the most anoying, once i got those worked out i started another charachter. I now have over 1000 hours played. That should tell you how much i still enjoy it			"

												This is one of the few games I've actually kept the original disc and jewel case on my bookshelf. It's currently collecting dust, because now I play it on Steam (yeah in my lifetime, I bought the game twice.) Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content here. Extremely rewarding. No quest markers, no hand holding. Immersion city. Would I use the words ""immersion city"" to describe any other game I've ever played on the PC over the last 20 years? No, I wouldn't. I've played this game for well over a decade and still manage to come back to roll a different build/race/guilds/etc. I'm still finding new ways to do things.This game will not hold your hand. You'll have to learn the hard way if you're not quite ready for a task. The game can be pretty harsh at first, especially to someone completely new to this type of RPG. To those people, read up on a few guides that have explanations of how things work, and why. Ask NPCs questions, sometimes you'll unlock quests, find out some locations or other interesting information. Learning to save the game, and keeping a couple on hand, before embarking into the unknown is critical. In time the lands of Morrowind will be your oyster and you'll be brushing aside everything that stands in your way, while loving every second.Combat in Morrowind (what appears to frustrate people,) is based on attributes. Play to your strengths attribute wise. Don't start fights with low stamina either because you're not going to hit much. If you're swinging away with your short sword, with a 25 short blade attribute rating, with no stamina, you're going to continue to hit air. As I stated earlier, read a couple guides. The are endless possibilities after you understand basic mechanics, and level up the attributes you plan on using.Another frustration I see voiced occasionally, is there is no 'fast travel.' There actually is and there are several ways to do it. Joining the Mage's guild provides you with portals in variously locations across the map. Stilt Striders are another form of fast travel (the gigantic bugs standing in front of Balmora, yeah, they carry people from city to city.) Many other major towns have them, too. Also, the Mark and Recall spells. Good luck finding these spells easily early on, or you could get lucky. Mark an area, use Recall when you want to instantly travel back to the area you marked. There are a few other ways to fast travel, to keeps, or temples. You can get around the map pretty fast if you know what you're doing.Graphically, maxed out, it's not the prettiest games to look at anymore. The game came out in 2002, what did you expect? That being said, if you have a decent computer, google 'MGO Morrowind.' Check my profile to see some examples of this graphics mod in my screenshots. Don't expect the best optimization, but it breaths some fresh life into this great, great game.COMPLETELY RECOMMEND.			"

												UPDATE: Nominated it for ""test of time"" award. :)Morrowind will always remain my all time favourite video game for a number of reasons. I put hundreds of hours into it on the retail version, and even so, each playthrough I came across something I missed the first time - And I only ever managed to finish 2 or 3 factions out of the almost a dozen in the game. There is no explaining how deep the game and the story is and how much there is to explore. It made me immerse myself in the story so much and made me want to learn about the lore of the fictional universe like no other game (except maybe Warcraft series) has done to me before, and until now.The game is far from easy, and not your casual gaming experience. I even feel compelled to say that you don't play this game for fun and relaxation, but to feel like you've achieved something. It had everything that could be asked from an rpg, but you had to work for it - it was a real challenge. Especially in the beginning you often find yourself close to rage quitting by how this game kicks your ♥♥♥ and makes you work to actually get good at something (best example: combat).The game felt more realistic to me. There isn't much communication between NPCs like in Oblivion, and most NPCs shared the same dialogue about specific subjects, but it was still made clear how you, impacted the world - that is by how the NPCs acted towards you, they would like or hate you based on your actions in the world.The guilds are one of the things I love the most in the game, you progress in ranks over time after doing certain errands for the guild, all getting progressively more difficult. By progressing in the world and the factions you earn reputation, which each NPC will pay attention to. You also have differing reputation between the different guilds, meaning that you are hated by some if you are friends with the other, like the strife between the mages guild and house telvanni, or the temple and the imperial legion. But ultimately, you start off as a nobody and are treated as such, and if you do good deeds, you are rewarded and actually recognized for it in the end.The quests are more fun to execute because there is no map marker to your destination. Instead, you follow directions from your journal. You can even ask NPCs for hints to your current quest (ask about an item, a location or a person), and they will tell you what they know. This way, you actually work on the task and do some exploring instead of just following the marker on the compass straight to a destination, which your character logically shouldn't have any idea about because they've never been there before.It's a widespread ""myth"" that Morrowind has no fast travel - that's not true. There is fast travel, only it's not as simple as clicking on a destination on your map and teleporting to it. There are other options, like going by silt strider, by boat, being teleported by the mages guild and using the spells mark and recall. This limited but more logical fast travelling allows some roleplay and imagination, and more importantly it further fuels the need to explore the world.Morrowind is, from my point of view, the richest game of the series. By that I mean that it had a lot of expansive and varied ingame features, more than any of the other games, and a lot of the features this game had were removed in Oblivion and Skyrim (I mostly compare Morrowind to the last 2 TES games, because Morrowind is the start of the 'new era' of The Elder Scrolls, starting with the fact that it's 3D). Some of these made it to Oblivion but were removed in Skyrim, but most of these features were removed in both games. To name a few off the top of my head: Much more Skills, Classes, Spellmaking, HUGE weapon variety (look up any Morrowind weapon by material on the uesp wiki, for example daedric, and compare that to the weapon variety of Oblivion or Skyrim), a bigger armor and clothing variety, armor and clothes mixing (e.g. robe on top of armour or 2 different independent pauldrons), more complex enchanting and alchemy, more unique mobs (especially daedra), an actually useful journal with in-depth direction giving, more abilities and spells, non-repetitive, rewarding dungeons and quests, realistic guilds with lots of quests instead of just a single questline for each guild, reputation and character recognition, better immersive races (argonians and khajiit were more beastlike, and all races had according heights and face/body features, in Oblivion and Skyrim all look very similiar and humanoid), freedom of will (no essential NPCs and no linear storyline - you could just decide to kill everyone and doom the world without any restriction, only a warning), and many other little things like easter eggs, which there was a ton of - Bethesda usually likes adding hidden secrets in their games and I can recall a lot in this game.There were also a lot of unique items, armor and weapons. To me it seems like in the later games, the daedric artifacts are almost the only unique items there are. Of course there are some unique artifacts, but not nearly as much as in Morrowind. Unlike Oblivion, Skyrim and the Fallout games, where I had no desire to delve into the generic dungeons unless it was needed for a quest, in Morrowind I always went into similiarly generic caves and tombs the moment I discovered them, just because I knew from experience that there might be an awesome unique artifact inside, which was indeed very often the case.These are some of the reasons why I still prefer Morrowind over its successors. When I first started playing Morrowind a few years ago, only after I played Oblivion and Skyrim, I didn't mind the outdated graphics because I was so enthralled by the more prevalent factors of the game, like the story, but coming back to it now the graphics slightly bother me. Which is not a problem, because Morrowind has had an awesome modding community for over 10 years and still even now; there are plenty of visual mods to keep the game fresh and up to date.So if you are ready for a challenge and a one-of-a-kind roleplaying game experience with a very unique setting and an in-depth story that will completely suck you in, you have nothing to lose even a decade later, because Morrowind will always remain a masterpiece.

(TL;DR - It's a good open world RPG, if you like TES games and haven't played this then get it, get it if it looks good too. Yup.)	What to say... Well I could start by saying its possibly my favorite Elder Scrolls game. For those of you not in the know of what the Elder Scrolls series is, let the Spectre tell you it's an RPG series started in March 1994 with The Elder Scrolls I: Arena.	What you do in the  game is your choice, whether you want to be an assassin who's good with heavy armor, a straight up tank, or a noble adventuring mage. The goal of the series is to make you feel immersed in another universe, play another life. Now the series started to go downhill and it wasn't looking good for Bethesda. So they put Todd Howard in the lead for the development of Morrowind. Now Todd, he figured if it might be their last game they might as well go out with a bang or try to revive the series (at least thats what I think) and had the team work on Morrowind and put their all into it. Of course this worked tremendously.	Now enough history, lets get back into the review shall we? Hmmm... where was I? Oh yes! I remember now, favorite elder scrolls game blah blah blah no one cares. Now let me tell why this is.Pros: 1. Quests. The game is rich with quests that could take you weeks or more to complete and lots of detail and places that can take you months to see. The amount of NPCs is astonishing (even though the dialog might not always be too interesting or unique), and all of them are individually named with the exception of the respawning guards or creatures, which is awesome and immersive. 2. Openess. The openess is impressive even with todays standards. You can go to any part of the map, whether it's in the ocean, or some mountain, or castle, or whatever, you can go there at any point in the game (though it's easier to do with a levitate potion or spell). You can start a new character and right after you finish the quick character creation/tutorial bit you can go where ever you want! No need for the  main quest when you've got exploring to do! 3. Map. The map size is huge (though not the biggest by any means, it's 16 km2 or 6.17 m2), it will take some time for you to fill your map. You could be walking for an hour thinking you've made a lot of progress, but when you look at your map you see you only discovered a small percentage of the world. Better walk a few more hours huh? 4. Lore. This game has a lot of lore, from abandoned fortresses, to extinct races, to gods, to a guide about the Fishy Stick, and much more. Since this is in the TES series, if there's a part of the lore you can't find any information too, odds are there's something about it on the wikis. It's full of history, and you're also, in a sense, creating some of it by being the reincarnation of the Nerevarine. Wanna learn some of the lore? You can either read one of the many books, talk to NPCs, go questing, stumble on it by accident, or by dicovering and learning it by some other means.	Now I could keep going with this review praising this game but ther really is no point. There are very few cons, but I'll name a couple and they won't be of much significance I can assure you.Cons: 1. Learning curve. Steep learning curve for new players, trust me. It you're transitioning from a game like Skyrim then you're in for a surprise. Welcome to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Prepare to Die Edition! But don't worry, you'll learn sooner or later, just keep practicing and you'll get it. 2. Lack of dialog. You could talk to 20 NPCs with the same things to say. This can get a little boring looking for quests or an overall interesting NPC. It's not really a big deal, it's just a minor thing. Although you can just download the LGNPCs (Less Generic NPCs) mod, though it's still in development. (The LGNPC[lgnpc.org] homepage.) 3. View distance. The view distance is terrible. Now I know this game came out in 2002 but the game is made to put the entire view distence rendering on the CPU. Now I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure if most games from that time period do that but I doubt it. Bethesda just didn't optimize it very well. Whatever I guess, it's realistic right? Seriously, who can see more then 50 feet ahead of themselves?(Use MGE[sourceforge.net] to increase view distance.)Final       Anyway, this game is amazing, and I don't know what it is about it but its more open than the newer Elder Scrolls (at least it feels that way to me). While it may be difficult to get into or just difficult, odds are it's going to be that way for a while with new players. But after some hardwork, perserverance, and maybe a little help from the UESP, you will find the game becomes a bit easier and you will be rewarded for your efforts in one way or another. It's filled with lore, easter eggs, and many quests, you won't be discovering everything anytime soon.	I guess that will conlude this ""short"" review. And to all you new comers, have a Fishy Stick!

												""Wake up. There you go... Not even last night's storm could wake you...""The bald dark elf in front of you introduces his name as Juib. Soon, though, you are roughly taken by the arms and marched out of the hold of the ship you are in. At least this isn't the Imperial Prison, you think as they roughly take you out.A man asks you where you come from-- your homeland. Reluctantly, you divulge the information. A short time later, you step out into the fishing village of Seyda Neen. You can head to Arrile's shop to buy equipment for a grueling journey to Balmora, or you can bust gold on a Silt Strider ride, arriving in Balmora safely though all but defenseless. Welcome to Vvanderfell, the volcanic island in the province of Morrowind, where gargantuan mushrooms tower over the insect- like and often dangerous Kwama, who are constantly searching for the next place to hitch their nests. Cliff Racers, flying creatures who once drove the mighty Dovah, Dragons, from Morrowind, rule the skies in multitudes. The Dunmer are divided, nomadic Ashlanders constantly at odds with the various House Dunmer, who may someday fall to their constant infighting.Welcome, wayfarer, to Morrowind. There are many ways to die here, in this harsh ashen expanse.But so, too, are there ways to thrive.

												I do not have any nostalgia for Morrowind. My first Elder Scrolls game was Oblivion, which back in 2006 blew my mind. Around that time, I also bought Morrowind to further immerse myself in this LOTR-esque world of Tamriel. I played it for a couple of hours, got totally lost (I suppose for the lack of pointers) and lost interest. Occasionally during the next 10 years I would make an ill-fated attempt to play it again, but would soon lose interest.However, last year I decided to make a serious attempt to play it again. I installed the Morrowind Overhaul mod (or rather a compilation of mods) and set out on a journey to Vvardenfell. What I found was a feeling I have not experienced since playing Oblivion for the first time a decade before.Morrowind is set on the island of Vvardenfell in the province of Morrowind, a rather remote area of the Empire. In contrast to Oblivion with it's Medieval fantasy setting and Skyrim with its Nordic setting, Morrowind takes inspiration from Egyptian, Japanese, Middle Eastern and I suppose even Mezoamerican cultures. The world is darker, rawer and much more mysterious than the latter two games. If, like me, you play Elder Scrolls games primarily in order to get immersed in another world, no other game of the series is ever as immersive as Morrowind. The settings, often intelligent quests and great sound (from the winds of Ald'Ruhn to the fantastic theme) is what makes Morrowind a fantastic game.The gameplay, while showing its age, is remarkably well-done. Character customization, spellmaking, enchanting, alchemy are all here, as is levitation (which becomes the best way to travel with a pair of fast shoes...). Only the combat mechanics stand out as archaic, especially in the beginning where your attacks rarely hit. This is less like Skyrim's action-oriented combat, and more like D&D-style dice-rolling. However, as you progress and your attacks become both more powerful and more accurate, this becomes less of an issue.This is my first review, and I find i difficult to know whether you would like this game. I supppose that if you want a world where you can truly immerse yourself, Morrowind is a safe bet. If you are looking for a game with more focus on fast-paced gameplay (or even just refined gameplay), it is possible that you will find the later installments of the series more to your taste. However, I personally consider Morrowind one of the best games I have ever played.			"

												Old but Gold in a shellnut, this game is extremely outdated with uglyas♥♥♥♥ graphics that can only come from that special era of early polygon modeling, and the combat is incredibly flawed, striking an ugly mix between dice rolling and straight up hitting things.But dispite that, this game is amazingly good. The story is complex and interesting, avoiding the typical tropes you find in other games *cough*skyrim*cough*. The game feels like an actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adventure where you are not the centre of the universe, such as when you acquire a rare artifact, you actually KNOW you have. It isn't just something to clog up your storage, artifacts within the game are virtually priceless and extremely powerful to actually represent that they are one of a kind things that you can't just flog to the average trader.It's through that and the other elements put into this game that you actually feel like your progressing. When you start Morrowind, you are an outlander and a weak one at that, your not worth the time of day for the average citizen of Vvardenfell. But as time goes on and the story progresses, you are recognised for your actions and the people will respond accordingly, until at the very end where you feel like a loved and respected hero, because people actually love and repect you!To conclude, if you can look past it's flaws and old age, Morrowind is great game that no RPG fan should miss			"

												With some graphic mods Morrowind has aged quite well.Anyway. I treasure Morrowind as a dear memory of gaming (the fact aside it has been my first contact with TES) because of many reasons, but just to mention a few:You can equip ...- rings & an amulet- shoes- leg armor- torso armor- a robe- right pauldron- left pauldron- right glove- left glove- belt- shirt- trousers- helmet... simultaneously as seperate items. (Kind of missed that in TESIV and V, especially the additional clothing for enchantments.)Oh, and everything mentioned can be enchanted, too, in addition to weapons (daggers, longswords, katanas, shortswords, small axes, big axes, halberds, spears, bows, crossbows, maces, (small) throwing weapons and some others I just forget).And nearly everything can be picked up and so many containers that actually contain things. Like pillows. Many pillows.An environment ranging from lush woods and swamps to rocky paths alongside mountains, mushroom plains, ashen plains, collectives of islands and of course the snowy and icy Solstheim.No quicktravel but a nice infrastructure of other transportations (boat, magic guild, silt strider, enchanted amulets/return spells).For some starting equipment follow the road to the left (I think it leads to the north) from the starting settlement.Alchemy can be used to brew some useless but high-grade potions with stolen equipment ... if you want.

												EDITI played Morrowing for some time and realized one thing: it requires patience. You must invest more hours it it before it shines before you in all it's glory.Battle system is one of the cons of ESIII. For those who are not in the know: it is based on a random chance of hitting. The higher your, say, short sword skill is, the higher the chance for your strike to be successful. Not a lot of fun, to say the least.Animations are bad, sounds repeat too often but that's about it with downsides.Pros: Atmosphere. Burnt-out ashlands, giant mushrooms, swamps... The world and lore are one of a kind. Graphics are Ok so it all looks pretty neat. Music is epic. I loved almost every second of it. Though I still think there are too few themes. When combined they barely last an hour.Story is engaging.Morrowind is harsh. No fast travel, no markers - just a map and your a.s.s. You have to read a f-n journal in order to understand where to go! That's terrific! Weapons and armor break and you have to repair them. Essential for RPG's IMHO.Some creatures cannot be hurt with particular weapons or skills. For instance, you can't hit the spirit with a common sword. Hell yeah! Now we're talking!Game's pretty hard. Anyway, you can adjust difficulty but even on easy your butt can be kicked hard in the wilderness. And about deepness. The world IS really deep. Earlier I thought it's just an illusion but it's not. There are some filler NPC's and generic dungeons but really... There's so much to do here! Sidequests, reading books, crafting potions, kicking creatures' a.s.ses. And the main story, of course.Considering that the game came out in 2002 (technologies, you know) all downsides can be and ARE forgiven. Must play for every RPG, fantasy and ES fan.			"

												I owned Morrowind on the first Xbox, and it was a mind-blowing title 15 years ago. The traditional Tolkein-like western RPG art, lore, and music with a wide open world was revolutionary. It made the dominant Final Fantasy JRPG's look... childish, effeminate, and downright bizzare at times. Even though the Elder Scrolls series was available on IBM DOS/Windows 95 style PC's in the 1990's, those PC's were ridiculously expensive, troublesome, very few owned one, and the Elder Scrolls had very little exposure to the public as consoles were popular. Nobody I knew ever heard of Elder Scrolls. A new king of RPG's was crowned when Morrowind came to Xbox and was part of a console launch line-up. I played Morrowind a fair amount but never came close to even finishing the main quest. I found the game to be highly confusing. I was always lost and somewhat unable to locate quest objectives. I eventually became bored of Morrowind and became hooked on Halo 2 multiplayer, and traded the Morrowind disc in at Gamestop. That was a mistake. So I recently bought it again on a Steam sale, and now that I'm a veteran of Oblivion and Skyrim, I have a better grasp of how to play Morrowind.Morrowind is for hardcore Elder Scrolls fans only. If you were born after 1990, you'll probably whine about the graphics, the unusual RNG-style combat, the slow sprinting speeds, very little voice-overs, no fast travel, the requirement to read alot, and the lack of any waypoint markers. Kids nowadays just don't have what Morrowind requires because they're used to a game holding their hand through the experience. Quests require following read directions with vague locations such as ""Go north of Balmora, turn west at a cave, and your goal is somewhere near there."" Prepare to use your brain, and physically trek to locations. I hope you know how to use a map and compass. Also, the menu navigation is painfully slow with a mouse compared to a controller. Simple acts like looting crates takes longer than it did on consoles. Controller Companion can be used, along with X-Padder, but don't exactly streamline the experience like the Xbox did. Using ALT-TAB to switch applications while Morrowind is running in fullscreen can cause a crash. The resolution is annoying and dated, and a registry edit didn't work for me. I tried mods as well, but can't seem to find any that work properly. Save often, with at least 2 seperate files... you'll die alot.People in their 30's and 40's who remember the crude titles of years past will adapt well however.This is a great game for anybody who has a low-end laptop but wants an engrossing AAA experience. A cell-phone or toaster could probably run Morrowind. The combat is unusual by todays standards. You'll swing a weapon at an enemy a 100 times and hit nothing but air until your character is levelled up. There are many items to find, equip, steal, use, just like in other Elder Scrolls titles. Some are useful. Many are useless. The magic system however is far superior to Oblivion or Skyrim. Morrowind gives the ability to basically craft custom spells that could possibly allow players to fly anywhere in the sky, or breathe underwater. The combinations of what spells that could be created are quite impressive. Alchemy and enchanting are present. There are also more unmarked caves, tombs, and treasures to be found than later Elder Scrolls games which encourages more thorough exploration... even underwater...Warnings and complaints aside, Morrowind will become probably one of the best RPG's you've ever played if you're patient enough to give it a chance, invest 30 hours, and be open-minded. I fully recomend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a more hardcore gamer.I think the near $20 price is a bit steep for a 15 year old game. It should be $10 in my opinion, but the price is still high because the game is still popular with about 1000 people playing it on Steam at peak times. Even at $20 Morrowind is still money well spent considering you can easily sink 300 hours of your life into it or more. Mods only serve to further expand that time.Thumbs up. Give it a shot!			"

												The perfect open-world sandbox RPG. It may have its glitches and quirks, but that is part of what makes the game what it is: A closed system with a set of given rules that you can ♥♥♥♥ around in to your heart's content, exploiting exploits at the corners of logic, and having a blast. Want to roam the wilderness robbing tombs and shipwrecks? Go ahead. Want to put on a cloak of constant levitation and float about taunting people on the ground? Go ahead. Want to kill a god (or two)? Go ahead. Want to follow the story (you weirdo)? Go ahead.So that covers the sandboxiness of it. The atmosphere is another incredible part- awesome unique environments, incredible music (that Jeremy Soule basically just copied for the next 10 years for sequels), and memorable locales (literally- I can navigate Balmora with my eyes closed).Some may consider the graphics to be subpar today (I don't mind them, personally), but there are loads of mods to fix that. Some complain about the click-click-click combat, but again, once you understand the system, just play within it.So yeah, if you haven't played this game, buy it now. Even at $20. NOW. DO IT. And if you say you prefer Oblivion, I will cut you.			"

												Over the past few years, I've played a good 90 hours or so, mostly through borrowing my friend's xbox. Over that time I went back and forth on my opinion of this until I finally managed to settle on a solid answer: This game is worth the money. However, you may struggle a bit getting into it. SInce I'm not going to compare this to the other games in the series, I'll just give a pros and cons list and a summary.Pros:1. Interesting story. It's not always easy to find an rpg with a good story. I can safely say that Morrowind does a decent job with this, and it tells a compelling story.2. Real RPG mechanics.As much as I sometimes have trouble with it, the hit/miss system is much more in line with a tabletop rpg, which I feel like bethesda was going for. take this one as you will, as it isn't for everyone.3.Vast and creative world.This was one of the first games I came across when I was younger that actually had a unique world, immersive lore, and sheer size to it. Even after all my time playing I still haven't explored everything, and that's part of the fun!4. Mod support.I don't know about anyone else, but I love mods! They have the potential to breathe new life into older games through many means such as dlc-like quests, new armors, graphical overhauls, and even sound packs! Some even give new playerhomes and worldspaces to explore. If you don't mind searching through pages of cringeworthy nude patches on the Morrowind Nexus, this is a huge plus!Cons:1. Dated graphics.I get that this was top of the line when it came out, and honestly it doesn't hold up too poorly, but these can be an issue sometimes. not being able to tell if what you're looking at is an argonian or a bunch of triangles can be pretty jarring. If you truly can't stand older 3d graphics, stay away from Morrowind.2.Real RPG mechanics.""But you put that in the pros column! How can it possibly be bad AND good?"" The answer is this, my friends: inflated difficulty and painfully slow traveling! The hit/miss mechanics are genuinely more like tabletop RPGs, but there's a reason they aren't commonly used. when you're in a 3d world space and you stab someone in the face with a sword, you would probably expect the sword to do damage when it actually visibly collides with the enemies' face. In Morrowind, actually hitting them only gives you a CHANCE to hit when this occurs. This makes for an insanely difficult beginning to the game, so be warned. Also, YOUR STAMINA DEPLETES WHEN MOVING! 3.NO NAVIGATIONI know that a lot of the hardcore fans of the game love this aspect, but the map of Vvardenfel is really bad, there's no fast travel (which to be honest isn't all that horrible,) and there is NO compass to help you through questing. A lot of the Morrowind fanboy crowd would say ""You don't NEED a compass, the quest givers and NPCs will give you directions! It's called immersion!"" But the problem with this oh so horrible excuse is this: Npc directions are frequently wrong! I don't know if this was an intentional ""Immersion"" trait, or if the devs just typed it wrong, but there are numerous quests that have no correct directions, making it nearly impossible to find the objective!

												A brilliant of the game design, and one of the best volunteers in every overall list of the most influencing video games in history. There are hordes of Morrowind fans in the world, and I am one of them. But I'll not gonna tell you that Morrowind is THE Best of RPGs, or even vouch for it like for the best in Bethesda's TES serial.It is not fitting for every person, but quite pervasive for those who caught the flow.There are no other game where I restarted from the very beginning so many times not because I've died from some critters, or did something wrong... I restarted this game so many for the boundless field of possibilities of what to do with your character in that game.Morrowind's game mechanics, would that be fighting, character evolution, story and quests patterns - they all may look quite dated, clumsy and unpolished. But all of those starting to make sense after you discover the biggest hook of the game. Not only it is one of the most glorious open-world adventures, it is also a great sandbox game! The greatest sandbox in whole RPG genre, that's a good definition!Morrowind giving you all the tools to make your adventure the most unique in the world. The first and the most useful tool for it is the magic. That part is much more sophisticated, then in previous and later Elder Scrolls games, for you have the immense variety of effects you can combine in spells, embed in your inventory, drastically changing not only yourself, but the whole world around you! To kill a demigod, capture his soul and use it to create the most powerful weapon... that could be a full of pathos main quest in some other game, but in Morrowind you can do it on daily basis (until you run off the demigods). And without any pointers from quest system... Or hey, forget the uberweapon, use the soul of god to warming your trousers, you can do that too!Okay, let's finish that. Morrowind was released in 2002, and vanilla version surely looks quite aged for modern standards... For graphics, for clunky mechanics, for difficulty... But with all that, it is still one of the most cunning worlds ever created. It is still looks great, it is still gives you the same enormous field to play with magic, dozens of heroic quest deeds and much more things you expecting from an open-world game. And if graphics or compatibility bothers you, there are various mods like OpenMW, Morrowind Overhaul 3 and so on, to cherish your eye...So I hope you'll share the delight from this game with me and millions of other fans of that living monument of the game design.As of mark... Morrowind does not need my 10, but even with all glitches and hardtimes that I experienced with it for those 14 years... It is worth not less than 9/10. Not the best game, maybe, but beloved one.

												Like your quest markers? Gone.How about your fast travel? Gone.Oh, don't you LOVE your dual-wielding, shouts, infinite mana with the right gear, vampires that don't catch on fire on contact with the sun, followers, and anything else that is softcore? GONE. Now, I'm not saying Skyrim is a bad game, it's actually a great game. It just seems a bit too easy to me. But, luckily, before the generation of games that help you aim, regenerate your health, and let you use a sniper rifle the wrong way but it somehow works, there was these kind of games.This game is one of my personal favorites of all time. I really enjoyed this when I was a kid on the original Xbox, so, a couple years ago, I decided to buy it on steam.It gives you a brief tutorial, then you're on your own, and it won't hold your hand. Just you, your weapon, your skills, and your unforgiving enemies (not to mention cliff racers... oh god, the cliff racers).The story is also great. What's that? You're the dragonborn? How about a cross-Vvardenfell idol that kills gods, vampires, kwama, etc, is the greatest wizard in the history of Tamriel, and can literally levitate and go anywhere? Anyway, the story made me feel like I was a god. I never felt like that in a game in a while.Overall, I would say this is a must-buy for any challenge-seeker, fan of classic games, elder scrolls fan, or those looking for a great RPG. This game is NOT for everyone, and I can understand that. This game is very memorable, though, and I would recommend for sure.			"

												This is still one of my favorite games of all time. If you're reading the reviews, I'm guessing you might be wondering how it holds up or compares to the other newer Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion and Skyrim. Morrowind feels a lot more like a traditional RPG than its sequels. A lot of people complain about the combat accuracy in this game, because it's based on stats and dicerolls, unlike the most recent Elder Scrolls titles. If you have a low skill in Blunt Weapons at the beginning of the game, you aren't going to be able to hit or do very much damage with a warhammer. This is pretty basic stuff for most RPGs but a lot of people prefer the FPS-style combat of TES4 and TES5, so it's something you should know going in. You should try to pick a race/class/birthsign combo that work well together so that your stats aren't all over the place.The other big, big difference that comes to the top of my head is fast travel. In Morrowind, you can't just instantly travel from one spot on the world map to the other - but there are a number of different travel options available to you. There are boats in certain towns, 'silt strider' ports (giant bug caravans), the Mages Guild has its own magical transportation network, there are 'Mark' and 'Recall' spells that allow you to set a point in the world you can teleport to at any time, etc. There are a few others, like the 'Intervention' scrolls that almost work like a 'Scroll of Town Portal' from Diablo. Overall I don't think the lack of a modern open world 'fast travel' option is a detriment to this game. It helps you to feel more immersed in the world.Compared to Oblivion or Skyrim, Morrowind's writing is top notch. The world feels very lived-in. The world and towns have a rich history, and there are lots of little details hidden everywhere for you to run into. The setting is unlike any other game, which is something you probably hear a lot about this game, but it's more than just 'giant mushrooms'. Morrowind takes place on a volcanic ashland island, and there isn't much plantlife. The locals harvest bug eggs inside of caves ('egg mines'), some towns have people living inside of giant insect husks, there are magical god-kings existing within the game world and a zealous religion associated with them.. I can't help but get absorbed in the game's atmosphere any time I play. There are too many little details and great things about Morrowind for me to go into detail on all of them, so I think I'll just rattle off a few more off the top of my head:-A massive NPC discussion system. In the newer games they opted to replace it all with more voice acting, which severely limited the amount of writing and dialogue that characters could have. -The magic system is WAY more indepth than Oblivion or Skyrim. Not only does it let you be a lot more creative with Alchemy, Spellmaking, and Enchanting, but the loot in Morrowind is also a lot more interesting as a result.-A lot more types of gear and skills available than the sequels, like Medium Armor, Spears, throwing weapons, etc.-No invulnerable NPCs. Any character, even plot-related characters, are able to die (a message will notify you if you've 'doomed your world', haha.)-Illegal drugs! NPCs won't trade with you if you have drugs on you. Get that moon sugar out of here - I'm not buying!There are probably a few more things I can't recall, but oh well. The bottom line is that if you think you might be interested in a heavier, classical RPG kind of Elder Scrolls, then Morrowind is worth getting into. It might be a bit rough at first adapting to the different mechanics coming from Oblivion or Skyrim, but it will definitely pay off in the end.			"

												I originally bought the game of the year edition of Morrowind when it was first released in stores. I can honestly say after playing HUNDREDS of hours on Skyrim and Oblivion, this title still earns its stripes. I would recommend this game definitley.Here are some notes about this game for new players:-There is no quest marker in this game telling you where to go and what to find. You must read and listen to everything people tell you. It makes the game more challenging and also more rewarding once you solve riddle, ciphers, and accomplish tasks. It puts you and your brain into the game more than the other titles, and your journal is your best friend. Ask lots of questions to get the most information possible.-Combat in this game is a little dated now, but you get used to it pretty quick. You do damage only when you land a hit on your opponent. At first you will have low skills, so don't expect to land hits when your swinging your blades or shooting your arrows. Magic is different however, as it will always hit....because it magic of course haha. The last thing to remember is that you see a man out in the woods wilderness.....he could kick your a$$. The opponents can be weaklings, or pretty strong adversaries, so it is best to think frist before you strike and choose your battles.-Graphics in this game have aged, but there are some nice ""visual enhancements"" out there if that is your thing. IMO this world feels the most unique and alienated of the series, and the graphics support the vibe and general sence of feeling.-The expansions are great! You can choose to jump right into them if you wish, but you should build your character first and save some coin. They expand the map not once, but twice.-You can kill ANYONE in the game, and it is perma death. This includes people that hand out side quests and main quests. If you happen to kill someone that happens to be linked to a main quest....sorry brother, tought luck that quest line is DONE. Choose your battles and think before you act. This is why I like this game personally.-Good music & there are strip clubs in the game! Heck yea!-Player customization and weapon maitanence is bar none the most diverse out of all the games.-This game can run on any PC and Laptop that exisits now, so you can play on the go! *Bonus*Have fun out there!

												I gotta say, playing the elder scrolls series in reverse order, starting with skyrim, then oblivion, then morrowind, and even a little daggerfall, this series seems to amaze more and more as you go back. We start with skyrim, a game with much polish, but in comparison to its predecessors, morrowind & oblivion, lacks almost a heart and soul compared to the other 2 games. All it really has on them is polish.... Thats it... nothing more honestly. Oblivion, which is sort of the middle brother in the series, is just an amazing and interesting game in its own. But i already wrote my review for that so lets get to morrowind. This game has such an authentic and unique feel that i must say, is not present in any of the other elder scrolls games. Now a days to test creative imagination people play things like minecraft, and all that. But i dont hear too many stories about morrowind and i cant understand why. In this game the only limit is your imagination, you never run out of things to do which offers infinite playability. Not only that but you constantly are wanting to create new classes because what you choose in the beginning of the game is basically what molds your gameplay for the rest of the game. Unless of course, you spellcraft (which is amazing by the way). I wont go too deep into it but if you can think of a game with magic in it, ill bet anything this game tops its magic. You can literally do anything... Wanna fly across the map and slam into the ground exploding into a massive fireball that heals you while destroying the entire world ? Not a problem! wanna go into space and visit the moon ? (okay too far) Anyways the amount of lore and depth this game has is seriously unreal and there will never be another game like it. People say the combat system sucks and isnt that complicated. The combat system in morrowind is more complicated than any of the other games. Its not just a matter of weapon damager and whether or not you hit the target. It takes into account how tired you are, how are your skills with that item, what is your strength, what is the enemies strength, how tired are they and i can go on and on and on. Due to its dateing and the fact that theres a bit of a learning curve it may be hard for some of you to really get into, but if you can get past that stuff, the gameplay will surely leave its mark on you and you will be totally engrossed... Give it a try			"

												After 95 hours I have finally completed the main quest of the game.What makes Morrowind special and unique, is its world, culture, people, I could go on but I will not. It's a game with a soul and story that is timeless, and that I have not experienced in any of the later sequels. It is the type of game that stands out, and you learn something new everytime you play it.Though many may argue that Morrowind is unplayable because of its combat system, there exists mods that solves this problem. It may take away the challenge that is Morrowind, but if you're in it for the experience then go ahead and install it. It is an absolutely wonderful, beautiful, strong game with an identity like no other, and is the owner of an setting that I will never forget.			"

												I had never heard of the Elder Scrolls games until Skyrim and thought that it was absolutely captivating that I wanted to play the others. I played Oblivion next, then Morrowind, and I have to say out of those 3 Morrowind is my favorite Elder Scrolls games I have played. It was extremely challenging at first since some areas have very high level monsters and it isnt leveled like it is in Oblivion and Skyrim.However, when you reach higher levels you become a literal god of Morrowind able to fly around, leap far and high distances, cast crazy insane spells. It's a lot of fun packed with tons of content. It is very unforgiving so one thing I learned is to save, and save often! Also if you steal something and no one notices prepare for the Dark Brotherhood to come kill you in your sleep. What happens when you tell a guard? They pretty much say ""tough ♥♥♥♥"" and to write a will. 10/10 would steal again.			"

												I recently purchased this game on Steam but had originally bought this game back in 2003 for the original Xbox. I played it not knowing the history or significance of The Elder Scrolls series. I just thought the game looked cool by the cover of the box and figured I'd give it a try. And boy am I glad I did. Up until I played this game back in 2003 the only RPG I had ever played was the first Final Fantasy so my knowledge and experience with RPG's was very lacking to say the least. I figured I'd begin the game and start hacking and slashing my way through lickity split. That was my first mistake. This game humbled me. I was not prepared for the steep learning curve mandated by this game. I died. And then I died. Oh, and then I died some more. But once I understood the game mechanics and realized why I couldn't hit anything even though I was close enough to my enemies to hear their inner most thoughts and desires, I started to have fun. Cut to several years later and hundreds of hours of playtime under my belt and this game has easily become one of my all time favorites. There is just so much to love about this game. For starters the setting is fantastic. It feels very alien with giant mushrooms for trees and giant beetle like creatures used as a way of transportation. The story is extreamly engaging. The thing I love about the story is that it doesn't make you out to be this all powerful Demi God, savior of the the world right from the start like most modern RPG's do. You have to earn that title. You don't just kill a monster two hours in and get bestowed title of the chosen one with praise thrown at you by everyone you meet there after. You have to fight and claw your way to that title all the while everyone is looking at you like a piece of scrib jelly stuck to their boot. You have to convince people that you are the chosen and when you finally do, it is one of the most rewarding moments ever felt in a video game. Another pro is the dialogue. More specifically the written dialogue. You see this game is primarily text driven meaning that when you talk to NPC's you have to read rather than listen. While this may sound like a con to some I find that the conversations are much more interesting and in depth. There are dozens of topics to discuss with an NPC with more topics that open up as you converse with them making the journey down the conversation rabbit hole an engaging one. My last major pro for this game is the difficulty. I love how this game actually makes you have to think and work to accomplish your goals. You see there are no quest markers showing you where to go or who to talk to. You have to rely on your journal that your character updates by talking to quest givers. Often times you have to use natural land markers or ask random pedestrians where to go in order to reach your destination. Fast travel is also very limited which opens up the possibilities of stumbling into more random encounters or areas that may have otherwise been missed if performing fast travel all the time. The game is not perfect though. No game is. Combat takes some getting used to and can be a bit of a turn off for some. Often times your character will miss it's target in the early game until you raise your combat skills high enough. Same goes for magic. Until you raise your magic skills high enough you will fail at casting a spell more than you will succeed. The game also does not tailor to sneak type characters very well making those character builds frustrating to use. With all that being said if you are a fan of The Elder Scrolls games or RPG's in general this game is a must. Be warned though if you are coming from having played Oblivion and or Skyrim first this game is not those games. Morrowind does not hold your hand and it will require you to figure things out for yourself. This is a hard game and you will die. A lot. But if you give it a chance and take it for what it is you will find a lot of enjoyment out of it. I was fortunate enough to have been a teenager when this game released and was able to go into it without any preconceived notions are expectations. The Steam version comes with the two official addons Tribunal and Bloodmoon.  "

												I have sunk countless hours into Morrowind since before I got this game on Steam and I plan to sink in even more for years to come. To me, Morrowind is a timeless game and despite criticism on the game's age and whether or not it holds up to this day, this game is truly a classic. To be fair, this was my first 'Elder Scrolls' game that I played back when I had the original X-Box over a decade ago so some may contribute my praises to nostalgia, but hear me out. Very few games captivated me the same was as Morrowind did. The level of freedom this game gave was unparalleled back in the day. It has a large map open to exploration, tons of side quests, amazing soundtrack, and deep lore. Despite these praises, it would be difficult to recommend this game to newcomers considering numerous role-playing games that have sprung over time that would overshadow this game in terms of content and overall experiences with examples such as 'The Witcher' or 'Mass Effect' but I argue that this game still holds up. Some knock this game for its visuals which I think people need to let that one slide considering this game was released in 2002 and for a game of it's sheer scope and content, was pretty revolutionary for its time. Another huge critique would be the combat which could agitate new players since the combat relies on a form of dice-roll mechanic similar to the likes of MMOs where there is a chance the attack could miss despite the enemy CLEARLY taking the hit. It is indeed frustrating and I understand criticisms to this combat, but I just compare this game to the likes of 'Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic' or 'Dragon Age' with the exception that you're freely controlling each individual hit instead of your attacks being automatic.Another critique of the game is that it can be vague with directions since the whole ""follow the waypoint"" concept didn't become a thing until the next installment ""Oblivion"" so some could be frustrated when finding their way. Personally, I have never struggled with the directions of side quests and I have gotten lost from time to time, however, I always managed to find my way. I suppose everybody has different experiences. The last critique by some people, to my surprise, would be the journal. Apparently, some people don't like the first-person style writing of the journal whenever it updates you on the quests which I find shocking because I love the journal in Morrowind. It has this style that feels as though your character is documenting his/her thoughts and, in my opinion, adds a nice touch to the game.Summary:I would recommend this game only if you keep an open mind. If you're a fan of the later 'Elder Scrolls' titles such as 'Skyrim' and 'Oblivion,' please give this game a shot, but try to work with its flaws. It's not a perfect game and I don't want to pass off as a fanboy, but I personally consider this game to be a masterpiece and one of my peronal favorite games ever made due to what it offers and the unique world you delve into. The environments and the experiences are like no other game I have ever played before. It's hard to recommend this game nowadays, but I hope some will appreciate it for what it has accomplished.

This f***ing game, is SO hard, I love it to death.PROS:-No fast travel= Explore to your heart's content!-carriage system= it's not too open, which is good, you don't have to travel across the whole map to finish a quest.-Character creation is game friendly and choice driven= :D-Graphics. Seriously, for a game made in 2002, it did a pretty ok job on graphicsRealism- you have to have enchanted weapons to fight ghosts, the ingredients are punishing, and you can fail at casting spells, hitting enemies, lockpicking, and repairing, which helps the game feel more realistic, even if there are cities of shrooms and dinosaurs that kick the everloading s*** out of you.CONS:-Combat= if you don't have a decenlt high skill, for example axe skill is 5, you will miss 95% of the time.-Enemies are SO HARD-Leveling takes FOREVER-If you forget to save, you have to start ALL OVER.9.5/10, this game is frustrating and big, which makes it shine brightly. It challenges you to the very end, and is sooooooooo rewarding when you get to the end.All in all, worth the $19 and some change.RECOMMENDED FOR: RPGers, and people who LOVE exploring and a challenging RPG experience.

												I played this game so much back in the day it's ridiculous. Used to have almost every location in the game world memorized because I'd played it so much. Even Skyrim, as good as it is, lacks a few things that Morrowind has. Morrowind doesn't try to hold your hand and ask you how you're feeling. It throws you in the game world and says good luck, buddy. Pretty sure it was because of this game that Bethesda couldn't get over the ""start the player as a prisoner"" schtick. Someone might want to send Bethesda the news; it wasn't the prisoner thing. It was simply the fact that this was a damn good game.			"

												It's not an easy game. If you're used to Oblivion and Skyrim, it seems rather clunky and obsolete at first. It took me several tries before I could really get into it.But man, when I got into it, I got into it hard.Underneath the supposedly clunky mechanics lies an RPG experience so deep and rewarding that it has yet to be matched to this day. It's a game that allows for a level of player freedom that the later Elder Scrolls games could not match. Not to mention the land of Morrowind is still, to this day, a beautiful and unique world with a culture worth discovering. There are many stories to be told on this land, and once you climb over the the initial barrier to entry you will find yourself making many of your own.Morrowind is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.

												Negative reviews are 90% of the time about aged graphics and mechanics. Bascially saying ""I like it but it doesn't look as nice as Skyrim"" or ""The combat system sucks and everything is underpowered"", because you are not a god at the beginning... Anyway, I am barely older than this game but I love it. You really notice how you become stronger and I would recommend it to anyone who played oblivion and skyrim to give it a try.			"

												I Started playing morrowind after i played skyrim and oblivion. and you know what, Its the BEST elder scrolls game bethesda has ever made. some gamers have trouble coping with the dated graphics/combat. Im 14 and even i could realise what a roleplaying masterpiece this is. yes its actually a roleplaying game as in you can make choices that have actual impact, the world doesnt revolve around you, and you have to work for what you earn. Look i loooooove skyrim but morrowind just did it better. This game even inspired me to play daggerfall and Arena (Wasnt my cup of tea but i wanted to eat up all the lore so i sucked it up and finished both games.)			"

												A game that stands the test of time pretty darn well especially with all the amazing mods for it. Worth playing at least once. It's weakest aspect which is the combat isn't that much of a drawback and it's pretty fun early one when you are a weakling and pretty much anything can kill you if careless so... there is that.What I most enjoyed was the exploration aspect of the game. Morrowind is an interesting place just to explore and see what you can find, both good and bad. The in game story and lore aren't half bad either and in comparison to the later ES games seem positively Tolkeish. A lot of fun to be had messing around with the potions and developing all kinds of cool abilities like flight or super jumps. Back when this came out this was just epic stuff and its still pretty enjoyable since the Morrowind is a well crafted environment that's just fun to visit from time to time and maybe even for an extended visit, why not?

												Morrowind is an amazing game. It's got a great soundtrack, the game's world is absolutely unique and sucks you in right from the start. I'll never forget the experience of just starting this game, running away from cool beasts and being scared of the mysterious diseases. Sure, the game's got some faults, for example, the world also feels plastic because it's just NPCs going around, giving you Tolstoyian amounts of words when you click a keyword in the dialogue window. But all those faults don't diminish the game at all. However, when people talk about how good Morrowind is, they mean only the game, not the expansion packs. I mean, I don't know that for sure, but it really feels like that. Why? Because the expansions sucked. Their mediocrity is absolutely painful compared to the great work that the base game is. Oh, you don't like escort quests? There's like six of them in Bloodmoon and quite a bunch in Tribunal, not to mention that the expansions' storylines are pretty bad, all over the place and don't involve you in it any bit. You should probably steer clear from them or take a break after beating the base game and starting the expansions.			"

												Arguably the most influential game I have ever played in my life. Having started playing this masterpiece a decade ago, it has captured my attention again and again. The endless hours of enjoyment to be garnered from the vanilla game alone make this game worth it. Once you finally feel that new itch to scratch there exist countless mods ranging from minor quality of life changes to complete new continents. Looking past the dated graphics and plodding combat system, this game still fills me with giddiness everytime I hear the intro theme.			"

												A brilliant game design, and one of the best volunteers in every overall list of the most influencing video games in history. There are hordes of Morrowind fans in the world, and I am one of them. But I am not going to tell you that Morrowind is the best of RPGs, or even vouch for it as the best in Bethesda's TES series.It is not fitting for every person, but quite pervasive for those who caught the flow.There are no other game where I restarted from the very beginning so many times not because I have died from some critters, or did something wrong. I restarted this game so many times for the boundless field of possibilities of what to do with your character in that game.All of the Morrowind game mechanics, would that be fighting, character evolution, story and quests patterns, they all may look quite dated, clumsy and unpolished. But all of those start to make sense after you discover the biggest hook of the game. Not only it is one of the most glorious open-world adventures, it is also a great sandbox game. One of the greatest sandboxes in the whole RPG genre, that's a good definition.Morrowind gives you all the tools to make your adventure the most unique in the world. The first and the most useful tool for it is the magic. That part is much more sophisticated than in previous and later Elder Scrolls games, for you have the immense variety of effects that you can combine in spells, embed in your inventory, drastically changing not only yourself, but the whole world around you. You could kill a demigod, capture his soul and use it to create the most powerful weapon. That could be the large portion of the plot in another game’s main quest, but in Morrowind you can do it all on your own initiative without the game saying that you should do it. Or hey, forget the uber-weapon, use the soul of the demigod you killed for permanently warming your trousers, you can do that too.Morrowind was released in 2002, and vanilla version surely looks quite aged for modern standards. For graphics, for clunky mechanics, for difficulty, but with all that, it is still one of the most cunning worlds ever created. It is still looks great, it is still gives you the same enormous field to play with magic, dozens of heroic quest deeds and much more things you expecting from an open-world game. So I hope you'll share the delight from this game with me and millions of other fans of that living monument of the game design.Morrowind marks a turning point in Bethesda’s career, before they figured out that going for the wider audience and console markets, aiming for the lowest common denominator and spending more budget on marketing than development will make more profit than making actually good games. Unfortunately, we will never see another game like Morrowind ever again, let alone a successor. Oblivion and Skyrim are worse in almost every way, and take away more than they add. One step forward, three steps back if you will. Fortunately, digital goods do not have an expiration date, and old games can still be played and enjoyed years after release.The game combines modern graphics with classic functionality. As such, many things will be determined by dice rolls. Many inexperienced players have expressed their frustration when not hitting enemies in combat. Let me just say this, it is perfectly possible to create a character who, even at level one, never misses an evenly matched opponent. Though this is not something a newbie would come up with.Morrowind’s main selling point is the open world, which is available to you once you complete the short tutorial. Unlike later games in the series, where you are the center of the universe and the world revolves around you, in Morrowind you start as a nobody, dropped in a world that would exist with or without you.Unlike the later games in the series, that underwater cave at the edge of the world will not have exactly the same treasure and enemies as the dungeon just across the tutorial town. The chest at the bottom of the biggest and most dangerous dungeon will not contain a rusty iron dagger just because you were at too low of a level. Poor bandits will not wear armor worth as much as an entire city just because you are high-level. The world is there, and waiting for you to explore it. Here, a young thief won't just have to steal silver spoons and forks because that's all he will find. All the best gear in the game is available right from the start, although well-guarded.  Also, people are not mysteriously immortal just because you might need to talk to them later. Morrowind lets you do just what you want to do, without trying to protect the player from his/her stupidity through artificial barriers and limitations.			"

												This game takes you on the possibly best adventure in RPG history. Epic music creates an amazing mood while playing the game, which is on its own already very mysterious and creates memories that the player will remember for a long time.In case you were worried about the graphics, there are a lot of mods that change the graphics completely. There is one particular mod called MSGO which is, in my opinion, the best Graphics Overhaul mod. It changes the way the game looks, in a good way, but keeps the originality of the game and doesn't change any game mechanics, meaning you will have the real The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind experience, but with better graphics.

												This game is very different from the later elder scrolls games, so when you start playing don't expect Skyrim with 2002 graphics.  First of all it is much more of a hardcore RPG than skyrim and Oblivion, you will need lots of trial and error with what to do when it comes to what the right things to say to people are, where to go and how you should build your character.  There are so many quests to do in cities like Vivec that they will keep you busy for plenty of hours, and all the things to do outside like exploring caves or maybe venturing up north to explore the dangerous island of Soltheim.  Like I said earlier about it being way more hardcore, you will have to walk everywhere on foot with the acception of paying gold to people to get to major cities.  Also there are no quest markers so you will have to look at your journal for directions and go around asking people for more detailed directions.  The dialouge in this game even though not all your conversations are fully voiced, they are so detailed and emersive you will read it for 10 minutes straight because it's so intresting.Though you will need to spend lots of time to do quests and to get around in general, I find it to be much more realistic this way and it makes you feel like you're an actual adventurer in the province of Morrowind.9.7/10 "

												If you are like me and love Skyrim you propably thought ""Hey maybe i should cheek out the other TES games"".Anyways I did so I bought Morrowind and this is how i compare the two.Imagine that you`re going to big and classy resturant call Bethesta RPG`s. You go in grab at seat and get the menu and order the dish called Skyrim and what do you get? You get a big buger with lots of fries and coca cola. Now there is nothing wrong with that I love burgers myself and if you came for one that`s fine. But if you want something classy, a real RPG you should order the one called Morrowind. On this dish you get lobsters potato gratin and a glass of wine. Now to enyoy this you have to be a littel bit more mature. Morrowind is a hard game without fastravel, questmarkers or the world leveling to match you`re strength. While the grafics are not so impresive it`s a beautiful game with culture, it`s own society and politcis.So if you want to be a part of this beautiful world and ready for a challange I couldn`t recomend itmore			"

I've probably put more than 200 hours into this game.BY FAR THE BEST ELDER SCROLLS GAME YET!!!WITH THE MORROWIND GRAPHICS OVERHAUL AT NEXUS THIS GAME LOOKS AND SOUNDS AMAZING TOO!!!The story is rich.- I REALLY don't want to spoil it for you, but story is AMAZING-The side quests are fun and unqiue. ( You don't have to go into a dungeon for every quest )- Can run amazing on any pc ( I have a $300 dollar laptop with no graphics card and an i3 processor and it can run the game at a smooth 60 fps, but it CANNOT handle the Morrowind graphics overhaul )- The dlc is loads of fun, especially tribunal. If i had to give this game an honest review I would give it a 10/10By far one of the best, if not THE BEST, game I've ever playedYou can't call yourself an elder scrolls fan until you've played this game.So are you going to DEDICATE yourself to being an elder scrolls fan or are you just going to go on and read the next review?!?!?

												Oh Morrowind, how I wished to complete your story before I reviewed you.  But you're such a massive game, and I simply can't leave you without a review.Morrowind is a huge game.  I can't describe how big it is.  And it has aged.  A lot.  Yet, I found the way the game aged poorly to actually be great.  D20 based combat that plays like an action RPG makes you realize how it feels deeper than other games having something that involves 'who loses health first,' 'hold on, let me eat some cheese wheels quick.'  The world is vast and unique, containing elements of a sci-fi planet rather than that of fantasy.  The feeling of being in the minority race, surrounded by a mainland race as you play an outlander is something that expands this lore filled game.  It has its flaws sure(cliff racers!), but in the end I love this game!It's not T rated Skyrim, it's better.  And as someone born in '98, I can easily say that once I realized what I got into, I loved it.			"

												Pros:- Throwing stars;- The world is huge, with more diversity than Skyrim's barren landscape;- Large amount of magic effects. A user created spell can have eight effects;- More weapon types than you can swing with;- A Mudcrab merchant, a plant named Charles, dead explorer named Peek-At-Choo and a statue that gives you a golden sword;- Did I mention throwing stars?;- One exploit allows for an unlimited summoning of monsters. - Hours of content rewards exploration with great items. Does Skyrim have that? (Look up the Ring of Pop Je);- Exploits allow for OPness beyond Chuck Norris.Cons-- Graphics are dated, 2002 is soooo last decade;- A bit buggy, save often;- Staffs are a weapon type better left on the ground;- Exploits sing their siren song for you to use them;- Skyrim has more mods. Damn you MLP fans.If you're not satisified with summoning an army of ogres and making Shrek jokes get your money back.			"

												Oh man, this game is something. I can remember the first time I heard about it. Toonami, on the Cartoon Network, ran a review for Morrowind when it came out. I just remember the open world, do anything you want, mechanic appealing so much to me. I was twelve then, and had not really ever played an RPG, other than Pokemon. I had no idea what to expect. When my cousin rented the game for his original Xbox, we played it all night long. I knew this was a game that would stick with me. And it has. I have come back to this game over and over again about once ever two to three years. When Skyrim came out and I finished it, most of my friends started it over so they could play a different character. But I went back to Morrowind.Where to start Hm, well first of all, let me preface my praise for this game with a warning. A lot of modern gamers seem to have difficulty getting into these older classics. The RPG system is fairly old school. Your skill determines your chance to hit and not your damage dealt like in Oblivion and Skyrim. Some modern gamers don't like this restriction, but being a fan of the traditional RPG systems of games like FO1 and FO2, Baldur's Gate, Planescape, etc. I enjoy this system. Sure, it's hard as Hell when you first start out. You feel so incredibly weak. You're in this strange, alien world where nothing is really familiar. Instead of horses or carriages, people ride around in the hollowed out carapace of giant bugs. The abundance of plant life is generally nothing you'll recognize except for a few flowers in the more westernized cities. You really get the sense that you're alone in this wild place. You're so weak that you struggle to battle against rats and mudcrabs. Just make sure you check the ""Always Use Best Attack"" option in the settings menu. It helps a good deal.You also have to really play into the RPG system. This isn't Skyrim where you, a mage, can use any weapon and still be a bad ♥♥♥. If you're a mage, then you won't be able to kill ♥♥♥♥ with a sword. Likewise, if you're a warrior, you're more likely to turn your genitals into a basket of fruit than you are to fry your enemies with magic. Try to choose a race that complements a certain class. Plan out what type of character you're going to play and then try to make your gameplay efficient in that regard.One last thing is that this game was created before voice acting was considered necessary in video games. I still argue that voice acting isn't necessary and that I'd rather see more content than less content with voice acting included. Regardless, some people find it difficult to deal without it. Really, it's not that hard to read and it just gets you into the story even more. I find myself paying more attention to the details when I'm reading as opposed to listening.Another warning is that the graphics are outdated. When Morrowind was released, it was the pinnacle of video game graphics. Screenshots of the game were advertised on the back of high end graphics cards you'd find in electronic shops. However, thanks to the game's wonderful compatibility with mods, this can totally overhauled with some excellent mods. It's possible to transform the game into something truly more beautiful than it was ever imagined to be.Controls are going to be a problem for you if you only like using a controller. I guess it would be possible to map the controls to an Xbox controller, but it wouldn't really be efficient. I imagine you'd have a lot of difficulty aiming at anything in the midst of battle. It's just as well, though, as this game is better played with a macro keyboard and mouse.Okay, now that the warning are out of the way, time for the good stuff.The writing for this game's story is phenomenal. The backstory and lore for this game is top notch. The atmosphere of the entire game is spot on. You get SO immersed into this world, so quickly. Some crazy things happen to your character in the main story that really just draws you in to the history of this world. The culture of the people in Morrowind is one of the most dynamic and interesting that I've ever seen in video game. The Dunmer culture was solidified in this game and it has obviously left an indelible mark on the series, even on into the future games like Skyrim.Speaking of which, the second expansion pack for this game (being including in this GotY bundle) is the first appearance of Solstheim. That's right, the frozen island featured in the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim is a revisit to the beautiful little island featured in The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon. Bloodmoon allows you to become a werewolf, truly one of the greatest mechanics of the series and something that was sorely missed in Oblivion.The other expansion, Tribunal doesn't add any new landmasses, but the capital city of Morrowind, Mournhold. While the city proper isn't huge, the underground sewers, and old ruins are quite expansive. The quests and story for Tribunal is just as compelling as the main quest for Morrowind and gives you the opportunity to meet yet another living god (the first being introduced to you in Morrowind's main quest).The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is just one of those games that everybody should have in their library. It's just a beautiful game in it's entirety. It does have it's flaws and bugs, but when you take an abstract look at the entire game, it is not hard at all to see why so many people consider it to be a true masterpiece. The story, setting, detail, art, and dialogue is just all so wonderful that outweighs any of it's more ""dated"" aspects. This game has been with me for around twelve years now and I will probably never stop playing it. There will always be times when I revisit Morrowind, as the little island of Vvardenfell was practically my backyard for my early to mid teenage years. Buy it. It is so worth it. And even if you can't get past the graphics or the lack of voice acting, then buy it anyway and get Oblivion. If you own both of these games, you can run the Morroblivion mod and play all of Morrowind's story in the Oblivion engine. The same will be true for Skywind when that mod is finished. Neither of them have voice acting yet, but the fans are trying to record it. One day, all of Morrowind will be available, fully voiced and retouched in the Oblivion and Skyrim engines.But you should experience the game in it's original engine at least once. The feel of it just adds to the magic that is Morrowind.10/10			"

												Firstly, don't let the Steam statistics fool you: I have played hundreds of hours before having the game on Steam. The time for me to write a review of my favourite game ever has come, and I couldn't be happier. It was the year 1996, and the fairly young videogames studio of Bethesda was releasing The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, the successor of the modest, quite unnoticed first chapter, TES Arena. Presenting you to a world with deep RPG mechanics, a map of the size of Great Britain and the freedom to do whatever you wanted in a sandbox, 3D world, it has become a true legend among the other RPGs of the time. Changing the paradigm, it introduced dozens of brand new mechanics and improved anothers from Arena, making it the turning point for RPGs. Straight after the release of Daggerfall, Bethesda worked on an expansion called Battlespire, that was later turned into a standalone game, and Redguard, a more action-like, dumbed down game that explored the universe and developed the lore. Meanwhile, deep into the studios of Bethesda, more shocking, jawbreaking ideas for a new game started to appear. Making a full, huge 3D detailed world filled with creatures, NPCs, enemies and with a full day/night circle seemed like an utopia, and it actually was. Being developed allways at the edge of the time's hardware, a new TES started to get shape, something bold, something unique, something terrifying and creative. Thus, TES III: Morrowind was born.    Well, enough with the story. This review will be divided into 4 aspects, graphics, story/plot, gameplay and sound, and a consideration of som other aspects. Released in 2002, as mentioned, Morrowind had two additional expansions, Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Since this in the review of the GOTY Edition, it will also take into consideration all the expansions and official add-ons.Graphics: this game runs in the Gamebryo Engine, the same engine that was used to make the next TES, Oblivion, and Fallout 3 and New Vegas, so it's an engine that spaned a very long lifetime. In 2002, the minimum requirements for this game were huge, and a state-of-the-art computer was necessary in order to run it in it's ful splendor. While some would think this was a bad optimization, in this case it's just the ludicrous ammount of details and material that was put into this game. The view distance was very short, even with the settings on the maximum, just to make the game able to run in that time's hardware. Nowadays, we can unlock those restrictions and see Morrowind in it's full splendor: for that time, it was just fantastic. From the water to the sky, going through the unique flora and the weird and suffering environment of volcanic formations, strange swamps and some environments that can't even be described due to their singularity make this one of the most inimaginable experiences in gaming. 96 out of 100. Gameplay: most people had their first contact with the TES series with the latest entry, TES V: Skyrim. Skyrim was good, but it was a game made to appeal to the casual masses, which it did. Some may also had their first contact with TES IV: Oblivion, which is, by far, the most equilibrated: the almost perfect balance between deep RPG, TES-like funcionalities, and accessibility for a smoother, more friendly experience. Yet, there is a more restrict group of gamers that had their first contact with Morrowind, or even with the oldest entries. These fans usually see the quality of the latest entries, but miss the deepness Morrowind had. the funcionalities Morowind had made it possible to do whatever you want: you want to be a vampire? You can! You want to be a werewolf? You can! you want to be a mercenary-like warrior working for a guild who gives you nasty jobs? You can! Of course all of that can be done in the other TES as well. the difference resides that in here you must have the appropriate skils to be able to do that and to even be able to accept various quests. This is just an example of the hardness Morrowind presents; From having to constantly sleep to recover health, to be unable to cast a spell properly, to the multiple hits you have to give and take in order to take down an adversary are, the confusion and sense of dispair is always present, making certain actions very rewardful. The only major problem are the menus, the combat system and the dialogue system: while they do their job, they are clumsy and could had been improved a lot. From the useless third person view to the very confusive journal and quest tracking, the interface and the combat is probably Morrowind's biggest flaw. And bugs, lots of bugs. Not as much as Oblivion and Skyrim, but yet, they started all here. 82 out of 100Story/plot: you, as usual, start as a prisioner. This time, you were released under the order of the Emperor himself, and were dropped in the forsaken island of Vvardenfell, which is a island that comprehends about half of Morrowind's total area, and the home of the Red Mountain, a volano that hosts a mad god-like man inside called Dagoth-Ur. After your release, you do some research jobs for Caius Cosades, a Blade that answers directly to the Emperor. After that apparently uninteresting research you were doing, Caius tells you a very disturbing truth that leads you to a seires of dangerous situations, in order to prove yourself as the Nerevarine, a hero who would save Morrowind from the wrath of the Red Mountain and Dagoth Ur himself. While this is just the main quest, there are still other multiple quest-lines and lots of sidequests that are very interesting and immersive. You can pretty much obtain a huge ammount of lore from the conversations, where you can select multiple topics. The quest-lines on the expansions are also unique and interesting: in bloodmoon, you go to the damned island of Solshteim (the same as in Skyrim's DLC Dragonborn) and involve yourself in a werewolf-related situation. Tribunal starts as a attemp from the Dark Brotherhood to murder you, and leads you to the mainland capital of Morrowind, Mournhold. Here, you will mess with the gods. Without any negative aspect, the plot, and all the TES lore is one of the best ever made for an RPG of this kind. It only sins for the bad organization of the journal, as mentioned above, and could use some more cutscenes or bold scenes. Yet, it's wonderful in it's own way. 95 out of 100.Sound: this is probably one of the most epic sountracks ever written for a game. May the Dunmer Gods bless the soul of Jeremy Soule for his geniusness. Also, it's filled with details: if you are not a Dunmer, Morrowind's native race of elves, you will be called some nasty and pejorative names by the people, allways depending on your race: a Orc will be called an Outlander with a very strong negative conotation, while a imperial will be seen as a ""civilized"" person. There are just some bugs, like the footsteps that are annoying and faulty, and the repetitive sound of ""interacting with objects"". 97 out of 100.Other aspects: with a humongous longetivity, to the ammount of mods the community has made, this game can give you months of fun. The Construction Kit allows you to create your own mods in a fairly easy way (though you may need some geometry knowledge), and it has a very active community even in today's time. As usual, the final score is given by the average between the 4 forementioned aspects, plus a factor of correction based on thre other aspects. So, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, my favourite game ever, and the game that brought to me the world of RPGs end up with the great score of 96 out of 100. Greatest RPG of all time, in my opinion.			"

												My favourite game ever. If you are playing for the first time prepare for a clunky, outdated interface, a frustrating combat system and terrible graphics. If you stick with it though, you will discover and amazingly detailed world, an actually really deep and complex combat and stat system, and a true open world experience as you've never experienced before. The various storylines are not as varied as the later titles, but the main quest is superb.			"

												The best in the Elder Scrolls Series. I've been playing this game for many years, and I got the steam version at a later date. My hours would probably be triple what it shows on steam. No quest markers and limited fast travel may sound like a negative to some, but honestly it makes the game so much deeper. You have to talk to everybody, explore dialogue options, and make sure you pay attention to what NPC's say. When they tell you to go east and take a left at the sign post, they mean it. No arrow on the map is going to show you where to go. You have to use your brain. You cant just fast travel anywhere either. You must pay for trasportation, and only at other settlements. You can pay for a ship to take you to Sadrith Mora, for example, but dont expect to be able to warp to every little place you discover. Honestly, it feels more like an adventure this way. You must use your brain and explore your surroundings, like you would in the real world.			"

												Essentially the game that shaped the elder scrolls series to what they are. A pinnacle of ''freedom of choice''. The game has no set path or quest marks, it trusts you to be smart enough to figure it out yourself. An open world RPG in the way it was meant to be, simple but hard and effectively smart. The humor is always apparent and you even love the racist dark elves. To me it is the game to come back to when i dont know what to play and i always lose myself in it all over again. Ive finished it so many times and even though the combat feels dated, the modding community keeps it alive. No wonder they are still modding to a scale where they want to recreate it in the Skyrim engine, a multiplayer is still in the making and all of that for a game that is well over 10 years old. To me it is the perfected RPG before they became too easy. Thank god for not fast traveling, no regenerating health and for the love of god there is spellmaking to even deepen the endless possibilities. To me it is my nr.1 game of all time. Nuff Said, just buy, download, mod and enjoy for even a modded version doesnt look so dated. 10/10 A Masterpiece amongst masterpieces			"

												This is THE Elder Scrolls to meI can still remember when I played this first time in 2003. It was my first sandbox rpg, my first rpg love. It was love at first sight. In Morrowind it felt like I could do almost anything, and world was rewarding and interesting. Dungeons that could be filled with pitiful rats or something scary that could kill me with one hit. Finding artifact was fun and felt like really something. No level scaling, no cringy dialog (I'm looking at you Fallout 4) and no disappointing dlc. Morrowind is still the best work of Bethesda.Of course there are some flaws. Since this is game of Bugthesda, there is bugs and glitches. Combat can feel bit clunky at first, but it's easy to get past it.And those god damn cliffracers...			"

												Oldie but a goldie. Many gameplay elements are heavily outdated by today's standards. However, looking past the age of the game lies something that many RPGs lack today. The game does not hold your hand, as it leaves you figurely many things out by yourself as soon as you leave the brief intro tutorial. If you are purchasing this game, you have to actually put in a lot of commitment to fully enjoy it, and there's A LOT to enjoy. 8.2/10			"

												Morrowind is a great game. It has great graphics for 2002, great exploration, and great replay ability. Many hate the combat, but I like it more then skyrim's combat where you hit every time.A little advice: when being chased by a cliff racer do zig zags while sprinting diagnolly and he won't hit you as much.Update: I will also note that I don't just like this game because of nostalgia. In fact I never even played until December 25th 2016. You don't need nostalgia to love a classic like this. Anything you don't like about this game can be corrected with mods or console commands. Finally, if you are unsure if you want to buy this game or not, check out oblivion and skyrim, if you dont want those, or if you're sure on this buy Morrowind. I do advise at least looking at Skyrim and Oblivion, they are also great games. It's on sale now as of March 31st! Get it!!!			"

												If you're a fan of TES series and haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor and do it. I can't vouch for you kids who started at Skyrim (this might a bit much for your soft hands, to be honest), but as someone who didn't have a PC/XBOX at Morrowind's release and got in on the series at Oblivion, let me tell you that I regret waiting so long.Ever wonder what Oblivion/Skyrim would be like with better writing, more characters, more weapons, more armor, more skills, better lore, more meta commentary, a more artistically creative atmosphere, better enchanting/spellmaking, more exploits, the ability to fly and/or jump long disntances, real explortaion, real RPG based combat and a real sense of adventure? Then stop ♥♥♥♥ing reading this and go play Morrowind.""But the graphics!"", you whine from your pathetic noise-hole. Well ♥♥♥♥ you, there's a very simple mod for that, just google Morrowind Overhaul. It's an all-in-one patch that updates the graphics/sound and adds several atmospheric mods, as well as many additional options. No ♥♥♥♥ing with anything in your files either, it all installs in one simple install wizard.No ♥♥♥♥ing excuses now, go play it, get your ♥♥♥♥ blown away at what a good TES game would look like and thank me later you god damn n'wah.

												This title is what caused me to truly fall in love with games on a design level - World design, music, sound, graphics, storyline, dialogue, art, and engine. This is going to be more than a bit biased.By far this is one of the most inspirational games of my childhood. The alien world that these characters, ambiances, settings, and beautiful soundtrack immerses me in bring me back into the nestalgia of how this game would fire my imagination, and made me so eager to learn about the strange island of Vvardenvel.The renouned TES Theme, huge open world, and seemingly endless quest and story content to me at the time, with an easy to use Editor Tool, this is a great gem once you get past the step of the game not telling you how to succeed past teaching you the controls. I highly recommend this piece but am unable to give an unbiased number rating, so I won't. Just know if you're willing to be patient with a game, and love the fantasy genre, prepare for many hours of immersive adventure.			"

												I will be honest and say that when i first booted this game up half a year ago or so, i didnt like it. But then  i decided that 30min-1 hr without really trying to learn how the stats system works wasnt enough. So i gave it another go with a clear mind and as of now i am totally hooked.the first thing people will ask how does it compare to skyrim and i say its better.  I have 450 + hrs on skyrim on ps3. And despite me playing this for less i still think this game is better and no this isnt a comparion between this and skyrim.The good:Story: I will begin with the story and is one of the best stories in an open-world game. One of the best main stories i have seen in a open world  game second only to witcher 3 , but this game has a far better lore. The story touches upon drugs, gods, religion, racism , good and evil is always not as clear as it seems. As someone pointed out who is good guys here are you the good guy or are you helping some evil killing off the good , well that up  to you to decide , but in this game it isnt clear who the villain really is. Quests:  In this game compared to many games i have played i really feel like doing all the side quests, i feel i help the world in someway, makes it a better place. There are alot of different side quests, from assasination, fetching, clearing a tomb, steal something , persuade etc. The main quest is great and the side quests doesnt feel forced and you will probably on numerous times find out that you rather do the side quests then the main quests. Or like what happens to me alot i do a main quest then suddently i get to a new area were i get tons of new side quests, or some of the side quests i have that can be completed in the area or close to it. Some of the best quests i have seen in a long time. As i said previously only Witcher 3 comes close or surpass it.Atmosphere: The atmosphere is fantastic. Every city feels unique, almost every place feels unique. The landscape/ world is huge and you really feel like you are there , also because of the music. When it comes to the places you visit you got the huge place called Vivec , small towns like Balamora and Peligrad, different forts, a huge mushroom that alot of shops and homes is in. You can walk from a huge town then you suddently finda a field with steam or  you have come to a volcano. And the weather system needs to be mentioned too. It can go from bright daylight - to ash storms - to rainy nights. Music: The soundtrack is fantastic and really helps creating this fantastic world.Gameplay: Well lets starts with when you hit someone it use a dice based system and a variety of factors and it works. It will probably get smashed by today standards if developers did this in todays games, but if you get around the idea you will find a gameplay that is pretty great and still works al right today. The skill system is great, with major, minor and misc skills. Major and Minor skills levels up your overall level so you can have more strenght, luck , agilit etc Misc skills is just some skills that still will help you dont focus on them too much. Your skills depnds on the class.I will also like to add that the use journal and talk to the people to find the directions to a town or do a quest without any hand holding is great.You can enchant whatever you want with say  levitate, that makes you levitate as long as you want. You can make for some stupid reason that when you hit and enemy he will turn inviniclbe. You can enchant so you have more strength etc.The fast traveling in this game is pretty great, instead of what alot of todays game do that you simply click on a location you have visit previously and teleporting there for a magical reason you will in this game have to either use a mage guild, slit strider, use scrolls, boat or a  mark and spot with a spell then teleport you to that spot again later.So yeah its old school but adds to the exploration.Cons: As of my update as i have played tribunal and after reaching around 65+ hrs, i have encountered a lot more time falling trough the floor, inside buildings and so on, at the worst time i am stuck and have to teleport out. And yes you get some atletic or acrobatic xp but is still really tire some.I have also encountred a few crashes. Score is redone.So for me i rate this a 9.8/10Skyrim if you wonder 9.4/10One of the best open world game i have played.  Only witcher 3 , and fallout 2 comes close or even supass it.N.B: When i wrote my fallout 2 review or the one for deus ex i had hard time imagining that i would fine a new game that  i would enjoy this much on pc and this one did ( not going to be surprised if days of the tentacle, total war rome will be up there too,maybe the old gta`s too). Despite whatever flaws people find in this game i will still say is a masterpiece of a game.Review might be updated or rewritten when i am done with tribunal and bloodmoon. I have rewritten cons and the last paragraph of the gameplay.			"

												I was introduced to this game at an early age, I might have been 11 or 12 years old.  I remember how my mind kind of melted of the very idea of a open world, where you could walk around and do whatever you pleased. Most gamers can relate to those specific games that did not only changed our perspective toward games but maybe even played a part in forming your very personality. I have been a big fan of The Elder Scrolls since then, and Morrowind stays the favorite because of the nostalgia. The game itself is probably not Better than Oblivion or Skyrim, but for me that does not matter.The Elder Scrolls have really climbed since Arena, which was not a particularly good game compared to other old-school RPGs from the same age. Daggerfall was certainly an interesting game, with that HUGE world, but sadly randomly generated. Morrowind took a huge step from Daggerfall, going from 2D to 3D and I believe this is where the series really started its ""golden age"". When Oblivion was about to get released I purchased my first computer and built it just for that game thanks to the impact Morrowind had on me.As to be expected, Morrowind is a western fantasy RPG, and today The Elder Scrolls are the biggest western fantasy RPG series. The very idea of the genre is that you choose your own path, build your own character and create your own adventure. Often build around the Health, Mana and Stamina system, where you have these 3... ""elements"" to preform your attacks and movements. Depending on the class you choose and build, you focus on a specific one of these ""elements"" for your favor. A mage for example should prioritize to build up mana for his/hers spellcasting while the warrior focuses health for close combat. Morrowind is a very open RPG, very much old-school, where you literally can focus on anything and still make it through the game, something that has been restricted in modern RPGs, where its expected of you to choose less ""crazy"" builds.Morrowind is set on the island Vvardenfell in the province of Morrowind in the world known as Tamriel. A very harsh land with the Red Mountain, a volcano, in the middle shaping a very alien and hostile world. Each time I return to this game I feel unfamiliar every time, it is clear that the developers had this in mind for the world to appear strange and unique. It appears Bethesda are very fond of putting your character in imprisonment at the start of all of their games. I like the idea of rising up from the lowest of the low to become the hero, saviour and an ultimate killing machine. In Morrowind you are to become the Nerevar, the upriser of the Dunmer people and defender of Morrowind.I can not begin to express my love for this game, and I realize that newer players will find the game very clunky and hard in the beginning. The lack of support for higher resolutions and the overall outdated graphics will surely prevent this game to shine at this age. Even so, I feel that this game have so much backstory, and the gameplay will become very rewarding over time. Besides, there are thousands of mods for it these days, such as complete overhauls to make the game very up to standards. If you enjoy RPGs, especially western fantasy and The Elder Scrolls, then you should not hesitate to play Morrowind. You just have to get over it being old. "

												10/10This game was WAY ahead of it's time, and I think it still is. If you want an Elder Scrolls game that doesnt hold your hand, play the frist three. Also, my all time favorite game. Don't let the graphics get to you, Morrowind has way more to do than the newer games, and if you really want to make it that much like the newer ones, theirs more than likely a mod out there that will do it for you.

												""Morrowind"" dubbed ""#1 rose tinted glasses game of all time""I started playing morrowind at the ripe age of 5 years old. i would spend countless hours exploring the continent, talking to npcs and crafting my own story. morrowind was a foundation for my imagination. I have many fond memeories from this game, my homeboy Fargoth, Egg hat man, Nwah, Vivec, balmora, Toddtest, and the talking mudcrab just to name a few. the world is immersive with an interesting asthetic that had never been done before. The music is beautiful and will stay with you forever. This game is a true RPG, made before the times of catering to filthy casuals.The only thing i think is missing is a lack of playable dwarves (I know, the dwemer are basically dwarves).I am proud to say that this game instilled the strength of ""Firmcenter"" gaming within me.

												Morrowind has to be my favourite game of all time. Yes, it has crappy combat. Yes, it has sucky graphics. But if you can get past those flaws than you will immersive yourself in one of the most detailed and interesting fantasy worlds.(If the graphics still bother you, search for 'MGSO 3.0' on the morrowind nexus. MGSO will improve the graphics significantly)			"

												This game is honestly my favorite game ever. I used to have an xbox and i ASSURE you that i had over 200 hours into this amazing game. The story is perfect and it takes you into the shoes of a hero (not going to spoil the name) who needs to save tamriel from a threat on the center of Vvardenfell. The center of Vvardenfell (Red Mountain) is sealed of from everyone through the Ghostfence and it blocks all entering and leaving on Red Mountain. The only way to enter is to aactivate a pillar which every enemy in the game pretty much can't activate it unless they're human. Personally, I loved when I roamed around Vvardenfell doing quests for the Great Houses and doing Daedric quests. This game is also very capable when it comes to modding as most mods don't even need a script extender as there are so many scripts in this game at the start. The modding community is also very active and live and people still mod it and create mods to this day. Morrowind is a 10/10 and you will find yourself with a LOT of hours into this game. xdddd			"

												This game is fantastic. It's got that old RPG mechanic were you have to build your character up from scratch. Unlike most modern RPG's, the stats you start of with do actually affect how good you start off in the game. As you progress you slowly, feel yourself become more and more powerful. Which fits into the story of the game. If you find that the hardware or mechanics are to difficult to play or enjoy, just download a mod to fix that. There are mods likethat out there. This game is a little difficult to get into at first (especially if you played Skyrim or Oblivion like I did.) but if you push yourself to play more and more of this game, you will find it is probrably the best Elder Scrolls Game.

That Game Whatb You Must Play Before You DieThe Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindI player first time about at 2003 at my friend, where he usually been in Balmora as far as i remember.Since its a perfect game of course, i also wanted to play it. So i ask him for CD and then i started playing.Hard to tell, how this game makes your mind out, but this world really amazing. Hard to escape from to keyboard, because its catch you. The quests how written are simply wonderful and really changable. If you tried MMORPGs but you tired with them or just think they was boring, then you must try this game. I always hated MMORPGs, but i just love this game. And it has many plugins. Some years ago Morrohun Team released the translate for Morrowind so i can enjoy the story on Hungarian. I really love this game and i really prefer to everyone, who want to chill out. TWO WORD: MUST PLAY!If you need any questions just add me. I got lot of experience from the game. I already play it for 10 years. So i know lot of about it.I just ordered TES Anthology from USA some days ago, so i cant wait to get that box.  "

												-Went to rest at an inn because resting outside is illegal. I pay my 10 gold and climb into bed, at which point I was 'Awakened by a loud noise'. The loud noise turned out to be an assassin calmly entering the building through the front door three floors up. I fight the assassin in the middle of the bar, nobody seems keen to help me. In fact, they don't care at all about the two guys beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other right in front of them. I manage to kill the assassin, loot his stuff and leave his body on the floor of the inn to ward off any more assassination attempts. I return to my room to continue resting, hit use on my bed, only to discover that I don't own the bed anymore. Apparently the two minutes I spent in it before being interrupted was all I was allowed. The previously indifferent patrons of the bar all piled into the cupboard sized room to kill me, and I was hacked to bits. At which point the game crashed. Still awesome.			"

												The last in the Elder Scrolls series which requires thought to play.You must actually read to understand what is going on and how to get to places.Signs are your go-to for directions, NPCs will tell you general locations of thing relative to land marks, and there are no magical floating arrows anywhere.Main storyline is okay, though the side quests and fluff content is excellent.Game is designed with random hits/misses as its core, so the start can be tedious of flailing without results but does get better as you level your skills with the weapons.There was a competition to make a build that wasn't viable to beat the game with.It provided not a single build that couldn't work.Seriously if you can find a selection choice that makes you unable to beat the game, then post it somewhere and be praised for your insight.Graphical quality is definitely a factor for one's enjoyment if they're into that sort of thing.Its models are super low polygon counts, and the animations are very jerky.The weather effects actually aren't bad.Snow resembles snow and feels like snow when moving through it.The Sun has an accurate light blinding effect, and looks really bright compared to everything else.Rain is the worst of the effects but it gets the job done.  I feel it is a bit too line-stretchy rather than point-drops in appearance.You are able to become super powered at the end-game to the point of being a God without the requirements of using third party tools/cheats/mods.

												This is the best game I have ever played, and it's not because of nostalgia. In one week, it will be exactly a year since I started exploring the magical world of Morrowind. I love everything about this game: the quests, the music, the characters, the lore. The lore is some of the most fascinating I have ever seen in a video game, and trust me, it's a wild ride to discover. You shoud avoid spoilers at all costs, but look at this picture[img11.deviantart.net] before you begin your journey. It might not make sense at first, but the more you play, the more you will eventually understand :)That being said, this game is far from flawless by modern standards and requires a lot of patience to play. Here's my advice for all beginners: Turn down the difficulty. Combat is the worst part of this game, and for a new player, it's a living hell. Make sure you understand how to fight, then gradually increase the difficulty when the game is starting to feel easier. Talk to everyone. Morrowind will not hold your hand, and if you don't ask questions or listen to what people say, you will be completely lost. Save your game often, or it will be very irritating when you inevitably die and have to start your progress all over again. If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, read this.[en.uesp.net] Download the Morrowind Code Patch.[download.fliggerty.com] It's essential while playing, but abstain from downloading any other mods until you're farther into the game. If you hear battle music and can't figure out where the enemy is, look up.If you love The Elder Scrolls or old-school RPGs, give Morrowind a try! It's the most beautiful experience I ever had in a video game, and I highly recommend it at any price.			"

												I could truly go into detail about this game, but for now, I'll mostly just say it's a flawed gem or even a masterpiece depending on your opinion. The game has some very archaic features such as dice rolls determining your ability to hit enemies which means you can miss even if you have a high skill with the weapon, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be and you just have to learn to cope with it. However, this is a considerably unforgiving game overall. You have to be careful not to go off the beaten path too much as enemies don't scale in level the way they do in this game's successors. There are also diseases which can give nasty effects to your character such as debuffs potentially lasting until the disease is cured though it can easily be done with potions that you should always have on you.You also need to be sure you make good choices when it comes to creating your character so you can maximize your chances of survival and killing potential. It's probably best to select a predesigned class or even look online to get an idea of building your character effectively. This does NOT mean you have to follow them exactly and use cookie-cutter builds to succeed. They're just general rules of thumb which you can better understand with. This way you won't go around missing every swing and dying instantly to enemies. Quests take more attention than they do in successors because there's no compass pointing you to your objectives meaning you must read your journal to see the directions there which aren't always 100% accurate. While this can be confusing and you may just not enjoy it, it serves to better immerse you into the experience and encourage you to explore the surrounding areas of the quests.The last possibly negative things I'd like to mention are the various exploits and bugs. You should definitely install the fan made patches, that you can find online for free which should fix the majority of the bugs that would otherwise make it a terribly glitchy experience. As far as exploits, these can be avoided if you choose to and play the game normally, but from what I've heard, alchemy can really unbalance the game with things like flying above enemies and shooting them and buffing up to near invisibility. However, you might find this to be a fun aspect of the game. There are many other things to learn that I didn't cover like this such as disposition and fatigue so I'd encourage anyone to look up some information to guide you a bit where a manual might have if you had a physical copy. This won't take anything from the experience (depending on where you look), unless you're the type who likes to go into a game and figure everything out the hard way, and it will probably prevent a lot of frustration for a beginner. To talk about the good, I'm sure you could easily look online to find a cult following gushing about this game, but from my own experience, the reason I enjoy this the most in the series is it's complexity, depth, and thematically alien feeling. You can look up what makes this game comparatively deeper and complex than the others with things like each individual weapon type being a skill and how the many factions interact with you and each other, but I just want to mention the world. Morrowind is a very strange place compared to the other games and real life in general. The environment includes ashlands which are essentially barren shadows of past volcanic eruptions that have caused dry, dusty terrain with calderas mostly providing the only form of pass through the many impassable (without flying) mountains. There's also the 'West Gash Region' which is hard to describe, but definitely unusual. There are other places more familiar like the 'Bitter Coast' being swampland, more that I can't name that are grasslands, beach, shallow waterered areas with stones and land sticking up from it with giant thorn trees where flying wizards reside, a lake area with different plantation grounds where slaves work. Most of the biomes contain giant mushrooms which act as trees. There's even an island in the Northwest, provided in one of the expansions that come with this version where there are traditional forests, ice areas and snowy places. So Morrowind cetainly has the most various environments of the last three Elder Scrolls.The native npcs themselves where insect armor, ride giant insects to other areas, use large reptiles to serve as mules, have a strange religion featuring many of their own gods not seen in the other games, have cities on water and shun any 'outlanders'. There are also ash dwellers who live in tribes that celebrate the banned god Nerevar who acts as a central plot - point to the story. The story is compelling enough, but it's the presentation that makes it great. You don't know a lot of what's going on when you first get to Morrowind and you only find out through books, npcs who are reluctant to inform you, and other npcs who help further the plot along. It's a very mysterious game. Simply put, this game demands a lot from you, but it's extremely satisfying when you succeed and win the main quest, not to mention all the side quests and definitely rewards you for being invested in the story and lore which are truly deserving of the word 'fantasy'.

												Just finished this time on my first playthrough, haven't even started either of the two DLC. This game is fantastic, and I would recommend for any RPG fan.Pros:Good character creation systemFantastic main story, better than Skyrim'sOver a dozen factions, each with conflicting interests and interesting conflictsRacist DunmerNaked NordsEncourages running around and exploring, even forces you to explore world before starting the main storyComplicated political world, with three Great Houses vying for control of VvandenfellCons:Bad 2003 graphicsMany, many glitches. Console commands are useful for fixing said glitchesClunky combat. Worse than SkyrimOverall, one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It doesn't hold your hand and help you with things like quest markers and fast travel, you have to actually think for yourself. The end battle was thrilling, much more interesting than the stupid battle against Alduin in Sovngarde.			"

												Are you looking for an open world adventure that's non linear, challenging and hardcore to the max? Well then, I would reccommend The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It's a godlike as ♥♥♥♥ challenging experience with full of adventure and has really good music. It has the most addicting theme ever and it's always stuck in my head. The CRPG genre is pretty much dead and this game is one of the last of it's kind. Get this if you're not a casual babby that's looking for a game that will engross you for a very long time because this game will take A LOT of your time . I do have to say though this game is very strict with character classes so whatever you choose in the beginning, stick with it or you will have to start over because you ♥♥♥♥ed up your character. If Morrowind is not your cup of tea because of the diceroll system, other gameplay mechanics etc. Then I reccommend Oblivion. It's a little casualized and entry level but no where as near as Skyrim and felt more of a CRPG than Skyrim did.			"

												Have you played skyrim before this? Did you enjoy the hell out of it? This game may be too old school for you, purchase at your own risk. Did you play this before you played oblivion or Skyrim? What are you reading reviews for!? You should either have the game already or be buying it right now!To summarize what I love about this game- The setting- Navigation- Interesting quests and events- Ability to become insanely OP- Enemies that don't scale to your levelThe island of Vvardenfell remains my favourite landscape. Sure the graphics are dated. But, I still recall my astonishment as I exited the boat for the first time. The alien creatures, silt striders, Kwama, nix hounds and those damned cliff racers. The giant mushrooms, sandstorms and blizzards set the environment apart from other sandbox settings. Subtle animations such as your character shielding their face from the sand being tossed about in the storm bring the world to life.Questing in this game is quite different from modern rpg and sandbox games. No quest markers exist, at all. Your source of directions are the locals and those you provide you with the quests. Luckily your journal will log all conversations related to quests and topics. Need to remember how to get to Balmora? Open your journal and search under B, any important conversations about the place will be recalled for you to reread.I don't want to spoil the magic of this event just in case someone reads this, decides to purchase the game and is yet to experience it. But it is just north of Seyda Neen, along the path through the swamp. As another example, further of the track near Seyda Neen, the body of an Imperial tax collector can be found. Still with all his money. What do you do? that is your choice. Tell the guards? Keep the money for yourself? Track down the murderer? No quest markers means that the quest ends when you want it to (to a degree). Of course the true ending of this quest is to track down the murderer, but there is nothing to stop you from just looting the corpse and forgetting about the whole incident.I'll sum this point up quickly. Scrolls of Icarian Flight Fortify your acrobatics by 1,000 points, making your jump send you flying into the clouds. Without a levitate or slowfall spell the landing will kill you. These are a joke item. But you get the picture.Finally, the leveling in this game. This is not like modern elder scrolls games. In both Oblivion and Skyrim enemies would scale to your level. However, in Morrowind this does not occur. Early days exploring are best spent cautiously, some enemies will one hit you, should you get too comfortable exploring a Dwemer ruin.I should also mention combat. This could be a turn off for some. The best way to explain it is that everything is determined by die rolls. Trying to hack at a creature with your sword? What is your skill with a blade? Do you have enough stamina for the swing? What is the targets dexterity? This is all taken into account as you try to hit a target. So some of your attacks will appear to pass through the enemy, missing for no reason. So do I recommend this game? Yes, Absolutely. This game is a must buy (in my opinion) for any fan of rpgs. I'd like to think that anyone who's a fan of the elder scrolls series has played this game. I fear many may call it dated, and give the game a miss. There is much to appreciate in this game. If the animation and graphics are an issue for you there is an overhaul mod pack which adds much to the game, even at the cost to some of the original feel. But you can tweak it to be more faithful to the vanilla game.			"

												This is it: the greatest Elder Scrolls game ever.Ok, it doesn't look to great by today's standards (but there are TONS of mods to improve the graphics), and the combat system is pretty clumsy (although I love it) but the gameplay, the exploring, the freedom, and all the things you can do make this a game you'll gladly sink hundreds or thousands of hours into.  There's a lot more depth to this game than any of the Elder Scrolls games that have come since.I've probably spent a thousand hours playing Morrowind, and I still feel like I haven't seen it all (I haven't even spent much time on the two expansions).  In 2002 when Morrowind first came out on PC and Xbox, it was my life.  I loved the game so much I bought it for both systems.  My friends saw me playing it and several of them became addicts as well.  I was never turned off by the slow start or the difficulty in using your low level skills.  In fact, that was part of the fun for me - watching my character grow from someone who could hardly do ANYTHING in this world to a god-like juggernaut that could do ANYTHING in this world.  It's so satisfying, and much more satisfying than the character growth in any other game I've ever played, Elder Scrolls or not.The spell creation system, which is sadly missing from newer Elder Scroll games, is so fun to play around with.  If you have the skill and money you can mix ANY of the spells together for some fun effects.  And there are a LOT more spells in this game.  Some are a little pointless (I've never figured out the point of the ""Sound"" spell) but some are tons of fun.  Levitate is a blast.  See something up high you can't get to?  Just Levitate up to it!  And the Jump/Slow Fall combo of spells is great.  You can do an uber-powerful jump, quickly flying through the sky for miles (or more/less, depending on how powerful your spells are) and then slowly, gently fall back to earth.  There are more weapons/stats including medium armor, spears and crossbows (great fun).  There are more factions.  The standard Fighter/Mage/Thieves guilds are there, but there are also TWO Dark Brotherhood type guilds, the Imperial Legion, the Blades, two religious guilds, vampire guilds, and three ""House"" guilds (although if memory serves me, you can only join one house).  And there is a LOOOOONG main quest.  So when I saw there's hundreds of hours of gameplay here, I don't mean hundreds of hours of aimlessly wandering the world.  It's real, substantial gameplay.But the world of Morrowind is a world you'll WANT to spend hundreds of hours wandering.  It's exotic and different, espcially when compared to other Elder Scrolls games.  Giant mushroom trees may dot the landscape, some cities are built using the shells of huge craps, you're transported around the world in big bugs, wizards live in enormous plants, violent ashstorms darken the sky, animals or people disfigured by sickness attack you.  And around every corner you'll find something, such as large, bizarre looking Daedric temples; sunken ships or underwater caverns in the sea; or a lone farm in the wilderness.If you've enjoyed Skyrim or Oblivion, you HAVE to play this game.  If you hear people complain about the graphics or clunky combat, ignore them and just play this game.  If you haven't played Skyrim or Oblivion, you HAVE to play this game.  It may take a little while to get past the old look and feel of this game, but you WILL get past it and you'll find that the more time you invest in Morrowind, the more satisfying and rewarding it becomes.  You'll feel a sense of accomplishment when every single one of your sword blows hit your opponent and when you sucessfully cast your spells every time.  Don't give up out of frustration because the questing system doesn't show you EXACTLY where to go, or because you can't fast travel EVERYWHERE.  That's a purposeful design choice to encourage exploration, and it promotes the feeling of a huge, open world.  In short, you HAVE to play this game.  It's the most rewarding game I've ever played, and it probably will be for you too if you allow yourself to become immersed in it.			"

												As a later TES fan, you may find it hard to believe that someone who actually started with Skyrim has found Morrowind to be their favorite installment in the series. But the thing is, Morrowind has a particular charm to it, despite it being over eleven years old. There are several things I'd like to discuss about Morrowind and why you should ultimately buy it, whether you're new to the TES series, or are a die-hard fan screaming for nostalgia.I'd like to create some points with Morrowind discussing its values:1. Presentation2. Gameplay3. OverallReady? Let's begin.Point One: Presentation.At first glance, Morrowind shows its age with the early Embryo engine with skeletal animation, and an average of 800 x 600 display. Also noticable is how NPC's stay within a general area without eating, drinking, or sleeping (sounds like a serious insomnia epidemic, no?). But besides that, there's nothing really flawed about the graphics, and it's actually reminiscent of Oblivion's. This gives Morrowind a sense of familiarity to begin with. You start off the game with a cinematic intro, as you awaken on an Imperial prison ship that has docked on an Imperial colony, Seyda Neen. From there, you enter your name, choose your race, and once you enter the Commision Office, you are asked to choose your birthsign, favored attributes, and class. From there on, you are asked to deliver a message to a man named Caius, and thus your quest begins. Or at least, the main quest begins. Like other TES games, what you do there on out is up to you. Fight monsters and bandits, loot tombs and ruins, join guilds and political factions, basically what you'd expect from an open-world RPG. That said, the island of Vvardenfell is wonderful, given you can see it, with the render distance and all. Cities aren't closed in separate maps like they were in Oblivion and Skyrim, and the geography is very immersive as you walk around, looking for your objective or simply looking for a dungeon to pillage. As you walk around Vvardenfell, you will encounter strange creatures, such as the Nix-Hound, the Alit, the Netches, and the infamous Cliff Racer. Imagination was really put into these monsters, and some of them won't be so easy to kill. As for the islands residents, Vvardenfell is home to the Dunmer, the ash-skined elves you've seen in the later or earlier installments. Their culture is reminiscent to that of Asian and some tribal cultures, as they may live in the shells of ancient arthropods, adobe buildings, giant mushrooms, and nomadic tents. You will also find your typical Imperial stone structures, things you may yawn about. The in-game literature in Morrowind is very well-written, providing fictional stories to amuse you with, informative tips about the local governments, cities, and religion, and even books that hint on certain gameplay aspects such as vampirism. It truly is something to see the thought lingers in your head.  Point Two: GameplayAs for perhaps the most important aspect of any game, the gameplay element in Morrowind is quite different from the later installments ( and definitly Arena, but we aren't comparing.) The game offers a wide variety of skills to use, with various weapon types, from typical swords and warhammers, to spears and throwing stars, to crossbows and staves. There are also a wide variety of spells to use, from your average destruction and restoration spells, to teleportation, and even flying spells. Filed Soul Gems can be used on epuipment to enchant them, and an alchemy set can be used with flora, fauna, and even raw minerals to brew potions and poisons. Dialouge with NPCs is somewhat different, though, as they will communicate with text-based responses to the selected topic, and there are many things to talk about with NPCs. The thing about dialouge is despite these many topics, what they say is usually the same as everybody else. Copy-pasted, in fact, thus rendering many NPC void of real personality, unlike Oblivion and Skyrim. As for conflict with enemies, you may either hate it or simply don't care, as it works more like D&D role-playing games. Based on your skil with a certain weapon type, or the Agility attribute itself, you may miss an enemy point-blank while they take crackshots at you (though still able to miss.). Magic works similarly, as using less skilled magic type while tired out will usually result in failure to cast the spell. Aside from those questionable gameplay elements, however, there's still plenty to be had with Morrowind. You can't simply fast travel from the map so you could skip treking all the way to a destination, but rather you use public transportation, teleportation spells, and spells to increase your speed to move around Vvardenfell. Personally, this gave Morrowind a really huge look at the world map, even though it's only 10 square miles + 2-3 from the Bloodmoon expansion and about an additional one from Tribunal, compared to Cyrodill and Skyrim (16 square miles each) or even The Iilic Bay from Daggerfall, with a whopping 480,000 sqare miles (randomly generated though). Plus, you really got to know the geogrophy of Vvardenfell, as the game references landmarks and cities to help you navigate the world, all written in your little journal. Speaking of which, the journal system is probably the closest thing you'll have for a friend in this game ( besides Ahnassi, of course ). Quests and Topics are recorded on your journal with every indication. Viewing your journal is always very helpful if you've been sidetracked from looting dungeons or completing other side quests. That's not to say it isn't flawed, of course. Some quests give really bad direction and can be sometimes misleading. If you don't believe me, join House Redoran. This was really compensated in later installments with a quest marker, as a mere convinence. But don't let the gameplay issues deter you from purchasing this amazing title. Overall, the game function very well and even a late audience can find enjoyment out of it.Point Three: OverallMany thing can be said about Morrowind to criticize it. The fact that NPCs had nearly no personality at all, a cumbersome combat and magic system, and even some broken quests do hurt Morrowind a little bit. But despite these cons, Morrowind is uplifted with many pros. Its lore will fascinate you, the landscape will amaze you, and your impact on the game world will really matter here. You truly can be what you want, whether that be a noble knight, a malevolent mage, an infamous assassin, or a troublesome thief, Morrowind can provide.This game has been Dubb-approved			"

												A great game that holds up still after 14 years with unique mechanics, fresh gameplay, a huge and vibrant world filled with a huge variety of factions and NPCs that is the greatest in any vanilla Elder Scrolls Title (can't beat shivering isles). Personally my second favourite Elder Scrolls title after Oblivion.I'd recommend a buy for any Elder Scrolls fans and newcomers alike - this is a pinnacle of games.			"

One of the best PC RPG's ever!Introduction - I would have to start this by saying that first off this game is absolutely massive. There is simply put no other way to describe it in one word. The original Morrowind was my favorite Action Role Playing Game of all time so this upgrade ranks even higher on my list. The Morrowind legacy Grows.Gameplay - This is where The original Morrwind really shines, and Game of the Year edition improves on an already great formula. When you first begin the game you get to start by choosing one of ten races which include everything from the traditional humans, orcs and elves, to the more fantasy like races of the cat like Kajiit people, and the lizard like Argonians. From there you proceed to totally customize everything about your character, including looks, class birth sign, and much more. Each different class and attribute, has a large effect on the game, so playing as an elf mage is completely different than playing as an elf thief, or assassin. The birth signs also come with their own special powers, and weakness's as well so each one is worth trying at least once.When you're finally into the game things start off a bit slow. You run a couple of errands, collect a few stray items as the game walks you through the first little bit, but you soon realize that there is a freedom here that no other game has managed to get just right. Want that piece of armor you see lying there on someone's shelf? Grab it. Want that cool looking sword you see a guard carrying kill him and take it, but be prepared for consequences.Bethesda went to such great detail on this aspect, that almost every item in the game can be interacted with with great freedom. You can spend hours at a time simply decorating a house you've made your home base, and all items aren't simply decoration. Books are fully readable, herbs can be mixed into potions, crates, bags, and shelves can all be used for storage. Beds can be slept in, candles and lanterns can be placed in your home to light it, or carried along to light dark areas.As far as character development, it's extraordinary, and a bit overwhelming at the same time. Every single action you take has the possibility of increasing one or more skills. Even something so simple as walking or swimming will lead to a faster stronger character in the end. There are nearly limitless combinations in ways to grow your character, so long as you remember every thing you do affects you in some way.Fighting at first is a bit difficult until you increase in some skills a bit, but with practice you will soon be swinging axes, and casting spells with the best.There is also an option for a third person view if the first person is not your thing, but keep in mind that fighting is a bit more difficult like this because aiming becomes harder.Story- The story in Morrowind was great, in the game of the Year it simply gets better with two completely new areas to explore, the addition of the Werewolf, and lots more surprises that I won't speak of here. Needless to say it the Story in Game of the Year is greatly improved.Graphics/Sound - My only real complaint about the first Morrowind was the choppiness in the frame rate, and the awkward way in which it made characters move. Thankfully this has been greatly improved. Characters, and NPCs have a much more fluid look, and less robot-like appearance now. Another improvement is that there is much less fog now. Before it was used to cover pop-in, but now for the most part it is used to convey mood rather than cover up for the programmers.The sound and music are both fantastic. Each race has unique grunts groans, and dialect, they also speak with accents that seem proper for their race. The music has always been a favorite of mine in morrowind, and Game of the Year is no exception. It has that special way of making you feel as though you are really part of something special.Play Time/Replayability -This is really a harder one to judge. The play time simply put is as long as you want it to be. As far as a straight walkthrough you could spend anywhere from fifty hours to one hundred plus hours, depending on how many side quest you choose to do, and the rate at which you choose to develop your character.Replayability is without a doubt one of Game of the Years best features. As stated earlier each of the Races are completely unique, with there own strengths and weaknesses, add to that all the different classes, the birth signs, literally thousands of different combinations of ways to get through the game, and you have a mighty big game. That's not even mentioning the completely new quest that were added in the expansion.Final Recommendation -In conclusion I full-heartedly recommend anyone that has a PC, and even the slightest love of Role Playing Games pick Up this game. It will keep you immersed in it's world for no doubt hours at the time, and at only thirty bucks, you get a lot of added content over the original. I say that Morrowinds world is completely magic, and that's what games are supposed to be.			"

												I've never reviewed anything before, but I just wanted to write this to make sure that anybody thinking about purchasing this, does just that. I've played for a little over thirty hours so far and I've only done one quest in the main story in addition to barely exploring half of Vvardenfell. I love Oblivion and Skyrim and I thought I might as well try Morrowind. I'm very glad I did. Sure when you first get in the game you have to get past the original culture shock of early 2000's graphics and diceroll combat, but as you progress through the game the graphics actually grow on you to the point of them becoming charming. And as you level up skills in the combat tree, the dicerolls become less annoying and begin to hit nearly every time. Essentially, buy this game. Especially if it's on sale for $10 or less. Then, just give it a couple hours for you to settle in and I guarantee you won't regret it. Have fun and I hope you can enjoy this game as much as I have so far!			"

Think you're good at shooting with bows in Skyrim? Well think again! In this game you're not even gonna be able to hit a giant from 2 meters away even though your marksman level is 100! Nice isn't it?Used to the living god feeling of skyrim? This game will make you a little ♥♥♥♥♥ and you're gonna keep on crying until you think people will finally start to respect you for doing awesome stuff, well TOO BAD. Also, Try finding Gentleman Jim Stacey in Vivec.It took me 3 hours, Good luck.Seriously though, this game is so much fun.

												Pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series, ""Morrowind"" is far superior to ""Oblivion"" & even ""Skyrim"" due to the magic system, environment, & music.  It is one of the greatest games of all time... now, after perhaps the buggiest release of all time.  Much of the fun was in breaking the game, despite the issues.  The atmosphere was msimply too brilliant for one to be bothered.  Jeremy Soule's soundtrack is perhaps one of the greatest game musical compositions, if not one of all media's greatest scores, enrapturing one in the turmoil & beauty of the lands.  Listening to the music inspires one to adventure, making even the most mudane of tasks seem exciting.  Magic, similar to how the materia system of ""Final Fantasy VII"" is far better than 8, 9, or 10, thus the combination of all systems by ""Final Fantasy XI""; a pattern we are hoping to find in ""Elder Scrolls Online"" but as of yet have not.  If you prefer ""Skyrim"" it is because you prefer movies to games, and the illusion of power, as opposed to actual hard earned skill.  ""Skyrim"" holds the player's hand, ""Oblivion"" less so, but just as much guilt.  ""Morrowind"" is open-ended, free, & a true adventure that more oft than not is out to kill you.  What makes that great is all of the ways one could circumvent death, notably levitation & the godly acrobatics skill, letting the player eventually create their own god.  The progression from nothing prisoner to god-killer feels right, usually around 40-100 hours depending on play style.  You will get there if you try, no matter the path, & that's amazing.Few games allow for such versatile gameplay style.You must survive.  The Mods make this game epic, in the true sense of the word, with 1000s of miles and hours of player made content.  The plot of the regular world is incredible nonetheless, & the portrayal of power versus illusion is phenomenal.  The religious overtones are masks for the subversive nature of philisophical gnosticism...  This game will change you.   The lore is as real as ""FFXI"" yet more accessible, if more ethnocentric, most Pagans should find it refreshing to hear a proper rehashing of some of the more negative remnants of christian slander against witches & sorcerers.  Werewolves & Vampires make this game relavant to the popculture as ""Morrowind's"" lore is much more dependable than a lot of the garbage being floated around out there as vamp, or lycan, or fronts for far worse.  Be safe, kids.  A lot of this is real, a lot is fantasy, just remember this;  It doesn't matter if someone calls themself a Vampire, Werewolf, or any sort of dangerous humanoid if if they are a crazy psychopath whom believes enough that it simply doesn't matter what you think.  Worse still, they could be a crazy psychopathic monster... and what then?  Don't take chances.  Don't do Skooma, stay in school, & actually read all the lore in RPGs. Now go, Vagabond!  Mod those graphics & remember you are discovering a story with hidden ancient lore and arcane secrets woven within.  This is not merely a game, it is a tome of riddles with the promise of truth & magic trapped for the ignorant, enchanted for the wise.  Therein lay a treasure for the Hero to unbind & wield:  The Philosopher's Stone, coicidencia oppositorum.""Morrowind"" is the great American ARPG:  9.7/10- Found pipe, made Skooma, smoked... *Would Smoke again!* ...& again.

												I've played this more before it was available on Steam.  The only reason I ended up with a Steam Copy was that I bought the Anthology.This is the best Elder Scrolls game hands down.  You can levitate, the continent is huge, everything is a lot more freeform than Oblivion and Skyrim.  If you're worried about the 2003 graphics, just download the Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul mod pack and get your game looking better.  There's a ton more factions, more lore, more spells.  I would gladly trade voiced characters in the next installment for a deeper and more immersive experience like this is.The biggest gripe a lot of people have is the old dice system combat.  Every swing of a sword, cast of a spell, and shot of a bow is based on a roll to determine if it's successful.  It's only an issue at the beginning of the game, as your skills increase the dice roll will become less of an issue.If it's ever on sale, pick it up and give it a shot.			"

												You awake, prisoner?Because Irreverend Opinions is about to enter the province of Morrowind.---The BlurbA staggering quest of epic proportions, you begin as a vision-touched prisoner aboard a boat, sent from the capital of imperial Tamriel to the remote, swamp-and-desert island of Morrowind. An incredible journey of discovery, betrayal, deicide, vengeance, and conquest spreads out from there.Open world game with heavy RPG elements and storyline.The GoodVery well-polished game with the old ""Daggerfall"" Kirkbride lore touch, which is to say ""you can drown in the world's content"".  The plot is sublime, with hours of invested time needed to complete it, with epic proportions matched only by juggernauts of the gaming industry.  The engine allows for an incredible amount of flexibility and freedom - you can spend time to become any kind of character you would desire, and there are multiple paths to get to the final plot.Detail is given to pretty much everything in the game, and if you are a curious explorer, you can get lost in the environment.  Despite the outdated graphics by today's standards, the sheer level of content is overwhelming, and sets a standard that is sadly unmet since.  The musical score matches the scale of the setting, and fans of the game will instantly recognise the strains of Morrowind's soundtrack - along with the pang of longing that it will bring.Bethesda kept to it's normal tradition of making the game extremely moddable, and even supported the game well past the three expansions they released for it; more quests and equipment has been released officially[www.elderscrolls.com] simply to enhance the game that little bit more, and if you wish to mod it further with extra content, the Nexus[www.nexusmods.com] holds a lot of quality content.The BadThe UI is often confusing and convoluted*, with bizarre choices for default keys (E to jump, space to interact) and there is often a lack of explanation for terms and controls.  The melee interface is not intuitive, and for modern gamers will feel lacking for the effort you need to take.Modern players will be more than slightly turned off by the very aged graphics*, and the sound effects are somewhat lacking*.  The plot does not often leave much explanation for steps needing to be taken, which can leave confusion and frustration in it's wake.  Almost everything in the wilderness wants to kill you.As usual, Bethesda's game engine is less than stable; an official set of patches are available here[www.paulcarr.com.au], and here[www.nexusmods.com], to counter this.* Suggestions to alleviate this are listed below.The UglyCliff racers.  The begging elf in Tribunal.SuggestionsPlayers will likely want to download and install the unofficial patches[www.paulcarr.com.au], and the code patch[www.nexusmods.com], to stabilize the engine; then the Morrowind Sound & Graphics Overhaul[www.ornitocopter.net] to improve the quality of the UI, default sounds, and graphics somewhat.  Following that, the official content patches[www.elderscrolls.com] add extra content, and the Tamriel Rebuilt[www.nexusmods.com] project will add even more to the sandbox you have to roam in.After all of that, if you care to do some more modding, the game world is, proverbially, your oyster.The Summary9/10 for this one, simply because the sheer amount of content and effort they put in overcomes a good portion of the poor graphics, the bugs, and poor UI choices they made.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I first played Morrowind back in 2011 after having heard about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I was looking for TES games for the PS2 before I happened upon Morrowind and found to my excitement, it was on the Classic Xbox which I still have, and when I started playing it; I fell in love with it, the old 2002 graphics, the music, everything.Fast forward to 2016, my Xbox Classic is dying, Morrowind lags, the journal is massive and with my computer upgraded, I figured it was time to take a chance and see if Morrowind could run on my PC and it did, unsurprisingly, I bought it just two days before this review was posted and the game is still as fantastic as it was my first time.Just about every recommended review speaks for this game, I can hardly do Morrowind anymore justice with this review. It's beautiful. It is a masterpiece, a true example of what an RPG is all about. It holds up incredibly well, it deffinatly outshines Skyrim in some areas.The following pro's and con's concern newer players, but do contain a hint of my own personal feelings.Pros:Music - is crisp and beautiful, still has that same feeling of wonder and beauty as it did during my first playthrough, and definitely one of the games highlights.The gameplay - while dated with hit-or-miss combat (at low levels this is litteral), holds up very nicely, it's no Oblivion, and it's definitely no Skyrim.Unique Fauna - You get wild life in this game you can only get in ESO, unless you go to Solstheim with all the wolves, Bears, Spriggans and Draugr.Enchanting - is fantastic, you can set the power and radius of an enchantment, particularly on weapons (this is especially true when applied offensivly).Spells - are the same as Enchanting, who doesn't want to make a spell that can lower their immune system?Cons:Difficult to Mod - the Steam version of the game requires the dates on certain files to be changed in addition to a few other things before the game can be modded. More info on this can be found in some discussion threads, or online.Lack of official Plug-in/Add-on Content - Examples include Bitter Coast Sounds and The Siege at Fort Firemoth. I don't understand why Bethesda excluded it from the GOTY release at all, there are alternatives to obtaining these plug-ins, however, I've personally run into trouble getting them to work.Crash Closing - Game sometimes crashes when exiting, it's perfectly fine however, it does no damage to your saves. From what I understand, it was an issue with the original release, I believe the unofficial Morrowind coding patch fixes this. Combat - While not a problem for me, I can see it would be irking for players who came off of Skyrim. Hitting an opponant relies on the amount of fatigue you have and the amount of time you've put into the skill related to your weapon of choice. This can be particularly unfortunate if you are in a fist fight with an angry, loin cloth-clad Nord, low on fatigue, and terrible with your weapon of choice.Cliff-Racers - I would never change these guys for the world, they are perfect the way they are, though, they get annoying, fast! Especially if you are out in the Molag-Amur region and you've managed to attract seven of them without realising it, and as an added bonus you're level one with a dagger. These guys can be silent, and if not careful, deadly in a flock. Cliff-Racers are also subject to memes, look up a few, you'll see what I mean.On a side note, Cliff-Racers are a pro for me, but to newer players they may be more of a con than anything else.That's about all I can say really.The Game is fantastic, it is a product of its time, and perfect for it; and until Bethesda releases Arena and Daggerfall to Steam, it's a good place to start if you want to experience TES as we know it today, and it's a wonderful game to pick up if you're looking to escape the snowy climate of Skyrim, or the hilly terrain of Cyrodill. I deffinatly reccomend this game with gusto.			"

You can trade with merchants, including ones in the black market.You can join multiple guilds, houses and other factions and rise within their ranks.You can even create a wide variety of entirely new spells and brew potions.But, if a boar attacks you, chances are you'll be stunlocked until you die.10/10			"

												Technically, I have FAR more hours into this this game, but I decided to buy it on Steam when my disk stopped working.Basically, if you want Skyrim with less handholding, then this is for you. Just download some graphics mods and you're good to go.  MGSO made this game look better, and it got rid of a lot of bugs. I get bored easily, but I can play this game for hours at a time (when I have the time). A must have for your Steam library.Also no quest protected NPC's so be careful who you kill ;)In Skyrim, you start out stronger than almost everything. In Morrowind, you start out as one of the weakest things in the game, but by end-game you have ascended into godhood.			"

												Simpy put one of the last great RPG games where you actually have to spend some time to develop your character and where the game doesn't hold your hand and tell you where to go instead you have to find it yourself. For me it's the greatest RPG game ever made and that great atmosphere and lore are so interesting. Definately more interesting than Oblivion and Skyrim.			"

												I have been playing The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition for years now albeit a bit on and off. I predominantly spent my time playing it on the Xbox.Some say that it is a bit dated on the graphics front but you have to remember that this game is 12 years old. Despite this, however, I think as far as the graphics and the general game play goes it was way ahead of it's time.With Morrowind you really don't start with much and you really don't get a lot of help. The sheer fact that you have to work hard to get other characters in the game to like you enough to actually tell you anything worthwhile is gripping. You can join a whole host of different factions and this helps to build your character. As some factions do not like each other you can end up being slightly more disliked by one faction or race than another. Ultimately the games main story line never changes but the multitude of side quests is mind boggling and if you can't even be bothered with those you can spend an age just running around collecting valuable and rare items and increasing your stats to almost godly levelsThe animals: If you think that Dragons are bad my goodness you haven't met a Cliff Racer (Be mega wary of the diseased or blighted ones especially if you are a weaker character)Favourite 'Easter Egg': It has to be the Mudcrab Merchant. If you find this little guy make sure you have a Mark and Recall spell so you can find him again as he is situated on a tiny island in the middle of no-where. He is the richest merchant in the entire game Little tip: Listen to the music. The music is set to warn you of any impending danger. If you are being attacked it will change quickly, if you are going to be it will be more subtle (But don't be fooled sometimes the game likes to play the first few notes of the attack sequence music before launching into the normal calm outdoors music) I did write a slightly longer review originally but couldn't fit it all in. If you want that then let me know			"

												The Elder Scrolls series: Oblivion and Online are ok, Skyrim is pretty good, but THIS game is my RPG codifier. Slower, quieter, more subtle than it's succesors, you will find no demons falling out of the sky or dragons setting towns aflame in Morrowind. Instead, the land is threatened by a slowly encroaching volcanic wasteland, a disease spreading amongst the populace, and plots, upheaval, and assasinations amongst the ruling and religious bodies. There will be no setpiece battles in Morrowind; your enemies lurk in the darkest corners of the world and are content to wait for you there and work their plots from afar. It is a genuinely different and fascinating story.			"

												Ahh Morrowind is so close to home. You play as The Nerevarine as prophesied to defeat the Dagoth Ur, who have tapped into the power of an artefact known as the Heart of Lorkhan in a bid to exert control over the inhabitants of Morrowind. This game is set predominantly on the island of Vvardenfell, just off the coast of Stonefall, in northern Morrowind.Any hardcore Elder Scrolls fan would instantly feel at home with the rich characterisation, role-playing elements, visual details, soundtrack and the quintessential open-world environment. It is still the best of all the Elder Scrolls games, because of the magnitude of the game for its time and the back-to-basics approach in role-playing - tremendous storyline, realistic characterisation, interaction and progression.There are weaknesses to this game however, the UI is not particularly helpful to meta-gamers (c.f. Oblivion min-maxing), the journal system whilst improved in the expansion, is still rather cumbersome to navigate, the inherent 'block' in combat can be difficult to get used to for some, as is the one-mouse-button attack and finally the graphics - this is a 2002 game, but thankfully the modding community has made graphic enhancement addons that could be easily installed and used with the game.Overall, this game is a gem.

												Well here I am one year later. 185 hours and counting. I well only recently got back into Morrowind, I was being lazy and said to myself ""heyyyy dude you love this game right? Why not play it vanilla?"" and let me tell you my play through lasted an hour. I think the main reason no one can play vanilla Morrowind anymore is because the combat is frustrating and the graphics aren't what they used to be, oh and well you'll be very alone, no quest marker to hold your hand the entire way, how sad. Okay this game really isn't for everyone, I would say it's very much an acquired taste, like this doesn't hold your hand at all in fact if it had quest arrows it would lead you down the wrong road on purpose. Because Morrowind hates you and everyone in it hates you, but to me that the beauty of it,you are forced to work your way up slowly, you are forced to get people to like you and you are forced to figure everything out yourself and that is one of the things i like about Morrowind; It doesn't hold your hand and it trusts you to be intelligent enough to play it. Trust me this isn't for everyone it takes allot of getting used to. I really recommend some mods like accurate attack,a good graphics mod or texture pack and the code patch, because they will help your enjoyment of this game. Because there really is allot to enjoy such as: The world is huge, not in square miles but in the amount of things there are to do and find, there are so many cities,villages,dungeons and just intersting out of the ordinary stuff. The magic system like you can collect spell effects and make your own spells, you can do so much with it, and in what other game do you get to fly and turn invisible? I also really really just like the island of Vvardenfell like its so rich and detailed there is so much to it, its just so alien and unique that you just want to explore it, But you can't! Because when you start you are the weakest thing on the entire island and this world will put you in your place, and i really like that, you're just normal you're not the dragon born, you're just a normal entity on an island that really hates you and you really need to grind and exploit to become powerful, you really need to work for your power it isn't just handed to you.speaking of not being special, the story is amazing (to me at least) it's not quite ""you are a all powerful hero and the only one who can save the world! go beat up the pending doom and save the day!"" you're not special most of the later game is all about cheating the system being something you're clearly not. I'm not going to go too much into it because the story should be enjoyed not spoiled.I would recommend this to someone who can enjoy an old game, and who doesn't need it to hold their hand. Morrowind is a masterpiece even if it is subjectively so. It has many flaws yet many fixes and ways to work around these flaws. But it is also one of the most in depth and rich games i have ever played and there isn't quite anything like it out there. My opinion is best taken with a pinch of salt as is Morrowind taken with a bucket of patience.			"

												I spent my first couple of hours on the game and I am already hooked!When I started playing the game, I made it clear to myself that I am not to focus on the graphics here. I should see the beauty of Morrowind beyond the images displayed on my screen, and to my surprise I found more delight in the game than what I expected I will find.So far I can summarize few points to why this game is so good and people still favor it over Skyrim:1- The world of Morrowind is so magical and unlike anything you have seen. It will captivate you for sure.2- Music is simple and charming.3- Quests don't hold your hand with arrows and map markers. I had to find my way to Balmora myself following signs on the road. Nice!4- The amount of detail in each quest or NPC encounter is tremendous . There is more depth to the story and tasks you are performing.5- The game mixes simplicity with detail in an entertaining form.I will try to update this review as I play more of the game. But I am surely enjoying it beyond my expectations.			"

												First I would say this game has quite a learning curve. I would consider 30 hours a ""college try"". So If you're trying to get into the game it has some commitment to it.Pick your race, which has benefits/weaknesses, pick your major and minor skills, which decide how fast/slow you level and progress. Melee combat may seem dated but is a very complex system based on dice rolls factoring everything from your fatigue when you swing to the condition of your weapon before it calculates damage. Magic system is leagues above future titles(looking at you Skyrim) with thousands of spells that you can create. Tons of gear choices with 3 classes of armor and unarmored as well. Lots of skills, some of which are more rewarding than others. The game is less balanced than future titles but thats part of the charm.Quests and travel really set this game apart from most games. No hand holding here. You really have to read and comprehend your goals before you can set off acomplishing tasks. There is usually several ways to organically complete quest, for instance one of the first quest in the Thieves guild has you stealing a diamon from a local shopkeeper but you can just purchase it and lie to the guild when you turn in the quest.Graphics are the most dated part of this game, but there is good news. Its an Elder Scrolls title which of coarse means MODs! One in paticular called Morrowind Sound and Graphics Overhaul or MGSO for short is a complete package of graphical updates with loads of bug fixes added as well. The Installer for MGSO is fairly simple and I've recommended it to several people (including a 51 year old computer illiterate co worker) and they havent had any trouble installing it.I love Morrowind and recommend it fullheartedly. 9.9/10 "

This game is still as amazing as it ever was. From the opening beats of the theme music, the atmosphere will wrap around you like a blanket and never let go.This is the only game I have ever found myself just wandering around feeling like I'm 'there'. Its immersion comes from intricately-written storylines, a world full of enormous detail, and a complete lack of hand-holding. Unlike Oblivion, there are no quest markers to follow. If you get lost, you get lost. And wow, will you enjoy getting lost. Everywhere you turn there is something new to see - sweeping landscapes, towering mountains, bubbling lava pools and farming country all await. Even just exploring the little islands that dot the map is an exciting pastime, almost a quest in itself.If you prefer completing quests and bashing things there is plenty of that as well. Tribunal and Bloodmoon, the expansions in the GOTY edition, have a LOT of bashing things. Be warned: the bashing things mechanic is actually done on dice rolls, and not direct fighting mechanics. This means that to begin with you may not be bashing things as successfully as you might like.The magic system is great. Shooting fireballs into the deep night sky from the top of a hill is one of my favourite things...but then so is zapping necromancers with massive explosions, so there is something for everyone.The graphics were impressive for 2002 and I remember being blown away back then, particuarly by the water effects ('Yay, I've got the right shader model!'). However, if you choose it, the modding community has transformed the visuals into a spectacular world which is faithful to the original whilst taking advantage of modern-day technology.If you really want to live in the world - which you will - you can also add fishing, food and crafting mods and never touch an official quest.I go back to this game again...and again...and again. It kept me up until the early hours of the morning when it first came out. It's my go-to game when my internet access fails. The Prima guide was bedtime reading for weeks (don't do this until you have thoroughly explored for yourself, however - 'thoroughly' meaning 'for years').And then there's the musical score... Don't be in any doubt about whether to buy this. I'm not even much of a fantasy games-type person, but this is less of a fantasy game and more of a living, breathing, utterly believable world in which your role is as important or as minor as you want it to be.Whether camping around the coast, catching fish for dinner and sitting by the fire, or engaging in huge battles with a big sword, worrying about your levelling and never bothering to sleep, you will eventually love Morrowind more than anything else in your collection. If Bethesda ever manages to capture this feeling in a game again I will be the happiest woman alive...			"

												Morrowind is a pinnacle in the Elder Scrolls series, it was a massive advancement on Daggerfall, with it's incorporation of proper 3D, and benefited from the development of the smaller gaming region by focusing on the island of Vvardenfell. In typical Elder Scrolls style the primary narrative is fairly formulaic revolving around the prophecy of the Nerevarine, but where it deviates is the impact that this has not only on the religious aspects of the world, a part of prophecy that is not often explored in fantasy narratives but also on the wider political spectrum of Tamriel, what if Akulakhan had truly awoken?Morrowind more than its sequels allowed players to truly delve into the depths and world building of the Elder Scrolls universe, yet still offered a decent leveling system, combined with it's simplistic conflict mechanics. On this level, as a game to be interacted with Morrowind required much improvement, partially done by modders that covered over and developed the game in directions the smaller group of original developers would never have managed.Morrowind is still an excellent game if you want to truly explore a fantasy environment that is utterly unique, and become immersed and explore an alien world, with skills and abilities that far surpass those offered to players in earlier and later Elder Scrolls games. Although not as technically accomplished as its sequels, Morrowind more than excels them in its vibrant and diverse world.			"

												Morrowind is the best game I have seen. Being a 13 year old gamer, I must say I would perfer this over Oblivion and Skyrim. The story and the game itself makes you feel like your actually there. Instead of getting everything you need at the start, you have to work for it. That's what I love about this game. It gives you a sense of accomplishment, that you actually deserve  what you got. When I first started playing, I was a bit annoyed about the graphics. But as I contiuned on, I noticed that the game didn't need good graphics. The quality of the content made up for it. The content was the most entertaing I have seen. It made me feel I actually did a QUEST and not some, ""Oh hey! didn't I do the SAME EXACT type of quest earlier?"" What I am saying is that the game did not have very many repetitive quests. I could go on for ever, but in the long run I absoulty would recommend this game!			"

												Unlike the newer two iterations of the Elder Scrolls, Morrowind is a role-playing game, not an action adventure. Player choice and character skill is what matters. In Skyrim and Oblivion, progress in the game is controlled by point-and-click combat and mini games where player skill is what matters. In Morrowind, the skill of a character is what matters, with hidden dice rolls and comparisons controlling successes and failures.Some will complain that the combat is clunky, and that they hate missing a rat 20 times and dying as a result. But if you have a skill of 5 in short blade, why are you using a dagger? Building or picking a class, allocating attribute points correctly, and choosing a logical strategy for your character is what makes this game so much different from Skyrim, where anyone can cast spells, swing swords, and sneak with extreme proficiency.By making you start off small, learn and mold your character's strengths and weaknesses, and lick the boots of every NPC around you, Morrowind lets you grow from a worthless, scummy, ex-con n'wah to the all powerful, well respected Nerevar Incarnate.

 ""Each event is preceded by Prophecy, but without the hero, there is no Event"" - Zurin ArctusThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind was a bold and brave step for Bethesda, finally coming out of the world of 2D and into the 3D. The 2001 game takes you to the land of Vvardenfell, where your actions and decisions will impact the face of the land forever.Everytime you start a new game, you definitely feel like you're in the world, interacting with all the people you encounter on your journey. The immersion value increases when you install the Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul (MGSO), but the vanilla experience is the way to go.I always come back to play Morrowind at least once a year, and find myself stuck in the land of Vvardenfell again and again, and I would recommend any fan of the Elder Scrolls to enjoy this experience.

												One of, if not the best TES game there is (my personal favorite is still Daggerfall)Pros:-Good story-Quests are usually interesting and have great dialogue (and there are quite a lot of humorous ones)-Tons of lootable items-You can use candles inplace of torches, even lanterns and some other light sources-Combat can be confusing, but rewarding when you work towards improving your character-Very atmospheric, even for a dated engine with dated graphics -Cool large world to explore, one of the more unique locations of the TES series-Complex mechanics (this could also fall under cons for younger audiences, but it's a pro to vets)-Interesting characters (that walk like they have to take a ♥♥♥♥ :-P)-Very open ended world, you can flat out fail the main storyline by killing important NPCs-Very rewarding character progression. Go from a physically disabled manbaby, to a God far greater than mr. Dragonborn-Pretty modular armor system. Less so than Daggerfall, moreso than Oblivion and Skyrim-Cliff Racers-Tons of skills to help evolve your character-more stuff that I should probably add hereCons:-Cliff Racers-Out dated engine-Hard to look at graphics and models (although the world is still somehow beautiful)-Combat is very RNG heavy (Progressing weapon skills lowers this)-Sometimes confusing quest locations (I personally very rarely get lost, but sometimes a quest cave isn't exactly where you're told)-Hard to get into for younger audiences (The learning curve plus the ancient combat may turn most people away)All in all a solid 9/10 RPG.A tip I'll give to newcomers; your starting weapon skill MATTERS. Going with Long sword skill but not Short sword, matters. You most likely will get the ♥♥♥♥ beaten out of you by those pillow noming rats if you go in with a weapon you didn't set for you to be skilled in. If you end up wanting to level different weapon skills, practice on lower level enemies slightly later on, it'll make it less of a headache. Or shell out ♥♥♥♥♥ons of gold to the dedicated trainers (gold is pretty easy to get imo, an armor set from a specific someone that tries to tickle you from your sleep is a good way to make early money. Unless you want to use it, of course.)I urge anyone interested to try this game. Try to get through the first few hours, you'll thank yourself. It's brutal early on, but once your skills come along, the game is very enjoyable. Most of the negative reviews are from people that don't have the patience for the early game. Trust me, as someone who falls under the younger generation, it IS worth it.			"

												This game was the greated of its year. I remember being so awed and impressed. Dont get me wrong! I still love going back and playing it again, but the glaring flaws are much more obvious now. I can't imagine playing it again without the community patch. If you let yourself actually read the dialogue you can fall completly into the storyline.I got so invested in my great house (Telvanni) back when I originally played, but this time I had trouble getting into it again because I skipped a bunch of dialogue.

												An adventure filled with mispronouncing each name and word, opening your journal every second to verify you're going the right direction, blistered feet, and everybody bullying you into fixing your outlander-ness. I have kissed lonely old men and watched as caravaners steadily fell from their platforms due to how much of a fetcher I was. I have even helped secure a man's underpants.These are the things you will experience in this beautiful game, a world where everybody hates each other but they hate you more.			"

												I might be a bit blinded by nostilgia when saying this, but honestly, this is my favorite of all 5 of the elder scroll's games, heres why.The characters in the game all feel slightly diffrent and for a game of its time it still holds up well, the graphics arnt nearly as bad as they seem and honestly hold no regaurd in the game quality because it was made 10 years before skyrim.The combat can be a chanlenge as it is all chance based on weather or not your attack will land, this is, of course, based on the level of a skill, which caps out at 100. You will run slow as hell at the start, but rather then in skyrim where you can beat the whole game in one sitting if your fast enough and know enough about the game and where to find things this game FORCES you to grind out levels and get really good gear, build a reputation, make allies, and basicly unite a whole province in order to battle a huge threat to tamriel.Before the end of the main story your treated as a outlander, A random person who just appeared on the shoars of morrowind and should be treated as nothing more. But by the end, your treated as a god, the saviour of all the land, hero of the people, and slayer of demond's, and thus people like you more, adding yet another layer of complexity that skyrim wont offer you.Over all this is game you just have to sit down, put some headphone's in, close the blinds and experince for yourself, no words can discribe first setting out into the land of morrowind.Other then ""wow, this looks beutiful"" and ""WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ AM I GOING!""

												Morrowind is something special, something different. Imagine three times the quests and content of Skyrim compressed into one small island, with so much lore and depth that you can lose yourself for hours and hours. Sure, it isn't a really pretty game, but slap MGSO on it and you've got an astonishingly good looking game to complement it's other aspects. You see, in Skyrim you find out you are dragonborn... cool! Yes, that means you get to incinerate people, make them fly off of cliffs etc. In Morrowind though, you start off as almost weaker than mudcrabs, but become a GOD by the end of the game, quite literally. Feel like flying around the whole map without even needing console commands? Go ahead. Want to jump like a super hero from Seyda Neen to Balmora? Do it! Kill the end game boss in one hit? Yes, you can do that. The possibilities are endless, and even though all of the above is true, that doesn't mean you're the strongest thing around, there are still monsters that are quite dangerous even in the late game, see what's different between newer entries and Morrowind? Yes, FREEDOM, to become whatever you like. Now, Morrowind isn't perfect, but it's probably the best game in the series. These days, even though it has aged well enough, it can be very difficult to get into, and since you are thrown instantly into a massive world with only a small dagger, quite confusing. But don't give up. Keep playing, and you could turn your 3 hours of frustration into your 300 hour playthrough of the best game experience you've ever had.So I don't think I need to tell you how much I recommend this game. But as I said, it's not without flaws, it's simply that the strong points make it so amazing that you won't need to worry about the flaws. I think there is something in this game for everyone, and it's an experience that can't be missed. Grab it in the christmas sale (it's almost always on sale then), grab MGSO, also known as Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul, and make sure your body is ready for one of the best PC games ever made. Have fun!			"

												Yes this is the best Elder Scrolls game! Thank you, because it is much better than Skyrim or Oblivion. All are good, but Morrowind is the divine roast beef among fast food cheeseburgers. The gameplay is excellent, and requires specialization in order to perform well. This contrasts with the other games, which try to tie all of the weapon classes together and kinda make everything simple and boring. Exploration and world design are oh so beautiful, and travelling around Vivec completing various guild quests fills me with a special feeling. Wow. MMMMM. OH YEAH. Even though I've put less hours into this game, I never got that in the rest of the series. Instead I just had the desire to get to the next objective as quickly as possible. I find that experiencing the world is better than teleporting through it.I also almost passed out today.			"

												Morrowind in my opinion is the best installment in the Elder Scrolls series so far. The amount of content and freedom the game offers you is insane. It's the type of game that doesn't tend to hold your hand, but give it a chance and the game will open itself up to you and you'll soon find yourself sucked in to it's world.The graphics and battle system may be a little too outdated for some, but because of the games awesome modding community, there's a variety of mods you can choose from to improve your experience (i recommend Morrowind Overhaul).The best thing about this game is that YOU choose how you want to play. Boasting a huge open world, hundreds of quests, a variety of races and classes to choose from, you'll never run out of things to do.I invite you to give this game a try, for the amount of content you get in game, it's definitely worth the asking price.

												Original review:""No time to explain, n'wah, buy the game! ♥♥♥♥, that cliff rider is coming, bai!""Maybe back in the days when I wrote that review, it was just an inside joke, a horror and nightmare that people who have played or heard of Morrowind would only get. Looking at it now, maybe it's a bit unfair to leave it as it is, especially considering how I feel about Morrowind and how much time I've spent on it, long before I got it on Steam.ForewordMorrowind....It'd be hard to capture everything about the game, and it'd be twice as hard to put it into words, but I can at least try, not just for my own satisfaction but for every possible person that might come across this review and actually stop to read it.Morrowind.The third game in The Elder Scrolls series, released back in the distant 2002. A lot of words could be used to describe it, for me personally it'd be just one - fascinating. For me personally, Morrowind is the kind of game that years later, playing Skyrim, I realized how much it has affected me - I'd always compare Skyrim and its mechanics and story to Morrowind; many people may not find it fair, but it's deep within me, and I'm sure that many people who feel about Morrowind the same way have done it, more than once. I also admit I teared up twice - once when I realized that the Morrowind main theme is incorporated within the Skyrim OST and once when I got to visit Solstheim... The latter one, especially, woke up a deep feeling of nostalgia, turning the camera around and looking at the Red Mountain, wishing I could just jump on that boat and set foot there once again.. set foot back home.You see, Morrowind is a masterpiece, not only one of its time, but a masterpiece that will stick along for years... It's no lie that it's old now. It is, indeed, and its graphics might not be as welcoming as they used to be back then, but the world and story it has to offer, it's something I'm yet to find in another game.But enough fuzzy warm feeling of nostalgia, let me tell you why I believe this would probably remain one of the games that I'll always come back to...What is MorrowindMorrowind is a timeless RPG, one that will take years for others to catch up on. While some may disagree, I believe everything from the details of the atmosphere of the game, through the sandbox mechanics that allow you and encourage you to do everything you think of, all the way to the combat system that I've seen people complaining about, all this is polished nearly to perfection.Morrowind is unforgiving, it won't hold your hand, it won't tell you what to do, it won't make things easy for you. It's a combination of detailed conversations, exploration and thought that is required to reach your goals. One wrong turn along the way and you'll find yourself in a cave full of Daedras, and if you manage to overcome the odds, your reward will be there waiting for you.Morrowind will make your imagination go nuts. You want to be a deadly wizard, using spells no one has ever heard of, well then, be one! You want to be the most powerful being walking this earth, Gods' demise, unmatched by no power, divine or mortal? Be one! You are allowed to do nearly everything in it, you just need to find your way to do it.Morrowind is frustration, trust me, not once or twice you'll walk into enemies severely overpowered than you are and they will kill you, over and over and over again. Cliff racers will haunt your dreams and mudcrabs will give you the most challenging fights you've ever experienced... Maybe except for that ebony beggar dude, ♥♥♥♥ that guy seriously.Morrowind is the land where you are no one. Brace yourself for being treated and called any kinds of names, from the popular 'outlander' to the so annoying 'scum'. Question is, would that break you or would you reclaim the destiny of the Nerevarine, Protector of Morrowind?Morrowind is .... perfect, in its imperfection.Closing wordsI doubt I'd ever be even close to properly reviewing this game. I doubt I'd ever be close to being one of those fellas that know every tiny bit of detail around its story and lore, I doubt that I'd ever be able to even explore its world and gameplay fully just because of how huge it is.... but I'm sure of one thing - that I'll always shiver and tear up a bit every time I hear:""Wake up... Stand up.. There you go. You were dreaming, what's your name?"" "

												Everyone has that game they play through once or twice a year. It never gets old, bubbles with nostalgia and each play through seemingly gets better. While games are released that just simply will never come close to the depth this game has to offer, be safe in the knowledge this game is still worth £20.Dont expect stunning graphics.Dont expect a game that plays for you and holds your hand.Dont expect an intuitive and user friendly journal system! Pull out a pad of a4 lined paper, equip your most reliable pen, pour coffee all night long as you indulge in one of RPG's most timeless stories. Struggle to stab up a mudcrab, struggle to afford anything, truely work towards understanding the system of magic and combat, and prevail, the lord of some dusty island the Dark Elves love so much.11/10, would work for a shirtless Caius Cosades again.

												I have been WAITING FOR THISThis has straight up been my favourite game for as long as I can remember. I don't know when I first started, I must've been 6-7 years old, but the game, the sounds, the world design, the characters, the character menu (oh it had a beautiful inventory menu) was amazing.The thing that really stands out to me is the story. This game delivered such a cult-like/biblical story that you've got to be surprised that any human actually wrote this. The lore behind Morrowind and the Mer has go to be the very best of any Elder Scrolls ever. So the game may take you a while to play and level up, but this game is very much like reading a book. It's long, but so much better than other games.I'm not gonna recommend to anyone if they don't like older games or if they're not patient and want to just jump into some action - I'm calling those who actually appreciate a masterpiece when they find one.

												After hearing about this game from a handful of my friends, I decided to pick it up and give it a shot. Immediately I was fully invested in everything about it - the 80s artstyle, the incredible soundtrack, the fast-paced and gorey action, absolutely everything about this game kept me coming back for more. The weakest link of the game is really the narrative, however I excuse the game because it doesn't really need one nor have we been kept from the full story since the release of the sequel. Although unique, this game is something I can recommend to anyone. It's definitely worth picking it up, especially if you can get it during a sale. It's most certainly worth playing. Go buy it			"

													When I got this game, I thought it was terrible. I thought that my game was bugged because I was getting point blank misses. Now, however, this is my favorite game of all time. Though it was a hard start, I can tell you why this game is so amazing.	You start the game extremely underpowered, with a set of terrible clothes, a dagger, 87 gold and, if you are smart. some extra trinkets to sell and a terrible lockpick.	I would also like to note that this is a hardcore RPG with a few action concepts, such as real time combat. However, much of the game is based on your character's skill, not your skill. So, if you have a bad short blade skill, you will get at least 9 out of 10 hits as a miss. In fact, I would even argue that this game and skyrim (I have played both) can be classified into different subgenres because of the differences.	Later in the game, it is the opposite of the beginning. You become an unbeatable god. It is the greatest feeling I have ever had in a game. This is why I reccomend this game.	One more thing to add. If you are considering buying goat simulator, this game can simulate the feeling of goat simulator with console commands. Add these commands and start punching people:player-> setacrobatics 300player-> setathletics 2000player-> sethandtohand 3000player-> sethealth 9999999999player-> setstrengh 999999 "

												After beating Skyrim and putting lots of hours into it I loved it. So I thought I would try to beat the older games and I just beat Morrowind recently, all I can say is that I loved it! THE GOOD STUFF:The world is looks beautiful (even better with mods), theres alot of cool weapons and armour types, lots of scary enemies and cool ones and the main antagonist is awsome. You can even go to Solstheim and do lots of cool stuff there that is also there in the Skyrim version of Solstheim. There is alot more good things but its hard to say them without spoiling it so go check for yourself.THE BAD STUFF:Only few bad things was I didn't like was combat, its like rolling a dice or something to hit the enemy so if you have bad stats you will miss alot, BUT if you take time to level your stats up or go to trainers for your skills you will rarely miss, unless someone casts spells to lower your stats or you fight an enemy with high luck/agility. Ranged combat sucks even more if its not leveled up high enough, you will waste so much arrows but it does make some fights easier. Another kinda bad thing is the game is really slow compaired to the other games but you can make potions and spells or find enchanted items to make you move faster.I reccomend this game if you love difficult RPGs and Elder Scrolls, with a few mods you can fix up all the problems and have lots of fun!

Dealt moon-crack to a thundercat, drank bug juice with a little goblin man, found drugs in my spymaster's house. Defeated evil demon man with a knife and a hammer. Smashed the dark elf yakuza. Became a vampire, became  a werewolf, became anything. Spent days reading books. Made a wall with pillows, not enough adderall or autism to make a fort. Killed everybody with a giant fire/ice/lightning/poison missile spell. Broke the game with mods, removed the mods, went full retard with console commands, broke the game with console commands, modded some more. Decorated houses for days. Murdered people for houses. Decorated houses with drugs and skulls and candles. Became an assassin. Became a noble knight. Became Abraham Lincoln: Dark Elf Slayer. Trapped everything's soul. Punched naked guys to death. Ate ghost goo. Ate glass. Ate crab meat. Ate mud. Ate everything. Made potions, picked locks. Went to the strip club, went to the temple, went to the mountain. Mis-matched all my armor, wore a dress, wore nothing, wore a glass helmet. Wore everything. Played as an elf, a lizard, a cat, and a frenchman. Played everything.

												This game still stands as the most nostaglic game within the Elder Scrolls franchise sure some say Oblivion is that nostalgic game...but to be honest i count this one without the fast travel system and a lot of things that will eventually come to in it's sequals this game feels like an immersive RPG game while sure the walking mechanics and the journal system might be clunky in the end though when comparing Morrowind to Skyirm you can truly see how far the franchise has come fromGreat World, NPCs, quests, and locations, amazing storyline and baddies to slay 10/10 if you love immersive RPG's get Morrowind and add it to your collection			"

												Great RPG. The Elder Scrolls series is amazing and the modern iterations owe tribute to Morrowind. This game has an old charm as well as the depth that can't be found in many new titles. Interesting characters, an interesting story, and rewarding exploration make the experience one of a kind.For new players, Morrowind can be daunting and confusing, but with a little time and effort it quickly becomes manageable and also becomes a refreshing RPG experience. There is little hand holding and explicit direction, but this is what gives Morrowind its unique charm.			"

												The Elder Scrolls lll: Morrowind is acknowledged by many TES fans as the best game in the series. It has a few features which other Elder Scrolls games failed to accomplish. The ability to kill every single npc in the game you want, regardless if it's part of a quest or not; The lack of quest markers and instead having to rely on directions and your common sense; The privilege of taking any house you want and call it your own. Not only that: the world feels completely different. It's not your average fantasy game filled with unicorns and dragons, instead the game throws more unique creatures at you: Kwama's, Nix-Hound's, Netches, Ogrim's, Kagouti just to name a few. Combat Some people hate it. Others love it. It depends on how you look at it. While in combat hitting someone does not necessarily mean it actually hits. Lots of factors play a role in this, such as the amount of stamina you have, how skilled you are in the weapon category (daggers, spears, longswords etc) and your agility attribute. If these parameters are high enough the game makes it count as a hit. The more you use a weapon in a certain category the more skilled you will become and thus essentially making you hit your target more often. This however also means you cannot easily switch from weapon to weapon. If your skill in daggers is 90 and you found an axe which does approximately 10 more damage than your current weapon it might be a better idea to stick with your dagger and move on as your low skill in axes might put you at a disadvantage. Exploration Exploring is extremely rewarding. There's always something cool and new to discover such as finding a wood elf plummeting to his death who carries the infamous scrolls of icarian flight which allows you to jump tremendous distances. Or who could have known the legendary dragon bone cuirass is locked away in a closet on a random island in the middle of nowhere? You will never know what treasures and garbage a cave has hidden. Quests As mentioned above there are no quest markers present in Morrowind. Instead you will need to rely on your brain and directions given by npc's. Quest items can also be freely sold to any merchant even though this may mean permanently breaking the entire quest once the merchant has stocked up on different wares.			"

												I think a video game succeeds when it can immserse its players into its world.Morrowind does that, and it does it great.I've found myself lost within Morrowind's world several times, exploring every nook and cranny of Vvardenfell, talking to every NPC I can, learning more about Vvardenfell and its lore, and of course, killing monsters!The story in this game for me is much better than the story in Oblivion or Skyrim, to sum it up you're POSSIBLY the reincarnate of the badass Lord Nerevar and you are on a quest to save Morrowind from the ash blight storms. (and Dagoth Ur, remember that place from Arena?)It's amazing how you start as such a lowly and disgusting outlander, then you start to hone your abilities and stay true to who you're loyal to, and then you have the power to do anything you want! Then you're an invincible demi-god with 1000 acrobatics EASILY jumping across and around the whole map. The game for me is about the freedom to do anything, anywhere. The only limitations are the hardware and the engine, so go frickin' nuts.Though the game DOES have its flaws.-  RNG based combat (dice rolls) Excusable though, seeing how this is an RPG. Just seems odd to have RNG based combat in a game like this though.-  Uninteresting NPCs and boring towns-  Bugs.. Every (especially Bethesda) game has these though.Regarding the combat, I don't think combat has ever been good in an Elder Scroll game, especially the swing your mouse at the enemy type of combat in Arena in Daggerfall. The combat is this game fortunately doesn't depend on swinging your mouse like a madman (and RNG!).. but instead is dependent on dice rolls(same thing). The game takes every possible factor from how much fatigue you have to how far your enemy to your agility to your weapon skills is to determine whether you'll hit or miss. Your skill with a weapon also determines your chance to hit with that type of weapon, for example, you're more likely to hit enemies with Spear 100 then Spear 25 while using a spear.Despite its minor and/or major flaws, these can be fixed, and Morrowind still remains as a masterpiece that can never be replicated, which is why people are STILL playing the game in 2014, and why I'll still be playing in 2015.

												I owned the game on disks for years. Never touched em. Always wanted to.Then one day I got this craving to look into it. I saw a video on youtube about ""why you should play Morrowind in 2015"" and it made me want the game so mcuh I cried a little. So I got the game. And modded the ♥♥♥♥ outta it! Jesus... my game looks so good now and has so many cool new features. I actually really enjoy the fact combat is treated like dice rolls (but far far far more complex... actually the game is so complex it would be a nightmare to actually write out the formulas for a good 1 vs 1 fight). I love Skyrim. I love Oblivion. I love New Vegas. I love Morrowind. Each of these are so different in their own way but to me they all end up being a tie. Plus the fact there are so many amazing mods for each of these games.If you grew up playing pen and paper RPGs like I did, you enjoy reading in your video games, you enjoy old skool progression (start out weak as heck and end up super over powered) and you want a completely amazing new experience... then this is your game. You'll wanna mod it though. Holy poop does it look horrible without a facelift!5/5 because... Bethesda			"

												With this purchase on Steam, I have now bought Morrowind four separate times. It's plenty easy to be turned off by its dated graphics and interface, but if you stick with it, you'll find a real gem of a game. As much as I like Oblivion and Skyrim, they both feel like they've gone through a streamlining process that left them as much more generic fantasy worlds. Morrowind has a lot of character that its sequels lose, and provides the player with many more options than they have in Oblivion and even Skyrim. If you're a fan of the series, Morrowind is a must play game, and since it's a Bethesda game, there are plenty of mods out there to help make the game look and feel a little more modern.Plus you can totally enchant a pair of pants with a slowfall enchantment and name them Parachute Pants.

												Still worth playing, even after all these years, even if you played Oblivion and Skyrim first. And that isn't Nostalgia talking, because I literally did not get this until I'd become bored with Skyrim. You'll want a few mods if you've got a decent system, and want graphical improvements, but it plays pretty well out of the box anyway. Still has an active modding community, even though a few major websites have died in the past few years. Not a perfect game by any means, but the most creative one Bethesda ever made.			"

												The best Elder Scrolls title, hands down. At the start of the game, you are thrown into an alien world, one that you would never expect to see youself in. Everything is different, to the odd fungus flora, to the floating jellyfish that are the Netch. You start as a lowly Outlander, and are constantly told that you, are a worthless outlander. And you don't belong. But as you progress, that will change. You will become an Outlander who barely can swing a sword, to the Nerevarine, legendary Dunmer Saint who can kill gods, and capture their souls. The satisfaction of this makes the game very rewarding and fun to play. Not to mention the amazing spell-creation system, that allows you to create any spell imaginable.  Now other than that, let's talk Story. Morrowind tells one of the greatest stories you will ever partake in. The 6th House has risen, and a blight pollutes Vvardenfell. Will you be the one to save Vvardenfell from this blight, and destroy the evil Dagoth Ur, who dwells in Red Mountain? Or who knows, you might just become arch-mage of Great House Telvanni. All of this is up to you. I definitely recommend Morrowind to anyone who enjoys a good story, a great RPG/openworld game, and a piece of art. But don't let graphics put you off! Morrowind is an amazing, must-play game! Alas, some people may be scaared of these ""bad"" graphics. That's why there's Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul! It makes the game look like any modern game, so haha, there's no excuses now!			"

												I wanted to wait a bit before writing a review.  This game does take a while to get used to, after all.So far, this is one of the best games I have played.  I have played Skyrim for several hundred hours (maybe not too ""impressive,"" but still enough to have an informed opinion of it), and Oblivion for around 50.  Morrowind blows both these out of the water.Maybe it is partially the jump (for me) from console to PC.  Maybe it is just my mindset at the moment. But Morrowind makes its sequels look ... lackluster.  You begin the game with a vague idea of what you're doing and no clue who you are.  And truthfully, I'm not much farther than that in the main story.  And I am completely okay with that.  This game immediately makes you want to explore all of it.  It starts you off in a little town and teases you with these big names that are not so far away.  And, yeah, you can take a silt strider to them.  But frequently a quest makes you leave the big cities. And it is then that Morrowind shows it's true colors.  I walked out of the first town, no idea where I was going, and came upon a man falling from the sky, screaming, with a few scrolls on him that begged to be tried out.  And then I, too, was falling out of the sky.  I later came across a woman who had fallen in love with a man who had stolen her jewels and begged me to find the thief for her.  I walked into a strange-looking edifice and found it filled with high level dremora who quickly taught me that I was not yet welcome there.Save frequently, get a few mods (like the Real Signposts mod.  It truly is a must for navigation. And a mod to make you run faster will keep the game from seeming so slow.), and buy this game.  If you are a fan of the Elder Scrolls, or even of RPG's in general, you will not regret it.			"

												Morrowind is an intresting game, and is considered by many as the best in the Elder Scroll series.The art direction is vivid with bright colors and soft tones, while still maintaing a sense of mystery. While traveling across the province of Morrowind, you will encounter a wide array of NPCs, both mundane and intriguing. The combat is the worst of the past three Elder Scrolls, but you have a sense of peril unlike the more recent installments in the series. Some people give the idea that Morrowind is the most ""hardcore"" Elder Scroll game, which will cause some to waffle on purchasing the game. In reality, Morrowind is really not that hard of a game, sure, when you first start off things WILL be difficult, but once you get the hang of things and level up, it becomes a pleasant experience. Overall, if you find open world games, western RPGs, and/or adventure games your thing, you should purchase Morrowind. It may not be the best for everybody, but it is entertaining to most.			"

												The first thing i want to say about this game is, that Morrowind is my favourite game of all time, and i have played it for a lots and lots of hours during several years. If you havent ever tried Morrowind, but for an example played Skyrim or Oblivion, you most likely cant enjoy this game. Morrowind still has more RPG elements than Oblivion or Skyrim has, and that makes Morrowind so much better than the newer installations in the series. Want to kill gods and use their souls to make extremely powerful weapons? Did you happen to kill an important character that is connected to the main questline, but still want to complete it? Possible in Morrowind, but not in skyrim or Oblivion. In Morrowind each time you start a new game, you are thrown into the world as a new person, not dragonborn or ""the hero of Kvatch"". Each time you have the opportunity to create a character of your own choise and not let the game make decicions for you, like in Skyrim or Oblivion. Morrowind is not only the best game I have ever played, but also contains the best DLC pack I have ever played; Tribunal. I recommend this for everyone, especially for those who havent played Skyrim or Oblivion.			"

												I could go into a lot of detail, but I'll keep this brief. This easily one of the best games ever made. At the very least, it's one of the best RPGs ever made.  (THE best in my humble opinion.) It's depth and complexity is completely unlike any game made today. There is infintely more to every single aspect of the game than just what meets they eye. The quests, the main story, the characters, the magic, the stat system. -There is absolutely no hand holding-This game will never forgive you for being inexperienced-You can't just go around chopping everything in your path to bits like you can in Skyrim. There are creatures that will absolutely decimate you without mercy. -You'll get lost trying to find places (A lot) -You'll get confused and stuck on quests -You will struggle to create a character with decent stats-You will miss important items or details-Spend hours upon hours trudging through the wilderness at a snail's pace-I'm not joking. Speed is an ACTUAL SKILL you have to level up. -You will fail to hit a mudcrab standing right in front of you with your weapon-You will be forever finding new gameplay mechanics, locations, or items you never knew existed.-You will love the music-You will develop and ungodly hatred for cliffracers-YOU CAN KILL MAIN QUESTLINE CHARACTERS. Pay attention. If you kill certain characters you might not ever be able to complete some quests or guilds.The game is not without it's shortcomings, but (some of) it's flaws are part of the fun. Yes, the graphics are bad but it's 15 years old for crying out loud. That's what mods are for. The combat system can be frustrating at first when your skills are low. There is no magicka generation. Glicthes, bugs and exploits are not uncommon. THE BOTTOM LINE- This game is an absolute masterpiece. Buy it right now. Cherish it, bask in it's glory. You won't regret it.			"

												The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is one of the best purchases and games I have ever played in my life. I had first played Morrowind back in Middle School on the old Xbox system and fell in love with the world, the mystery, and the open endedness of the game world. After wanting the game really bad, I decided to purchase it on Steam and it was a wise decision. Morrowind gives the player the ability to truly do whatever they please, create the character of their dreams, and explore an enormous world with amazing characters, creatures, and cities to explore. The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is certainly one of the best Elder Scrolls games I have played out of the entire series and I wish more of the game would have the same feel as Morrowind. I would certainly recommend Morrowind if you love a good RPG, but also if you love open ended exploreation and the ability to go anywhere and do anything you please. Out of 5 stars, I would give Morrowind a 5.Also included in this purchase is the official expansion packs for Morrowind as well. The first expansion pack The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal takes the player to a new location called Mournhold the capital of Morrowind Proper. The expansion is exciting but after a few hours of exploring it does get boring as it is possible to discover everything you can in this expansion. The city does add more quests to the game which is exciting but the quests are certaintly not easy and may take a while, but that is what makes the expansion great. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automantically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Tribunal a 3.The second expansion pack is The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon, which adds a large island territory called Solstheim which the player can travel to and complete new quests to stop the Bloodmoon prophecy from taking place. The island adds even more beautiful scenery, creatures, and towns and cities to be discovered. It is certainly an entertaining expansion as the player is exposed to new landscapes different from those of Vvardenfell and it adds yet another good 15 hours to the already massive game. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automatically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Bloodmoon a 5.			"

												The first thing i want to say about this game is, that Morrowind is my favourite game of all time, and i have played it for a lots and lots of hours during several years. If you havent ever tried Morrowind, but for an example played Skyrim or Oblivion, you most likely cant enjoy this game. Morrowind still has more RPG elements than Oblivion or Skyrim has, and that makes Morrowind so much better than the newer installations in the series. Want to kill gods and use their souls to make extremely powerful weapons? Did you happen to kill an important character that is connected to the main questline, but still want to complete it? Possible in Morrowind, but not in skyrim or Oblivion. In Morrowind each time you start a new game, you are thrown into the world as a new person, not dragonborn or ""the hero of Kvatch"". Each time you have the opportunity to create a character of your own choise and not let the game make decicions for you, like in Skyrim or Oblivion. Morrowind is not only the best game I have ever played, but also contains the best DLC pack I have ever played; Tribunal. I recommend this for everyone, especially for those who havent played Skyrim or Oblivion.			"

												Morrowind. Started actually playing the game after periods of playing for a bit and then stopping for ages. I'm hooked now. Im only level 3, but I'm so enthralled by the game and how fun and addictive it is. I've played almost all the Bethesda games, Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. I loved them all, so naturally, I thought I would try it out after hearing so many positive things about it. It's extremely hard and unrewarding at the beginning, because it does'nt hold your hand. Also, the combat is a dice roll mechanic, meaning the more skilled you are with a particular weapon, the more likely you are to hit your target. I know it sounds a bit odd, but it's a gem of a game. Stick with it, it's so worth it. Keep grinding and keep your eye on the prize, and you'll have no problem with the game. 10/10 definitely recommend.			"

												The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is one of the best purchases and games I have ever played in my life. I had first played Morrowind back in Middle School on the old Xbox system and fell in love with the world, the mystery, and the open endedness of the game world. After wanting the game really bad, I decided to purchase it on Steam and it was a wise decision. Morrowind gives the player the ability to truly do whatever they please, create the character of their dreams, and explore an enormous world with amazing characters, creatures, and cities to explore. The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is certainly one of the best Elder Scrolls games I have played out of the entire series and I wish more of the game would have the same feel as Morrowind. I would certainly recommend Morrowind if you love a good RPG, but also if you love open ended exploreation and the ability to go anywhere and do anything you please. Out of 5 stars, I would give Morrowind a 5.Also included in this purchase is the official expansion packs for Morrowind as well. The first expansion pack The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal takes the player to a new location called Mournhold the capital of Morrowind Proper. The expansion is exciting but after a few hours of exploring it does get boring as it is possible to discover everything you can in this expansion. The city does add more quests to the game which is exciting but the quests are certaintly not easy and may take a while, but that is what makes the expansion great. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automantically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Tribunal a 3.The second expansion pack is The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon, which adds a large island territory called Solstheim which the player can travel to and complete new quests to stop the Bloodmoon prophecy from taking place. The island adds even more beautiful scenery, creatures, and towns and cities to be discovered. It is certainly an entertaining expansion as the player is exposed to new landscapes different from those of Vvardenfell and it adds yet another good 15 hours to the already massive game. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automatically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Bloodmoon a 5.			"

												Morrowind was my introduction to the Elder Scroll's series. I had heard many great things about it, mostly about how it emulated Gothic and the Might & Magic series which made it seem very interesting to me. And while I don't hold it in the same high esteem as many other fans it is still a game I did enjoy despite it's many flaws.Morrowind is an exploration driven RPG. What that means is essentially that the story, combat and skills take a backseat to a huge open world that you can explore at will with little or no boundaries imposed. Now what separates a good exploration RPG from a bad one is both the uniqueness of the locations you can explore and especially the challenge of those locations. One of the worst mistakes an exploration RPG can make is to use leveled enemies or any similar system. If the chance of you entering a new cave only to be running out 30 seconds later with a big scary monster in close pursuit is a non factor then it will quickly become boring and predictable. Likewise if every location is too similar to the last one you will lose that driven to find new caves and castles to loot.While the challenge you get from skipping too far ahead is not quite as good as you can find in other games and the locations do have a number of repeats Morrowind still does a good enough job that you will want to keep searching for new locations and secrets. A number of very cool travel abilities, in particular the one that allows you to jump halfway across the island in a single bound, makes for some very good exploration at times.In terms of combat however the game is very simple and not very entertaining, killing enemies feels more like a chore than anything else and although the spell making system and enchantment system is somewhat interesting it doesn't help enough that you won't find yourself dreading running into yet another enemy. The equipment and loot system is fairly detailed but not very well thought out, mostly notably the clothing/armor system is needlessly complicated without that complexity actually adding anything to the game.The storyline and dialog is not particularly impressive, not as much because of a lack of quality but because there isn't really enough of it to be judged and what little there is tends to be very generic and not very detailed. The quests should be mentioned as some of the most mind numbing that an RPG can dish up with, the majority being simple fed-ex jobs that challenges only your ability to stay awake.In the end, despite every negative thing I've brought up about this game and every negative thing I've forgot to bring up, I still enjoyed it. I enjoyed it simply because the core gameplay mechanic, the exploration, worked. And that is the most important thing for a game to accomplish. It might not be a hall of fame game in my book, but it was still a good play and a game that played to it's strengths.			"

												Note: You can buy Morrowind without DRM on GoG, so I would probably recommend buying it there.Morrowind is a famously good game, but it has many factors that must be considered before touching it, these are the six that come to my mind:1. The combat system is terrible. The later games may be simplified, but the combat systems actually work in those games. This is the only real flaw I have with the game. You can defend it all you want, but the combat is terrible, and drags the entire game down, and is one of the few areas the sequels actually did better in. There are some interesting combat areas that are sadly omitted from all future instalments, such as ability, accuracy and power being directly linked to how exhausted you were.2. Difficulty. I like difficulty, but those who like Oblivion and Morrowind spoon-feeding you will hate this game. I think it makes this a real RPG, but some may disagree. However, the difficulty can be annoying, as some enemies can kill you in a single swing, or in twenty swings. It is really inconsistant.3. Navigation: As said above, the game does not hold your hand at all. There is no compass, quest markers, or other forms of game help, just your ability to ask questions and follow directions that your character puts in their journal. This once again enriches the RPG elements, but may put off those coming from its sequels.4. Oblivion and Skyrim are much easier to play. They are Action-RPG games; this has more RPG elements than its successors. This makes the game seem better for some, but can be a pulling factor to some.5. As it’s older, it naturally won't look as nice. The game has aged somewhat fine, but other games have aged more gracefully. The Morrowind Graphics Overhaul mod makes it look great though, leaving you with the now outdated gameplay mechanics.6. There is a lot of text to read. If you can't read or follow text directions, ♥♥♥♥ off.Outside of this, the game has far more focus on the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe as well. The land is far more alien than Cyrodiil or Skyrim, and the variety of environments is far wider than what is found in subsequent instalments. The world is therefore far more interesting and engaging than later instalments, and this is the final Elder Scrolls game to not include fast travel (outside of transport services), so like it or not, you will walk, sprint and jump your way across the world. The world itself outside of the environments has a lot more personality than Oblivion and Skyrim, with a much larger emphasis on what the native Dunmer consider traditional rights, introducing themes such as slavery, racism and factionalism that isn't present in such a way in any later instalments.If you are ready for the last Elder Scrolls game to focus more on RPG elements than action elements, then I'd recommend. However, if the many broken elements of this game put you off, then don't bother. Morrowind is the last Elder Scrolls game really aimed at a niche market.			"

												TL;DR Review:Morrowind is a unique entry in the Elder Scrolls series that is just as fun, engaging and addictive as its big brothers Oblivion and Skyrim, but you will have to work a bit harder to get to the rich nougaty center.Long Review:Morrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game to be released for the Windows platform, and it's clear that Bethesda rewrote the engine from the ground up.  Gone were the problematic, randomly-generated dungeons of Daggerfall.  Now all content would be hand-created, using specialized tools to still allow the massive amounts of content that hallmark an Elder Scrolls game.The setting deserves a special mention - it's as far away from your standard generic fantasy setting as possible.  Green gives way to volcanic grey, red and purple.  You fight giant insects, dinosaur-like creatures and steampunk constructs.  Trees give way to cities built under huge mushrooms and massive stone formations.  You travel between cities tucked inside the hollowed-out shell of a giant bug.  It's almost like adventuring in an alien world instead of a fantasy one.There is a lot to do.  Over ninety dungeons to raid, four cities and thirteen towns to explore, three noble houses and four guilds to join - each of which has their own questline.  And that's not even touching the main plot, which is arguably the best one ever written for an Elder Scrolls game.Downsides?  Of course.  There's no fast travel, so you'll initially be doing a lot of walking around.  But between the silt striders (the giant bugs mentioned above), teleportation between mage's guilds, scrolls of intervention and the Mark and Recall spells, you'll eventually be jumping around Morrowind with ease, and it feels more realistic.The leveling system isn't quite as broken as the one in Oblivion but it's not as good as Skyrim.  And the progression isn't balanced well - you'll spend a long time feeling like a shmuck and then suddenly you'll be a godling.Also, because this version includes both expansion packs, early on in the game you'll be attacked by a fairly difficult enemy.  This fight can be hard for new players, but if you persevere your reward will be an excellent set of light armor that will make the rest of the early game much easier.I'm not big on mods for Morrowind, but I'd recommend the Morrowind Code Patch, especially if you play a stealthy character because it enables sneak-toggle (by default you have to hold down the sneak button for as long as you're sneaking).  It also does other silly, inconsequential things like fix a ton of crashes and savegame corruptions.  You can learn more about it and get it here:http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:Morrowind_Code_PatchIf you've never played an Elder Scrolls game, I would strongly suggest you start here.  If you played Oblivion or Skyrim and want more, Morrowind will pay off for you in spades.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I love Morrowind. I've played probably around 300 hours of it and there's still lots of unique quests to explore. That being said, if I take off my nostalgia glasses, there are some pretty major flaws that I feel anyone playing it for the first time today should be aware of. Breaking it down:Cons:* Combat of all types is boring. Magic/Stealth/Archery/Melee are all essentially reduced to keep-clicking-until-it-dies. On the magic side of things, the spell creation system is fun and there are lots of neat base spells to choose from, but in essence the combat itself is overly simple.* The leveling system functions fine if you just don't pay attention to it, but optimal leveling is a tedious chore. If you are the type who just can't pass up an opportunity for maximum stat gains, this might be a big detractor.* The dialogue is text based and most NPCs are just walking lore encyclopedias. The persuasion and bartering systems are laughably simple, and again, boring.* The graphics haven't aged well, though it does have a strong artistic concept at its core.* The menu interface is sub-par, but gets the job done.Pros:* Exploration is really well rewarded. Everywhere you look there's some small detail that hints at a story, or a unique artifact with interesting properties. Many of the ruins have secret entrances and places that you could easily miss.* Morrowind does a good job of making you feel like your actions have impact. It could be better, but it is satisfying when factions will hate or love you depending on what you've done, and there are many unique dialog lines based on how famous you are.* The quests are unique. Sure some of them blend together a little bit, but overall they are NOT just cookie-cutter quests. Most of them give you some insight into the world and how it works, or have some neat little twist.* You can fly. It seems so trivial but I keep coming back to this as an example of the game's overwhelming freedom. It's fun scrounging around in the early game for limited-use levitation spells or the infamous Scrolls of Icarian Flight which make you jump so high you'll certainly die on your way back down. You start out so weak but there are powerful scrolls and spells to exploit that can change the entire game... the wild variance in the power of the enemies and items you encounter is one of Morrowind's stronger points.* A final important pro is the modding community. If there are things you don't like about this game, chances are high there's a mod that can change it. In particular, I have a had good luck with graphics mod compilations and just general expansion packs. Of course, modding is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.In summary, this game has many great features and in some ways the sense of depth and scale you get when immersed in it is unrivaled by any game since. However, it requires a certain type of gamer, (or a certain amount of modding,) to get past its unpalatable quirks and into the wonderful world beneath.EDIT: Just going to address a couple points that have come up in the comments.* Discrepancy in my playtime listed vs what I have on record with Steam. I played Morrowind in 2004 just after the GOTY edition came out, which was before it was on Steam. I later purchased it on Steam because I had lost my physical copy.* I love Morrowind yet gave it a non-recommendation. I wrote this review for the general gaming public in 2013 and I did not think it would be a good experience for the average 2013 Steam gamer because of the points listed above, hence my non-recommendation.

												If you enjoy stories and getting lost, then this game is for you.  Echoing previous reviewers, this game has not aged well; but fear not! Get the Morrowind graphics and sounds overhaul (MGSO for short) along with Morrowind Rebirth, read the directions and install everything carefully, and you're good to go. The game is brilliant once completely modded with those two overhauls. But if you really want to play the original version like so many, such as myself, did when it was first released, have at it. ;)You won't be disappointed.			"

												I have only 4 hrs for the steam version, but I have played this game probably more than any other and probably have close to 500 hrs logged on this game over the past decade or so.This is in terms of a role playing experience, probably the best game ever created. It is much more unforgiving, but not necessarily difficult than Oblivion and Skyrim. It is the last pure RPG in the elder scrolls series. Contrary to popular belief, this game is actually larger than both oblivion and Skyrim, before expansions. Everything except some random loot is hand placed. Everything. It is one of the most immersive experiences ever. There is little voiced dialogue but I feel it is made up by the massive amounts of DEPTH that is in the text conversations and just the sheer amount of background and lore and history you get from speaking to NPCs.Story wise in terms of pure ""Feeling important like a hero factor"" Morrowind stomps both Skyrim and Oblivion. Oblivion you are second fiddle to Martin septim. In Skyrim, literally nobody gives a damn about you or your importance, your goal is so ridiculously simple (Slay alduin and the dragons) and has so little depth to the story. Morrowind's story is so epic, and you feel like you are truly doing something of great and supreme importance, even though the impact was so much smaller than the end goals in Oblivion, and Skyrim in terms of the overall story of Tamriel.This game has not aged well, but luckily has more mods than oblivion and skyrim put together including several freaking amazing visual mods that basically make it prettier than either of them. The combat is lackluster and mostly just dependant on your stats, which honestly the most efficent way to level up is to train from Npcs simply because otherwise it can be a bit of a pain.  If you play this game you will understand how ""casualized"" and gutted skyrim especially is. It's still an excellent, amazing game don't get me wrong, but it doesn't hold a candle to the amount of depth that is contained in probably the greatest game ever made in the history of mankind.

												I have only 4 hrs for the steam version, but I have played this game probably more than any other and probably have close to 500 hrs logged on this game over the past decade or so.This is in terms of a role playing experience, probably the best game ever created. It is much more unforgiving, but not necessarily difficult than Oblivion and Skyrim. It is the last pure RPG in the elder scrolls series. Contrary to popular belief, this game is actually larger than both oblivion and Skyrim, before expansions. Everything except some random loot is hand placed. Everything. It is one of the most immersive experiences ever. There is little voiced dialogue but I feel it is made up by the massive amounts of DEPTH that is in the text conversations and just the sheer amount of background and lore and history you get from speaking to NPCs.Story wise in terms of pure ""Feeling important like a hero factor"" Morrowind stomps both Skyrim and Oblivion. Oblivion you are second fiddle to Martin septim. In Skyrim, literally nobody gives a damn about you or your importance, your goal is so ridiculously simple (Slay alduin and the dragons) and has so little depth to the story.

												This is by far the best open world game I have ever played. People moan about the initial fighting system, but in my oppinion, the system works: your base attributes and skill set is clearly reflecting your level. When you are level 1, you can not take on even level 5 monsters and enemies, because you are simply to weak. This is not faulty gameplay, this is just a game that refuses to hold your hand. On the other hand, as you reach level 20 and beyond you will start to feel like a God, as suddenly nothing will stand in your way or slow you down as you plow through dungeons and mission like an irresistable force! This game is highly recomendable. I have played it since it came out decades ago and recently purchased it again (to make it work with windows 10) and I still find new stuff, even after thousands of hours of pplay (litterally). Epic!			"

												I have played this game since it came out in 2002, and it continues to be my personal favorite of The Elder Scrolls series. The story is compelling, and actually draws you into the world unlike in Skyrim, and Oblivion. Don't get me wrong that Skyrim and Oblivion don't draw you in. They do, just not on the same scale.Advancing in a Faction requires you to be proficent in their favored skills, not just doing the quests.There are NO limits to what you can do if you really think about it. Have you ever wanted to make a ring or amulet that lets you Levitate forever? This game engine lets you do that, you just have to make it yourself.Do you want to use the soul of a God to power a pair of slippers? Go for it.Have I replayed this game over and over? Of course.Do I recommend that you play this through before playing Skywind? Absolutely. "

												For anyone new to the Elder Scrolls Series, this game will make you work, cuss and just very angry. Its one of a kind and the very eccense of the game series, the difficulty and over all the unforgiving world you'll be in for the next several months will be tough, you will get lost and figure out how to walk for once instead of quick travel. Almost every action you make will take effect on things in the world. Npc's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they learn to grow on you and begin to enjoy your company as the game progresses. Just about everything in this game will make you work for it there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doubt about it. but once you figure out how everything works and just be enthrawled into morrowind you will be satisfied like taking a huge dump. Morrowind is one of those challenges that we all must play in gaming atleast once, to remember that rpg's like this are slowly slipping away. I recommend this to any hardcore gamer or just anyone up for a challenge :) this has my thumb of approval.			"

												Morrowind is a very well-made RPG that does not hold your hand. Some Morrowind features such as map notes and a superior bartering system bring out the flaws of the other games in the series.If you have played the newer games in the series before Morrowind; the lack of fast travel and quest markers will be obvious as soon as you enter the introduction.You will be forced to ask locals for directions, you will add notes to the map to remind yourself of certain details of the world and Morrowind is more satisfying game because of it and that is one of the aspects that makes Morrowind so enjoyable: Satisfaction that you have achieved everything by yourself.So take a carriage and then a boat, east, to Morrowind, you won't regret it.10/10			"

												I first played this game in 2004. When I saw it I was blown away that I could be who I wanna be and go where I wanna go. And that was exactly what I got back then when I played it. Im sure I put over 1000 hours into it easily by now.Well i recently picked this game up again. Added the graphical overhaul 3.0 and its definatelly stunning in comparrison to the original so highly recommend getting that. 100%Well I definately love Skyrim to death and I think the combat in Oblivion is good but the rest of the game is Ehhh... okay.. i guess. At best.But the way the world of Morrowind it self is crafted is like no other open world RPG befor or since. Just the level of love they put into every area and every detail is fantastic. The world it self is what grips me in these type of games and this world is everything but ""just slapped together"". Its very detailed, it has enough dungeons to explore around every corner and I love that when im exploring I can open a chest and potentially I could find anything. Kinda like Diablo. Loot finding is awesome. Great variaty. Not just the same kinda things over and over like in the other Elder Scrolls games.Combat may not be for everyone though and I can understand that. Its alittle dull. But if your willing to get used to it you will definately have a good time.  For me personally even when it comes to playability today this is my favorite Elder Scrolls game. Though I also love Skyrim as well. This is the perfect ""in the middle"" of the series game, in that i mean, it has the action and feel of the newer ones while keeping it classic RPG like Daggerfall and Arena. Its the perfect middle man.But The reason I recomend it most of all is beacuse of the world of Morrowind it self. To me its the best crafted and most lovingly detailed Open World RPG of all time. Its kinda like they relized the possibilitys of creating and open world and they persued it passionately as hell. It is definately a trail blazer game that was built with a passion.9.7/10			"

												I will always say that Morrowind is the most Elder Scrolls that the series will ever be. This game has more depth, character, and atmosphere than any other game in the series. Here are a few things that I love about Morrowind: Interesting and Unique Setting and Lore Memorable, Impactful Atmosphere Clever, Well-Developed Writing Difficult, Thought-Provoking Quests Bucketloads of ContentAnd bucketloads is almost an understatement of how much game Morrowind has to offer. This game's depth isn't even scratched by Oblivion or Skyrim. Morrowind has more armor, more skills, more classes, more weapons and weapon types, more dialogue, more of just about everything. The game's skill system isn't limited in as many ways either, so you can push your character to insane power. This game is an art piece that just needs to be experienced by serious fans. But that's not to say that it is objectively the best game in the series, and it is definately not the most accessible. The game almost requires a different mindset for playing than Oblivion or Skyrim requires. It's slow, atmospheric, difficult, old, and a little unfair at times. Many newer Elder Scrolls fans are turned off by a number of factors present in Morrowind: RNG (Random Number Generator) Based Combat Slower Pace Lack of Voiced Dialogue Less User-Friendly Quests, Interface, and Controls Awkward, Aged GraphicsThese things may be difficult to get past when you first get into it (especially for a Skyrim player), but the game has so much to offer once you push past them.

												Throughout the years, I've put maybe 4500 hours into this game, more than any other game, over the course of three lost and rebought discs, as well as the Steam edition once I stopped putting optical drives into my computers. I still have the Cliffracer screech as my alarm in the morning. Doesn't fail to wake me up.To me, this is the highlight of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I realize a lot of it is nostalgia - when this came out there was nothing about it that wasn't revolutionary in scope. Oh, I remember the days when my mates would outright whine for days about not being able to run the game well, after they saw what it was supposed to look like on my first proper bleeding-edge gaming PC.Off the back of its combat system, the game got a few moderate reviews, even back in 2002. Which is understandable as this game is something as rare as a PC game that was ported to console rather than the other way around. However, as a pen & paper role playing gamer I always enjoyed the combat and never understood the problem people had with it. I was simply predisposed to suspend my disbelief before I even began.Even today, with the graphical mods to Morrowind that are available, I have still not been able to make Oblivion look better than Morrowind. Modded DirectX 9 Morrowind just flat out looks better and more atmospheric.The soundtrack is up there in my top 5, maybe second behind Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures, just in front of the Monkey Island franchise. Jeremy Soule's best work, and such a great compliment to exploration and discovery. Apart from aforementioned Age of Conan soundtrack, I have never been more motivated to explore just because of a soundtrack. And when you hear that Cliffracer screech and the descent of timpanis, you know ♥♥♥♥ is going down.Thank god we had spears back then. Nothing like a 1.5 reach modifier against Cliffracers.A modder's perspective:The game is infinitely moddable - more so than the newer TES titles. It is just more accessible and powerful. There's no need to add empty voice .mp3 to a mod just so the dialogue won't skip along on its merry way. There is no convoluted AI pathing and waypoint micromanagement just to script an NPC to move somewhere. And the scripting language in Morrowind is just downright simpler and more intuitive than most notably Skyrim.For these reasons, Morrowind still to this day has 5-10 new mods being posted every day, and a live community. Additionally, because of how easy it is to turn idea to practice, the amount and quality of quest mods is tenfold that of especially Skyrim. If you want ACTUAL CONTENT from mods, and not just blinging out your character or anime mods, Morrowind is hands down the game you should get.			"

												Morrowind won't hold your hand. It's dark and deep and the main story is much more complex than in Skyrim or Oblivion. There’s no “good” or “bad” here and it’s virtually impossible to make everyone love you. And this makes the game’s world truly believable.Morrowind simply asks you to take your time, get into the lore, explore the world, understand its politics and history. It's a game that's hard to get into... but very satisfying when you do. Definitely not for everyone. Still, the atmosphere, the main story, the side quests, the politics, the alchemy and enchanting system and the overall freedom that Morrowind gives you make up for all its flaws.If you're looking for an outlandish open-world RPG experience in a dark cruel world... I'd definitely recommend Morrowind. Here you need to earn your respect, slowly build up your reputation and only then you may truly enjoy it as a power fantasy game. And trust me, it'll give you much more satisfaction than being called the Dragonborn after 30 or 60 minutes of gameplay.			"

												TES III: Morrowind is not a RPG, it is an experience and a milestone.The moment when you step outside the ship and the soundtracks kicks in, doesn't only mark the beginning of your adventure, but the beginning of a genre that defined the future of RPGs.Every NPC encountered, every quest or enemy, they all hold a special place in our memories and this is what makes Morrowind such a great game.For many gamers this is the first played TES episode, and probably this is the reason that made us purchase the Steam version once again: the first TES is like your first love, it is unforgettable and incomparable.I remember receiving it as a Christmas present in the early 2002, along with my Xbox; I remember the Christmas holidays spent trying to figure out how to properly play it as I felt amazed by the open world in front of my eyes. And now that Chirstmas is nearing (27 Novemeber 2015 as I am writing this review), I can feel the very same excitement, the sensation of awe when I arrived once again in Balmora, the thrill of having taken down an enemy after countless missed hits, and yes, even the terrible sensation of annoyance everytime a Cliff Racer approaches me.Honestly, despide all the wonderful mods user created, I refuse to enhance this experience, as I wouldn't feel it original and genuine. My advice is to play Morrowind as it is, and afterwards, perhaps, try out all the user created content.Do not wait any longer, grab it already, you n'wah!			"

												Morrowind is by far the most ""true"" RPG of the Elder Scrolls games on steam. It is a very different game than Oblivion or Skyrim, but ultimately whether or not you enjoy the game depends on your liking for more traditional RPG elements vs. the action-RPG elements of the newer elder scrolls games. However, if you just want a cool setting to explore, this game will certainly satisfy, as the world is really an interesting and unique place.  It also happens to have my favorite music of the ES games. If you can deal with dated graphics and slightly dated gameplay, it's certainly worth your time. 8.6/10			"

Despite the obviously dated graphics (which can easily be modded to a reasonable extent), I would say this is one of the most interested and engaging video games out there.			"

												This game is a must for every RPG lovers. Combat is a little awkward and graphics are dated, but the ammount and quality of content is outstanding. And you really need to put some thinking and exploring to complete quests because the HUD has no compass, there are no marked places or NPCs in game world and fast travel is limited, but that only makes this game a truly immersive experience.

												This game is what Skyrim promises to be. I love all the Bethesda games, even Fallout 4, but there's no denying this is the best Elder Scrolls made IMO. Daggerfall is too archaic for me to want to pick up, and while I recommend the Morrowind Overhaul project, I'm playing through for my first time using only a mod to fix the resolution and loving it. You can craft spells with EIGHT DIFFERENT EFFECTS. Want a spell mixing multiple elements and area of effect damage? You can do it. Want to summon 8 Daedric Beings with the press of a button? You can do it. Want to create a spell that heals as much as it damages, allowind you to indefinitely practice your magic on one enemy? You. Can. Do. It. All the systems in this game are about as deep as that, and alchemy requires FOUR different machines to properly do it. The two biggest barriers to entry are the graphics and combat. Morrowind Overhaul fixes that completely so that's squared away. The combat is purely stat based; I do more damage with a mid range sword than the best most OP axe in the game, because you'll miss your swings with a weapon you have no knowledge of how to use. Also WATCH YOUR FATIGUE. % chance you hit is based on how much fatigue you have, don't be like those dumbasses who mash left mouse and wonder why they miss every swing.Pros- In depth lore and a wide variety of topics to ask NPCs about.The best magic system in any game I've played. Free form quests- I have a sword powered by the soul of a god I slew. Nobody told me to do that, Morrowind merely provides the weapon (Daedric Shortsword) the soul (not gonna spoil which god) and the means (in depth enchanting system) to do it. Wide variety of locales and quests. Good storytelling that isn't always spoonfed to you. To cure vampirism without looking it up online, you need to read a couple of books and figure it out yourself. As far as I know, it's impossible any other way besides discovering it by dumb luck or google.Truly an RPG. Very easy to stick to your characters beliefs, unlike in Skyrim where the story makes you a good guy no matter what you do because you saved the world from Alduin.Cons-Somewhat obtuse mechanics. Once they're learned they're badass, but hard to do so. I recommend looking up how to do alchemy, enchanting, etc. as the game expects you to have an instruction manual.Some bugs. Morrowind Overhaul fixes thousands though.Personal Preference- I think having to read to figure stuff out without the game just telling you is awesome. Some might not.No quest markers. You get directions, and late game are in unexplored areas and have to go off of handwritten maps. Conclusion- 10/10 best RPG I've ever played. Quite a challenge, but if you're up to it, it's the most rewarding game I've ever played.			"

												Now that i beat it for the second time i can comfortably review this game. imma keep it short and sweet. Pros!  +Vast attribute system [lots of different ways to level up and customize your character if you wanna make your class.]  +Long and engaging story with a lore deeper than the rest of the Elder Scrolls games.  +Enchanting weapons and armor and accessories has never felt better, so many different ways to customize as long as you have means to  +Vast open world with many secrets to discover. a very diverse landscape indeed which is probably why i didnt favor skyrim that much seeing as how it was smaller and less diverse with a few secrets.  +a soundtrack unlike any other, absolutely beautiful.  +Combat is quite unique. although it may not be the best, spell creation and badass enchanted weapons do make up. Cons.  -Not very good looking in terms of asthetics, didnt age too well. [strongly reccomend getting the Overhaul 3.0]  -Combat is not the best. [refer to the last Pro]  -Requires alot of reading to get through it. [not nessarily a bad thing, just pointing out how most people wont like it as opposed to skyrims quest markers. git gud] Overall : 9/10 Definately one of the most unforgettable Rpg Experiences out there to date. till this day i have not played an RPG that could engage me like Morrowind did. I reccomend giving this game a try if you a hardcore fan of the series.			"

												This has to be one of my favourite games ever. Yes it's graphics are dated, and the gameplay can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you're only used to newer games, but trust me, Morrowind is amazing. The atmosphere of the game is, in my opinion, almost unrivaled. Small things like the sound of a siltstrider in the distance or the sandstorms blowing through towns completely immerse you in the world of Morrowind. While the story features no real character developement like some newer games (and duh, it's a western RPG they never do anyway) the main narrative is epic, there is no other word for it. Bits and pieces of the story come together slowly and little things fall into place as you do side quests, Morrowind lets you live out one of the best realised fantasy worlds ever, without the irritating limits on choices that are enforced in Skyrim and Oblivion. So seriously, buy this game, and get on to the Elder Scrolls website and get all the free addons.			"

												Morrowind is and always will be a true masterpeice that is the crown jewel of classic RPGS. Yes, I said it, the CROWN JEWEL, sorry Occarina of Time! Morrowind is not for the faint-hearted kid fans of Skyrim who play it like it's a hack and slash. It is not for picky, complaining adults who point every little fault out and refuse to enjoy games for what they are. Morrowind is for hardcore RPG players, the people who can just get lost in the world for days at a time wanting to find every city and do every quest. It's for those of us who can sit down, start up the game, and find our way through with no in-game quest markers at all, instead using strategy, creativity, and logic. And above all, Morrowind is for true Elder Scrolls fans, with history books scattered around the world and a story that ingeniously weaves it's way deep into the past and present of the Elder Scrolls timeline. Overall, if you are a hack and slash fan of Skyrim and not the whole franchise, who will pick apart a game just to find something to complain about, this game is not for you, so don't buy it. Period. If you are an RPG gamer and a true fan of the Elder Scrolls, get Morrowind NOW. Seriously, get it now, you are missing out on a great game!			"

												I first played this game in 2004. When I saw it I was blown away that I could be who I wanna be and go where I wanna go. And that was exactly what I got back then when I played it. Im sure I put over 1000 hours into it easily by now.Well i recently picked this game up again. Added the graphical overhaul 3.0 and its definatelly stunning in comparrison to the original so highly recommend getting that. 100%Well I definately love Skyrim to death and I think the combat in Oblivion is good but the rest of the game is Ehhh... okay.. i guess. At best.But the way the world of Morrowind it self is crafted is like no other open world RPG befor or since. Just the level of love they put into every area and every detail is fantastic. The world it self is what grips me in these type of games and this world is everything but ""just slapped together"". Its very detailed, it has enough dungeons to explore around every corner and I love that when im exploring I can open a chest and potentially I could find anything. Kinda like Diablo. Loot finding is awesome. Great variaty. Not just the same kinda things over and over like in the other Elder Scrolls games.Combat may not be for everyone though and I can understand that. Its alittle dull. But if your willing to get used to it you will definately have a good time.  For me personally even when it comes to playability today this is my favorite Elder Scrolls game. Though I also love Skyrim as well. This is the perfect ""in the middle"" of the series game, in that i mean, it has the action and feel of the newer ones while keeping it classic RPG like Daggerfall and Arena. Its the perfect middle man.But The reason I recomend it most of all is beacuse of the world of Morrowind it self. To me its the best crafted and most lovingly detailed Open World RPG of all time. Its kinda like they relized the possibilitys of creating and open world and they persued it passionately as hell. It is definately a trail blazer game that was built with a passion.9.7/10			"

												Morrowind has to be one of the most aged, arduous games you could ever play. But it defined a whole generation and brought the Elder Scrolls series into the modern light. Combat is clunky but you can really feel your character grow as you begin to hit more things and face much tougher enemies. The Elder Scrolls has always included a massive world to explore but I think no game like it has ever invoked the true freedom of a players decisions like this one has. The Spells and Enchantment's make anything possible in this game. Whereas other games in the series and in other open worlds have set resistrictions on the player. Morrowind's greatest strength is the ability to play how you want. You can enchant and craft leviation relics and spells to complely avoid areas, make items which drain the life of users who wear them (making killing civilians without being noticed a breeze) and practically create anything you can think of. Even the main story is something that can be overlooked or ruined completely if that is what you want to do. Despite all of its flaws in gameplay, that is what makes Morrowind so special for me even today. It has problems and I certainly don't think its the best RPG ever made. But it's a captivating game with a rich lore and a true sense of freedom that even games today have trouble creating.			"

												Morrowind won't hold your hand. It's dark and deep and the main story is much more complex than in Skyrim or Oblivion. There’s no “good” or “bad” here and it’s virtually impossible to make everyone love you. And this makes the game’s world truly believable.Morrowind simply asks you to take your time, get into the lore, explore the world, understand its politics and history. It's a game that's hard to get into... but very satisfying when you do. Definitely not for everyone. Still, the atmosphere, the main story, the side quests, the politics, the alchemy and enchanting system and the overall freedom that Morrowind gives you make up for all its flaws.If you're looking for an outlandish open-world RPG experience in a dark cruel world... I'd definitely recommend Morrowind. Here you need to earn your respect, slowly build up your reputation and only then you may truly enjoy it as a power fantasy game. And trust me, it'll give you much more satisfaction than being called the Dragonborn after 30 or 60 minutes of gameplay.			"

												I will always say that Morrowind is the most Elder Scrolls that the series will ever be. This game has more depth, character, and atmosphere than any other game in the series. Here are a few things that I love about Morrowind: Interesting and Unique Setting and Lore Memorable, Impactful Atmosphere Clever, Well-Developed Writing Difficult, Thought-Provoking Quests Bucketloads of ContentAnd bucketloads is almost an understatement of how much game Morrowind has to offer. This game's depth isn't even scratched by Oblivion or Skyrim. Morrowind has more armor, more skills, more classes, more weapons and weapon types, more dialogue, more of just about everything. The game's skill system isn't limited in as many ways either, so you can push your character to insane power. This game is an art piece that just needs to be experienced by serious fans. But that's not to say that it is objectively the best game in the series, and it is definately not the most accessible. The game almost requires a different mindset for playing than Oblivion or Skyrim requires. It's slow, atmospheric, difficult, old, and a little unfair at times. Many newer Elder Scrolls fans are turned off by a number of factors present in Morrowind: RNG (Random Number Generator) Based Combat Slower Pace Lack of Voiced Dialogue Less User-Friendly Quests, Interface, and Controls Awkward, Aged GraphicsThese things may be difficult to get past when you first get into it (especially for a Skyrim player), but the game has so much to offer once you push past them.

												TES III: Morrowind is not a RPG, it is an experience and a milestone.The moment when you step outside the ship and the soundtracks kicks in, doesn't only mark the beginning of your adventure, but the beginning of a genre that defined the future of RPGs.Every NPC encountered, every quest or enemy, they all hold a special place in our memories and this is what makes Morrowind such a great game.For many gamers this is the first played TES episode, and probably this is the reason that made us purchase the Steam version once again: the first TES is like your first love, it is unforgettable and incomparable.I remember receiving it as a Christmas present in the early 2002, along with my Xbox; I remember the Christmas holidays spent trying to figure out how to properly play it as I felt amazed by the open world in front of my eyes. And now that Chirstmas is nearing (27 Novemeber 2015 as I am writing this review), I can feel the very same excitement, the sensation of awe when I arrived once again in Balmora, the thrill of having taken down an enemy after countless missed hits, and yes, even the terrible sensation of annoyance everytime a Cliff Racer approaches me.Honestly, despide all the wonderful mods user created, I refuse to enhance this experience, as I wouldn't feel it original and genuine. My advice is to play Morrowind as it is, and afterwards, perhaps, try out all the user created content.Do not wait any longer, grab it already, you n'wah!			"

												Morrowind's greatest triumph is that it crafts a distinctly unique fantasy world, from its various cultures and politics to its dwellings, landscapes, and species.  There is a great deal to discover and an epic story to be experienced - one that still stands as one of the best, even all these years later.However, the game is not without its flaws.  In particular, combat and its related skills are a bit unrefined.  For example, you won't be able to hit anything with melee attacks until you raise your melee skill, which is only raised by successfully hitting things.  Luckily, this game was very popular and you can find many mods to get around the aspects of the game that aren't up to modern snuff.If you have the time and see what fantasy can be like when it isn't just piggy-backing off of Tolkien, play this game!

												In my opinion: The best Elder Scrolls game available. Its almost the polar opposite of titles like Skyrim. Morrowind encourages exploration and flatout tells you to deviate from the main story to become more experienced and come back when you think you're more prepared to progress. There is no fast travel, only Striders which are basically buses. And there are no quest markers. The game instead gives you directions which you then write down in your journal. Personally I had a much better time trying to figure out how to get places based on hints and directions than just walking mindlessly towards a beacon on my map. This game is flawless, a masterpiece. Granted it does take an hour or so to get past the ""terrible"" graphics. And you may one to get an HD overhaul mod or two. But with the previous set aside, RPG/Adventure games can't get any better than this.Pros:-Blinding nastolgia-Amazing exploration-Beautiful world design-Stunning character design-Easy to use UI-Great storyCons:-YOU RUN SOOOO DAMN SLOW!!!-Its incredibly hard to do a brute character.

Many people claim that the reason people still play this game today is because of ""nostalgia"" and they say that it's outdated. I can seriously say that this is completely false. I can say this with all honesty because this game was made only one year after I was born, as I was born in 2001 and this game was made in 2002. I'll go through a couple of major catagories of this game and give some details on each one in this part of the review. Graphics This section does not deal with the enviroment, but with the actually way things look. While this game was made in 2002, the graphics are actually decent. While yes, they have a low polygon count and are rather structured, it still gets the job done. There is still a lot of artistic talent going on here, the art really shines in my opinion. And honestly, graphics can be completely redone by MGSO. I really am fine with a game having O-K graphics, so I'm going to give this section a7/10 Gameplay If you're not totally new to the gaming world, you've probably heard something about Morrowind's combat and how bad it is. And truely, it is not very interesting. Stealth, magic, melee, ranged. Nope. But this game isn't about combat. It's about exploration, questing, collecting, and talking. Sure, there is some combat, but it really doesn't play as huge of a part as other RPG games I've played. Anyways, the gameplay is fun. Exploration is very well rewarded, and there are lots of places to visit and people to talk to. Also, there is so much to do in this game. I'm 120 hours in and I haven't even come close to finishing the main quest, and I have about 5 characters so far (four of whom havent started the main quest at all). I am going to give this section a 9/10  Story and NPCs I'm lumping all of these together because they have a lot in common. The story to this game I think is actually very interesting. While it sort of follows the classic ""an ancient evil has awoken"" story, it's done in a very unique way in which you can relate to both ""sides"" and in this case there are actually very many sides. More on that later. Now onto NPCs. The NPCs are pretty bland, with a few exceptions. They have generic answers and things to talk about, and none of the dialoge is voiced. This can be sort of fixed with mods, but I'd still give NPCs a 6/10and the story a 10/10 because it truely is a fantastic story. Setting The setting may be this game's strongest part. You could also call this part the enviroment. The world of Morrowind is a very alien one. About the only thing that you might recognize is a rat when speaking about Fauna, or some grass and tress if you're talking about Flora. Everything is so different and stranged, and it's rather intimidating stepping out of the first building and being greeted by a giant mushroom (and Fargoth...). Also, the history behind everything is really awesome. Just about every cave you explore has a stroy that you can peice together from things that you find in it, it's quite facinating.If you haven't read much about TES lore, Morrowind is the land of the Dunmer, or dark elves and was also once home of the Chimer and the Dwemer. The setting and history is so very interesting and I really get engrossed in it. I could rave on for a really long while just talking about this, but I'll spare you.  Expansions The expansions to Morrowind are pretty awesome, too. Bloodmoon transports you to Solstheim, an island just north of Morrowind where the Legion has just set up fort and some pioneers are trying to set up a village (which you get to help build, by the way). I'm not going to spoil a lot but lets just say  FIRST PERSON LYCANTHROPY Tribunal takes you to Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind. Now I haven't started this one yet, because it's not supposed to make sense if you haven't done the main quest, but It's supposed to be really awesome. You get to meet Sotha Sil! (sorta) I'm going to give the expansions a 9/10----------Now that I've covered the major points I'll cover a couple of minor ones.MusicFantastic. There is not a lot of it, but the stuff the you do have is amazing and really captures the essence of Morrowind. Plus, the Elder Scrolls theme comes from this game. There are also lots of mods that give the game more music like the things already in the vanilla game. I'll give this section 9/10 (one point off because there isn't as much music as I might have liked. Speaking of mods...Mods!There are so many mods! The community has been pumping them out since 2002, so there are a boatload of mods out there. MGSO, Sotha Sil Expanded, Starfire's NPCs, Tamriel Rebuilt, just so many. The community for this game is truly fantastic (and not pervy like Skyrim's or Oblivion's).10/10PerformanceThis game should perform well on any computer made after 2007. I can't afford a nice PC at this time, and even on my 2011 laptop, I get 25-30 fps at all time with Medium Settings on MGSO. You shouldn't worry about your computer being able to take this game, especially if you have a nice one.9/10 Conclusion All in all, Morrowind is a fantastic game. I recomment it to anyone who likes RPG games. And don't be fooled by the age of the game. Even vanilla Morrowind is so much better than all of the stuff they are pumping out these days. Thanks for reading, and I hope that this inspired you to buy this game. I hope you enjoyed my review!I give this game a  10/10 3000th Review for this game, yay.			"

												8/10 now after 13 years of aging, but 10/10 for its time.  This being said only because I'm taking into consideration its mechanics compared to all other games old and new.  Granted, it still has mechanics and gameplay aspects that are still unique to this day.  Though disregarding its modern day competitors, the environment, story, lore, and immersion of this game still hold up beautifully.  Any fan of The Elder Scrolls series absolutely need to play this game.  It enhances the story and immersion of the newer games in the series considerably (especially the Solstheim DLC in Skyrim.)  I got this game after playing Oblivion and Skyrim and still had a blast playing it.  This game is truly a masterpiece and gem of its time.			"

												The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind is the best RPG ive ever played.I have played Skyrim at the first time and I thought, that it was the best time-consuming game i've ever pushed into the drive. But no. Oblivion wasn't my game, because the world was too ""plastic"". But Morrowind was a masterpiece. You can explore the world more than 100 hours (my main-time was without steam). Yes, i know, the story was not the best and you can play it through in 1 hour, but the RPG gameplay was revolutionary in this age of time and for me. The graphics are today irrelevant, when you are a real RPG-player.The Elder Scrolls have changed my life.			"

												This game. I  love  this game. It did everything that none other could do at the time. Graphics? Check. Battle system like none other? Check. The list goes on and on about what it did right. I grew up with the Xbox version of this game, and it still is the best pc port to console game ever. Even though it didn't have the command console, the graphics, or the mods, it still had the gameplay (even more if you got the GoTY edition, which everyone should have), and the controls made by gods. Although it's one of my favorite games, I will bash at it. When running some game-important mods; it will have stability issues and most likely crash if you DIY. You can fix it though if you set the quality down a little if you have a low-end system like mine, get an FPS optimizer, and get a mod-loader like nexus. Overall, this is as close as you can get to perfection.			"

												I played the elder scrolls IV: Oblivion first, and then i had this one.  Although it is a lot harder than the next two of the series, the scenery is still one of the most interesting, and the gameplay is still similar to them.  The only criticism would be how you have to levelling up works, which is harder to do than Oblivion, which had a lot less skills to learn.  All in all however, this is a really, really good game.

												The best game in the franchise if you ask me, the story and the fact that you can kill every singel NPC in the game is awsome. I truly felt like a god when I had drunk 300+ alchohol (that gave me about 600 strength) and killed a god with one strike with my sword and captured his soul. Now I have a soulgem worth 5 000 000 septims (not that anyone can afford to buy it) and I love it.			"

												Morrowind is a really great game that has a depth that subsequent TES games do not quite match. The interconnectively of some of the quests as well as the immersion and exotic locales give Morrowind a feel that is quite unlike Oblivion or Skyrim. The main cons of this game I would say is the combat which is much more stat based and boring. The game also does not have quest markers or the like which, while I find makes the quests more involving and immersive, might put off some people looking to quickly get into a game. Nevertheless, Morrowind is a great WRPG that truely showed what a TES game could be.			"

												Morrowind is one of my all time favourite games and will always have a special place in my heart. This game is what single handedly got me interested in making video games.The graphics were pretty good for the time, but they're definitely dated now, though there are mods that can fix that.The combat isn't the best.The skill system and the quests are interesting and really well done, as is the main story. Bethesda really needs to take a look back at this before making the next Elder Scrolls game. Oblivion and Skyrim are really simplified and too hand-holding on players.Morrowind is how you do RPGs right.			"

												Hands down my  favorite game ever made. Don' t let the time that Steam shows fool you. I've played countless hours on the original Xbox and the non Steam version.Don't get me wrong, I love Oblivion and Skyrim, but in my own opinion they do not even come close to competing with the detail this games brings. If you're looking for more fluid combat and an overall wayyyy easier gaming experience then go play either of those games. They are both great as you probably know. I myself don't like having a magic compass point me to my next quest. It makes you miss a lot of detail and cool things to be found if you're just following your compass from quest to quest. The lore and story in this game alone makes it worth the playthrough. The amount of content provided via NPC/Books is unbelievable. Once you play this game for a couple of hours you will overlook the dated combat and fall in love. Also, if you like more modernized graphics I recommend downloading MGSO. It updates many aspects of the game without straying from the vanilla experience. Buy it. You won't be disappointed. "

												Having played over 10,000 hours of this game since its release purchasing multiple copies over the last 15 years I would recommend this game to anyone. To me this is by far the best elder scrolls game ever made it truly felt like an entirely open world rpg that you could literally go out after making your PC and explore with very little boundries. The game was beautiful when it came out and the support from the mod communities continues to make it so. Morrowind a game well worth investing in. The story is rich the world is alien and unique the choices are nigh endless. If i where to introduce anyone to an rpg THIS IS THAT GAME. As far as the elder scrolls series I would always start anyone right here with Morrowind. If you are looking for an EPIC game that you can invist hours in you have found it. I hope that one day Bathsalts Studios will try to re-master Morrowind but leave all of the features the game has be as they are. That will never happen but i know the mod communities will keep this game alive for years to come.			"

Open MW only updates the game engine, making it far more stable, nothing else, so i do know the game and its quirks well.Morrowind does not infact take place within Morrowind, It takes place on the island of Vvardenfell, I direct you to Tamriel Rebuilt for full Morrowind land mass.More in depth than Skyrim in terms of enchanting, magics, weaponry and interesting character backstories and a fantasticly built up world and of course, the NEED for stats and decent thought on how you distribute them.Story starts similarly to Oblivion and Skyrim... and most TES games with the old prisoner shenanigans.Combat is intensely complex, needing relative knowledge of how the Races and Classes will effect how your character plays during the first say around 5-10 levels when EVERYTHING can mess up your day.Not as pretty as Skyrim in terms of the games appearance, but at the heart the game has more soul, Though the looks can be potentially fixed with MGSO (go check it out if your unsure).Still to this day I would willingly pay $40 for this as there is potentially tons of replayability, even in terms of main storylines.ALL NPC's can be killed, yep even so called ""Essentials"", you kill a main quest character.

												I'm going to open with pointing out my bias, because I played and loved this game endlessly on XBox back when it came out. Objectively, the graphics are very dated, and the gameplay does feel a little clunky. However if you're any fan of more classic RPG's, you need to give this game a look. Before Oblivion's more medieval landscape (Shivering Isles exheunt) and before Skyrim's Canada, Morrowind built a beautiful fantasy landscape, filled with spectacular creatures, varied characters, dwarven mechanations, and original quests.Technically speaking, the sound and graphics aren't much to speak of (though the music is adventurous, and really ups the experience). There is not much voice acting to speak of in most of this game, instead Bethesda opted for text boxes to save space. However, this opens the door for so much lore, and flavor text (which is important, damnit!) that this feels like the best crafted version of the Elder Scrolls universe. The game isn't levelled like it's predecessors, the world stays as it is, and you start out pretty weak. But it pushes you to be strong, and if you put the time in, you can overcome every challenge. There isn't a lot of emphasis on balance, because like a classic RPG, this game doesn't hold your hand. There isn't a compass to help you find quest points, instead you have a journal which subjectively directs you to your quest goal. For example, ""The cave is north of Seyda Neen, a bit past the bridge on the river."" It feels like a real adventure, going through it.If I were to price it: 30-Full price due to the age. But the game now can be found for incredibly cheap, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hard RPG experience.			"

												Morrowind has long been one of the best of the best.  What makes it so are the setting and the freedom.  I got into the franchise with Skyrim, but Morrowind is truly its pinnacle.  Sad to say we are unlikely to see anything like it as long as the corporate higher-ups at Bethesda see the Skyrim model as a safer bet.  Sure, Skyrim is prettier, and many people prefer its combat, but it just can't do as much, not even with mods.Really, I think what turns most people off the combat system isn't that it's based somewhat in RNG, it's that it's based somewhat in RNG but there's no animations showing what happened, leading to ridiculous situations where people go ""I stabbed that rat in the face at point blank range and missed!"" rather than ""It dodged again?!  I guess rats are really fast...""  I think the latter is enough more immersive that many people would be able to ignore it...so long as they know WHY they're missing (usually low fatigue because they're running everywhere).  While there doesn't seem to be a mod to accomplish this now, when the open-source engine OpenMW hits version 1.0 and a full release, this kind of mod should be entirely possible, among a host of other options, such as natively working on Linux.  (As of this review, OpenMW is on version 0.40 -- perfectly playable, but somewhat buggy and doesn't work with all mods.)  There are, however, mods to make the combat like that in Skyrim and Oblivion -- I recommend the mod Oblivion-like Combat, which, as far as I know, is still only found on the official Bethesda forums.Finding mods for Morrowind can take a bit more searching than it does for Skyrim.  Skyrim mods are mostly consolidated on the Nexus, with a few exceptions.  Morrowind mods on the Nexus are few and far between.  Most are found on Morrowind Modding History, Great House Fliggerty, or the personal websites of the authors.  MMH in particular is an archive for all the mods formerly hosted on sites like Planet Elder Scrolls and ElricM which have gone down over the years.  You can find some truly impressive and interesting stuff there and the quantity swamps the Nexus, with almost four times as many mods uploaded.  Between GFH, MMH, the Nexus and all the other small sites out there hosting a handful of mods, I'm pretty sure there are more Morrowind mods available for download than Skyrim, and they're capable of affecting a lot more.  Much of what's hardcoded in Skyrim's engine is able to be altered in Morrowind's, and because of the way the engine processes them as well as the scripting language used, scripts are both safer to use and more versatile.  Beyond that, for things that ARE hardcoded, we have external utilities like the Morrowind Code Patch to make the changes we need, in addition to the script extender and others.The other enormous advantage Morrowind has over its sequels is its setting, which is strange, and alien, and very good at telling a story through the world itself.  Morrowind is also where most of the series' interesting lore comes from.  If you don't know how anyone can care about TES lore and haven't played Morrowind, that's probably why.  One of their major writers for the game has written stuff that makes it look like he can't possibly be sober, and yet it somehow works.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, look up Michael Kirkbride.  The man is some strange variety of storytelling genius, even if he doesn't appear to be at first glance.Other majorly good things about Morrowind include its main quest, which is probably the highest-quality out of the series  (by a very long way if you're only comparing it to Skyrim, and a bit less if you also include Oblivion).  There's just something special about getting dropped on Vvardenfell with not a coin to your name and no idea what you're doing or why you're there, and working your way up to godlike power so you can face down a terrible threat to all of Tamriel...Or is he?  Delve into the lore and the backstories, and you find it's not all so cut-and-dry.  Are those who would see the armies arrayed in secret shrines and ancient ruins destroyed truly your friends, or did Dagoth Ur have the right of it the whole time?  You may need mods to actually side with the seemingly crazed living god, but even without them, you can see that he may not actually be the villain all the citizens of Morrowind are making him out to be.  That ambiguity makes for a fascinating main story, and unlike the later games, it's paced very well for an open-world game, because your foe is a schemer.  He's incredibly dangerous, but you never know how imminent that danger is.  There's no false sense of urgency; instead, there's a sense of inevitability about impending doom if you don't act.  You can leave the main quest completely alone in favor of side quests for hundeds of hours right in the middle and go back to it afterwards and it still feels like it makes sense in-game.The guild quests have no overarching story, but their self-contained stories are generally interesting, and it's far less immersion-breaking to become the head of every major faction because A) you need the skills that faction cares about to ever be promoted anywhere near that high, and B) as the Nerevarine, you are a uniter of squabbling factions against the threat from Red Mountain, and so it makes some sense to have you leading numerous guilds that would otherwise oppose each other when you need to make arch enemies cooperate in the face of a common threat.The side quests are also quite good, all of them hand-placed and written with care.  None of those stupid strings of radiant dungeon-delving quests we got in Skyrim.  Also, remember all those little pieces of DLC made for Oblivion and sold for a few bucks each?  Remember Horse Armor?  Well, Morrowind has a few of those as well, but they're completely FREE.  Nothing as stupid as horse armor, either.  Instead, you get small but good dungeon mods, short but decent quest mods, item mods with and without quests attached, and small immersion increases, and none of them cost you a penny.  They are also all excellent, and generally recommended, except where you can find versions you prefer made by the community around ideas they got from the official version.Finally, I would be most remiss not to mention the magic system.  There are all sorts of crazy things you can do.  Enchanting is also much more versatile than in Oblivion, let alone Skyrim.  On-use magic items are something that Oblivion did away with completely, but in Morrowind, you could use a ring to summon creatures, or an amulet to shoot fireballs.  Enchanting weapons with constant effects is gone in the later games as well.  Beyond that, people of a particularly diabolical mindset have been known to enchant robes with constant effect damage health and place them on NPCs they want to see die, and on-use items allow you to get powerful effects that would be beyond overpowered if they were constant, either at the level you get them or at all.  Furthermore, no TES game since has had anywhere near the diversity of magic effects found in Morrowind.  Spells having a chance of failure if you try to cast ones that are too powerful is also something that makes sense to me as a lover of fantasy and an effective self-balancing mechanism.  Yeah, you could try to cast that enormous fireball, and if it hit, everything you're after would die...but it only has a 55% chance of succeeding, and would drain most of your magicka to boot.  Maybe try something safer?  This means there's no hard skill checks, no magic number at which you suddenly get access to spells you couldn't cast before.  If you have enough magicka and are willing to take the chance of failure given, you can try any spell you can think of.  You might have to increase your skill for it to be worth the risk in the heat of battle, but trying new things in the middle of combat has always been a dangerous move in any case.  But it could pay off...			"

												One of the greatest games I have ever played.    I just want to highlight the skill system here, for some of the good and inherently bad things about it.The thing about the skill system in Morrowind is that it has many skills and possibilities, but it is solely based on the gods of RNG. The thing that's so bad about this (or, based on your perspective- good), is that everything you do is based on a percentage, a number, a sliver of chance as a new character. This means that even if you are an extremely powerful level 50 character, mastering all there is to know in the school of swordplay, you'll still have a chance of completely missing the enemy and doing no damage.   Another thing I see people fail to realise in their nostalgia is the fatigue system. There is literally no reason for me not to be able to throw fireballs at people's faces because my Fatigue is low. And because of this, the chance of casting is significantly lowered...that's all I'll say about that. It's incredibly aggravating.   The Graphics...they're extremely dated and about 13 years old. They haven't exactly aged well. But although this game doesn't look terrible, it can still be jarring for a new player to come from Skyrim or Oblivion into this game.   The Gameplay isn't incredible, but still fun. Even despite it's odd skill system. It's Classic RPG fundamentals are, in a way, the lifeblood of this game, despite it's oddities. In no other game can you walk up to a slow-moving mudcrab at level 1, completely miss every swing, and get yourself killed. Despite this, you can do anything you want, kill anyone or anything you want, steal, plunder, or even become the Grandmaster of almost every guild. Despite this, the game does NOT hold your hand. You have to work for what you want. Don't have enough gold for that Dreugh Helmet? Go to that dwarven ruin over the hill, kill everything inside, and find the treasures within. This game really captures the scope and expanse you would expect of an entire continent, even in just the space of an island. You can be running through the rolling hills of the grazelands, and the next minute you're in the middle of Molag Amur, in the midst of pools of lava and ash. That being said, it still takes a while for that transition. Even for an old game, the map is huge.   The Story is one of the pinnacles of this game. In more recent years, the story has not been bland, per se- but rather, it has been turned into this constant story that the game will try to make you feel inclined to stay with until that story has ended. For example, in Skyrim the main story was very heavily forced upon you. They try to create this false sense of ""urgency"" that you just do not find in this game. You are thrust into this world with no money, no hope, and no future. You are not respected as an outlander. People don't like the idea of integrating the ignorant ""n'wahs"" into their society. As with anything in this game, you must earn their respect. There is tons of side-quests which, I will argue, are about 30-40% ""Go fetch this for me"" quests or, ""Go kill this man for me"". But even in these quests, Morrowind most definitely has an extensive story to tell, and quite an enthralling one at that.   The DLC in this game is phenominal! Much like the other Elderscrolls games, the downloadable content in this game is extremely good. (Minus the horse armor from Oblivion!) Rich, and deep with story- the activites and things to do in them are quite extensive. The first time I had gone to the Clockwork City in Tribunal, I KNEW that I would remember that experience in gaming forever. I was in awe of this world created by a man-turned-god. Which is a feeling you don't get in most games today.   All-in-all, I think that this is a great game- and definitely stands the test of time today. With a few mods (which are still being made in 2015), this game can definitely net you countless hours of mudcrab-bashing fun. Definitely worth picking up, if you haven't already.			"

												A game that you can always come back for more. The adventures in this game never end, from finding hidden gold and rare items in a sunken ship to seeing a guy falling from the sky. The enemies in this game are priceless as is the game itself. The only Con about Morrowind is the outdated graphics since it was released a decade ago. But you can also download a mod to retexture the whole game to HD with improved textures,skys and well everything in between. But i keep it original :)			"

												I was suprised at how much I enjoyed Morrowind coming to it after playing the likes of Oblivion and Skyrim. I concentrated mainly on the story which was gripping and interesting. I enjoyed learning about Morrowind's history and looking into the lives of the people of Vvardenfell. However I found that exploration grew tiresome due to bland terrains and huge slow paced walking distances. This reason also lead to me giving up on side missions. Overall I believe Morrowind is a great purchase based on its story, but the newer games of the Elder Scrolls series are much better purchases.			"

												Truly a classic. While Skyrim drew the attention of casuals and babbie's first RPG's, Morrowind has always been a game to respect the player and his choices. There is no such thing as an important character in the game's eyes. Actions will always have consequences. Kill an important character? That's your choice, live with the consequences or reload a save. Sold a quest item? Shouldn't have done that, all your fault. It feels more like a game as opposed to a sandbox. You can do anything, but the world isn't here for you to just ride it.			"

												Много слышал о том, что Морровинд морально устарел. Сам на сей почве накрепко рассорился с парой неплохих людей. И на почве уважения к пиратам, у которых качаю игры для пробы, перед покупкой. Но это прошлое.А по мне, Морр уже не устареет, живая классика с великолепной графикой. Ну чуть устаревшей. Он либо может затянуть с первой мелодии, либо с первой мелодии отвратить.А меня вот затянула рецензия на ещё вышедшую игру, вернее короткая новость в Навигаторе игрового мира вроде. Что смешно, тогда и заинтересовался игрой из за графики) Ну и комп кроме видеокарты, вполне Морровинд тянул.Потом было несколько прохождений, некоторый шок от того сколько всего пропустил в игре. С самого начала зачищая пещеры, пропускал тем самым квесты. Да и сами квесты не искал, кроме возврата кубка из одной из пещер. Находишь кубок именной, потом случайно замечаешь новую тему в разговоре, и короткий квест пошел) Никаких особых подсказок, ничего нет, думаешь сам.За полтора примерно десятка лет, игра не потеряла в интересе, жаль продолжения после неё кажутся халтурой.На сем заканчиваю, ибо хандру воспоминания о новых вызывают.

												After playing almost 200 hours of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, I decided to give Morrowind a try, as everyone says it's the best entry in the series. I bought this game back in 2012, and played it for about 1 hour; I didn't like it at all, it started out slowly, I had to read a crapton of stuff, and I got easily lost in about half an hour, so I stopped playing it.Two years later, I decided to give this game another try. It's seriously one of the best RPG's ever.The game is slow, I simply accepted that and decided to take it all slowly, read all texts, even take notes IRL so I don't get lost and I remember important stuff; the graphics are a bit outdated, yeah, but nothing Morrowind Graphics Extender can't help; the lore is awesome, everyone seems important (except those slaves you free) to the game, the gameplay is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it's dice-based, but it gets pretty cool in mid-end game, and the best part: The Soundtrack.Totally recommend this game, may not attract everyone, but those who like this type of game will fall in love with Morrowind.

It offers what made Daggerfall great, but streamlines it a great deal and thus makes it much more accessible to new players. Despite a clunky combat system, greatly aged graphics, and a buggy nature, it's an enjoyable game where the prospect of exploring the alien world presented on the island of Vvardenfell offers new and interesting locales and inter-faction conflicts to experience.

												This was my first Elder Scrolls Game and is one of my favorite games of all time. I first played it on the Xbox. When I first saw my brother playing it I thought it was stupid as I seen my brother wandering the world and I always refused to try it. But one day he made me try the game and then I was addicted. When I first played the game I didn’t do any quest I just got a house the good old way by killing its owner in Ald-Ruhn, Gnisis and Khuul. Later on in 2008 I got the game for the PC and made mods that I dreamed of playing. I don’t mod the game anymore but I still play the game and it never gets old. I also play the game for quests now unlike I did when I first played and that the best part of the Elder Scrolls series. Your free to wander, kill, steal, help others, betray, travel by foot, swim, travel by boat or silt strider which is their stagecoaches, it was endless. And If you got bored I always started a new save and it was memories all over again. The two expansion packs Tribunal and Bloodmoon are the best expansions packs I've ever played in any Elder Scrolls game, especially Bloodmoon. It adds a green forest and snowy environment which isn't available in the rest of the game. And the Tribunal expansion only added a city but a big city to the game with a 20 hour main storyline which I thought was impressive and very enjoyable. And the free little add-on DLCs that were made by Bethesda are pretty cool too especially the Seige At Firemoth plug-in. I recommend this game to anyone who hasn’t played an Elder Scrolls game and if you have played an Elder Scrolls game you may want to get mods and high-res textures that make it more like the newer Elder Scrolls game so it doesn’t seem old to you such as the games combat, menus, or graphic. Its an older game and for some gamers its maybe too old for them and not enjoyable. If you unsure watch some gameplay to decide for yourself.			"

												From my prespective, still the best game of The Elder Scroll series, might unfortunately remain so, and maybe the best RPG single person sand box exploration title ever published.I love the immersiveness and complexity of the gameworld, background lore and especially the underlying race / faction / personality reaction adjustments. The race selection is actually more than just a cosmetic choice especially in the beginning when your fame is low, with dominant Imperials having the easiest start and the enslaved beastie-races having the hardest get-go. I've actually gotten attached to the Imperials because that was first CHAR I ever created in Morrowind to give myself just that slight edge with the learning curve I expected to be pretty steep, which it was. I just kept on exploring and stubbornly figuring ways to get around my initial limitations, and am ever since faithfully enamoured. One such trick I particularly vividly recall was using Scroll of Icarian Flight - acrobatics +1000 if memory serves - when at some point I got a bit stuck not having yet figured out that ""Levitate"" is really a must! Or trying to frantically remember what I did with my sucky imperial armour, because I could not get my next assignment without knowing ""where was my uniform.""Also, the different regions feel distinct, as well as the most important factions actually have a network of outposts in the contient, requiring more than doing a few odd tasks to raise through the ranks.I personally strongly prefer the major/minor skills and attributes character build up: pimping up your character if you choose to is surely part of the TES legend!Graphically Morrowind vanilla version is obviously somewhat dated, but that has never personally bothered me.Would rate the main questline above both Oblivion and Skyrim perso. The soundtrack is ""typical superb TES"" as well, composed by good ol' Jeremy Soule. "

												Have replayed Morrowind at least three times..absolutely my favourite game. It is an older game and the graphics are not up to par with many modern games (plus you can still get ""stuck"" in a rock or fall through the floor, necessitating a reload) but the brilliant story line, rich and detailed world of Morrowind itself, huge open world (so much to see and do, you can get lost and die out there, so save often), and masses of quests are the reason I come back to play. Your character can be crafted in any way you want...stealth, melee, ability to mend your own gear, magic (so many spells). The game can still crash but I found the steam version much better than having the game on disc (less crashy)...saving often is a must. There  is also no real hand holding, so paying attention to your world, increasing your skills and reading (the conversations, books, your journal) will point you in the right direction (maybe...I did die a few times before I got the hang of the game). Absolute must play for rpg fans.			"

												At first I was unsure if I would enjoy this game or not because of the people saying the combat system was tough or the quests were hard because there was no compass with a way-point telling you where to go since I was used to that stuff, but when I bought it I really enjoyed it. The lack of way-points gives you a reason to read every bit of text to find out where you're going to be headed and makes this game very engaging. The combat system led me to stop playing the game for about a week until I looked it up and found out that you had to be skilled in the weapon you were using and that enemies could dodge. Also I learned that you should sell items to earn money when you're starting off. Those made me be able to enjoy the game. So far at the time of this review I have 5 hours and I haven't gotten anywhere in the quests so I can expect this game to be a very long game. This game has aged very well for being 13 years old. I would rate this game 10/10.			"

												This game came out in 2002, yet it manages to capture the spirit of adventure better than many games that came out in 2012. Add on top of that a well thought out, powerful story, and you've got the makings of a cult classic video game.Highly Recommend.			"

												I've owned this since it released on XBOX.  This is truely a masterpiece which I have logged more than about 1000 hours in outside of steam with no problem.If you're one of the kiddies who think graphics are what define a game, go play Skyrim.  But if you're the one who loves and enjoys this classic of which is best in the series, this is for you.  This game is the most expansive in the series and contains a lot more to discover than in the next two games.  It is titled 'Game of the Year' but in my case I would scratch 'year' out of the logo and replace it with 'century'.This is one of the best RPG piece made ever in history, hands down.If it is your first time playing, you have to be patient as you progress because usually the beginning of the game is very slooooow, but it is worth it as you go.  There is lots of loot to collect and horde and many fun exploits (huehue) that spice the game up a bit.  There are lots of skills you will master in this game, just note that marksmanship is a bit finickey but you will eventually master it.			"

												This was the first game that was truly an escape for me as a child. It has an intensely vivid and intriguing storyline and lore. You will spend years exploring and loving the game.I have brought this game 4 times over several consoles throughout the years.I do recommend to cheat while you play this game as the mechanics are very dated and for people coming from Oblivion and Skyrim, you will not be able to look past it to get to the story line. This game is massive and has so many little things to find in the world. It has the best sky in all the fallout games and you could just spend hours looking at the night sky in the game. "

												You know when you try and force the same poles of two magnets together? That's what the combat is like.Get lost, die, reload, repeat. Once lost three days worth of progress because Skyrim softened me up with not one, but FOUR autosaves.>Leave starting town>Elf falls on head>""Scroll of Icarian Flight"">Sure, why not>Nooooooooooooooooooooooope>Two uses later>Cool, SolstheimYou will cark it constantly. I'm not even sure if enemies scale. Some stuff will one-shot you no matter what. People won't buy your ♥♥♥♥ if you've got drugs, but if you dump them at your feet, sure. It looks like ♥♥♥♥. (hey, it's an old game) It sounds like ♥♥♥♥. In most games, you're the best entity in the world. In Morrowind, you're supposed to be a pretty good entity. You're not. You'll die to an unarmed farmer because you accidently stole a cup. Fight or flight? More like die or cliff racer tornado. This game is harder and more frustrating than dark souls ever was for me. Oh, and Sheogorath's voice acting makes him sound like an accountant.However,10/10, would get paralysed by a scrib againAnd the soundtrack is at a solid 11/5			"

												From my prespective, still the best game of The Elder Scroll series, might unfortunately remain so, and maybe the best RPG single person sand box exploration title ever published.I love the immersiveness and complexity of the gameworld, background lore and especially the underlying race / faction / personality reaction adjustments. The race selection is actually more than just a cosmetic choice especially in the beginning when your fame is low, with dominant Imperials having the easiest start and the enslaved beastie-races having the hardest get-go. I've actually gotten attached to the Imperials because that was first CHAR I ever created in Morrowind to give myself just that slight edge with the learning curve I expected to be pretty steep, which it was. I just kept on exploring and stubbornly figuring ways to get around my initial limitations, and am ever since faithfully enamoured. One such trick I particularly vividly recall was using Scroll of Icarian Flight - acrobatics +1000 if memory serves - when at some point I got a bit stuck not having yet figured out that ""Levitate"" is really a must! Or trying to frantically remember what I did with my sucky imperial armour, because I could not get my next assignment without knowing ""where was my uniform.""Also, the different regions feel distinct, as well as the most important factions actually have a network of outposts in the contient, requiring more than doing a few odd tasks to raise through the ranks.I personally strongly prefer the major/minor skills and attributes character build up: pimping up your character if you choose to is surely part of the TES legend!Graphically Morrowind vanilla version is obviously somewhat dated, but that has never personally bothered me.Would rate the main questline above both Oblivion and Skyrim perso. The soundtrack is ""typical superb TES"" as well, composed by good ol' Jeremy Soule. "

												Incredibly good. The level of paranoia one can feel when roaming the confined halls of Vivec is astounding. On my first or second time with this game, I had the good fortune to run into a Mage who falls out of the sky. I take his scrolls of super flight and save the game. I then find a rock to use as a ramp and, after a few tries, fly directly to Vivec's palace, winding up in the second to top tier. I understood this as a sign that Morrowind is just really an incredible game. Despite being a UFO, I did not receive discounts on skooma.			"

												Perhaps the best RPG ever made. Graphics are a bit out dated, but there are mods for that. I recommend Morrowind Overhaul 3.0. It will set up most things automatically, and then let you set specific things that you want. It breathes life back into one of my favorite games.Don't be fooled by newer Elder Scrolls games such as Oblivion and Skyrim. This game is difficult to start up. It's unforgiving. You may die in the first cave. Don't give up though. Explore, gather loot, and learn how to best use your fatigue.There is no hand holding in this game. No quest markers, no fast travel (unless you use the town to town system and even that costs gold), and enemies don't level with you. You can wander into zones where you have no business being.I can not recommend this game enough. It's a masterpiece.			"

I don't care for graphics/eye candy as much as some others might, furthermore it may still be the best in the elder scrolls series! I Highly Recommend this game to anyone who is considering buying it or has enjoyed any number of the elder scrolls series. If you want some 'fancier' graphics than I recommend using the Morrowind OverHaul Mod, it improves the graphics, fixes a bunch of bugs while adding a couple of convenient mechanics and making the animations of walking/running much better than they were before.

A true classic open world RPG For me the most enjoying playthrough was becoming a vampire, then carefully exploring the map in the night and spending daylight time in dungeons. By luck I found my blood clan's Dwemer HQ. Doing my clan's questline I found a book on healing vampirism, so I rid myself of it and proceed to main quest, in the end becoming Vvardenfel's ultimate explorer and savior.The amount of content in this game is extremely large, you could easily end up playing this game casually for years.Most will praise this game for mods, but I don't. I Found having a clearer font mod, few basic texture mods is more than enough for me to enjoy the game.This is THE game to immerse yourself in it, not to pwn and own. "

												Good:You are truly free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want. The game world is incredibly rich and complex. The main story is amazing, but there are also a huge number of side quests, which the game actively encourages you to explore. I didn't even get past the first mission of the main quest in my first year or so of playing. Unlike the other TES games, you usually have to work hard to get the best gear, which makes it far more rewarding. Bad:The graphics aren't the best, although that can be fixed with mods. The combat system takes a bit of getting used to, although it can be very rewarding when you reach higher levels. Overall, this is probably my favourite game of all time. The graphics and combat are quite dated, but if you can get past that, you are in for a fantastic open-world experience.			"

												I bought this game back in the early retail days, but due to a fire I lost that copy. I recently found Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim on sale with all downloadable content/expansions for cheap here on Steam, so I bought them. I loved the sheer variety of the paths you could travel and guilds/factions you could join. You could enchant your clothing/armor and weapons with magical effects, pick locks, cast awesome destructive abilities, heal, affect your enviroment, etc. I liked the fact you had 10 major/minor skills that leveled you up, but I hated the level 50ish limit on your levels. In order to maximize your stat bonuses you needed to micromanage your skill growth to an absurd level in order to achieve the 100 stats.  Also, after you do the available faction quests (again, you can't join but ONE of the three Great Houses, which does make some sense, but you can join opposing factions, such as the thieves guild, and the imperial legion, or the morag tong, which is almost the same boat.) and the Great House of your choice and the expansions, you can roam the lands to find random quests from people along the roadways. Overall grade: 9.8/10			"

I'm slowly learning my way around cities like Vivec, and I'm able to walk from place to place without getting lost (for the most part).

If you can pick-up Morrowind for $9.99, go for it. Otherwise, if you are new to these games, go with Oblivion or Skyrim first. I can go to Skyrim & play for an hour doing side quests, and have fun hunting vampires or bandits. Morrowind is a little more like work than vacation, but I will persist with it until I either give up in frustration, or decide that I love it.

But you are able to get into another quest chain which hides inside itself a great journey at literaly every corner.If you are just a light gamer and you preffer the new games, this game might not be for you. It does not guide you by your hand. You actualy need to play and read everything yourself.Still, I might actualy recommend it for everyone that can embrace the beauties of this old game. Games nowadays lack alot, and you will understand that only if you play a masterpiece like Morrowind was.			"

												I'm not going to lie I was always put off by this game because of it's dated graphics and tabletop game fighting aspects, but one day I decided to get it. It blew my mind! It was so fun because it was actually brutal on you unlike Skyrim and Oblivion that could make you god sometimes. You want something? Go out and kill ten mudcrabs and collect fifteen mushrooms then you might get 50 gold. Those mudcrabs lower your health? Okay say goodbye to those gold coins so you can get yourself healed. By far the best Elder Scrolls game in my opinion. If you don't have it, get it. If you do have it, play it. If you are playing it right now, you know what you are doing.			"

												Ahhh, The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind! I want to start by saying that yes I am a fan boy, but I wont let that get in the way of giving the best, most accurate review of this game as I can. Years ago, this game as many remember, was released on the orginal xbox ( was also on PC but I mean come on) which is where the elder scrolls series reallllly took off imo, and back then I could not get enough of this game. So to keep it simple, ill make a semi-detailed list of the pros and cons of Morrowind:Pros:-The best story of all the elderscrolls ( an opinion but if you give it a chance, youll see why ) so far, very in depth and extremely detailed.- THE MUSIC, MY GOD THE MUSIC. They actually used a sample of Morrowinds theme song in Skyrim, anyone who played morrowind before hand will have recognized it, thats how good the music is, tBethesda pretty much recycled it lol. You can get lost in the pleasent music and ambient backround sounds, and the combat music gets you on your oes in a split second. Playing Morrowind really makes me feel like im in a foreign land, an alien world. No other elder scroll game can capture that essence like Morrowind DID. This  set the bar reaaaaallly high, and honeslty I have yet to play another game where I was so enveloped in its atmosphere, it's captivating, magical and wonderful. - Character Customization/Class creation:  Same Races as the other Elder scroll games, not too in depth as far as how many types of face/hair etc you can choose. however the game has an awesome way of helping players to choose what role may fit them best which is unique ONLY TO MORROWIND. You can customize your class completely from the ground up, choose from a list of pre-set classes, or answer a series of questions and depending on how you answer these questions, the game will suggest a class for you. ( which you do not have to take if you dont want )- The NPC's : Morrowinds NPCs are very interactive, there are 3 different forms of persuasion you can use to try and get information from NPCs, not only that but there are many other ways to get information needed. Simply being a good person in game will help you, unless you decide to go on an extreme killing spree without going to jail, people will be afraid of you, word of who you are will travel across the land, and in some events NPCs will completely refuse to speak to you yet alone help you. - Vvardenfell is the continent Morrowind is held on ( if you get the GOTY, which I would highly suggest if you enjoyed the regular version, can port your character right over ) and during your travels ( you will have access to something that can transport you from town to town for a small cost, its called a SIlt Strider, looks like a giant flea and can be found in most cities) you will find tons of ruins, mines, bandit camps, and much more to explore. Vvardenfell has so many secrets hidden and locked away, and among those secrets is the tresure, the loot, the good stuff. There are tons of quests, and guilds, and side missions to do;  unlike the newer ES games, Morrowind is set in a harsh land where things are much more powerful than you are, and forces you to flee until you get stronger or can formulate a soild plan of attack and escape. There is no random loot, things are where they are which I personally like, it always gave me a particular goal to work towards like killing that guy for his armor, or robbing a certain store and teleporting out before the guards come. - THE MAGIC SYSTEM! Again, unlike any of the other Elderscroll games, Morrowind allows you create and customize your own spells.  ( one CON is that while casting spells, you have a chance to fail completely and use up mana which will make the start of the game very tough) Now there is a limitation to this; you must have the required skill level of magic in order to successfully cast a spell. You can make any spell you'd like, but in reality some you just wouldnt be able to cast if you make them too crazy. Was def one of my favorite things about the game, being able to make my own spells. There are spells in Morrowind that were removed ( jumping spells, levitating spells, MARK AND RECALL...) in Oblivion and never made a return, sadly. Now, the CONS:- RPG like combat. This means early on, when you start your game it will be very tough to kill things. You will swing your weapon and miss over and over until a few blows actually land. The thing with Morrowind is that even RUNNING drops your fatigue, and with lower fatigue your chance to cast spells/ strike your target decreases . So, the less stamina you have, the lower the chance youll have to hit something/ cast a spell. This can make the game frustraiting for some players, pushing them away from the start. As your skills go up , naturally so will how much you are able to hit something or cast a spell, once you get a skill to 100, you will always hit no matter what, but fatigue will still effect how much damage you do per swing etc. If you're really liking the game, just push through this- find the correct trainers for your skill set ( mages guild, fighters guild, theives guild, Morag tong [ assassin guild ]  etc ) and this wont be a problem for very long.  - Vvardenfell- IS IT TOO BIG..? It might be, for those who dont have an adventerous spirit, you might find the world too expansive.  Often times you will have to run on foot ( or use spells...!?!? ) to new destinations, and it is possible you can actually get very lost .  There are a lot of other ways to travel around Vvardenfell, and youll figure that out in time, but still looking for a partclar person or a particular place in such a large world can be extremely difficult and at times, demoralizing. - EVERYONE AND ANYONE CAN BE KILLEDIt would do you well to remember this, because in the newer elder scroll games they disable the ability to kill characters who are important to the main story. Well, in morrowind you may kill whoever youd like, whenever if youre powerful enough. You will not knock them out, they will be killed. The NPC will die and you will be able to loot them. HOWEVER..if and when you kill a NPC that is important to the main story, a large box will appear in your bottom left hand corner warning you of what you've just done, and how in doing so the main story line has been severed and you can never finish it. At which point you may reload your game, or you can carry on and keep playing because the rest of the world is still in action with plenty to do, but I wouldnt suggest it. -THIS GAME IS TOUGH. Morrowind can be very unforgiving. Save often or else youll find yourself losing hours of progress, which is extremely disheartening. -ALL IN ALL- The Elderscrolls 3 : Morrowind is wonderful game that has a tough learning curve, its not nearly as easy to play as  ES4: Oblivion or ES5: Skyrim and so if you dont want a challenge, a real one, don't pick it up. However if youre a big fan of the Elderscroll series, and you like games where you can see real progress overtime,  pick this gem up, you wont regret it. This is one of those things in life where you wish you could forget about it ever existing, just so you could go back and discover it all over again for the first time. "

												There's just something about this game that really hit the sweet spot for Bethesda RPGs.  It's not cut down significantly like recent Fallout/Elder Scrolls games, but at the same time it's not so huge as to be an impossibly glitchy mess like Daggerfall.  This is probably my favorite Elder Scrolls game despite the hiccups.Keep in mind that this being an Elder Scrolls game, many of the cons can be patched away with mods.Pros:- Much greater amounts of unique text than modern Elder Scrolls games.- Spell-crafting system is pretty much unlimited and is really fun to mess around with.- Environment and wildlife is very strange; it's unusual to have a game with the entire ecosystem based on a harsh volcanic island, never mind the magic influence.- Plot is very interesting and can be as deep or shallow as you want to put the effort in to be.- You can choose to kill quest-vital NPCs, and the game will kindly tell you you've done so in case you wish to re-load. (Much nicer option than ""NPC just won't die for some reason"" in later games)Cons:- 2000s-era graphics and a lot of unvoiced lines, if these things matter to you.- Random townsfolk tend to not have anything interesting to say if they don't have a quest for you.- Dice-based combat is not for everyone, and makes combat really difficult before you get more Agility/Stamina/Magic Skill.- The name of the game is Morrowind, but only part of Morrowind is present. (Of course, the game would've probably taken 5 extra years if it was all there...)			"

												This game is great.  It has not aged well but if you get mods or something like that you should be good.  I would reccomend another Elder Scrolls game over this however.  The combat in this game is just not nearly as good, but with mods like skywind it will still be one of the best games of all time.  The story is great and the world is huge, not to mention the various side quests.  If you are into Elder Scrolls games than this is a must have but still I would highly reccoment modded over vanilla.			"

No hand-holding, no dumbing down gameplay, huge open world to do anything, and the freedom is what I want. If you don't care about any of that, stay FAR away from me and this game.

												I have well over 500 hours in Skyrim (counting all platforms), 350 hours in Oblivion and probably around 350 hours in Morrowind in total...so far, and it is my opinion that Morrowind gives the best RPG and TES experience of this threesome (I am leaving out Arena and Daggerfall as I haven't really gotten around to playing them properly yet). The main story of Morrowind (which is the only real questline in the game without the expansions) is simply many levels above what is presented to us in Oblivion and Skyrim as I see it. Even though the graphics are now very outdated, I still feel the game world in Morrowind feels more ""real"" than in the two latest games - the reason for this is probably that Morrowind is much more lore-rich and that no matter where you go and what you do you still feel connected with the main plot and the workings of Dunmer society (which you will be intimately familiar with in this game).Morrowind's greatest asset is probably the sense of wonder and strangeness the game world instills in the player and its very rewarding exploration. Some have called Morrowind ""the last real TES game"", and while I'm not going to make that claim it is clear that the dumbing down of the series and the extreme hand-holding of the player in say Skyrim has not exactly made the series take a direction that I'm very happy with. In Morrowind you often have to read to discover what to do and where to go at times and at other times you will have to think - there are no quest markers in this game to ruin this part of the game. Many people complain about the combat in Morrowind, and reasonably so if the game is to be compared to modern action titles - this was never the point however: this game is supposed to be an RPG with many mechanics taken from table-top RPG gaming. Seen in this light the combat system is altogether decent and in my opinion can be quite fun. In vanilla Morrowind for instance you can not manually block with your shield, something that probably sounds ridiculous to modern players - it makes perfect sense though seen from the perspective of old-school RPG-gaming where it is your character's stats and abilities that govern the outcome of an action and not the players own skills of reaction and button-timing and what not.All in all I strongly recommend this game and I urge all fans of TES to try it out no matter their feelings about the lack of an action-oriented combat system, because in my opinion this game is simply a better RPG experience than we get in Oblivion or Skyrim. A far better one. Oblivion and Skyrim are games I will probably never play again (been there done that...), but Morrowind I will return to again and again.			"

												The Elder Srolls Series i think is one of those Love and/or Hate series because of its take on the RPG genre.The Story Lines are really deep and there is huge amounts of background lore scattered about through side quests, books in game, or even just by listening to the NPC's converse with one another. Insane, I know. Still one of the Largest free roam RPG's of its time probably even bigger than some AAA MMORPG's (before major expansions of course).Combat is where it was hit or miss with people, you can still attack at will, yet some features like your shield skills were based upon a hidden RTD (roll the dice) feature that rolled your chance to block attacks until it leveled up and made your shield skills grow. There is plenty of secret areas (not really secret anymore since im sure theyve all been documented and plundered since) and large areas and dungeons to explore.***If you want the Hardest play through possible without any help from the game or the gods, kill Vivec when you first meet him, loot the note and item from him. You will get a message pretty much the same one you get from killing any important NPC suggesting that you restart from a save. This is an Easter Egg***For those with a great computer i suggest grabbing the Morrowind Overhaul 3.0 (Final Version) mod which has many great graphical upgrades as well as bug fixes & tweaking options for better gameplay.http://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/ "

												I played the heck out of Skyrim recently, and this one is so far my favorite in the series.-I personally loved the lack of fast travel, since it extends the gameplay and forces you to pay for traveling services, or go on foot and face the horror that is the disease spreading fauna of Vvardenfell.-I also loved the lack of quest markers. I feel like quest markers in Skyrim diminish the gameplay by straight up telling you were you need to go without forcing you to explore and find your own way, or ask for directions.-The class system and the very minor limitations to skills it imposes really appealed to me. As a Nord Barbarian, I have trouble casting spells; but that makes sense since…Well… I’m not a spell caster. If I wanted to be a spell casting Barbarian, I would have to pay a trainer enough for me to not fail my spell casting as much as I currently do, while in Skyrim, as someone with a thief build, I would have to buy the Flames spell from a shopkeeper and burn some random mudcrabs in order to become a master of destruction.

												Before getting Morrowind, Skyrim was the only Elder Scrolls game that I played. We all know how ""almost"" perfect Skyrim is, so I won't bother getting into that. For those who have played Skyrim, they know it almost feels like being immersed into a videogame life, like you get to live in a different world while getting addicted to the quests, the characters, the cities and villages, and the lore itself. Morrowind captures that same exact feeling. The combat takes some patience, but after you get the handle on that, the game is phenomenal. It really shows the perfect image of an Elder Scrolls game, not to mention, without this game, what we know as the modern day RPG genre would be different. This game defines the RPG genre. I've grown to love this game, and I hope you will too.			"

												What I love about this game is the way you can make each playthrough unique. What makes this game different from for example Skyrim, is how you have to specialise in skills in order to succeed. In Skyrim you can get good at everything, which isn't exactly something that could realistically happen. What this does also is that unless you in Skyrim keep making new characters before you reach a high level (which is what I did) there's not really as much replayability in that game. More things I love about Morrowind is the lack of skaling (which made Skyrim too easy at high levels and Oblivion too hard) and the quests. The combat is a bit dated though, so it takes some getting used to. The dialogue is also very stupid. Every NPC basically acts like an information dispenser. Also, there's not much voice acting, which is both a pro and a con. You can have more dialogue, you don't have to listen to the same voice actors on different NPCs like later TES games, but because of no voice acting they don't have much personality, a problem which is exaggerated by the fact that 95% of all NPCs have THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING LINES. Don't be fooled by all those Morrowind fanboys who think every Elder Scrolls game since this one is awful in comparison, and that you're a filthy casual if you disagree with them. All 3 are awesome games IMHO, and I have both good and bad things to say about them.			"

												The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is a classic Open World RPG. It allows you freedom to do what you wish, go where you choose, right after you complete the intro. It won't hold your hand, or coddle you though, so you have to play smartly... wander too far in the wrong direction and you may find yourself getting chomped or blown to bits by something way too powerful for you. The combat is kinda clunky, and in my opinion, one of the game's few weak points... but the depth you'll find in this game is something many games these days sorely lack. You could spend over 100 hours in this game and find half of what lies within it's world.  The characters, plot, and background lore are all carefully crafted, within a vast, rich wold.Play this game if you want a challenge, deep story, and love open world fantasy RPG's. Also, check out the mods and fan restoration projects that update this game's graphics to some surprisingly impressive levels for how old it is.			"

												This game is pretty old with old gameplay features but Morrowind is my favourite elder scrolls game thanks to it's wonderfull map and it's amazing main story. The world of morrowind is very mysterious and harsh, full of weird plants and creatures. Some caves are actually scary thanks to crazy sound effects and dark enviroments. There are strong, weird and sometimes funny special weapons and armor that you can find or earn by quests. You can only be in one guild at a time and this makes it feel more impactfull. You can still do enchantment and blacksmithing. There is also another feature wich I enjoy thats called spellcrafting. You can creat your own spells and make them crazy overpowered. You get levetating spells and jumping spells to get to places you can only get to if you can jump or levetate high enough. The weather is very cool, there are sandstorms, thunderstorms, clearweather and a day and night cycle. You are not allowed to rest in the cities and towns, you can only wait or you can go and sleep on your bed if you own one. If i'm correct you can also own houses in Morrowind. You still get to choos all races and you get to create your own class or choos from the premade classes. There are spears, staffs, longswords, shortswords, axes, hammers, bows, daggers and much more weapons.I feel the most involved in this world out of cyrodiil and skyrim.			"

												Quite possibly the greatest RPG of all time. Don't let outdated graphics discourage you -- there's mods for that if you really need to have shiny graphics. In fact, 15 years after the game came out, it's still being actively modded. That really says something about the game and what it means to people.			"

												This game is a classic, It's one of those RPGS you must play through once in your life. A game that still holds up to the newer generation of gamers. This game has a lot to explore,  a lot to do. You can do almost anything, but this game makes you earn the stuff you want. You also need to do a lot of thinking and prep planning before you take on a harder task. This game also has a lot of story,  guilds, tribes, races, classes, skills, and spells. But starting off isn't easy. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who don't have patience, other than that PLAY IT.			"

You do get the random creeper NPC's of course, if you know what I mean but being how magical this world is, its not uncommon for there to be psychos. Anywho, its a wonderful game, nice sights, fun to play, interesting story, and gives you tons of things to do. If you are looking for a good RPG game then this game is for you. If you played the other Elder Scrolls series of games then you'd know this game is not one to miss out on.			"

												Morrowind is arguably the best in the Elder Scrolls series for several reasons which I will go into detail in this review. If you're on the fence about this game, hopefully I can bring some insight to the wary. Please note that Morrowind is by no means a perfect game, but has some incredibly redeeming qualities about it that will keep you coming back for more no matter your experience with other RPGs or Elder Scrolls games.You're sent to Morrowind on a prison ship along with one other, for reasons left unkown to the player, with a missive from the emperor himself. There has been rumours abound for a long time in Morrowind that Saint Nerevar, a powerful Dark Elf from ancient days past, would be reincarnated and rid Morrowind of the outlanders and protect her from it's enemies. The emperor has suspicions that the player may be one who could fulfill this prophecy, and sends you to the island of Vvardenfell within the province of Morrowind. There had been plenty of 'false incarnates' of Nerevar in the past, who claimed to be the reincarnated hero, but all of whom were proven false by the roaming Ashlander tribes that inhabit Vvardenfell. This is basically your introduction to the game.After you exit the prison ship, you choose your race and which skills to favour, and they basically hand you a note to deliver and tell you 'good luck!' From here, the world is open to you, and you can choose any path you wish. The world is truly massive and you can pursue whatever suits your fancy. There are few limitations in Morrowind as to what you can do; you can kill every single character in the game, for example, which the later Elder Scrolls games lack. You can rob entire stores, kill the 'false gods' (tribunal), claim an entire city as your own... The possibilities are rather overwhelming at first.The magic system is probably the best of any of the games, allowing you to create your own spells in several schools of magic, including the ability to levitate high above the ground or jump several kilometres in a single bound. You can use bound weapons and armor at the same time, and even create one spell to not only bind a weapon but also a set of armor to wear. The enchanting system is impeccable, allowing for 'constant effect' enchanting, which can allow you to heal your health constantly without the use of spells, or constantly have several flame atronachs or golden saints following you at all times. The spellcrafting and enchating in Morrowind offers a lot of different combinations and possibilities to make your character the most powerful being in all Tamriel.The combat system is clunky, and rather lackluster. Depending on your skill with a weapon, you will either hit or miss, even if you're aiming directly at the target. It is also dependent on how much stamina you currently have; if your stamina is low your chance to hit is significantly lessened (This however can be corrected with a constant effect stamina regeneration enchant). This is one of the more frustrating aspects of Morrowind, but after a certain point when you become skilled with a weapon it really doesn't affect the gameplay too negatively. It'll be hard in the beginning, but you will notice when your character truly begins to become strong.The story line is very in depth, and involves your quest to find out whether or not you truly are the reincarnated Nervar, or the 'Nerevarine,' as was prophecised by the Ashlander tribes. Along the way you will meet many memorable characters and enemies, delve deep into very dangerous dungeons and caves, and form alliances and bonds with the Ashlander tribes that live throughout Vvardenfell. Through these experiences the player becomes stronger and more aware of the world around them, and also what is at stake; the destruction of all Tamriel itself.This game also boasts a huge selection of items, including 9 different types of weapons (with appropriate skills to use them), dozens of different armor types, hundreds of different potions, hundreds of books, and more! Many of these items also have unique designs which makes for varied NPC enemies and exceptional loot; all of which has been hand placed in the world by the developers. No more random loot for you, you know where something will be after you've found it for the first time.There are also two expansions, the Tribunal expansion, which involves two of the three of the 'false gods' known as the Tribunal, and also Bloodmoon, which involves the exploration and salvation of the small island of Solthsteim. Both of these expansions feature extended gameplay, new types of armor and weapons, new enemies and even bigger challenges than the vanilla originally offered.There is something to be said about the NPCs and their relation to the player as well. Though on the outside, they're rather robotic, when you engage them in conversation you have dozens of topics that you can ask almost every NPC in the game, and many a time they will be different or unique responses depending on their relation to the player or their race/status. For instance, on my last playthrough I donned some Ordinator armor, which are the guardians of Vivec city and the guardians of one of the Tribunal, Vivec himself. Since I am not of the Ordinator order, I am not permitted to wear such sacred armor, and the Ordinators will attack me on sight for disrespecting their hierarchy. It's little things like that that make the NPCs just a bit more a part of the world than bumbling ways of retrieving information.I could go on and on about the things that make Morrowind such a joy to play, but really it's something that needs to be experienced rather than read about. And that's the key thing here, it's an experience, not just a game you play through and forget. There are plenty of little quirky things in the game that make it memorable, such as an orc who believes he's a khajiit, no matter how many times you tell him he's not he will not believe you. Or a man falling from the sky to his death in front of you, for seemingly no reason until you read his journal which explains what went wrong. All in all, this is my favourite game of all time, and if you can look passed it's flaws and dated graphics, you may find yourself of a similar opinion.Oh also don't let my played time on Steam fool you, I've owned this game for over a decade on Xbox original, played through it several times with friends on their consoles, and also on older PCs, with what is most likely over one thousand hours of play time. You can definitely get your money's worth with Morrowind.			"

												Morrowind is a game with one of (if not the absolute best) the best worlds/settings to be seen in an RPG, and a unique, enigmatic atmosphere. Just about anything you can see in Morrowind can be visited at some point, and just about every quest is designed to have natural alternate approaches. It is a world that is not only beautiful, but also fully explorable, with a rich, deep lore and interesting NPCs. Many people criticise Morrowind's combat, and the sometimes vague quest directions, but there is one rule you need to follow to enjoy Morrowind: Respect its advice and systems. There is the infamous idea of missing all your attacks, and failing all your spellcasts, but this only happens at low fatigue, and with the quests, the optimal way to approach them is to play like you're in Morrowind.Morrowind is often criticised for being antiquated, but honestly I think just about anyone with an open mind and enough patience and time can appreciate it, even today.

												Cons.-Morrowind lacks many of the good gameplay mechanics of the newer Elder scrolls games. (you can however fix this easily with mods).-Outdated Graphics  (can be upgraded with mods but it's a hassle).-No fast travel from your map. (only fast travel is by hiring a ride or boat).-Almost no voice acting.-Blocking is a random reaction and cannot be controlled.___________________________________________Pros.-Morrowinds story bets the **** out of Skyrims and Skyrim ain't a joke.-16 joinable factions with lots of quest and ranks that actually makes you feel like you have status.-Morrowind has a lot more skills then newer TES games.-Morrowind has more weapons and armor types then newer TES games.  (like spears and medium armor).-A whole lot more spells and the ability to make your own.  (and there is a spell that makes you fly).-I have heard that a lot of people don't like the quest journal but I love it.  (it's like an actual journal).___________________________________________________I don't think that Morrowind is for everybody but if you like RPGs and you'r not too picky with the grafics then I would definitely recommend it.

												Perhaps the best RPG ever made. Graphics are a bit out dated, but there are mods for that. I recommend Morrowind Overhaul 3.0. It will set up most things automatically, and then let you set specific things that you want. It breathes life back into one of my favorite games.Don't be fooled by newer Elder Scrolls games such as Oblivion and Skyrim. This game is difficult to start up. It's unforgiving. You may die in the first cave. Don't give up though. Explore, gather loot, and learn how to best use your fatigue.There is no hand holding in this game. No quest markers, no fast travel (unless you use the town to town system and even that costs gold), and enemies don't level with you. You can wander into zones where you have no business being.I can not recommend this game enough. It's a masterpiece.			"

The countless hours I put into this game, only finishing the storyline after I got tired of running around.  I have played both Oblivion and Skyrim, but there's something about the skill system and mechanics of this game that feel better and there is a lot less hand holding.  I know I may be looking through rose colored glasses, but I can say without a doubt that this is a wonderful game and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.			"

												In Morrowind, my character:-has killed a living god-destroyed an Aedric artifact-is the head of House Hlaalu-is amused by the Telvanni tradition of violently murdering political opposition-has talks and meditates with Vivec-shoots Daedra in the face with a crossbow-has achieved CHIM10/10 will play againSeriously though, the atmosphere in Morrowind is amazingly well-crafted. I cannot yet speak for any of the earlier games (as I haven't played them), but Morrowind really is the best TES game I've played. I started with Skyrim and worked my way back. It isn't just nostalgia bias talking when people say Morrowind is amazing; it truly is a culmination of very hard work and insane attention to detail. It rewards you and doesn't insult your intelligence by putting the solutions to puzzles on the wall *cough* Skyrim *cough*. Everything you do, from joining the Temple to fulfilling the prophecy of the Nerevarine, has a noticeable impact on the world. People react to your actions; Bethesda nails this quite well. Whether you're going out to kill Mudcrabs that dragged off a Guar from some random lady's farm in the wilderness or playing politics to manipulate the ebony trade in your house's favor, every moment of Morrowind is rewarding. But that's also the beauty of it: It doesn't force you into anything. Nothing just screams out at you. You have to put the work in to enjoy the game. And once you do, the world and its story slowly unfolds before your eyes. There are so many moments in Morrowind that grabbed me and opened my eyes on a new range of perspectives that there's absolutely no way I could ever hope to count them. Don't let anyone lie to you; this game is incredibly frustrating and difficult at times, but the reward for working through it is one of the best gamplay experiences of all time. My only hope is that Bethesda will make a game as well-crafted, clever, and gripping as Morrowind again some day.			"

												Ahhh, The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind! I want to start by saying that yes I am a fan boy, but I wont let that get in the way of giving the best, most accurate review of this game as I can. Years ago, this game as many remember, was released on the orginal xbox ( was also on PC but I mean come on) which is where the elder scrolls series reallllly took off imo, and back then I could not get enough of this game. So to keep it simple, ill make a semi-detailed list of the pros and cons of Morrowind:Pros:-The best story of all the elderscrolls ( an opinion but if you give it a chance, youll see why ) so far, very in depth and extremely detailed.- THE MUSIC, MY GOD THE MUSIC. They actually used a sample of Morrowinds theme song in Skyrim, anyone who played morrowind before hand will have recognized it, thats how good the music is, tBethesda pretty much recycled it lol. You can get lost in the pleasent music and ambient backround sounds, and the combat music gets you on your oes in a split second. Playing Morrowind really makes me feel like im in a foreign land, an alien world. No other elder scroll game can capture that essence like Morrowind DID. This  set the bar reaaaaallly high, and honeslty I have yet to play another game where I was so enveloped in its atmosphere, it's captivating, magical and wonderful. - Character Customization/Class creation:  Same Races as the other Elder scroll games, not too in depth as far as how many types of face/hair etc you can choose. however the game has an awesome way of helping players to choose what role may fit them best which is unique ONLY TO MORROWIND. You can customize your class completely from the ground up, choose from a list of pre-set classes, or answer a series of questions and depending on how you answer these questions, the game will suggest a class for you. ( which you do not have to take if you dont want )- The NPC's : Morrowinds NPCs are very interactive, there are 3 different forms of persuasion you can use to try and get information from NPCs, not only that but there are many other ways to get information needed. Simply being a good person in game will help you, unless you decide to go on an extreme killing spree without going to jail, people will be afraid of you, word of who you are will travel across the land, and in some events NPCs will completely refuse to speak to you yet alone help you. - Vvardenfell is the continent Morrowind is held on ( if you get the GOTY, which I would highly suggest if you enjoyed the regular version, can port your character right over ) and during your travels ( you will have access to something that can transport you from town to town for a small cost, its called a SIlt Strider, looks like a giant flea and can be found in most cities) you will find tons of ruins, mines, bandit camps, and much more to explore. Vvardenfell has so many secrets hidden and locked away, and among those secrets is the tresure, the loot, the good stuff. There are tons of quests, and guilds, and side missions to do;  unlike the newer ES games, Morrowind is set in a harsh land where things are much more powerful than you are, and forces you to flee until you get stronger or can formulate a soild plan of attack and escape. There is no random loot, things are where they are which I personally like, it always gave me a particular goal to work towards like killing that guy for his armor, or robbing a certain store and teleporting out before the guards come. - THE MAGIC SYSTEM! Again, unlike any of the other Elderscroll games, Morrowind allows you create and customize your own spells.  ( one CON is that while casting spells, you have a chance to fail completely and use up mana which will make the start of the game very tough) Now there is a limitation to this; you must have the required skill level of magic in order to successfully cast a spell. You can make any spell you'd like, but in reality some you just wouldnt be able to cast if you make them too crazy. Was def one of my favorite things about the game, being able to make my own spells. There are spells in Morrowind that were removed ( jumping spells, levitating spells, MARK AND RECALL...) in Oblivion and never made a return, sadly. Now, the CONS:- RPG like combat. This means early on, when you start your game it will be very tough to kill things. You will swing your weapon and miss over and over until a few blows actually land. The thing with Morrowind is that even RUNNING drops your fatigue, and with lower fatigue your chance to cast spells/ strike your target decreases . So, the less stamina you have, the lower the chance youll have to hit something/ cast a spell. This can make the game frustraiting for some players, pushing them away from the start. As your skills go up , naturally so will how much you are able to hit something or cast a spell, once you get a skill to 100, you will always hit no matter what, but fatigue will still effect how much damage you do per swing etc. If you're really liking the game, just push through this- find the correct trainers for your skill set ( mages guild, fighters guild, theives guild, Morag tong [ assassin guild ]  etc ) and this wont be a problem for very long.  - Vvardenfell- IS IT TOO BIG..? It might be, for those who dont have an adventerous spirit, you might find the world too expansive.  Often times you will have to run on foot ( or use spells...!?!? ) to new destinations, and it is possible you can actually get very lost .  There are a lot of other ways to travel around Vvardenfell, and youll figure that out in time, but still looking for a partclar person or a particular place in such a large world can be extremely difficult and at times, demoralizing. - EVERYONE AND ANYONE CAN BE KILLEDIt would do you well to remember this, because in the newer elder scroll games they disable the ability to kill characters who are important to the main story. Well, in morrowind you may kill whoever youd like, whenever if youre powerful enough. You will not knock them out, they will be killed. The NPC will die and you will be able to loot them. HOWEVER..if and when you kill a NPC that is important to the main story, a large box will appear in your bottom left hand corner warning you of what you've just done, and how in doing so the main story line has been severed and you can never finish it. At which point you may reload your game, or you can carry on and keep playing because the rest of the world is still in action with plenty to do, but I wouldnt suggest it. -THIS GAME IS TOUGH. Morrowind can be very unforgiving. Save often or else youll find yourself losing hours of progress, which is extremely disheartening. -ALL IN ALL- The Elderscrolls 3 : Morrowind is wonderful game that has a tough learning curve, its not nearly as easy to play as  ES4: Oblivion or ES5: Skyrim and so if you dont want a challenge, a real one, don't pick it up. However if youre a big fan of the Elderscroll series, and you like games where you can see real progress overtime,  pick this gem up, you wont regret it. This is one of those things in life where you wish you could forget about it ever existing, just so you could go back and discover it all over again for the first time. "

												A very difficult but rewarding and seemingly endless game! One of the best if not THE BEST Elder Scrolls game I've ever played. Don't let the play time affect your opinion, I've put way more time into this game than what's on my Steam account and I can tell you first hand it should be on a list of the best games ever created. The dialogue is so in-depth often involving multiple paragraph responses for each of your questions which really makes you feel immersed as if you were having conversations with these characters. Over time you grow a bond with this game and how far in the lore and immersion goes. You can easily get lost in it for hundreds of hours. Amazing customization, spellmaking, barter system, dialogue, gameplay, story, lore, quests, guilds, cities, races, etc., etc., etc.. WARNING: NOT FOR THOSE WHO GIVE UP EASILY OR DO NOT WANT TO READ! *No quest markers included ;)			"

												Perhaps the best RPG ever made. Graphics are a bit out dated, but there are mods for that. I recommend Morrowind Overhaul 3.0. It will set up most things automatically, and then let you set specific things that you want. It breathes life back into one of my favorite games.Don't be fooled by newer Elder Scrolls games such as Oblivion and Skyrim. This game is difficult to start up. It's unforgiving. You may die in the first cave. Don't give up though. Explore, gather loot, and learn how to best use your fatigue.There is no hand holding in this game. No quest markers, no fast travel (unless you use the town to town system and even that costs gold), and enemies don't level with you. You can wander into zones where you have no business being.I can not recommend this game enough. It's a masterpiece.			"

												Verdict: Old School but still great (and that aint nostaglia talking, I had never played this until after Skyrim)I HATE old style games. I just cant play with outdated graphics & gameplay. Nonetheless, I LOVE Morrowind. The game's terrifying. You never know, when you walk into a dungeon, if you are going to stomp or be stomped. As for the outdated aspects: (1) The Morrowind Overhaul is amazing, and super easy to install. This all but fixes the graphics for me(2) player->setspeed 150. Boom. The game isn't broken, but you no longer feel like you're crawling.(3) Yes, you will swing and miss 100 times at a Rat. But once you actually get a decent skill, and if you remember to keep your fatigue up, you'll be fine. There's a steep curve at the beginning, but once you hit like level 4 things become reasonable.			"

												This game is great.  It has not aged well but if you get mods or something like that you should be good.  I would reccomend another Elder Scrolls game over this however.  The combat in this game is just not nearly as good, but with mods like skywind it will still be one of the best games of all time.  The story is great and the world is huge, not to mention the various side quests.  If you are into Elder Scrolls games than this is a must have but still I would highly reccoment modded over vanilla.			"

												There's just something about this game that really hit the sweet spot for Bethesda RPGs.  It's not cut down significantly like recent Fallout/Elder Scrolls games, but at the same time it's not so huge as to be an impossibly glitchy mess like Daggerfall.  This is probably my favorite Elder Scrolls game despite the hiccups.Keep in mind that this being an Elder Scrolls game, many of the cons can be patched away with mods.Pros:- Much greater amounts of unique text than modern Elder Scrolls games.- Spell-crafting system is pretty much unlimited and is really fun to mess around with.- Environment and wildlife is very strange; it's unusual to have a game with the entire ecosystem based on a harsh volcanic island, never mind the magic influence.- Plot is very interesting and can be as deep or shallow as you want to put the effort in to be.- You can choose to kill quest-vital NPCs, and the game will kindly tell you you've done so in case you wish to re-load. (Much nicer option than ""NPC just won't die for some reason"" in later games)Cons:- 2000s-era graphics and a lot of unvoiced lines, if these things matter to you.- Random townsfolk tend to not have anything interesting to say if they don't have a quest for you.- Dice-based combat is not for everyone, and makes combat really difficult before you get more Agility/Stamina/Magic Skill.- The name of the game is Morrowind, but only part of Morrowind is present. (Of course, the game would've probably taken 5 extra years if it was all there...)			"

												I'm not going to lie I was always put off by this game because of it's dated graphics and tabletop game fighting aspects, but one day I decided to get it. It blew my mind! It was so fun because it was actually brutal on you unlike Skyrim and Oblivion that could make you god sometimes. You want something? Go out and kill ten mudcrabs and collect fifteen mushrooms then you might get 50 gold. Those mudcrabs lower your health? Okay say goodbye to those gold coins so you can get yourself healed. By far the best Elder Scrolls game in my opinion. If you don't have it, get it. If you do have it, play it. If you are playing it right now, you know what you are doing.			"

												Elder Scrolls Morrowind, what a fantastic game. This game is a true Elder Scrolls game, meaning like almost all Elder Scrolls games ,that you never run out of things to do, things to kill, exploring, a huge amount of quests to be had. Except Morrowind is unique from Oblivion and Skyrim in the fact that it does not hold your hand. From the no quest markers, to crafting your own spells, to a classic dice roll combat system serves to make it one of the best classic roleplaying games out there. Im not denying this game has flaws, as it often feels like when a npc sends you off to a far location they give you very vauge locations, feels like sometimes they are saying ""go to this cave and get me my amulet, its somehwere north of Vivec or wait...... was it Dagon Fel? I dont know figure it out yourself you scum"". But Besides all of this Morrowind is a truly fantastic game, we will proably never see this type of game again.                                                                      10/10 "

												Before getting Morrowind, Skyrim was the only Elder Scrolls game that I played. We all know how ""almost"" perfect Skyrim is, so I won't bother getting into that. For those who have played Skyrim, they know it almost feels like being immersed into a videogame life, like you get to live in a different world while getting addicted to the quests, the characters, the cities and villages, and the lore itself. Morrowind captures that same exact feeling. The combat takes some patience, but after you get the handle on that, the game is phenomenal. It really shows the perfect image of an Elder Scrolls game, not to mention, without this game, what we know as the modern day RPG genre would be different. This game defines the RPG genre. I've grown to love this game, and I hope you will too.			"

												I played this ten years ago and it was brilliant, my first proper RPG game. Oblivion seemed to blow the graphics out of the water, and Skyrim did that again.Going back to Morrowind after 10 years was very interesting. It has the haunting foreboding of the island still intact, but the main thing I was happy to see again was the statistic system and the way skills progress.The overall character set up and stats feels far more like an RPG than the later games. Something I think should have been carried through.The level of lore present in Morrowind is pretty large and back then they were not afraid to just use text for the bazillions of minor NPC's that exist. Its great being able to walk up to pretty much anyone and ask them for gossip or a little about themselves.Having 10+ choices for conversations with NPC's makes it feel as if you can have a conversation with anyone, even if just in passing.I would love the series to port this to future games, give me more NPC's I can talk to. If they are minor NPC's and its going to break the budget, dont be afraid to use text.Dont be afraid to play this game either, if you like old school RPG's this one has a great storyline and lots of playable hours.It does require a good four hours of so of playing to start feeling like you can take on the world. Dont expect to be able to handle more than one bandit at a time at lvl 1...cause you wont.			"

												The Elder Srolls Series i think is one of those Love and/or Hate series because of its take on the RPG genre.The Story Lines are really deep and there is huge amounts of background lore scattered about through side quests, books in game, or even just by listening to the NPC's converse with one another. Insane, I know. Still one of the Largest free roam RPG's of its time probably even bigger than some AAA MMORPG's (before major expansions of course).Combat is where it was hit or miss with people, you can still attack at will, yet some features like your shield skills were based upon a hidden RTD (roll the dice) feature that rolled your chance to block attacks until it leveled up and made your shield skills grow. There is plenty of secret areas (not really secret anymore since im sure theyve all been documented and plundered since) and large areas and dungeons to explore.***If you want the Hardest play through possible without any help from the game or the gods, kill Vivec when you first meet him, loot the note and item from him. You will get a message pretty much the same one you get from killing any important NPC suggesting that you restart from a save. This is an Easter Egg***For those with a great computer i suggest grabbing the Morrowind Overhaul 3.0 (Final Version) mod which has many great graphical upgrades as well as bug fixes & tweaking options for better gameplay.http://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/ "

												I bought this game back in the early retail days, but due to a fire I lost that copy. I recently found Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim on sale with all downloadable content/expansions for cheap here on Steam, so I bought them. I loved the sheer variety of the paths you could travel and guilds/factions you could join. You could enchant your clothing/armor and weapons with magical effects, pick locks, cast awesome destructive abilities, heal, affect your enviroment, etc. I liked the fact you had 10 major/minor skills that leveled you up, but I hated the level 50ish limit on your levels. In order to maximize your stat bonuses you needed to micromanage your skill growth to an absurd level in order to achieve the 100 stats.  Also, after you do the available faction quests (again, you can't join but ONE of the three Great Houses, which does make some sense, but you can join opposing factions, such as the thieves guild, and the imperial legion, or the morag tong, which is almost the same boat.) and the Great House of your choice and the expansions, you can roam the lands to find random quests from people along the roadways.

												I've played Morrowind off and on for years. Before Skyrim ever came out, just about when Oblivion was released, I met this game and fell head over heels in love.  And I freely admit that this is my favourite of the franchise. Why?Yes, it has lesser graphics than the others (cut-scenes in Skyrim are gorgeous, no lie).  But the story. Oh so immersive, like a visual book. It draws you in, giving you reason to learn more, wanting to see what's just around the corner. And no matter how many times I replay it, I still find myself entranced.  So for those curious about this game, if it's still worth getting? Yes. I've had it in the past on other systems, rebought it on Steam to continue to get lost in this world, and would buy it again and again.			"

No hand-holding, no dumbing down gameplay, huge open world to do anything, and the freedom is what I want. If you don't care about any of that, stay FAR away from me and this game.

												This game is a classic, It's one of those RPGS you must play through once in your life. A game that still holds up to the newer generation of gamers. This game has a lot to explore,  a lot to do. You can do almost anything, but this game makes you earn the stuff you want. You also need to do a lot of thinking and prep planning before you take on a harder task. This game also has a lot of story,  guilds, tribes, races, classes, skills, and spells. But starting off isn't easy. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who don't have patience, other than that PLAY IT.			"

												Great game, I first played this game on original xbox so not to many hours on computer version but I do know the game. The world is engaging and fun, you can wonder and explore to your hearts content completly ignoring the story if you want, you can kill almost every charecter and actually lose the game because you killed one you need to progress the story, but it still lets you play! I cant recomend this game enough			"

												The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is a classic Open World RPG. It allows you freedom to do what you wish, go where you choose, right after you complete the intro. It won't hold your hand, or coddle you though, so you have to play smartly... wander too far in the wrong direction and you may find yourself getting chomped or blown to bits by something way too powerful for you. The combat is kinda clunky, and in my opinion, one of the game's few weak points... but the depth you'll find in this game is something many games these days sorely lack. You could spend over 100 hours in this game and find half of what lies within it's world.  The characters, plot, and background lore are all carefully crafted, within a vast, rich wold.Play this game if you want a challenge, deep story, and love open world fantasy RPG's. Also, check out the mods and fan restoration projects that update this game's graphics to some surprisingly impressive levels for how old it is.			"

												This game is pretty old with old gameplay features but Morrowind is my favourite elder scrolls game thanks to it's wonderfull map and it's amazing main story. The world of morrowind is very mysterious and harsh, full of weird plants and creatures. Some caves are actually scary thanks to crazy sound effects and dark enviroments. There are strong, weird and sometimes funny special weapons and armor that you can find or earn by quests. You can only be in one guild at a time and this makes it feel more impactfull. You can still do enchantment and blacksmithing. There is also another feature wich I enjoy thats called spellcrafting. You can creat your own spells and make them crazy overpowered. You get levetating spells and jumping spells to get to places you can only get to if you can jump or levetate high enough. The weather is very cool, there are sandstorms, thunderstorms, clearweather and a day and night cycle. You are not allowed to rest in the cities and towns, you can only wait or you can go and sleep on your bed if you own one. If i'm correct you can also own houses in Morrowind. You still get to choos all races and you get to create your own class or choos from the premade classes. There are spears, staffs, longswords, shortswords, axes, hammers, bows, daggers and much more weapons.I feel the most involved in this world out of cyrodiil and skyrim.			"

												After all these years I still find this as the best game in the whole series. The most sandboxy one I would say.Yeah, you can feel the age on animations, and the ""dice"" rng combat systems, and probably on how small the world is compared to actualy all other TES games. But you are able to get into another quest chain which hides inside itself a great journey at literaly every corner.If you are just a light gamer and you preffer the new games, this game might not be for you. It does not guide you by your hand. You actualy need to play and read everything yourself.Still, I might actualy recommend it for everyone that can embrace the beauties of this old game. Games nowadays lack alot, and you will understand that only if you play a masterpiece like Morrowind was.			"

												Ahhh, The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind! I want to start by saying that yes I am a fan boy, but I wont let that get in the way of giving the best, most accurate review of this game as I can. Years ago, this game as many remember, was released on the orginal xbox ( was also on PC but I mean come on) which is where the elder scrolls series reallllly took off imo, and back then I could not get enough of this game. So to keep it simple, ill make a semi-detailed list of the pros and cons of Morrowind:Pros:-The best story of all the elderscrolls ( an opinion but if you give it a chance, youll see why ) so far, very in depth and extremely detailed.- THE MUSIC, MY GOD THE MUSIC. They actually used a sample of Morrowinds theme song in Skyrim, anyone who played morrowind before hand will have recognized it, thats how good the music is, tBethesda pretty much recycled it lol. You can get lost in the pleasent music and ambient backround sounds, and the combat music gets you on your oes in a split second. Playing Morrowind really makes me feel like im in a foreign land, an alien world. No other elder scroll game can capture that essence like Morrowind DID. This  set the bar reaaaaallly high, and honeslty I have yet to play another game where I was so enveloped in its atmosphere, it's captivating, magical and wonderful. - Character Customization/Class creation:  Same Races as the other Elder scroll games, not too in depth as far as how many types of face/hair etc you can choose. however the game has an awesome way of helping players to choose what role may fit them best which is unique ONLY TO MORROWIND. You can customize your class completely from the ground up, choose from a list of pre-set classes, or answer a series of questions and depending on how you answer these questions, the game will suggest a class for you. ( which you do not have to take if you dont want )- The NPC's : Morrowinds NPCs are very interactive, there are 3 different forms of persuasion you can use to try and get information from NPCs, not only that but there are many other ways to get information needed. Simply being a good person in game will help you, unless you decide to go on an extreme killing spree without going to jail, people will be afraid of you, word of who you are will travel across the land, and in some events NPCs will completely refuse to speak to you yet alone help you. - Vvardenfell is the continent Morrowind is held on ( if you get the GOTY, which I would highly suggest if you enjoyed the regular version, can port your character right over ) and during your travels ( you will have access to something that can transport you from town to town for a small cost, its called a SIlt Strider, looks like a giant flea and can be found in most cities) you will find tons of ruins, mines, bandit camps, and much more to explore. Vvardenfell has so many secrets hidden and locked away, and among those secrets is the tresure, the loot, the good stuff. There are tons of quests, and guilds, and side missions to do;  unlike the newer ES games, Morrowind is set in a harsh land where things are much more powerful than you are, and forces you to flee until you get stronger or can formulate a soild plan of attack and escape. There is no random loot, things are where they are which I personally like, it always gave me a particular goal to work towards like killing that guy for his armor, or robbing a certain store and teleporting out before the guards come. - THE MAGIC SYSTEM! Again, unlike any of the other Elderscroll games, Morrowind allows you create and customize your own spells.  ( one CON is that while casting spells, you have a chance to fail completely and use up mana which will make the start of the game very tough) Now there is a limitation to this; you must have the required skill level of magic in order to successfully cast a spell. You can make any spell you'd like, but in reality some you just wouldnt be able to cast if you make them too crazy. Was def one of my favorite things about the game, being able to make my own spells. There are spells in Morrowind that were removed ( jumping spells, levitating spells, MARK AND RECALL...) in Oblivion and never made a return, sadly. Now, the CONS:- RPG like combat. This means early on, when you start your game it will be very tough to kill things. You will swing your weapon and miss over and over until a few blows actually land. The thing with Morrowind is that even RUNNING drops your fatigue, and with lower fatigue your chance to cast spells/ strike your target decreases . So, the less stamina you have, the lower the chance youll have to hit something/ cast a spell. This can make the game frustraiting for some players, pushing them away from the start. As your skills go up , naturally so will how much you are able to hit something or cast a spell, once you get a skill to 100, you will always hit no matter what, but fatigue will still effect how much damage you do per swing etc. If you're really liking the game, just push through this- find the correct trainers for your skill set ( mages guild, fighters guild, theives guild, Morag tong [ assassin guild ]  etc ) and this wont be a problem for very long.  - Vvardenfell- IS IT TOO BIG..? It might be, for those who dont have an adventerous spirit, you might find the world too expansive.  Often times you will have to run on foot ( or use spells...!?!? ) to new destinations, and it is possible you can actually get very lost .  There are a lot of other ways to travel around Vvardenfell, and youll figure that out in time, but still looking for a partclar person or a particular place in such a large world can be extremely difficult and at times, demoralizing. - EVERYONE AND ANYONE CAN BE KILLEDIt would do you well to remember this, because in the newer elder scroll games they disable the ability to kill characters who are important to the main story. Well, in morrowind you may kill whoever youd like, whenever if youre powerful enough. You will not knock them out, they will be killed. The NPC will die and you will be able to loot them. HOWEVER..if and when you kill a NPC that is important to the main story, a large box will appear in your bottom left hand corner warning you of what you've just done, and how in doing so the main story line has been severed and you can never finish it. At which point you may reload your game, or you can carry on and keep playing because the rest of the world is still in action with plenty to do, but I wouldnt suggest it. -THIS GAME IS TOUGH. Morrowind can be very unforgiving. Save often or else youll find yourself losing hours of progress, which is extremely disheartening. -ALL IN ALL- The Elderscrolls 3 : Morrowind is wonderful game that has a tough learning curve, its not nearly as easy to play as  ES4: Oblivion or ES5: Skyrim and so if you dont want a challenge, a real one, don't pick it up. However if youre a big fan of the Elderscroll series, and you like games where you can see real progress overtime,  pick this gem up, you wont regret it. This is one of those things in life where you wish you could forget about it ever existing, just so you could go back and discover it all over again for the first time. "

												The first Elder Scrolls game I played was Skyrim and I got Morrowind and Oblivion later on to learn more of the background story. I assume I'm not the only one so this recommendation will be geared towards other people who are playing the series backwards.Pros: + Large and dynamic world (for the time anyway)+ Quests aren't spoonfed to you and you're challenged to figure out on your own where to go and what to do+ Many different factions for you to join and your choices will affect how other factions judge you. It's not like Skyrim where you can join the Theives Guild and Dark Brotherhood and no one seems to care.+ What happens in this game is sometimes referenced to in later titles so you get a better understanding of the Elder Scrolls universe+ No fast travel means you have to prioritize where you want to go. The ability to use silt striders and teleport with the Mage's Guild is a fair compromise. Some might see this as a con, but I think it's better this way. It forces you to explore more and get to know all the places along the way instead of fast traveling and missing out on things. Cons:- Combat is super clunky. Meelee fights are basically like rock em sock em robots. Even your shield is completely passive. - If a skill level is too low, it will always ""fail."" Weapon swings will always miss, ingredients can be mixed and used up but the potions won't be created, spells will eat up your mana but still won't cast, etc.- Stamina, referred to in this game as ""fatigue,"" can run out quickly and you're practically useless in a fight once you've run out. If your enemy is strong enough, they'll keep knocking you to the ground and can't do anything but revert to your last save or wait till they kill you.- Your character runs really really slow when you first start out (you can level your speed or get items to make you faster later on) and you can move a bit faster by jumping while running diagonally which is kind of stupid if you ask me.- NPC dialogues in many situations are lazily copy/pasted.Overall I'd say it's worth getting the game even if you're more accustomed to Skyrim. The game is from 2002 so most of the issues with it are kind of forgiveable. Just keep in mind that if something isn't one of your main skills, you can basically forget about using it until you find someone who can train you in it, and that you should always have fatigue potions ready when you might get into a fight. I'd also suggest getting the MGSO mod to make the game look nicer and fix some of the bugs.			"

												As someone has already remarked, this game requires patience. I haven't played much of Morrowind, but I have played tons of Oblivion and Skyrim. I love those games unreservedly. If you can pick-up Morrowind for $9.99, go for it. Otherwise, if you are new to these games, go with Oblivion or Skyrim first. I can go to Skyrim & play for an hour doing side quests, and have fun hunting vampires or bandits. Morrowind is a little more like work than vacation, but I will persist with it until I either give up in frustration, or decide that I love it.  That said, I reccomend this game with reservations: you have to dig for the gold.			"

												If you are interested In playing this game, Here are some things you should know.This game is extremely hard and unforgiving. This game is not like other Elderscrolls and current RPG's, There is no minimap or quest markers. In order to progress through the game you have to read through your journal in order to get directions for people you need to find. Walking takes forever and the combat is extremely slow.The map is amazingly huge and to walk from the first city to the next took about 10 minutes and I needed another map open the whole time,This IS a positive review. That game is good and I did have fun. BUT it is too much work and dedication for me personally to play through. Call me a casual but I like how the newest elder scrolls tell you where to go and makes it fairly easy.If you do decide to play this game I recommend adding some mods.There are many quality of life mods for this game that doesn't change the overall feel of the game but simply make it a better gameplay experience. Updated graphics being one of the best.TL;DR: I do recommend this game if you have the time and dedication for it. It also helps if you have an interest in the elder scrolls franchise. "

												I love this game and have played it many times over the years. There is a rich and complex lore. There are lots of quirky characters and some downright silly side quests. There is a sense of epic scale, both in geography and story. The two expansion packs offered solid additional adventures for the protagonist. You can be just about anyone and do just about anything. Graphics are dated but easily spruced up with mods--and there is of course a robust modding community still out there. Dealing with even simple encounters in the early few levels can be frustratingly difficult (especially given the percent chance to hit based on skill level, so even point-blank perfectly aimed attacks often miss), and if you have adequately leveled your character then the very end-game content can really reduce the game to a pattern of repeated clicking to kill things, barring a few overpowered encounters (rather disappointing, as it really makes obvious that so much of the way the player interacts with the game is through violence); besides these points, though, I would describe the game as nearly flawless (if it wasn't infamously and maybe even fondly known for a bevy of bugs). I would highly recommend, whether you've played any Elder Scrolls games or not. Never too late to give this great title a try.			"

												It's old, the combat is wonky at best and absolutely infuriating at the start (the first and only time I've died to a RAT but then HHHNNNN CLIFFRACERS). The UI? It makes you almost appreciate the Skyrim UI.I recommend getting some tips on the combat and character creation before starting, otherwise you'll be struggling to attack the enemy 90% of the time. One thing you should do is: Mod this game. The Morrowind Overhaul (MGSO) makes makes this game prettier than Oblivion (which isn't difficult, Skifree is prettier than Oblivion) adds new items, textures (them shiny waters and purty skybox) and completely changes the atmosphere for the better.One more tip, at the beginning of the game you have no place to store your items, there's a dead body just north of Balmora, near the rd sign. Store your stuff there, that body will never despawn. "

												A very difficult but rewarding and seemingly endless game! One of the best if not THE BEST Elder Scrolls game I've ever played. Don't let the play time affect your opinion, I've put way more time into this game than what's on my Steam account and I can tell you first hand it should be on a list of the best games ever created. The dialogue is so in-depth often involving multiple paragraph responses for each of your questions which really makes you feel immersed as if you were having conversations with these characters. Over time you grow a bond with this game and how far in the lore and immersion goes. You can easily get lost in it for hundreds of hours. Amazing customization, spellmaking, barter system, dialogue, gameplay, story, lore, quests, guilds, cities, races, etc., etc., etc..

												I was excited when Morrowind finally came out on Steam. I've decided (obviously) to write a review.Let's be clear: This mod is not for you if you require on graphics or audio to enjoy a game. If you don't, read this review (NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE SPOILERS):Morrowind is a creatively-crafted, replayable game with great storylines and gameplay. You start out as a mere, useless outlander and work your way up. This game by no means gives you a title. No matter what quest you do, you must be powerful enough to become the next rank in a guild. The main quest doesn't hold your hand and is relatively harder compared to modern RPS. The combat, the skill system, it's great, yet not perfect. Trust me when I tell you that this game will not be over quick. I became Nerevarine of all tribes and Hortator of all houses... and I was pronounced a heretic and hated by many. If you don't enjoy this game... you're an n'wah!			"

Disclaimer; I've moved to a modded version which doesn't log playtime, so ignore that at the top of this reviewIf I had to describe Morrowind in a single sentence, it would read as such;""It plays like Dungeons & Dragons, but with 3D renders and a real-time map instead of chracter sheets and hastily-drawn dungeon layouts sprawled across the dining room table.""If you're a D&D player, then Morrowind will come naturally to you. If you're more into the hack-and-slash arcade pace of something like Skyrim, then this might not be the best because there's slow, there's glaciers, there's continential drift, then there's the pace that morrowind plays at.It's true, there's nothing really quite as satisfying as when you spend three whole days preparing to face a monster that's been terrorizing a town, balancing all your gear, tweaking things for best performance, and then when the fight comes the beast falls like a house of cards in front of your perfectly executed assault strategy.But the key part of that for most people is the ""Spend three whole days preparing"" part. Believe me when I say if you decide to just run in and hack at the thing, you'll be served copious amounts of rekt. Morrowind is a game that heavily rewards long-term strategy and heavily punishes short-term kill everything in sight behaviors.It's very immersive and has a rich, well planned out lore with lots of little hidden things to learn, but you better be prepared to be spending long hours leafing through the in-game books and scrolls to learn it.Graphics: 2/10Artistry: 9/10Action: 3/10Immersion: 12/10Overall: 7/10			"

												A very difficult but rewarding and seemingly endless game! One of the best if not THE BEST Elder Scrolls game I've ever played. Don't let the play time affect your opinion, I've put way more time into this game than what's on my Steam account and I can tell you first hand it should be on a list of the best games ever created. The dialogue is so in-depth often involving multiple paragraph responses for each of your questions which really makes you feel immersed as if you were having conversations with these characters. Over time you grow a bond with this game and how far in the lore and immersion goes. You can easily get lost in it for hundreds of hours. Amazing customization, spellmaking, barter system, dialogue, gameplay, story, lore, quests, guilds, cities, races, etc., etc., etc..

												Morrowind is an amazing game. No game quite captures the freedom or charm of Morrowind. If you can get past no fast travel, dated graphics, and awkward fighting system (Which can be fixed with mods if you really care that much). Morrowind is a sandbox of creativity, there is little to none hand holding. You can enchant or create essentially anything you want. You have to earn everything you got and once you have it its probably one of the most satisfaction i've had in a game, and damn is it fun getting there. The characters you meet, the bizzare experiences you are thrusted into, or seeing some hideous beast that one hit kills you. Everything you do in the game is a journey a quest all up to you it gives you an astonising amount of freedom in this little, detailed, harsh, bizzare, and beautiful world. You can spend hours roaming a city and not discover all that you can. You can create a ring that makes you fly 10,000 feet in the air. You can slay everyone you meet and conquer the world if you really wish. I highly recommend Morrowind and all its charm and harshness and freedom.			"

												This is what modern RPGs should be based on, the atribute system alows you to become so powerfull you can kill a god, yet you must devote lots of time to your charecter in order to do so, the magic sysytem is complex, hard, and requires intelegence to be usefull, like magic should be. the combat systytem is perfect (except for those point blank misses with huge swords). the ranged system is nothing special, but with the physics engines avalible at the time it was advanced, the story is nothing short of enthraling, the world is beutifull and emersive 11/10			"

												Golly gee wiz, just going through the first few reviews of this game wasn't a walk in the park. Granted, many have made valid points and I do agree in some aspects, but some may have been a tad bit biased. That being said, that's not what this is about. Now, let us move on to the actual review, shall we?Ahem.Let Blue the Bard (that me) tell all you lovelies a teeny tiny story. A story that you may or may not rage at, but that matter is entirely on your part, not necessarily mine. Blue will admit that they got into the Elder Scrolls series by first playing Skyrim. I know, I know, how n00bish and lame of me, but please, spare Blue the Bard a moment or two! Thing is, Blue hadn't even  heard  of the TES series until Skyrim came out. And even then, they didn't even play it at that time (when it first came out in 2011). Skip to a few years and one of their good ol' friends caused Blue to perk an interest in the game. They were curious, so they decided to try it out. And, to their surprise, they loved it! Blue wanted to get into more of this series, so they did. Blue tried their hand at TES I: Arena. A bit of a hassle, that one is: what with the DOSbox thingy and remembering the commands, etc. But Blue had minimal knowledge in that area so it wasn't so bad. Skip to a few weeks or months later and TES III: Morrowind and TES IV: Oblivion went on sale. Blue acted quickly and purchased them. First, they tried Morrowind, seeing how that game was released first out of the two. Okay, so I lied. THIS is where the actual review starts. Blue was very mindful as to not have been biased in any manner, for such a thing is a spell for disaster. They reassured themself that ""hey, this is an old game. It's not gonna be fancy-pantsy pretty like them later installments. And maybe the mechanics and gameplay are slightly different. You'll just have to go through with it, like other people have.""Well, I played it, and I loved it. Sure it is a tad bit more complicated, and there are indeed things I could complain about (initial player speed and limited voice acting to name a few specifics) but those aren't things worth giving up this game for. In this game, Blue is nearly unbiased, for they lack the nostalgia factor and they have an understanding of this game being an older thing.Honestly, despite the early graphics, Blue felt immersed. Here they were, exploring this strange and magnificent land. And, in Blue's humble opinion, this installment has the most relaxing music track. And that is a good thing. Blue felt..happy playing this game. Despite the fact that they have obviously played more Skyrim and Oblivion than Morrowind, Morrowind is something Blue can always come back to. There is still so much more to be explored, after all. And they look forward to it. c:And that's my review for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made full stop. It's So Original, So Unique, So Bloody Amazing and unlike anything else.The feeling I got when I first played this game when it came out was like no other game before it or even since really. The music, the setting, just everything about it really, and yes even the combat system, I loved it all, it added to its charm.The culture, the history, the lore, the world, the depth of Vvardenfell was a massive accomplishment, and Morrowind will now and forever stand as one of the greatest in the genre and the history of gaming.Now if only the next Elder Scrolls game will go back to this more mature thinking type of RPG where you had to read the quest log and find the location around where people said it would be, none of this quest markers compass stuff.Morrowind... A true explorers RPG 10/10			"

												This game is surprisingly deep, despite the fact that it's over ten years old. Sure, it's not optimized for modern machines, and the textures look like ♥♥♥♥, but beyond that lies an RPG that is extremely dense with content and possibilities. If you'r\e an RPG fan, this is right for you. The game is quite punishing, even on normal difficulty settings, and the game is also very vague in its quest descriptions, but that's what gives this game its charm; It's a hardcore gaming experience.Hold off on all those crappy next-gen rehashes, and buy this gem of a game; you will not regret it.

												By now this game is probably much too old for many people to care, but if you are reading this let me tell you that Morrowind is easily worth the 20 dollars any day. Though yes, it hasn't aged very well compared to other games, it's story and plain freedom is incredible. Easily beats oblivion and even Skyrim in some degree! What I think is unique and interesting about this game is that there is no ""fast travel"" mechanic in it which forces the player to explore and become apart of the world themselves! Gamers today have it easy with all the ""auto saves"" and ""fast travel"" but in Morrowind they just give the time to let you create your character then after that you're on your own. I recommend this to any Elder Scrolls fan or addict like me!			"

												Great lore, Expansive world, Dedicated modding comunity (Although no easy workshop support, so you have to actually have a bit of basic modding knowlege.).  This is a great game for someone who loves the story and worlds of games...However, it should be noted that if you loved action RPG antics of the latter games like Skyrim, you might be let down.Morrowind has alot less action and more dice rolling, some people call it flailing weapons till something hits.  This game also douse not hold your hand, YOU CAN make the game unbeatable, should you choose to throw away quest items and or kill important people.  there is no compas, no waypoints, only reading.  if your the kind of person who reads everything, this is fine, BUT you need to read what people say, so you know where to go, otherwise you will get lost fast.

												Game:The best game I ever played. Even though it says I haven't played that much on steam- I've played it on my Xbox Original, which had many disturbing glitches. On the Xbox, you could jump before entering a dungeon or house and get killed randomly. This game can be really hard to sit still when your walking around, and really annoying when starting out the combat system (MISS MISS MISS MISS) but when you skill up and become better, it's a lot more fun. I recommend being a Mage class, because later you can make spells! I do misuse the spells for jumping across Morrowind, and Fortifying spells to increase my Stats permanently but don't overdo it like me. I recommend this game, however check out the videos of the game before buying in case if the modern games have 'Spoiled' you. MODS:Sadly this game didn't include Construction Set, which ables you to modify the maps. I like to use it to make my own castle, home, and make it more interesting. There's no Mod-community workshop on Steam but do not fear because there is another place you can get mods called: Nexus.  Look it up. (Forbidden to link, Sorry!) Once you check it out, look at my profile: FastxNxDeadly - I have endorsed all my Mods that I installed, Including the Construction Set mod.You can transform a classic looking game into Skyrim if you want to. With mods, it can be really fun.Update: Since the the personal Award for 2016, I'd just like to update this personally. Since Daggerfall isn't on steam, Morrowind is still a piece of what everything turned out to be because of Daggerfall. So I want to thank this game so much for all the years of childhood gameplay.

												Back on xbox it took me a few years to beat the game even with cheats.Buying on PC was probably the most nostaglic thing I did. I started out like I normally did with my old plays and then I came across the console. My trolly side just couldn't help it'self. I created a new play, maxed out my character so all my stats were full. I took an amazing 1 minute journey to Red Mountain from Seyda Neen. Into the depth where the great and powerful Dagoth Ur resided. He greeted me, claiming of course that I had come unprepared. Insulted that he would even suggest that I was lacking the required materials to defeat him I had used my own godly powers to prove him wrong. With Sunder, Wraithguard and Keening suddenly in my posession the Dagoth Ur was curtain that he was ready to take me on. When he thought that I was going to attack him with the one of the weapons I had insulted him by drawing the iron dagger that you get into Census and Excise office at the very beginning of the game. With two swift hits he decided that it be best to move along into the next room. He of course does the normal dialtic claiming that he is a god, but that did not sway me. with a few more hits I had managed to knock the weak god into the pool of lava. I continued to foil his master plan which he was none to happy about. After promptly gloating and leaving the room I was greeted with the final cut scene of the game. That was it I had won. I decided to humour myself some more. I took it upon myself to pay a visit to Caius in Balmora. Turns out I could still take part in all the main story quests that lead up to the magnificent display of my powers. I was quite pleased by this.10/10 would use console commands again.			"

												Great lore, Expansive world, Dedicated modding comunity (Although no easy workshop support, so you have to actually have a bit of basic modding knowlege.).  This is a great game for someone who loves the story and worlds of games...However, it should be noted that if you loved action RPG antics of the latter games like Skyrim, you might be let down.Morrowind has alot less action and more dice rolling, some people call it flailing weapons till something hits.  This game also douse not hold your hand, YOU CAN make the game unbeatable, should you choose to throw away quest items and or kill important people.  there is no compas, no waypoints, only reading.  if your the kind of person who reads everything, this is fine, BUT you need to read what people say, so you know where to go, otherwise you will get lost fast.

												I bought this not a few days back. I also have Skyrim and Oblivion. Never played this until 2015. Now I can see why this has been said to be the best Elder Scrolls game to date.It's really good. Makes you work a little to get to places (no fast travel!) and the quests really offer some challenge. (IT TOOK ME 2 HOURS TO REALIZE WHERE IS BITTER COAST SO I CAN GET SOME SHROOMS FOR THE CAT! ...) There's still much for me waiting to get discovered, but I can already tell that I'm going to get addicted :D "

												Coming from an Elder Scroll's fan this game takes the cake for clunky, Text and lore heavy RPGs. It's amazing, The game never holds your hand. You can't hack and slash through five bandits without having some sort of strategy. Your skills are actually useful and so is putting money towards training in a skill. If you love Elder Scrolls or RPGs in general, Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												After finishing Morrowind I have to say it was one of the best games I have played in a long time.The story was very intresting and with the two DLC's it adds more of a great story.The combat for me was simple but a bit borring, but the spells where very creative and really had allot of uses thoughout the game.The game itself only crashed on me three times and the number of bugs I expirienced where either minor or rare.

												Morrowind is likely the best game I've ever played; there are no boundries to what you can do, and even after twelve years there's still a huge community for the game. Morrowind has a wicked art style that's the most original I've seen in an RPG, rather than Oblivion and Skyrim's cliches. Hell, even the bandits are uniquely, or at least semi-uniquely named. And for those who need a visual boost, there's the Morrowind Overhaul which makes the visuals more up to date and is infinitely customisable. The only real caveat is the bugs, oh the bugs! But those can easlily be fixed with Morrowind Code Patch and Morrowind Patch Project, two very important mods. 9.5/10			"

												Welcome, N'Wah to the wonderful and unique world of Morrowind, they've taken you from the Imperial City to Vvardenfell and now you're epic quest begins. When you first step off the boat onto the island you'll find streaching before you a game unlike Oblivion or Skyrim. This game does not hold your hand, this is not a ""follow the quest arrow"" simulator. This is not a game that scales everything and anything to your character. Morrowind is a game that will let you fail. You can make NPCs hate you so much they are prevoked into attacking you. This game is crafted for fans of role-playing games, not casual minded gamers.Who should buy this game? Fans intreged by the idea of a game that doesn't hold your hands. Fans of older RPGs. Fans who love depth, lore and replayablility.Who shouldn't buy this game? People who do not like RPGs, who REQUIRE modern ""babby"" mechanics like quick travel and regenerating health. People who can't find their way around their house let alone Vvardenfell.			"

												I remember playing this game back in 2004 or 2005. Morrowind was the first game I played on pc. Disregard hours since I just bought it on steam now. I probably have over 1000 hours played on it.Although a very dated game in terms of graphics, I dont recall a single rpg that was better than this game. Unlike oblvion and skyrims main quest line, you're not thrown into whats probably the end of the world. You're given the freedom of time so you can hone your skills until the day you have to fight Dagoth Ur. The mechanics in Morrowind were never that great even back then, but the story and atmosphere do make up for it. The characters in Morrwind make you feel like you're actually there. The antogonist of Morrwind(Dagoth Ur) also has alot more personality then Alduin or Dagon could ever have.Overall a great game.			"

												For those thinking about trying Morrowind because they only started the series with later titles, you may find that Morrowind generally does hold up, though I recommend installing Morrowind Overhaul. Combat is a bit awkward as it relies on dice rolls based on your skills to even land a hit, but there are combat mods out there if you don't like that.If you're okay with reading you will get the most out of it. It's not as heavy as Pillars of Eternity, but there are some parts where you'll need to read a couple paragraphs to understand what's going on. This was the age before the quest compass too, so you'll need to read about and look for clues as to where you're supposed to go. For example, 'look for the fangs of whats-his-face and walk South', and it's referring to a rock formation—or 'he lives at the East end of this road', and you actually have to look for that road and head East. Morrowind does, however, explore the lore and history of the world better than any of the other titles, and it's setting is the most mature and interesting—dealing with drug addiction, slavery, bigotry, religious extremism, and the sex trade in ways that other Elder Scrolls titles never fully got into.Click here for gameplay sample with Overhaul 3.0 installed.

												Morrowind has the best storyline by far, and the landscapes are so unique and varied compared to other TES games. It also has more armor pieces, weapon types, potions, scrolls, proffesions etc. than any of the newer games. Even though the game is really old, it still has a thriving modding community that provides tons of landmass mods, quests, houses and even graphics that arguably makes it look even better than Skyrim!That being said, the combat system is pretty bad (atleast when you are low level), and the player/NPC animations are terrible.Morrowind is easily my favourite TES game of all time :)﻿			"

												This may be the highlight of the Elder scrolls series. Now, it has its flaws as most games of the earlier era did but the customization and the massive MASSIVE world makes up for whatever shortcomings it has.

												Definitely one of, if not the best, Elder Scrolls games. Morrowind's combination of amazing music, immersive story, and fantastic RPG elements definitely make it one of the best games I've ever played. Now since it's the year 2014, the graphics for Morrowind are considerably... laughable, but that's not reason to turn down this amazing game. If you're like me, and you play games mainly for the story, then give Morrowind a shot. It combines the use of directional sense and pen & paper when it comes to quests. You are not given a map, nor quest markers, so you are required to read the quest's objectives and find the goal yourself. I find that writing down locations and drawing a map are extremely useful when venturing out into the land of Morrowind, so you should give that a try too. The game heavily relies on character skills, attributes, and automatic dice rolls when it comes to just about everything. Combat is all about how likely you are to hit your enemies with your current abilities and attributes, rather than you making contact with your weapon. I've been in a number of frustrating situations where I flail my sword against my enemies, only to have me character miss with every swing. However, this is how things worked with table top games such as D&D, and it's nice to see it transitioned to video games, even if it was just the one of the few times. A combination of soothing music to lift the hearts of many adventurers, and intense gameplay, make Morrowind a definite must-play for all RPG fans.			"

												Before I'd begin, I'd like to say the only Elder Scrolls game I have played prior to this is Skyrim, which I have played since release. I had always been interested in the other games if nothing more then for lore.Morrowind is an interesting game, from my perspective. Coming directly into this after Skyrim, it's a much different experience. I bought the Game of the Year edition to get the full experience, as I had been told this was probably the best Elder Scrolls game. I booted it up, and started playing.The first thing I noticed is... Morrowind is NOT too kind to new players. You're thrown into the world with little to no direction other then go here and deliver a package. Which is not entirely a bad thing. Morrowind gives a sort of feeling of freedom, and pushes you to discover how things work on your own. While in Skyrim, there WAS a sort of feeling of ""freedom"", but if you did not do the main quest immedietally, or at least go into it, quite a few things were sealed off, like shouts and dragons. And the main quest always sort of felt like it was looming in the background and that I was screwing up by not playing it. Morrowind however, presented more of a... ""Take your time to get to know the place"" feel. How I can describe it from what I've played thus far? It's a lot like Dungeons and Dragons. You're thrown in, you pick your race, what you're good with, and your special skill/sign. Then you go into a world, get told your main quest... And then you do whatever you feel is right at the time. What REALLY gives it the DnD type feel to me is probably the dialog, which is fairly unique in feel.I'll probably come back to redo this review once I get a few more hours in, or at least enough knowlege of how to play the game correctly. This is my first impression review from someone who never played Morrowind. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.			"

												Recently I've come to the conclusion that Morrowind is my favorite Elder Scrolls game.  It was a true old-school RPG, of which only some elements survive in modern games.  There was no fast-travel, quest markers, or the ubiquitous crafting system that seems to be the same in every game nowadays.  There was only adventure! Morrowind is one of the biggest Elder Scrolls games by area and you can get lost for weeks in and out of game exploring all that countryside.  If you haven't played Morrowind, please do so! You'll be much better for the experience!			"

												Before I'd begin, I'd like to say the only Elder Scrolls game I have played prior to this is Skyrim, which I have played since release. I had always been interested in the other games if nothing more then for lore.Morrowind is an interesting game, from my perspective. Coming directly into this after Skyrim, it's a much different experience. I bought the Game of the Year edition to get the full experience, as I had been told this was probably the best Elder Scrolls game. I booted it up, and started playing.The first thing I noticed is... Morrowind is NOT too kind to new players. You're thrown into the world with little to no direction other then go here and deliver a package. Which is not entirely a bad thing. Morrowind gives a sort of feeling of freedom, and pushes you to discover how things work on your own. While in Skyrim, there WAS a sort of feeling of ""freedom"", but if you did not do the main quest immedietally, or at least go into it, quite a few things were sealed off, like shouts and dragons. And the main quest always sort of felt like it was looming in the background and that I was screwing up by not playing it. Morrowind however, presented more of a... ""Take your time to get to know the place"" feel. How I can describe it from what I've played thus far? It's a lot like Dungeons and Dragons. You're thrown in, you pick your race, what you're good with, and your special skill/sign. Then you go into a world, get told your main quest... And then you do whatever you feel is right at the time. What REALLY gives it the DnD type feel to me is probably the dialog, which is fairly unique in feel.I'll probably come back to redo this review once I get a few more hours in, or at least enough knowlege of how to play the game correctly. This is my first impression review from someone who never played Morrowind. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.			"

												Well, what can i say?I'm suprised. I've started from Skyrim - Oblivion - Now Morrowind.I finally decided to buy Morrowind, and so far the experience was pretty decent, i dont dislike the graphics like many people say, because the lore, content matter more, and if you have a decent PC, install Graphics Overhaul. it will look like Oblivion, or even better.This Elder Scrolls serie, is the most addicted edition, you need to run miles to reach your objetives, you need to read everything to understand what you need, is more survival than the other Elder Scrolls titles.The lands are so beautiful, and make you feel excited to explore them.The game is a ' true ' RPG, the magic... oh... magic in this game, is the biggest part, you can be whatever you want.The soundtrack, makes the player feel so confortable, while playing the game... every elder scrolls lover or fan, must try this game, such a piece of art... this review, was based on my hours, i m on the beginning, gonna update later!So far, the worst part, was the resolution... only available 1024x720But, check on youtube, many people can help you with that! enjoy this lovevly game!

												Most of you have played or heard about Skyrim and Oblivion. What you may not know is that neither of those games could match the mature tone and sense of mystery and wonder that Morrowind mastered. It certainly doesn't looks as good as those games, and the combat isn't as sharp, but it outshines them both in challenge and in freedom. Morrowind does not hold your hand; it does not direct you to points of interest and give you tips on how to improve. It simply offers a massive world to you and lets you do with it as you wish. Of course the main story wil show you a path, but don't expect waypoints or fast travel; You want to progress? It's all on you. And it's all the more rewarding because of it.			"

												I've noticed that the reviews for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim tend to be about why that game is the best Elder Scrolls game and the others are terrible in comparison. I really enjoy all three of them (sorry, Arena and Daggerfall, you're just not very enjoyable by today's standards), so I figured I'll give reviews for each that focus on what's unique about each of them, and what kind of players that will appeal to. Morrowind has easily the most vocal proponents of any of the three. They are very passionate about it, and insist that the latter two were disappointments. There's a pretty simple reason for that. It's easily the most chaotic of the three. What I mean by that is that you have far and away the most freedom and choices with Morrowind, but also easily the biggest negatives of the three games. Players who love chaos in their games tend to be the most vocal about what they want, so that's why you see Morrowind fans being the most passionate.For the positives of Morrowind, the aforementioned freedom is the biggest one. It doesn't funnel you into rapidly progressing through the main questline right away, and in fact discourages it through tying a need for certain levels in different skills to the ability to even receive many of the main quests. You are also free to decide which factions appeal to you, based on which skills you emphasize. Unlike Oblivion and Skyrim, you can't decide to progress all the way through the questlines of every faction. Several of them are incompatible with each other, so deciding which factions suit your playstyle is up to you. Morrowind also has the largest selection of spell types, armor types, weapon types, and even skill types (you can cast spells to blind enemies, use spears as your main weapon, and have all sorts of options not available in Oblivion and Skyrim). Another big draw is a beautiful soundtrack that really puts you in the game emotionally. The enchanted items also tend to be much cooler and more abundant than in later games. The recall and mark spells also provide a nice way to teleport out of danger or when you are overburdened. The environment is pretty cool, with swamps, ash storms, green plains, volcanoes and lava, and all sorts of other different types of scenery and climate.For the negatives of Morrowind, you have to be prepared to be much more frustrated with this game than you will with Oblivion or Skyrim. Many areas don't scale to your level, and so sometimes your freedom can be deceptive, as you can't realistically go to many parts of the island for a large chunk of the game without dying almost immediately. There is no fast travel to locations you've already visited, so you waste a lot of time walking the same roads over and over, or constantly paying for transportation between cities. The combat, magicka, and stealth dynamics are also much worse than in later games. Your magicka doesn't replenish on its own, so you have to either sleep, take potions, or wait far away from civilization (you can't use the wait function within a large radius of every town or city). Sneaking is a lot more difficult in this game, but less nuanced. A large portion of it is entirely luck based, regardless of how high your sneak skill is. The barter system is also fairly frustrating, with items costing exorbitant sums while merchants only have a small pool of gold to buy things with from you, so it takes forever to build up the large sums needed for many items.And now, let's talk about the biggest negative of the game, which also happens to be the biggest negative in any of the games: the combat system is terrible. Instead of your weapon skill determining how much damage you do, it determines (although somewhat loosely) whether or not your attacks connect. And even then, they will frequently miss. So you'll stand right in front of an enemy, swinging your weapon over and over, and very few of them will connect. Your fatigue affects it as well. A similar thing goes for spells, where every spell has a rather large chance of failing to cast, while still draining your magicka. It's the single dumbest decision Bethesda made with any of the Elder Scrolls games.This game is definitely worth it, although if you first play it after playing Oblivion or Skyrim, you have to change your expectations, because it is a lot less polished or refined than those two. If you love chaos/anarchy in your games, this will be your favorite. If not, it's still a great game to play, it just takes a lot of getting used to.			"

												Arguably one of the best W-RPGs of all time. Oblivion can go eat a sack of Guar ♥♥♥♥♥. (it would only eat 4 ♥♥♥♥♥ at a time though, because you'd hate to give the player choices or freedom in their open-world RPG)The combat is a bit wonky if you have ADHD and/or you're terrible at video games and can't get two hours into a game without complaining about stupid ♥♥♥♥, but the game excels in many other areas.Its deep RPG system, equipment system (Gee N'wah, how come your mom let you have TWO gloves?), exploration, many different quests and factions, soundtrack, and graphics (for its time; if you care about that type of thing), just to name a few.Did I mention you can ride a giant flying bug from a city made of huge mushrooms to a city that's likely bigger than all of Skyrim's cities combined, and meet god while walking past a jellyfish farm and a giant levitating prison asteroid, all while high on skooma?

												This game is the breaking point when Bethesda escaped the pixels, and was born into 3d amazingness. Though the graphics take some getting used to, once you break the 10 hour point, everything becomes an adventure, and here's why.1. Unlike its previous games (aka Daggerfall, Arena), Morrowind has a clear storyline for you to follow and make branched desisions off of.2. Unlike Skyrim, you can kill whoever you want, without them bowing down and regening their health.3. Unlike Oblivion, you can gain blessings from any shrine, all you have to do is donate some coin. (has a time limit)4. The island of vvardenfell takes an hour or so to cross, but will take 30 hours due to the amount of caves, ancestral tombs, daedric ruins, dunmer fortresses, and much much more. 5. Unlike other games, you can choose from a plethora of guilds and groups to join.(a.k.a. House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, Blades, East Empire Company, Fighters Guild, Imperial Cult, Imperial Legion, Mages Guild, Thieves Guild, Ashlander Tribes, Morag Tong, and the tribunal temple. You can also join one of three vampire clans such as the Aundae Clan, the Berne Clan, and the Quarra Clan.)So with all included, this is a pretty amazing game that deserves the awards it got in its day, and still has talking points that Skyrim, Oblivion, Daggerfall, and Arena cannot compete with.

												9/10 - I believe this is the best elder scrolls because of it's realistic feel, great immersion of the world and characters and racism. Oh, and guess what! This isn't pure nostalgia :O I got this game about 10 months after getting skyrim. And it's just great. Though... I wouldn't fight more than one npc at a time if your new to the game >.> because the combat isn't the best, well, let's change that to unforgiving... The story is the best of all the elder scrolls series! Though the graphics may be outdated, you can still have so much fun wandering the land of morrowing... and if you really need good graphics you can just get mods :o. Get the game. It's good.			"

												Absolutley fantastic game. My clocked hours is misleading, as i played most of this game during a car ride across the USA, btw. But to the point, this game is beautiful, in many ways. My favorite part is the environment and the atmosphere. Vvardenfel is such a strange place, you feel like your on another planet sometimes. Wandering through the ashlands, trudging through the swamps, or delving into a daedric ruin, there is tons of stuff to explore.  The dark elf culture is so vibrantly displayed, as is their reactions to other cultures. The customs and armors (especially bonemold, i love that stuff) are so peculiar and awesome, its like nothing you'll find elsewhere.  The sounds are great as well. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the game, however it is only 30min long, and the repitition gets a wee bit annoying sometimes.  The thing that i love the most about it is its complexity. This is not an easy game, and you need some knowledge to get through, unlike Skyrim, which was dumbed down for all the console CoD fans (still a great game tho). The leveling system works very well, the combat system does not. Using melee weapons is okay, but magic is freaking impossible. The graphics on this game are amazing, especially for 2002. They impress me even today. All in all, this is a great game. Highly reccomend it.			"

												I have played Skyrim. I played Skyrim obsessively. I got banned form Skyrim I played it so much. I loved it. I just bought this game. I have less than an hour on record. I already love it more. Everything i loved about Skyrim is improved in this older game. Heck, i even like just walking around more. Just watching myself walk! The combat is more depthful, and I feel it's more realistic. There is a lot more humour, and the landscape is much more interesting than Skyrim. I have not been playing long, but so far, I've loved everything I've seen.			"

												This game may perhaps be my favorite of all. Morrowind has an endlessly explorable world, is very believable, and very immersive. It's story is captivating, and I would say far more in that regard than its successors, The Elder Scrolls IV and V, Oblivion and Skyrim. Now, it may have some dated combat and some slightly dated graphics, but if you play intelligently the combat shouldn't be a real issue, and the graphics really aren't too terrible, aside from perhaps the low view-distance. I would highly reccomend this game.			"

												Great game, annoying as all hell fanbase. I first came into the Elder Scrolls series with Oblivion and was absolutely absorbed into Skyrim once the game finally released. Now considering myself a die-hard fan of the Elder Scrolls, I took to the internet and found that many considered Oblivion and Skyrim to both be dumbed-down knockoffs of the series' true crowning achievement: Morrowind. I was intrigued by the idea that what had become my favorite game series was spawned from what was apparently a flawless masterpiece that I had yet to experience, so I picked the game up on Steam immediately. I was then treated to appalling graphics with a draw distance shorter than I can throw a football (which isn't far), characters who walked around like they'd just completed a cycling tour of Europe, and fetch quests galore (Gathering mushrooms for the Mages Guild, anyone?). I then forgot about the game for several months until the ESO update announcement put it back into my consciousness. I decided that I owed it to myself to figure out what it was that made people adore this game so much and started a new playthrough. This time, I felt that I was finally seeing the game's charm. Quests without objective markers meant that some modicum of mental effort was actually required to complete them, giving a real sense of weight and accomplishment to even the most simple of tasks. The story and lore were rich and layered, not shying away from unsavory topics like slavery, drug abuse, and religious persecution. The combat, while lacking the fun and dynamic feeling of subsequent entries in the series, gave a real sense of progression as levelling up enabled my character to actually hit enemies and successfully cast what spells that had once felt far out of my depth. I don't have too many hours into the game just yet, but I've explored a great deal of the map and progressed into the main story and can't wait to play for many hours more. I would recommend this game to any Elder Scrolls fan with the caveat that they'll have to look past the game's lackluster, outdated exterior to find the truly excellent experience within. Despite what its most rabid fans will tell you, this game is by no means perfect. However, it is a blast to sink your teeth into and definitely worth your time.			"

												first off i will establish this: morrowind definitely has aged- a lotbut what'd you expect?? it's a 14 year old game- probably older than 65% of all steam users (wow hilarious and original joke am i right???)you're supposed to feel out of place and confused in this game- you're on your own, no one to hold your handand i can totally see why that can be detrimental but it really doesn't have to be! just like give this game a chance- the depth of this game is incredible; you just gotta dig to get to it!the moral of the story is:  where my n'wahs at10/10 would lay for eighty days and eight though headless to increase my spear skill			"

												Don't let my ""hours played"" fool you, I played this game before steam was a thing. My first RPG, and my favorite one to this day. The stealth system wasn't as workable as the newer ones, but you could say it was more realistic. Once enemies are on alert, they will find you, it's only a matter of time. Decided to go wandering the northern parts of vvardenfall before you even found your first enchanted weapon? Probly gonna have a bad time. Not only that, the fast travel is expensive early on, and you can't just fast-level blacksmithing and smith daedric armor like in skyrim. You want that daedric shield and sword? You're gonna have to kill that dremora over there for it, and he gets to use them against you first. And by the nine, use your journal, it will save your life.			"

												In my oppinion this is one of the best games that has ever been made. The gameplay and details were way ahead of the rest of the competition, and honestly still is. Many current games still are trying to reach the point that this 2003 title attained. This game has a way of getting you lost in another fantasy life that i have not found anywhere else, with the music, lore and trials.			"
