												For a game that I had 0 hype for and wasn't even on my radar, it's shocking how let down I was by Lichdom. The concept really grabbed me. I love wizards and the idea of a game that could really let you cut loose and let you wreck havoc with its entire focus put on making you feel like a mighty wizard among mortals seemed like exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, you'll quickly find that the game's definition of ""badass wizard"" is extremely narrow, and even worse, they really don't deliver. The game brags having thousands of spells, and while that may be technically true, it rings hollow. Spells are crafted by combining elements that you unlock through the story and spell modifiers that drop as loot, so you have potentially infinite combinations on paper. The result however is that you have 3 spell types with a million permutations that only change a few decimal points are on the numbers that pop up. Elements are meaningless, just pick what particle effect you want on your projectiles. If you were expecting some real magic, like summoning dogs, lighting them on fire and throwing them at your enemies, you will be sorely disappointed.The gameplay is where things really grind down though. The levels are just corridors a mile long with the only interaction being busting up the game's equivalent of decorative vases. The enemies are mindless and predictable, and so is fighting them. You walk into a clearing, combat music plays, a bunch of skeletons pop up out of the ground, walk backwards and throw ice/fire/lighting balls at them until dead. As said before you only have 3 real spells. A basic fireball in whatever flavor of particle effect have on, an AOE attack/bomb in whatever flavor particle effect you have on, and a block that does damage if you time it right. In whatever flavor particle effect you have on. The enemies have little variation either. Melee guy that runs up and slaps you, ranged guy that throws♥♥♥♥♥♥at you, and sometimes theres a ghost that floats around and freezes you. Expect to see groups of about 8 of them pop up every 15 feet, about 30 times a level. No puzzles, no talking and investigating, just walking from one fight to another. The game promises dungeons and quests made specifically for a wizard, unhindered by needing to allow warriors or barbarians through, and all I could think while playing it was how much more satisfying it would be bashing skeletons to pieces with a hammer than dealing with the game's slow clunky combat casting.The gameplay honestly just feels like skyrim's magic. Hold down button to charge fireball/aoe, point at enemy. Except in Skyrim you could dual wield magic. And you could summon creatures. And you could cast enchantments on yourself. And you could summon magic weapons and slash and smash enemies if you wanted. And there were more than 3 kinds of spells. And And And. The list goes on. When a game focused soley and entirely on one thing can't even do that thing better than a game that really only includes that thing in an ancilliary manner, you've got a real problem. Skyrim is NOT the best game to experience being a wizard, yet Lichdom has chosen to emulate its combat system more closely than any other game I can think of, puts its entire focus on that one aspect, and frankly only improves on it by a degree of maybe like, what %5? If that? But guess what, skyrim isn't 40 bucks, and it's got an entire everything else going for it.Lichdom has some things going for it, it looks good and It's got a good working loot system. It's not painful to play or anything, but it isn't great, and above all else, it's not what it promises to be. It doesn't make you feel like you're an almighty wizard any more than sweepng the driveway will make you feel like a bulldozer.Tldr: lichdom falls short of everything promised. Weak magic, repetitive gameplay, tiny scope. If you want to feel like a real unstoppable wizard, play morrowind and craft fireballs the size of cities. If you want frantic action with an interesting spell casting system and cathartic blow stuff up fun, play magicka and trap your friends in bubbles full of landmines and zombies.			"

												Usually when I write up a game, I start with all the good points and then transition to the bad stuff. I feel like this makes for a more positive reading experience overall, and should make my impression of it whole and clear by the end. I'm not going to do that this time, because the first thing you need to know about Lichdom is that it is too damn long. Now, this is not ""the new Shadow Warrior is too damn long"" or ""the Hobbit trilogy was too damn long"" or ""presidential primary season is too damn long"". This is an entirely new paradigm of too damn long, and you really need to understand this before even considering this game. My first playthrough took 22 hours. That's certainly long for an FPS, and short for some other genres with a little overlap here, but those 22 hours were stretched over eight levels. That's it! Furthermore, those eight levels play more like five, because three of them are continuations of the previous level. There's a lost city level, two ice levels, two desert levels, two swamp levels, and a proper city level. With each of those lasting 2-3 hours, you're going to be wandering through huge stretches of glacier and sand and muck.But what really makes this game feel like it takes forever is the level design itself. Lichdom is constructed in the vein of an arena shooter, much like Shadow Warrior or Bulletstorm. Hallways lead to conspicuous arenas where you fight whatever spawns in, after which you take another hallway to another arena and so on and so forth. There are no puzzles, no doors, no interactables, almost no alternate paths, and very little reason to explore off the main trail. There are some side fights and usually one or two secret dungeons that can get you valuable piles of spell components, but in terms of gameplay you're just getting harder versions of the fights you're doing normally. So yes, the cardinal sin of this game is that it is 20+ hours of the same damn thing. What you get in the first two hours is what you're going to get times ten, with arguably even less variety as you progress.Still with me? Good, because if you can get past that admittedly enormous flaw, there's a pretty great game in here. The whole reason to play Lichdom is to make good on the whole BADASS MAGE thing, and the magic system delivers. Instead of guns or swords, you fight solely with magic that you can customize to an impressive degree. Over the course of the game you unlock eight sigils, which are elements like fire and ice but also more curious concepts like corruption and delirium, and you can have three equipped and ready to use at any given time. Each sigil has three spells attached to it for you to use. There's a targeted spell that can be built as a homing missile, a bomb you lob, or a channeled beam. There's an AoE spell that can be an explosion, a pool, or a trap that must be triggered. And there's a nova that has conditions for triggering it depending on your shield (more on shields later). On top of that, you can determine the EFFECT of each spell, either direct damage, a status effect, or a damage multiplier, which also varies in its function by sigil. Fire spells can knock down and burn over time, lightning spells can stun and chain across enemies, delirium spells can mind control and make enemies flee, and so on.And honestly, that's just the basics. Spells can critically hit for additional effects, or be charged before casting for a guaranteed crit. Charged spells can do a special crits charmingly named ""apocalypticals"" which give you a bonus effect based on the inflicting sigil. You can craft special synergy spells that use two sigils instead of one and have awesome room-clearing effects like collapsing black holes or summoning exploding zombies or conjuring a hurricane. You also build a shield spell for yourself that represents your hit points and determines additional abilities like teleporting and blocking. Spells are crafted out of Diablo-style loot drops from enemies and chests, color-coded by rarity (white-green-blue-purple-orange-red, of course). These components can be combined up to higher grades, disassembled for specific parts, or gambled away for a chance at rare components. If this sounds overwhelming, there's a Smart Inventory option that will upgrade your spells and combine up your components for you. Honestly though, if you're not in it to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out over your spells, you're missing a huge part of the game. You've got a ton of control over your arsenal, and experimentation is incredibly fun with the enormous range of effects and combinations your can produce.As hard as I slagged the level design, I have to say they are pleasing to progress through. The CryEngine makes for some gorgeous scenery, and a lot of love went into rendering the battlegrounds and cesspools you traverse. The levels themselves can be pretty creative, even if their layout is not. The third level is particularly impressive once you figure out what it is. While there is a lot of detail, it's worth mentioning that there are no destructables or physics objects. This felt particularly disappointing while slinging around devastating spells, even if the spell effects themselves are meaty and satisfying. There's a pretty good variety of enemies as well, or at least there would be for a shorter game. About half are introduced early on and the rest are slowly sprinkled in so there is some variety to the battles, even if you're going to be fighting every possible combination of foe at least twice.The story is nothing special, classic fantasy revenge story, but the voice acting is pretty great. You get to play as Troy Baker or Jennifer Hale, and whichever one you don't pick becomes your NPC traveling buddy. And let me tell you, they are some clever, snippy jackasses. The other characters mostly talk like Tolkien characters but these two love cursing and quipping at each other and everything in a perfectly charming way. Your mentor figure is Clancy Brown (swarthy Lex Luthor from the Superman cartoons!), and the villains and side characters all turn in quality performances as well. I will say that the plot does something dumb in the swamp levels that cuts into the voice acting fun quite a bit, but by that point you're probably just trying to power through to the end. There are some pretty good and challenging boss battles, and the New Game Plus mode if you manage to beat the game is great for dicking around and tricking out your mage; it's a big series of challenge portals with different randomized fights and scaling difficulty.So there you go, a writeup almost as long and meandering as the game itself. I've certainly gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it, chiefly because the spellcrafting and combat are excellent and the presentation is fantastic. But even I was getting sick of the game by the ten-hour mark, and that wasn't even halfway. I really pushed myself to finish it, and I'm glad I did, and I still kinda want to play it now and then. It's just important to know what you're getting into, and prepare for a lot of monotony if you want to get to the meat of the game. Pick it up on sale like I did ($5 is a steal for a game of this quality, at least!) and give the first level a try, and if you're cool with that for another 20 hours, enjoy depopulating a faraway kingdom with fire and locusts and zombies and time rifts. Forever.			"

												Game was a ton more fun in beta. Then they went and changed a ton of minor (but very important mechanics in the game, like how often you get upgrades. Which was decent in beta, now with release its almost never). They also did a major overhall on the ability to dodge enemies (unlimited unless you limited yourself but got other boosts, now it is 3 dodges max, with a long long cooldown). I had 10 hours in the beta and loved the game, just played an hour of official release and I just cant bother. Their whole thing about making mages seem strong was completely destroyed with the official release, and like many games (as a mage) with every encounter I am spending atleast 2/3 of my time running away and less than 1/3 attacking. Which frankly makes me feel against like any old squishy mage, and you might as well just throw in a mana bar that regenerates over time because its comes out to the same thing, if you dont spend most of your time running way you just straight up die before you can cast enough spells to kill anything beyond the weakest of the weak enemies. I seriously cant believe how much they destroyed their main selling point when they went from beta to release.			"

												No, this is not Skyrim. It is more of a hallway shooter with f***ing awesome spells. There is no open world or anything like that. It's more like a Serious Sam, or Painkiller with magic and a great spell crafting system, which is fine with me, I love that kind of a game. Sometimes you just want to run around and kill things in all sorts of fun, creative ways. Perfect for late night gaming sessions. It's also $20 less than your typical ""big deal"" full release, or even much less than that if you got it when it was early access, like I did. I already have my deep RPG's, more than I can even play. It's nice to just have something like this to sit back with a beer, pump up the headphones, relax and enjoy at the end of a long day. Bottom line, it is just a fun time.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage promises hours of fun combat as a powerful battlemage but, sadly, the actual game leaves a lot to be desired. Thought the game would be fun but all it is, is spam the left mouse button and follow the path. It gets boring after 30minsPros:-very good graphics and spell effects-frantic combat backed by responsive controls-deep spell creation system-Steam trading cards & Achievements-pretty funCons:-boring, mostly linear level design -same-ish and sometimes unbalanced enemy encounters get dull and/or frustrating after awhile-spell creation system is barely explained and extremely convoluted-overall uninteresting story is also very slow to unfold-pacing problems made worse by extremely long levels-lack of enemy variety-some checkpoints are too far and/or badly placed			"

												I admire this concept. I was excited by it when I first read the description of Lichdom somewhere on the Internet. World certainly lacked a game where you could really feel like a mage, casting endless spells and wreaking mayhem around yourself.You even feel wrong while playing it, because until now, in any other game, this kind of gameplay has only been available through cheating. You are basically immortal (in case of ""death"" you actually just despawn and spawn back at the nearest checkpoint), you have an abyss of magical energy that never exhausts, and you can just keep throwing orbs of fire at your enemy until it dies. Overall, it's all you could only dream of if you ever chose to be a mage in an RPG. Do you remember how you had to sleep in order to restore your mana after killing every_single_enemy in Morrowind? Feels like nightmare now.Lichdom makes use of the old principle of making magic that you could find in certain games in the past. You need to 'craft' spells by means of combining certain elements: the basic source (like fire), shaper (like projectile) and effect caused (like damage). Shapers and effects have several levels of strength and can be upgraded to improve them. The crafting system is tricky: a lot depends upon your ability to analyze the spell components, understand the way they work, and pick up those that would make the spell the most efficient. Thus, your work on the spells should be scrupulous and meticulous. Certain people fail to understand that, and it's rather funny to see them complaining that enemies are too strong, spells are too weak, and they can't just come through the whole game with one set of spells they created at the very beginning.Speaking of which, you can have 3 sets of spells at hand, each set consisting of a single-target spell, a multiple-target spell and a protective spell. Personally I could use more creativity and variability in both crafting and management of spells: you can't combine two different kinds of shapers or effects, for example, or have two single-target spells in one set. Still, I think it's fine the way it is.People criticize Lichdom for making promises about thousands of possible spells that come out to be not entirely true. There's a bit of marketing manipulation in that, indeed; it would have been more technically correct to speak of hundreds than of thousands. The arithmetics is as follows: 3 types of spells - 3 ways to attune them - 7 main types of shaping - 8 basic sources; that's 504 in total. Also, unique and extra-strong synergy spells can exist between the basic sources, adding another 49. The rest of spell variability resides upon random modifications that come up with certain shapers and effects: damage boosts, projectile speed increasers, critical hit chance multipliers etc. I have also seen a number of reviewers who believed that basic sources (""sigils"" by in-game terminology) are all the same and only change the color of projectiles you cast. That's basically a bitter mistake of people who saw the first three sigils and decided that they've seen them all. I feel pity for them, because they will never know that you can hang your opponents in the air and smash them into the ground, summon an army of creatures to assist you, slow the time down, control the minds of your enemies, create black holes that tear them apart, cast meteor showers or whirlwinds of fire and ice etc. Also, each sigil is suited for a certain purpose, so by means of careful and skilled attunement you can create incredibly powerful spells. What do you think of killing the main endgame boss with all his monstrous health in a couple of minutes?CryEngine obviously is not designed for open-world games, so this game has a strong resemblance to a first-person shooter where you just follow a wide but still limited passageway. I would have preferred a greater freedom of exploration and probably some other things that might make Lichdom more Skyrimey as well; but maybe it's not that bad, because you have enough trouble dealing with all those shapers and augments to care about grabbing loot or running around with a map.There's also been a lot of criticism for repetitive gameplay. As one person had said, ""you just travel from one pack of enemies to another"". The trick is that Lichdom is a shooter (as I've just said), and any shooter can be called repetitive. Games of that genre are played for the action and for the process of killing enemies standing in your way. Take Crysis 2 or 3, that are built upon the same engine, as an example. Can't you say that it's travelling from one bunch of CELL soldiers or cephalopods to another? Meh, you can even call Half-Life repetitive: ""oh come on, kill some headcrabs - solve a puzzle, kill some zombies - solve a puzzle, repeat ad nauseam"".I won't be saying anything about graphics here, because again, it's CryEngine. You know what I mean.You can choose whether you'll play with a male or a female, but there are no editing options for the character. That's not a big problem, because the game doesn't have a third-person view, so you won't really get a lot of chances to enjoy their exterior. I enjoy the female character's voice instead; it's quite nice, and it reminds me of Commander Shepard.  I've said about things I liked and things I'm fine with, now I'll say what troubles me.The game is still slightly buggy. It's not critical, it won't crash, freeze, or make you lose your progress, but there might be minor issues like character starting to move automatically in one direction with no way to stop it except for exiting to game menu and loading the game again, or birds hanging in mid-air after they were supposed to fly away. It's a new release, though, and probably these things will be dealt with in future.It also seems to me that spells and their effects are not that action-like. It's a common trouble in many games, and it partially exists in Lichdom too. What happens if a fireball impacts an enemy and explodes? Yes, your guess was right: the enemy continues to run at you without even losing a step. This is a fireball, after all; it should knock the enemy off its feet and bump it into the nearby wall. If you decide to use a lightning projectile, be ready that your character will cast a slowly flying orb of electricity instead of a flashing lightning bolt. I'd like to see a swifter and more explosive gameplay. Maybe it's a matter of personal taste, though.So, the primary positive feature of Lichdom is its concept to unshackle the mage,and the primary negative feature of it is that I do not actually feel badass. I feel cool, but not badass.In general, I like this game, and I support it. To me, its virtues outweigh its drawbacks. If you like the idea behind it as much as I do, if you ever dreamed of limitless magical power, then don't hesitate and get it - it won't disappoint you.			"

												Lichdom Battlemage was a game I highly anticipated, but the game just did not fulfill my expectations.You might note that I spent 38 hours playing the game. Well, yes, that's correct.First of all you have to manage to reach the end. It's a rather long game, some of the levels are huge and seem like they will never end at all. Then there is the difficulty, this game can be freaking hard! Unless you shift down to casual mode you will die plenty of times. And then there are the achievements, which I enjoy hunting, so all in all it took some time to find my verdict.The reviews and articles about this game like to mention the word 'bad♥♥♥♥♥mage'. Well, there might be some bad♥♥♥♥♥in this game but it's definitely not you or me. And even if you reach the highest tiers in all you magic abilities you still won't be the bad♥♥♥♥♥you dreamed of. Besides, it is very unlikely that you will reach level 20 of any of your ability by a one time play-though. But luckily the game lets you continue progressing your abilities and strengths after reaching the end of the game. You even have the chance to move back in the levels you have already played, just this time there are more enemies and they are much stronger than before. Your masochistic attitude will define if you are going to like this or rather not.So did I have fun?Well, yes, I had some fun, but not enough to make me recommend this game.Let's have a look at the pros and cons.Pros:- nice graphics- fighting is fun and looks very cool- after too many gamer complaints the developers added an automated spell crafting system (that works but always keeps you wondering if a spell could not have been done better)- developers added some extra levels called portals to keep you playing after you finished the game- five difficulty settings. So why is this a good thing? Because there was only one difficulty level before player complaintsCons:- cry engine 3, it's going to cost you if you want to enjoy this game in full details in full HD without stuttering- the story is boring, to be frank, I could not care less- the only two things you can do in this game is fighting or redefining and upgrading your spells. Fighting makes you gain accessories for spells.- fighting becomes too repetitivespell-crafting is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I still don't really understand it in full detail- no manual (yes, you will painfully miss it and you will find yourself searching the net for clues on spell-crafting, trust me)- limited range of enemies that almost stays the same group of foes from the beginning to the end of the game- very linear level design- boss fights are rather tiring than existing- some actions make you loose some of all your progress in spell crafting. Like when you switch to 'bad♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty all spell crafting experience for all spells not equipped is reset to level 1. Is this bad? Yes, this is bad !!!- the game can be very frustrating if you play on medium difficulty or higherSince I like to collect achievements I kept playing after finishing the main game. That's why I ended up with 38 hours play time. But would I recommend this game to a friend? No, sorry, just can't do that!If it's on sale for like 5 bucks or less I think it's OK to buy the game but do not expect too much. My  expectations where high. Maybe that's why I was somewhat disappointed. The bad things in this game simply outnumber the good things and that's what leaded to my verdict. In terms of gaming magazine ranking my verdict would be around 60 for this game. Do I regret playing Lichdom Battlemage?Not really, but I am more than happy to leave it behind. "

												This game is exactly what it says on the box. You are a mage. You have great power. You have no responsibility.I have one huge gripe with this game and it's that nothing is explained, which makes the crafting system a ♥♥♥♥♥.I had spells with 10 different variables listed on them. After playing through the game thrice I only understand HALF of them.I'm not even kidding.Luckily, you don't have to understand the chemistry of flammable materials in order to pull a trigger and the spells work just fine even if you don't know wtf you're even doing.Just find a combo that gets the job done, and stick with it.For example, after skimming tutorials on crafting I made a build that allowed me to debuff my enemies, freeze them in place, set them on fire, explode them into bloody chunks, STOP TIME FOR 5 SECONDS, and then kill all their friends.This pleases me.On my second playthrough I made a build which involved infecting my enemies with the eggs of stinging insects, waiting for the eggs to 'mature' and then killing the first enemy, which freed the insects to attack the second enemy, which then spawned more insects to attack the next enemy...and so on.This self-perpetuating insect cascade scoured the board clear of anything that irked me.And if anything survived I electrocuted it to death.And don't get me started on the kamikaze ghoul you can summon who breathlessly chuckles at you while he searches for enemies to blow himself up against.""Huehuehuehue.

(will be updating this soon)Lichdom is a very promising game as far as early access go. It has a silky gloss of polish over most of the important aspects of the game. It certainly look and feel professional, however, it being an early access, there are a few ""hic-ups"" along the way. Overall the game is worth the money imo. The devs have proven to have listened to their community very activity, and has updated the game fairly regularly. I think It has the potential to become some thing pretty incredible. This Early build is already fun as hell. Sure, has some issues, but considering it's alpha, it's pretty fun.Pros:- AAA feeling visuals- Fast, and twitchy combat- Combat feels fluid and responsive- Deep spell crafting system- Can be challengingCons:- Still parts where you can very much tell it's early access- Could be overly challenging for some.- Some pacing issues.

												I was excited to see the premise behind this game, and I must admit the hype got the better of me. I should've waited for more reviews. The following are the reasons why I do NOT recommend this game to anyone. 1: I have been a RPG fan for the majority of my life, and I can tell you: This is not a RPG. Consider Serious Sam, only instead of bullets you shoot magic. There is no strong story line, no character development, no sensible balance between physical-magical abilities and no items. Just mindless hack and slash from area to area without any rhyme or reason. Most notably, there is no discoveries or adventure, which is perhaps the most notable aspect of any good RPG.2: The premise of magic is abhorrently wrong. One can clearly sense that the developers had some system of magic like Skyrim in mind, and thought: ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if the hero had no limitations like mana etc?"".The result is just bizarre. You can only have 1 spell equipped at any time, there is no artistic way of combining them together: Simply hack and slash, just with magic. Even Dragon Age 2 got it better than this, of course far far better. Not to mention games like Path of Exile which have a clearly different and much better progress.3: The diffidently spikes are extremely annoying. You have 3 shields, if you lose them, you die and have to start from the checkpoint. Easy? Nope: - ""I just wanna be a tanky mage with lots of AOE!"" - ""No can do sonny, now dodge, dodge, DODGE! RUN! Oh you got hit twice? You dead sonny, start from the beginning.""//To recap, the whole premise is a lie: This is neither a Role Playing Game nor is based on Magic (at least so far that other success RPGs have put forward). If you are a fan of hack and slash games you may like this, but others please stay away and do not waste 40$ on this one.			"

												Lichdom for a while was fun, finding new abilities and spells, creating new things, collecting tons of sygils. It was lovely fun to use new things to destroy every foe. But a few chapters in, it became super annoying, repetitive, and even boring. eventually you settle on whatever best combo you have to take out enemies and constantly use it. sure you can make new moves with different powers but that takes time and more and more sygils, why bother when you have a set that already works? Even with a working killing combo (IE set fire to foes, levetate them, put them in stasis bubble then use killing blow for x20 damage) you still get smacked and pelted around by random guys all over the room who are out of your FOV. Some enemies put shields around the ones your killing, ruining the combo, which is fine thats gameplay but it constantly disrupts the flow, as does being knocked down, just feeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and aggrivating.And to top off the feeling of battle, if you don't charge abilities (holding down a mouse button till it pings) you do little to no damage, elongating an already cumbersome fight. The only way to really take down enemies is fast and hard, comboing mastery stacks, then hitting at the end. but to do that you must charge EVERY SINGLE MOVE into a super critical, and holy crap its so boring to just charge over and over and over and then be sometimes knocked over during this by the enemy.Flow is another thing, this game has awful pacing. its battle battle battle, listen to some guy talk for about 12 seconds, battle battle battle battle. I can't even finish the game I feel utterly bored and bothered.Give it a looksie, its a pretty game, and it has some great ideas. I just personally am fed up enough to uninstall it right now. I'd rather go play almost anything else right now.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT:I'm still playing right now but I figured I should comment on some of the positive aspects now that I have a better grip on the gameplay and am not rushing a review before leaving for work. First, the impact of magic is badass. When you play, particularly when using fire spells, the first thing you will notice is that the impact of spells is unlike any other game out there. Embers shoot off of enemies, and there is even a nice touch where nearby foliage can be scorched. I adjusted my graphics preset to medium and am happy to report that there seems to be very little loss of visual fidelity while at the same time a noticeable increase in performance. I still wish there were more advanced options, and choosing a preset is definitely favorable to customizing your options, as it will often result in worse performance.I maintain that the level design is very linear, however, there are branching paths. Upon starting a new game I was able to experience a rather engaging mini-boss fight that I did not see before. As for being able to run past enemies, it is not as severe of a problem as I initially thought. Enemy AI is fairly competent (ranged enemies keep their distance and even take cover from spells while melee enemies rush you as expected), however, the problem seems to be that enemies are tethered to certain areas. This is fixed in a few areas, like the boss arena, that require you to jump into an arena, however the problem still persists in many places. I would like to see enemies be able to follow you wherever you go and maybe even a new enemy type that can outrun the player.Animations are very high quality. Incinerating skeletons and watching their burning forms recoil and slump to the ground is satisfying, and all the enemies move and attack in realistic ways. I still think that the slow motion dodge (though extremely cool) is a bit too powerful, though I definitely see the merits of ranged combat now that I have to deal with the pesky archers. If anything, AOE attacks seem underpowered considering they take longer to charge up than any other attack and are used for close range, a situation where the dodge move would most likely be far more effective and easy. I'm sure there will be plenty of balancing, though.So yes, I definitely recommend buying this game right now. This build is very solid as far as pre-alphas go and if I were you I would definitely grab it for the discounted price now.****End EditFrom what I've played so far, I can say it is alright, especially for pre-alpha.There are not a lot of spells that are available right now, but I'm sure they will be added later. First the things I don't like:-Sluggish movement-No jumping-Lack of crosshairs and ambiguous UI-Problems with dialogue being voiced (don't know if voices are integrated yet or this is my problem) and some artifacting problemsMy biggest concern, however, is the level design. I was able to beat the entire game (thus far) by simply running past enemies and then later spamming the slow motion move that burns/ices a path. Very disappointing. Spellcasting right now simply isn't that fun. Most enemies rush you and certain spells are FAR more useful than others. The basic projectile spells pale in comparison to your slow-mo and AOE attacks, but take a similar amount of time to charge.I can say that the game does look pretty good, particularly in the lighting department, though it is not perfectly optimized yet. Again, I will require some more playthroughs. As of right now I have run through the first mission and about half of the second one. The story is fairly nonsensical, unfortunately. It looks like effort is being put into it, though, so maybe more context will be established in the future. Right now it is DEFINITELY pre-alpha. As long as some of the balancing problems are fixed, the game is optimized a bit better (and we are given some advanced graphics options), then this will be a worthwhile release. Right now I'm coming away feeling lukewarm about the whole thing, but that isn't a bad thing at all considering the early state of the game.			"

												It might be fun to play for some people, but it wasn't for me.Lichdom: Battlemage is basically a first person shooter with magic. The advertising goes like ""be a mage with unlimited power, no cooldowns or anything"". Having unlimited power, the ""mage"" feels fairly limited. Not only does your magic often enough feel incredibly weak and slow, the entirely unnecessary base damage/health value increase over the course of the game makes fighting a lot more annoying than it is fun.The game starts off being rather easy. Enemies in the first two regions of the game (Drivasser City and the caves underneath) are pretty easy to defeat. However, during the course of the third region the player is introduced to (the snowy Greyteeth Mountains) difficulty tends to spike and reach a level where combat becomes a tedious chore and no fun at all anymore. Increasingly large groups of enemies dotted with more and more ""miniboss"" or ""empowered mob"" kind of foes start applying a headache inducing number of rapidfire CC effects on the player, which are terribly hard- to often impossible to dodge or deflect. For example, there will be a low powered ranged-attack mob shooting arrows that freeze the player. While damage to the player will break the ice, those mobs shoot these arrows in rather rapid succession, freezing you on every hit. This combined with CC effects of other enemies that usually spawn in tow of these can lead to the player being frozen, stunned, slowed or otherwise impaired litterally for minutes before there is even a slight chance to break such a chain, given that the player survives it at all. That said, the players very few own useful CCs are usually frail, weak, slow to deploy and outright unrelieable. For example freezing: You can usually freeze most enemies with a simple Ice-beam spell or an ice shot, which usually works on trashmobs with no to little special effects. However, enemies which you would actually NEED to be frozen are either not affected, or the effect works only for maybe a half to two seconds, which doesn't really give you time for a worthy followup. That said, all enemies (especially bosses, minibosses and empowered mobs) seem completely randomly immune to CC effects like freezing or being held in place by a kinetic spell, which, as mentioned before, makes these spells utterly unrelieable. The fact that enemies tend to spawn around and right next to you, doesn't really help you keep control or fight systematically. I know that some level of chaos and surprise attacks by newly spawning enemies is an integral part of the fun in these games, but there is a fine line between it being fun or just utterly annoying.Combine all that with a completely unnecessarily complex and unrewarding spell crafting system (granted, the smart inventory crafting system helps a little but it has it's limits), unnecessary difficulty spikes through utterly over-powerful enemy types being introduced, and a completely off-putting story and storytelling.Story... I have yet to experience something of the sort in this game. Basically it goes: The Cult of Malthus is your enemy because it's evil. Go and murder as many as you can and kill their bosses. Oh and they have undead. Enjoy.That not being enough, the ""mage"" (player character) called ""Dragon"" in this game, isn't actually a mage, but some random person the Cult has done wrong by, which is handed a pair of magic bracers that allow throwing spells, make you unkillable (if you die you get revived by waypoints without loadscreens and regular dying is actually part of the lore), and give you shields. The player character has actually no frickin idea how his/her magic works and is magic-wise generally a dumb n00b.Personal note: I don't feel like playing a ""mage"" when the ""mage"" is just some random idiot with enchanted weapons and hasn't worked for their magic power by study or training AT ALL.Anyway, now for the positive aspects of the game:Amazingly beautiful environments. Seriously, the game world might lack some of the fidelity and dynamic effects of for example Crysis (this is a Cry-Engine 3 game after all), but still it is extremely beautifully crafted. Surroundings look entirely awesome, that much must be said. Characters, enemies and most special effects like spells or fire also look very nice (ice/freezing being the possible exception), but a game is not just about looks.Sadly however, for all it's good looks, there's very little one can do in the environment. Shoot a few glowing plants or ice crystals here and there, and find a book or a scroll for some journalbound lore now and then, but that's largely it.The soundtrack is decent, yet largely unremarkable.The most positive aspect of the game for me is that, however in a game like this most people would maybe consider it unnecessary, the player get's to choose if the protagonist should be male or female, while the game is actually completely voice acted for both player genders. It might be a minor detail for some, but I find it very nice and would wish for more games to include that option.So. Very bad and annoying combat gameplay, unnecessary damage/healthrange increases, needlessly complex crafting system (with the recent addition of an automated crafting system which is alright), really really beautiful graphics, not mentionworthy story that doesn't really make too much sense, player choice of gender.I cannot really recommend the game, but if you like first person shooters with a ""challenging"" gameplay in a fantasy setting with little in the way of a compelling tale and you don't mind retrying a lot, sure, go ahead.

												This game is great. I bought it the moment it came out, and I don't regret it. If you read the negative comments, they mostly focus on 3 things, 1) Too hard, 2) Spell making isn't great, or 3) too repetitive.Well, It's hard. There are boss fights and even mini boss fights which I will slam my head against for hours. If you don't like a challenge, don't play. This game wasn't meant to be a stroll through the park, it was meant to really challenge a mage-type character. I enjoy difficulty, so I enjoy this game.The spell making is much more than what the negative comments would make you think. Yes, there are only three basic types of spells (Area, Target, Nova). However, there are multiple types of each spell. For example, targeted spells can be rays, missiles, a lobbed bomb, etc. Then, once you've chosen the type of spell, and it's category, you can choose modifiers. You can go for super fast, super destructive, crowd control, etc. AND that's not even all. Don't forget the sigils, each sigil is a different type of magic with different effects and usages. To top it off, when you're crafting spells, the most powerfull spells use two sigils, and that mixture brings epic destruction.  There is plenty of spell variety if you're looking for it.No, it is not repetitive. There is quite a bit of grinding, I won't deny that, but that is only due to how difficult the boss fights can get. The more you kill the more spell components you get, the better spells you can craft, the more powerful you become. When you get to boss fights, different bosses require different strategies. Some you have to cc and kill quickly, others you have to dodge and run and hit hard when you can. Some bosses you have to walk right up to them and just hit them non-stop until they slam into the ground and explode (It looks awesome). p.s. I forgot to mention when it comes to spells, there are also sheilds.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage promises hours of fun combat as a powerful battlemage but, sadly, the actual game leaves a lot to be desired.PROS:-very good graphics and spell effects-frantic combat backed by responsive controls-deep spell creation system-pretty fun for the first few hoursCONS:-boring, mostly linear level design -same-ish and sometimes unbalanced enemy encounters get dull and/or frustrating after awhile-spell creation system is barely explained and extremely convoluted-overall uninteresting story is also very slow to unfold-pacing problems made worse by extremely long levels-lack of enemy variety-some checkpoints are too far and/or badly placed


Lichdom: Battlemage 
A Screenshot of Lichdom: Battlemage
By: stranger1982




The game starts pretty strong and the first few hours are fun while you blast enemies left and right and try to follow the story: after a bit several design problems start to rear their ugly heads. You slowly realize levels basically funnel you along a mostly linear path and that the gameplay boils down to walking around with little to do/engage long enemy waves in certain areas/walk to and activate the next vortex to get a small bit of story/rinse and repeat. This gets dull after, say, 3 to 4 hours and when you realize the game takes between 12 to 15 hours your enthusiasm will take a pretty big hit.The combat can quickly get frustrating as you get swarmed by wave after wave of enemies: you can dodge a few times before entering a cooldown and there's a block mechanic that mnost people find too hard to use properly: this either leaves you frustrated as you die and get sent back to the previous checkpoint (having to bear the long walk AND having to face all the enemies that have respawned along the path) or dial down the difficulty and slowly fight enemies that are still too much of a bullet sponge.Last but not least Battlemage's most interesting feature, its deep spell creation, is mostly ruined by excessive complexity and horrible tutorials: you'll have to search for several guides before you'll be comfortable with the basics and even then quite a few elements will remain a mistery.For little more than 5$ when on sale the game sure isn't a trainwreck and can be decent for a while but due to the huge amount of shortcomings I honestly find it hard to recommend.

												So, a few months ago, I think Bundlestars snuck this in with the Apogee Retro Pack for like $5 and I couldn't resist. Overall, that pack had 40 games in it, including Halloween Harry and all the pre-DNF PC Duke Nukem Games. That was enough nostalgia to get me to bite, and so I wound up with this in my inventory.I'm trying to figure out a way not to be mean to this game. I really, really, am. But see, I played 40 minutes of this right now and something about it made me feel irritated enough to the point where I actually got a little physically ill.That, for me, is a very strange reaction to have towards anything, let alone a game. I think I can explain how this happened, though.In order for an FPS about being a hardcore awesome mage to work, you need a few things.1) Spells should have an obvious visceral impact.2) Controls should respond to the slightest movement.3) Menus and interfaces should be intuitive enough to ensure you're rarely out of the action.Lichdom: Battlemage, for me, achieved none of those things.Instead, what I got was a game that very badly wanted to be both an exciting nonstop action mage FPS, but also a reasonably complex RPG with deep crafting elements. Lichdom seems to have succeeded somewhat in being a Frankengame because it happens to end up with the worst elements of a shooter, and an RPG.The game gives up on explaining its own menus pretty quickly, leaving you to figure a good amount of the game out, and the controls feel somehow like you're always acting on some serious input delay.Part of me feels bad for not carrying on and giving the game a fairer shake, but I simply cannot enjoy a shooter in which launching a fireball takes a noticeable delay after I click, and has all the impact of a feather duster when it actually reaches its target. Enemies simply POOF out of existence with a little puff of smoke. Physics attached to enemy gibs could have really made all the difference here, but the system as-is feels somehow weak. For a supposedly tough-as-nails mage, I was left wondering why it felt as though my spells merely tickled my opposition until the game decided to replace them with a ""dead pile of bones"" texture on the ground.The more I type, the more I'm reminded of that feeling in the pit of my stomach. Lichdom has a lot of great ideas, and that makes it all the more upsetting. It looks nice, but it's static. It aims to revitalize Hexen, but it fails to feel fast or responsive. It tries to tell a mystical story, but its voice acting and writing is all over the place.These disappointments, and others like them, leave me with this uneffable sensation that enough is enough, and 40 minutes is all I can take. I simply can't get into this. Lichdom has the best of intentions, but intentions and ability to follow through are very, very different things.			"

												Xaviant hasn't been around for that long, but you might be impressed with its first attempt, Lichdom: Battlemage, described as a ""first-person caster,"" and living up to that title unambiguously. Crafting spells is at the heart of the game, with virtually everything you experience hinging largely on your ability to craft the right spell for any given circumstance. Lichdom has some troubles with its learning curve, and there's a good chance you'll spend a long while trying to clear the first boss of the game, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be lobbing fireballs, calling down lightning storms on your foes from a safe distance, and blinking your way out of danger when it comes your way.Even starting out, the spell crafting system is a tad on the complicated side - there are literally millions of potential spells you can create from the 156 base spell types - so you'll do well to read up online, or check out the in-game tutorial videos to sort out exactly what you're doing before you waste all your crafting materials. You'll have up to three active elements of eight total elements available in the game, and three types of spells active for each element at any given time; Targeted, AOE, and Nova. There are three ways to cast spells of a given element as well. Left-clicking will launch your equipped targeted spell, and holding left and right mouse buttons will charge up your AOE, with a visible circle on the ground for targeting, as well as animations to let you know when it's fully charged. Finally, right-clicking will block an attack, and timing a block perfectly will release your third spell type, the Nova, hitting all nearby enemies. Despite the difficulty of some bosses and game segments, the gameplay itself is spectacular. Combat is refreshingly fast-paced, without resorting to mechanics like one hit kills and the like. While blocking may be the preferred approach to not dying, I still find blinking around the area to be preferable to trying to time blocks, and the maneuverability this imparts on your character is profoundly game changing. Having used the charge blink for some time, switching back to the quick blink was like night and day for survivability.The entire combat system - spamming blink, charging auto-crits with your targeted spells, and laying down AOE effects for your enemies to wander into - is thrilling.Lichdom: Battlemage tells an incredibly linear story, but does it in a fairly novel way, with most of the cinematics being shown in-game, and triggered optionally by activating purple rifts in the world. They'll show you a little glimpse of something that's happened in the area, offering some background and context for the zones you're playing through. It's not an open world by any stretch, and most of your wandering will be minor branches off the path to collect a piece of loot or recharge your shield after a tough fight. Otherwise, you're just walking along the predetermined paths, killing all the bad guys you see along the way. With an remarkably robust spell crafting system and spectacularly entertaining combat, Lichdom: Battlemage finally brings the glory to the magic user that it has long deserved. Creating your own options for how to play lends depth and complexity to the game as a whole, and lets you tailor the experience to literally any style of combat you want. Lichdom crafts an intoxicating blend of frantic, skill-based combat and deep role-playing mechanics that makes it a solid choice for action fans.			"

												This is a hard game to review, one one side you see wasted potential and in the others what marvelous thing they accomplished. First off, they are right, never before has being a mage been taken to this extend as far i know. you craft your own spell from components, and each spells can be influenced in 9 different ways, some with varying results. Some spell can behave completely differently depending on their focus while others barely register a change. But this is because some spells are better suited for some things, Control fire is inherently less. interesting than say control frost, but destruction fire on the other hand.... The game feature a  large quantity of spell sigil, a decently long campaign with a new game +, challenging boss fights, i for one thought i was too strong for as moment, and the boss put me in my place. Being an immortal mage never been this fun and i hope to see a Lichdom 2 someday. Takes everything that's great with this game and improve on the rest and its GOTY material. as it stand the game is not too pricey and you will get a good bit of fun. The game strength is not its story, it is its mechanic. The graphics are pretty decent and it is one of the only game that force my computer to work for them, noticeably. If anyone need a comparison, this is the Serious Sam of magic games! It is one of the game i will/have taken the time to finish. Blast away!-Lost			"

												On my second playthrough of this game and I have to say it is unexpectedly beter than I thought it would be.If I had to try to classify it, I would say it is a mix of the old school magic FPS games like Hexen and Herectic with some Diablo loot collecting and some crafting thrown in for good measure.Requires a decent rig, but it is great fun once you understand the mechanics of the game.With 8 spell schools to choose from(each with 3 spell types) and three spell attunements to apply to each of those spells, there is a huge variety in what you can do.The game is also more tactical and less twitch than I initially thought it would be which is also a good thing IMO. In short, give it a try. Freeze, burn, shock, phase, corrupt, force and necro to your heart's content! Oh and craft new spells too...			"

												At first I thought the game will be fun, but after few levels I was hoping to face the end of my journey as battlemage. Same crowd of monsters\cultists over and over again, long levels, far checkpoints, dull and complicated spell craft system (I'm really glad that there is also smart inventory besides the original one), and the most disappointing (for me) - the plot is too predictable and boring. After hours and hours of collecting journals I stopped reading it at the very beginning and believe me I have no regrets about it.I struggled to finish the story, rage quitted a lot, and now, when I finished it, after 25 hours spend in game I have only hard feelings about it. May be I was expecting too much from it?			"

Early Access Review
								I was expecting something elseWhen I saw the description and the idea of being the ultimate mage badass, I did not think it would be so boring and un satifying.I know this is an early access game but I was expecting something similar to dark messiah might and magic. Instead it feels like I am walking from arena to arena fighting the same enemies using the same boring spells. I expected a huge aarray of fun and wacky spells to use. But all it is is an aoe attack, a projetile attack and a block. Is that really the best you can do? The magic in skyrim is more interesting. I saw kinesis and got excited, was hoping for something like the gravity gun in garrys mod or fus ro da from skyrim. What did I get? exactly the same as every other element it just has knockback or snare. really? is this what being an ultimate mage is like? Because its boring. I want to summon hell creatures reign down fire, and spew death and fear about the battlefield. Not just click lmb till the guy in front of my dies while constalty back pedalling. Very very dissapointing. atleast the game is prettyEDIT: Its no longer in early access and it still is a huge let down			"

												Played this game a good bit in beta (~14 hours) and here's what I have to say. Out of any game I've ever played this game had the absolute best first impression on me. The novelty of the combat system was so immersive that many of the glaring flaws of the game don't become obvious until the combat becomes routine. The crafting system was a stroke of genius, and I really can't praise it better. Getting past the awesome crafting and using magic, its a strictly linear (and uninteresting) story. It boils down to a series of hallways connecting larger rooms where you fight baddies in order to progress to the next hallway... While it is an excellent combat system I personally feel like you should hold off if you expect to be entertained indefinitely by games you buy. This game has infinite untapped potential, but to realize that I think that it would have to draw more elements from many of the games that it is trying to improve upon. They made the mage feel badass, I certainly agree, but a lot of what I enjoy from the games in the genre this tries to redefine comes down to the storytelling elements and the open ended nature of the worlds. Put this combat system in a setting like that and you will have one of the best games ever made.			"

												Some people say this game is overhelming and too hard. I have to agree and also disagree.The gameplay highly depends on what 3 powers you use, and the combinations of them.For me only 1 set of power really worked for me, making the game (too?) easy. 1-Fire (For main damage with missiles)2-Frost (Crowd control with ray)3-Necromancy (Helpful minions tanking foes)I was struggleling a lot while not using those power, and I felt that I did not have the choice to use them.So I had the same rotation over and over again, it gets repetitive.Also, I found the blocking ability very annoying and decided to not use it at all. Here are some of the main reasons:1-Blocking time is excessively short. You have to predict attacks and time it to block perfectly which can be very hard with the following reason.2-Ranger monsters can be hard to deal with, I felt that some projectiles are faster/slower/instant between some monsters.3-Melee monsters are unpredictable, some are charging on me then slowly attack me making me block too early.Blocking is a waste of time for me. When trying, I am focusing too much on a single monster, and ignore what is happening nearby. So I get hit by other monsters, can be deadly. Too often, I failed blocks, so all this in vain.Tip that worked for me: Dodge and use pillars to your advantage! Dodging is amazing!By the way: Pressing the <Shift> key actives run or walk. Holding it do not make you run! (Realized it after 10 mins lulz)I would recommend it, but it is buggy and incomplete.You can probably find better games.			"

												Lichdom:  Battlemage, a game with high aspirations, and for some a great game.  However, this game is anything but that for myself.  As you can see from hours played I have genuinely put some effort towards trying to enjoy this game, but have failed to do so.First, I would like to compliment the developers for actually creating a pretty stable, feature complete game.  In that regard, they have succeeded.Now, why don't I like this game.  The game for myself just amounts to a first person shooter... with fireballs, lightning, some status effects... etc..  There is little strategy involved.  You dart around, prep targets with mastery and keep them in place with control, and then finish them off with destruction.  There is very little else.  That and the controls can be a bit unresponsive when trying to quickly switch between spell types.  I have found myself many times thinking I switched spells after casting just to find myself casting the same thing twice.  Also, darting around is a bit much, and a longer teleporting type of spell, even if not used as often, would have been far more prefered.Did I feel like an all powerful mage by the end of the game, hmm not really.  You could have kept all the enemies at base level, and your power at base level, and you would have had the same game.  The leveling system for your spells, and shield are really not necessary when you really take a look at the game.The worst part is all the enemies are pretty much the same as you progress.  There are projectile enemies (the most difficult to deal with) and your melee types (super easy).  A few odd ones but that is pretty much it.  Oh and rapid fire crossbow men that knock you down if you get too close, they are so much fun.Needless to say this game is now in my trash category.  It was a good effort on the devs part, and I am sure this game is great fun for some gamers.  Perhaps it is my age, but I just can't recommend this game for more than 10 USD.  I just find it too boring.			"

Lichdom: Battlemage has some innovative and fun ideas, but unfortunately is held back by poor execution and a number of questionable design decisions.In its current state, I cannot in good conscience recommend the game without a few health warnings.  In my opinion, different types of gamer will find the title lacking for different reasons.1) Gamers who are looking for a pick-up-and-play action title with big explosions and fun spells will likely be frustrated by the poor tutorial experience and the clunky crafting system. If you expect that a full-price game released in 2014 will teach you its key mechanics and make sure you know at least the basics to be successful, you'll be disappointed. The tutorials do not explain absolutely key gameplay mechanics. The crafting system, which is the only way to improve your character (there are no levels, talent points or skill trees - you only get stronger by crafting better spells), is not explained in the tutorials at all. If you don't read the journal, the official guides and probably ask a few questions on the forums you may not understand important concepts (such as how to deal enough damage to stand a fair chance in boss fights) and you may get stuck because your spells are ineffective.2) Gamers who enjoy more complex systems, don't mind studying tooltips in detail and experimenting with the crafting system, won't be bothered by point 1). However, they may find other aspects of the game frustrating. Once you've understood how the crafting functions, the game isn't all that difficult and quickly becomes repetitive. The enemy variety is poor and the only real danger emanates from a couple of ranged mob types. IMO there are some serious balance and scaling issues, which become apparent from the middle of the campaign onwards.  Some spell combinations are very powerful (killing the final boss in a single combo is entirely possible), whereas others scale poorly and start to fall behind. Gamers who are looking for the replayability and long-term motivation of ARPGs like Path of Exile will also likely find the current NG+ mode disappointing. NG+ is a series of short missions using locales from the campaign (the campaign itself can't be replayed on higher difficutly - it becomes completely inaccessible). However, that's where the similarity with maps or Diablo III style GRifts ends: the difficulty tuning just isn't tight enough to provide a sense of progression (beat content to get better gear to get access to harder content to get better gear...). You get progressively better spells in NG+ but these spells just aren't really needed.Note the above is not a full review and doesn't describe the game in detail.  I am focusing on the question whether someone should buy this game in its current state. Hopefully, this is helpful for some. If you aren't put off by the issues described above (all IMO of course), then by all means get this game: there are some fresh ideas at work and I definitely hope the Devs can improve/build upon the current game.Below are a few links to reviews/other comments that I find insightful and that I generally agree with:https://boards.xaviant.com/t/few-thoughts/173http://steamcommunity.com/app/261760/discussions/4/34096318968616496/http://steamcommunity.com/app/261760/discussions/0/613936039539856174/ "

												Before I dig in here, I should probably mention that I got this game in a $5 bundle with some other stuff. So I paid less than a dollar for what normally retails at $40 as of writing. Obviously that allowed me to lower my expectations a ton.Though deeply flawed and repetitive to the point I almost wondered if the game was joking sometimes, Lichdom: Battlemage managed to do enough to make me enjoy it. It's hyped up and marketed as the next big thing in AAA fantasy gaming but when you get past the shiny CryEngine environments and flashy effects, it really does play like a budget title. It took me a little while to realize it, and it's still fun, but its production values are weirdly out of sync with its overall design and had I bought into hype and pre-ordered this one at full price I'd probably be writing a long-winded rant right now instead. But with the mediocre reviews and huge discount, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed myself. Funny how that works. It puts its best foot forward with its impressive visuals and professional-quality voice acting, with Troy Baker and Jennifer Hale as the fairly likeable interchangeable player or support characters. It looks poised to set up an interesting revenge story, but that falls apart pretty thoroughly The magic looks and feels good. It's easy to control. I wouldn't say they nailed the ""unshackled mage"" feel they were going for, but it's less bland than the treatment most games give magic, at least. At first, the crafting system seems impressively deep, and it's fun to tinker around with it to try out new ways of using each type of sigil until you settle on the playstyle you like. I played around with every different element, crafted hundreds of different spells, and never really settled into using the same strategy until fairly deep in the game.  It does a poor job explaining itself and new players will likely craft themselves into a corner if they don't know what they're doing. Plus, though the illusion of complexity is there, it really is pretty simple when you get down to it. It plays itself up with its elaborate stats and systems, but a lot of spells end up basically feeling the same, just a different colour. There are some exceptions, like the nifty corruption that grows big gross hives on your enemies rather than just directly damaging or debuffing them, but others are less creative. You can play around and do some cool things, but in the end the most effective strategy was just debuffing the enemy to take more damage then fireballing their face off. What could have been a drawn-out battle using corruption and necromancy or other more interesting elements became just zap, boom, dead, over and over. And the battles being over fast was a very good thing, I eventually found. The game is pretty long, and not because it's loaded with ideas. The levels are pretty, but they go on for ages, walking you from room to room, spawning the same enemies on you a hundred times, with no unique strategies ever required other than exploding them all yet again. With level design that's basically corridor, room battle, corridor, repeat, this game is just laughably repetitive. The same enemy types keep appearing all throughout the whole game, with the same annoying battlecries shouted at you each time, going down to the same spells, every time. A bit of exploring is possible with some hidden secrets and extra optional fights to get you more crafting loot, but the game doesn't have many ideas other than ""use spells to defeat enemies!""Though I had fun for the first few hours, the repetition really sets in after a while. Constantly tinkering with my spells and trying new things kept me entertained for a time, welcoming the same enemies so I could try a new strategy on them. But once I found a setup much more effective than others I tried, combat was a bore, and crafting was a pain. They were just things I had to do to get them out of the way, which is bad, because that's all the game actually has you doing. I'd groan when new enemies would spawn in, and eventually was tired of spellcrafting to the point I just kept using the same ones, using the (not very) smart inventory system to handle the upgrades for me. I guess this doesn't exactly sound like a recommendation so far, but it's still a game that's worth trying and a worthy purchase at the deep discount I got it for. I've seen it sell for 90% off during Steam sales, and it's worth those four bucks. You'll have fun and enjoy the scenery and fancy magic explosions even if you don't ever end up finishing it. Playing half the game or so was enjoyable, finishing the whole thing was a slog, but I was still at least moderately satisfied that I got all the way through it. If the concept sounds cool to you, then you'll definitely find things to like, but don't buy into its over-budgeted marketing hype and expect a genre-changer, because it most definitely is not that. So in short, it's a ""meh"". But it's a meh that tried, a meh with some good ideas, and even at its most frustrating or boring moments, didn't stop me from playing all the way through it. If you've been curious about this one, it has ""sale purchase"" written all over it. "

												I'd like for it to be very clear that this is a review coming from someone who only played it after it was released. It is not limited to only 3 types of spells - it's more like 8. you can only use 3 elements at once, but there's enough complexity to more intelligent builds that it is plenty. I've heard people complain about how it isn't as interesting a spell process as Skyrim. As someone who has played more than 150 hours of Skyrim, I can honestly say these people are wrong. Could it still use some things from that game? Perhaps so, but if I had to choose one over the other, I have found Lichdom's magic FAR more entertaining. Just don't do the standard DPS only spells, and you will see what I mean. Using spells to fill your enemies with insect larvae, then use mindcontrol to buy you the 10 seconds you need for the larva to mature before setting fire to the right mob... Well, that's just not something you can do in Skyrim, and it's a blast juggling it like so.Yes, it's quite linear - this is true. Only a few branch off options to do fights for ""loot"". They are worth it, are a blast, and are often a great challenge. Give this game enough time for you to get to the first boss fight and get at least 2 interesting spell types in your inventory. You will find trying to build the perfect spell build to be very enjoyable. I seriously hope this game gets a sequel!			"

												I realy want to love this game, I did at first. It has spell crafting, a variety of abilities and promises to let the mage be the focus of a game for once. What I got was a slow, disappointing and frustrating FPS where you are limited to 3 guns and 3 utilities with interchangeable colours where everything you do is delayed by having to either charge your attack for 2 seconds a shot or dodge hordes of brutal opponents who can corner you, stun lock you and kill you in very few hits.The Game totes the idea of being an all powerful battlemage but if anything it just reinforces the stereotype of the pasty faced mage hiding behind a barbarian's muscles. It took me a while to realise this but the spells just aren't fun. There are clearly correct combinations I'm meant to be using and if I stray from this path I find myself penalised, not only that but you lose your experience points and levels BY experimenting, forcing you to commit to your choices. An equivalent would be if call of duty reset your progress with rifles just because you played one game with a shotgun.In essence there are 3 targeted weapons, 3 AOE weapons and 1 perfect block. These are then either turned into either a non-damaging control spell (status effects or tactical control), an all damage destruction spell or a middle of the road, does some damage but not much mastery spell. you then augment this further by picking an element to give it colour. So what's the difference between a Destructive Fire Missile and a Destructive Kinetic Missile? The latter is purple and does half the damage, the same goes for all comparisons, they're identical safe for particle effects and damage numbers. But this just means that the only spells that harm are your destruction ones so you will always need them to actualy get the kill. You might think then you use a freeze control spell followed by a destruction spell. That works fine when you're fighting 1 enemy but is impractical when you're facing 5 at a time with ranged support. You will find yourself running round in circles charging your ranged attack because all the spells are bloody mega-man style charge up guns and hoping not to get sniped in the mean time.The enemies are tough, brutal and tanky, meaning that they will all need betwean 2 and 4 shots to kill, some also have disabling attacks such as freezes and knock downs which will leave you helpless on the floor or having to drop that spell you were charging to defend yourself, thus forcing you to start charging all over again.

												Lichdom: Batlemage brings a great concept on the table... But fails to deliver on many aspects.When I saw quotes like ""Never has magic felt as powerful"", I expected a lot from this game... But here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Amazing graphics. Excellent use of the CryEngine engine, locations feel real, many details, beautiful overall.- Magic feels very good, visually.- The whole ""magic"" part is based on a very good (and new) concept that has an amazing potential.- They tried really hard to make you care about the lore, the characters, the past events, but...Cons:- Linear levels with some ""goodies"" on the side.- Repetitive x1000.- I honestly couldn't care less about certain characters or events. While I understood the story, I didn't feel ""in it"" at all.The whole ""previous war/moonbreaker thing is nice, but, for example, when Gryphon died, I've felt just nothing ! Couldn't care less... I MEAN I'VE BEEN TRACKING HIM AND HEDIRA FOR HOURS IN THIS STUPID SWAMP !- The inventory and the crafting system.The problem is that, after a while in the game, you just keep doing this: >be at checkpoint>go forward onto the path that you cannot divert of>ennemies spawn of the ground around you>usually some running weak minions, some stronger various flying/walking/beasts/archers and eventually a lieutenant or mini boos>combo, kill, dodge your way out of the fight>go forward 50 meters>repeatSometimes you'll find yourself at key points in the story and you'll have to fight a boss... And that's kinda all.If the levels were to be shorter and the magic really more powerful, the whole ""repeat"" thing wouldn't be such a problem. But here, since even the slightest minion levels up as the game advances, it still takes the same freaking time to eradicate them, especially when you consider that at the start of the game you would have dealt 50 damage with a particular combo, and at the end 16'000 !So yeah, given the fantastic possibilities of this magic system, I would have loved a game that actually make me feel like a badass - mid-game and onward, you should have been able to oneshot whole enemies waves with well executed combos, instead of that, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.Sooo... Recommended, yeah, because I still had some fun playing it.. But only if you are into this type of games and only if it is on sale.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

												I got this game upon pre-alpha release and have had an absolute blast. It was a fantastic game then and even better now.  It's beautiful...great textures.   There is a lot of 'replayability' due to the fact that there are spells you must commit to in order to get them leveled enough to finish off the bosses.  You will want to play again putting your crafting abilities towards other spells in your replaying of the game.This is not open world and all loot comes from the deaths of some enemies in the form of a spell craftingThe development team is very active in the forums and care about your opinion.This is not an easy game.  The enemies behave like real people, not bots so you feel like your playing online enemies.(Prepare to learn from your mistakes and replay a few areas and bosses.)  Some ememies can morph behind you which is unnerving and sometimes irritating.Spell Crafting is key to this game.  The spell crafting has a large learning curve so watch tutorials and read the in-game journal.  Upgrade your shield through spell crafting.  That's overlooked by many.There have been time when I have immersed myself in this game all night but many nights it's just a nice, fun way to fill part of my gamimg evening.  I can't think of any other game like this.  As for the story, I don't care about stories in most games and can't review what I haven't paid attention to.  I just have fun being a mage that's not shackled down by mana bars so you can spam your spell button all you want.Bravo to the developers.  This team is one you want to follow.  Although I am sure much more energy will be put into this game, any games after this will grand; And with some investers I can imagine an amazing multiplay game or even a series to compete with Elder Scroll, Dark Souls, etc. but do not expect that in this game.

												The description says you are a powerful mage but I found that you arn't really powerful, taking many hits to kill a basic enemy. Also the game is very boring, I found myself losing interest after a few hours. The interface is not that great and it is very tedious to setup new combinations in your spells. All in all I didn't think the game was that great, there are better games out for sure.			"

												Don't go into this game expecting skyrim or like myself you will be sorely disappointed. It is not openworld in anyway nor does it have strong RPG elements in interaction with NPCs and the like, you simply don't get to do that. The graphics while OK are not spectacular and the magic system while fun and reasonably innovative doesn't ever give me the feeling of spectacular power, honestly some of the shouts from skyrim are vastly more impressive.Otherwise, taken for what it is the game is reasonably fun and probably worth a playthrough if you don't mind what amounts to just a FPS with spells.

												In the first level I told myself: ""why this game has so many bad reviews on steam? it's awesome! with so many spells you can craft and the beautiful graphics"" but then I reached the snow level and by then I realized that Lichdom: Battlemage gives you tons of different spells that are all the same, they are recolors of other spells and the only other difference is that they apply specific debuff without much weight on the game, in the end you just gotta spam left click or charge it until everything dies, you don't really need more than 1 spell for anything but bosses.I got it for 1 dollar on bundlestars so I don't have much remorse but boy I do pity whoever bought it at full price.

Early Access Review
								I found this early access extremely promising. Gameplay reminds me of playing a mage in Skyrim or Dark Messiah of might and magic.It is really playable for an early access game, cant wait for them to flesh out the story, seems pretty interesting aswell.Basically you have 3 different spell types in your disposal, and 3 different attacks for each (I think :D) Single elemental attack, charged aoe attack and a charge spell. And you can customize those spells with different attributes, i.e shorter cast and longer duration of effect and such.Gameplay seems smooth enough, crafting spells seems really interesting aswell.Heres some gameplay i recorded. (sorry about the short freeze in the beginning)

												I think most of the negative reviews say the same: that Lichdom is boring and repetetive and I don't agree with that. Lichdom is underrated.Overall score for me: 8,5/10StoryThe story is not that stunning but it's good enough to be interesting and fill the game with life. Some breakpoints keep the tension. Nothing more to say. The game focuses on the fights.Graphics and Level DesignThe game, powered by Cryengine 3, really know how to wow you. The levels are very beautiful and crafted with a lot of focus on the details. Secrets are placed very good and you really have to search for some of them. Also, the different level themes (like harbour city, ice world or swamp) implement the corresponding atmosphere very well by using different weather schemes, color saturation and so on.Yes, the levels are in fact linear but I really doubt that an open world would have improved the game at all. This is not Skyrim.Gameplay, Spells and FightingI must say that I was really impressed by the whole fighting and spell thing. It's starting on a low level with weak fire and ice spells and you unlock many more different spells while doing progress in the story. I really like two of the spells: necromancer and delirium. While Necromancer will summon demons from fallen enemies that will help you, delirium will make enemies fight for you. I'm doing very well together with powerful fire spells.Later in the game you can also combine two spells into Synergies, that must be charged but can for example cast large Hulk-like monsters fighting for you or a black hole as seen in the trailer. These spells are unique and may help you get around some boss fights where 'normal' spells are not enough.Some reviews also state that all fights are the same and I don't really understand the point. Because the fights are not the same at all. Different enemies force you to change your tactics; you cant fight against three heavy tanks in the same way you fight against a large horde of weaker enemies. There are also very different types of enemies, from melee to ranged combat to enemies that are able to teleport themselves or also use ice spells against you.The game is not easy but also not hard like Dark Souls. If you die all the time you simply use the wrong spells / tactics against the enemies.ConclusionIf you are interested in magic fights, crafting and beatiful graphics you should really look into the game. I really recommend it!			"

Product received for free
Teal DeerDevelopers: XaviantPublishers: Xaviant, Maximum Games Initial release: Aug 2014Genre: Action, Magic-System#Worth/NotWorth: #NotForEveryoneExposition, Concurrence and SummationJennifer Hale and Troy Baker are Dragons confirmed.Lichdom: BattleMage is not a shooter, it is not a RPG; It is for most intents and purposes a pure action game with a semi convoluted magic system. The game is quite contingent on the player grasping or at least having a basic understanding of the magic system to do well. Think Bioshock with a Plasmids/Vigors only mod with a lot less character. The player can have 3 sigils at once and these can be changed at any point at a checkpoint. You can craft modifiers and apply them to each sigil. From what I saw, these effect the targeted, AOE and Nova effects of each. It seems incredibly daunting and overwhelming at first, or it can. The main effects of the loot drops are the duration and type of attack. Either a Lob, Ray or Missile style attack for each. Think Borderlands but with more pieces and crafting. Loot drops are happening constantly and if you are trying to optimize everything all the time you'll drive yourself crazy. I suggest you experiment up front to find some mixture of sigils and type of attacks that you enjoy and then switch the magic charts over to the Smart inventory that will warn you of any improvements the random drops you've picked up might be able to aid you while staying in line with the same style of attack. As an example of this, I found a happy mixture of Corruption, Ice and Necromancy sigils. I was able to freeze people and have that cause “stored” damage while sticking pustules that behaved something reminiscent of the Needler from Halo while infecting them with zombie juice so as to when they did die they came back as minions that fought for me. I believe the default difficulty is a little steep especially for learning how the systems work. 3 of 4, to bring the Halo comparison further, the Heroic difficulty. Only, there aren't guns or any thing that you are innately familiar with on a systems level. Obviously fireball grenades are not unique and rather ubiquitous in videogames but on a systems level between the shield and pipeline heath and the way the attacks can stack or to get the most out of them the default difficulty is not ideal for learning. The game has a lot of flaws and the overall mixed reviews are well warranted. This game sort of exists in what is becoming a dying breed of games. The indie developed -- faux --  triple A game. The sort of “Dark Sector” of the industry. The narrative of the game is okay, it's not great. You can choose your “Dragon” and the characters story is slightly changed based on who you pick. Voiced by Troy Baker and Jennifer Hale, regardless of who you pick, you'll hear plenty of them both. The pacing is also fine over all though I think the game is a little long. There is an NG+ as well. The level design is fairly linear but you can go off the beaten path for some challenge room side content. THE GISTNice feeling action game IF you care to take the time to learn and experiment with the sigils. It can feel unbalanced at times and can be quite overwhelming. I don't outright recommend the game. It has nice ideas and I think it's worth giving it a try at a discounted price.Technically, a BattleMage needs to also wield a sword or axe, not just magic. Maybe I'm just crazyFollow my curation for more "

												6/10The Good:This game is visually stunning. The graphics are great, and there is good use of architecture, and differvent visual styles and environments. The combat system is really nice and solid, any FPS player can just right in and pick it up. The spell crafting system is absolutely insanely good. You can craft different spells of different varieties, allowing you to mold your own fight experiences. The design of this game is quite good overall.The Bad:The levels are just tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long. The story was rather quite sparse. You are constantly chasing one person, then find out he has a boss... you chase that guy, find out about 2 more people you need to chase through really long confusing areas(especially the swamps) that I found myself sprinting through areas, and skipping lots of enemies just so I could say I finished the game. There are a nice array of enemies that have different skills, but overall there are just too few enemy models. You fight the same 15 different enemies in random arrays through 20 hours of gameplay. This game should have been wrapped up in 10 hours tops. There really are no intruging events or things to do as you run the game. There are a few boss fights in an arena, and other secret arena fights that you can do where you are trapped with a bunch of enemies, but that's about it.The Graphics good, combat good, spell crafting good.Level design bad, story bad, few enemies.6/10Would reccomend if you just want to blow stuff up from time to time and aren't looking for a real story or to be entertained other than the blowing enemies up value.

												With very pretty graphics, strong voice acting and a compelling concept, I had high hopes for Lichdom: Battlemage. Finally, a game that seemed to fulfil one of the most engaging power fantasies I could think of: Being a nigh-omnipotent mage! Blowing up fools with the snap of a finger! Casually sauntering towards an enemy, all of their feeble attacks blocked by a ward! Then blowing them up! With the snap of a finger!Unfortunately, Lichdom: Battlemage ended up being one of the biggest gaming disappointments I have had in a very long time. This is an extremely linear corridor shooter with a needlessly convoluted crafting system, stupendously durable enemies and a terrible story involving cartoonishly one-dimensional villains. Game developers, can you please - PLEASE - stop making enemies bullet sponges? I am so incredibly sick and tired of facing common mooks that require seven crits to the face before they die. If my character really is, and I quote the official description, ""a total badass with limitless magical potential at their disposal"", then why am I struggling to take down even the lowliest of minions? On the easiest difficulty level? Come -on-, this is just a cheap way of artificially increasing the difficulty that is not even remotely fun, and it easily shattered what little immersion I had.Indeed, the game is not particularly immersive at all. The story is just so... Ugh. Enemies unironically utter lines like ""This creature is no friend to the darkness! Spill its blood!"". Human enemies, mind you, not hand-wringing goblins. It is hard to care about the clichéd tale of revenge that the game tells you because the villains are written as hamfistedly as can be. They are basically mustachio-twirling, cackling baddies who would gleefully kill newborn puppies ""for the evulz"", and it's played completely straight. It is just terrible. The writer(s) should be ashamed of themselves for creating such terrible antagonists.Whilst I would normally try to describe all aspects of a game in reasonable detail, I simply cannot be bothered this time. The combat drags on, there isn't nearly enough variety in the spells you can make and the same models keep being recycled for the enemies. I frankly don't recommend this game. How on Earth the developers managed to make this game - a game about a mage unshackled from cooldowns and mana pools - boring and unenjoyable, is just beyond me. It is a terrible shame.			"

												I have 44 hours on this game and I can say that it has to be one of the most repetitive and unsatisfying games I have played in a long time... The constant spamming and blocking really make for a dull ride, even if it looks nice. following a linear path just to constantly have enemies pop out of the ground makes it even worse. The story is the not so original revenge story. The spell system would have been nice if they actually made the spells more fun to use, without that it's pretty pointless. I understand that people worked really hard on making this game and I respect that, but you dont see me pooping in golden pouches and selling them saying ""this will make you feel like a badass"". this game in my honest opinion is nothing but a polished turd.Good idea, horrible execution.

												I REALLY wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. It seems like it would be super fun, but after a handful of hours, I was purely bored and frustrated with the game. I'll investiage some of the changes made in the new patch, but I'm not expecting much.It was pretty because they obviously spent a lot of time on the visual aspect of the spells and what they could do, but that was the main redeeming factor. Gameplay was clunky and basically devolved into walk backwards while throwing X spell with Y particle effects until enemy is dead. However, you cna completely ruin your ability to play by crafting spells that don't do damage if you're not paying attention like I was at one point.Sound and voice acting were fine; I'd say at least on par with most games.I'd say pick it up if you can get it for ~10$, but that is about all it's worth. The story isn't interesting and the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired.			"

												Amazing, challenging game! I'm really hooked. Can't wait to play more. Intuitive gameplay! Don't expect a novel of a story, because you won't get one - it's very mundane to be honest! But I for one do not care, since the gameplay pulls it out just great. I enjoy the magic-system, the complex crafting and all in all the graphical effects are quite impressive. I was very sceptical due to the huge amount of negative feedback they've got on their steampage, but after watching TotalBiscuit, I decided to give it a go, since his taste often applies to mine (The new Thief is a very good example aswell.)Thank you TotalBIscuit for providing an interesting review on this amazing game!

												This game is really fun until you realize that you are bascially using the same spell effects over and over and over.  This game had a really nice concept, but fell short of what it could have been.  At full price I would pass, but if it ever goes on sale think about picking it up.  Its not bad, but its not great. Its just average.			"

												Great concept  ....poor implementation. The spells feel underpowered, the maps uninspired, the enemies bland and samey. The spell crafting system, which is basically the cornerstone of the game, becomes tedious very quickly and is not at all induitive or fun. I really can't recommend this game unless it's selling super cheap and you're bored, or you just really like obsessively micromanaging a pile of crafting components and putting in a silly amount of time into what amounts to a 1 or 2 percent firepower upgrade.

												I loved the graphics and the game concept. However, the ""smart upgrade"" system doesn't do a good enough job of creating spells that are viable against the bosses you run into. I ran through the game at least 8 times in order to build up enough spell power to take on the second boss and still failed. The key to progressing through this game is to master the rather complicated spell creation process, which, for me, detracts from game play. Consequently, I gave up in frustration at the extremely high level of hit points you must damage in order to get past the super-tough bosses. Many games balance the game play styles by allowing multiple levels of difficulty. This one doesn't. Ideally, a player should at least be able to downgrade the difficulty level to get past a particularly challenging point so that they can at least get some of the value they paid for with their hard-earned money. Some game developers just don't get this.If you're an avid/hard core gamer and you like this kind of fantasy RPG, then you'll love it. If you're a casual gamer or one that doesn't like to get mired in micro-management then stay away from this one.			"

												The graphics are beautiful, similar to Skyrim. Don't buy this for the storyline, the storyline is confusing and relatively cheesy. Make sure to get it on sale, too. I feel they delivered on the ""invincible badass battlemage"" but you may have to adjust the difficulty and craft some good spells before you feel truly powerful. The crafting system is ok, there are a lot of spells, but most of them are very similar.  Lichdom is not very RPG-like and I don't think it should be considered one. Lichdom is one of those games that I'd rather listen to music and shoot some fireballs at a walking corpse then try to follow the story line. 7/10 recommended but gets old after a while			"

												I really like the -idea- of this game.  I really hate this game.tl;dr an amazing concept and good production value is ruined by awful writing, a lack of direction, bad combat balancing, and terrible repetition.  An essay follows.On the plus, it looks pretty enough, with some relatively detailed environments and models.  The voice acting is mostly really good (thanks Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker and more).  The whole feel of throwing magic is fantastic, combined with all the animations, the ""realistic"" arm movements, the variety of spell effects conjuring in your hands, and most of the sound design, as well as the impact it has when enemies are smacked by it.  The idea of controlling magic so intimately is an extremely fascinating concept to me; having a direct control over the complex freezing rays, gravity bombs, and temporal blasts from a first person perspective sounds amazing.  And it is!...For maybe 2 hours tops.  The story is a bit of a boring mess, and for a narrative so hell-bent on driving home strong feelings of hatred, revenge, and power, I've never felt so underwhelmed by what was supposed to be climactic fights.  They dragged certain emotions and events on FAR too long with no development within them.  The spell crafting system is awful.  The UI is bad, it's primarily driven by randomly generated drops which also serve to fuel as your progression of power, it's incredibly confusing and even once you figure it out you realize how downright stupid it is, and a large amount of the spells you can make are just useless!  Not just because they're bad or low strength, even though many of them are, but because of the terrible enemy design.There are melee enemies, arrow shooting enemies, spellcasters, and flying enemies, along with rarer demons and minibosses.  All of the enemies have a high health pool and low damage, and to save some time, I won't list how they react to every situation.  What I will say, however, is that every melee enemy reacts the same, as does every archer, and every mage, and every rare flying enemy.  Suddenly, with everything having a high health pool and enemies extremely rarely grouping close together in groups more than 2, your AoE spells and Lightning as a whole are looking very lackluster.  I was sad because I just wanted to shoot lightning bolts, but it was so monotonous to do chaining-damage that did less to a single target that I stopped.  My slot for an Area spell was never actually used to hit an area because it was NEVER relevant.  I only used it in conjunction with a hard crowd control combination because them standing in my pool of Fire did more damage, faster, than actually throwing bolts of fire at them.Aside from health pools going down, the progression in the actual pretty-looking areas are rather putrid.  In the latter half of the game (and maybe more, I took a hiatus between the first and last half), it was some RPG nonsense, except I wasn't earning anything.  Like clockwork, every 10 seconds of walking forward post-fight, new enemies would emerge from the woodwork in the huge, expansive, otherwise-empty levels.  It never changed in difficulty.  Nothing new ever happened.  There were no surprises.  It wasn't relevant to the story.  The ""levels"" you achieved in your spellcasting are menial.  It was just empty busywork that repeated itself, almost as if they thought repetitive combat was a good thing.  The areas were irrelevant except to give the artists a new palette to work with.  With my frustration set in and my faith in the game gone, I equipped a newly acquired and overpowered Ice bolt spell, summoned skeletons with Necromancy, and spat all over the intended combat systems by just running in circles and spamming left click to kill enemies in 4 - 10 seconds each.  For around 4 hours.  Nothing changed, nothing was introduced.  It was just an exercise in repetition.  Don't even get me started on the unwarranted difficulty spikes.I'm starting and stopping on multiple points to just give the real sense that no one thing is wrong.  Everything concerning the combat system, everything concerning the story, the crafting system, the bosses, the flow of the game, is all so interwoven on so many bad levels it's hard to start and stop at one specific idea.  I stuck through it just to say I completed the game, and to really find out if it ever got better.  It didn't.  Upon completion of the game, I felt such a strong sense of disappointment and disbelief that I hadn't in a very long time, if ever.  The ending is absolute trash.  Indirect spoiler ahead:   the game literally announces all of the loose ends it did not tie up in the narrative, provides no closure, and ends on ""yeah, the protagonist is a badass"". The idea, the novelty, is legendary in my eyes.  The execution was just disgusting.			"

												Have you ever had that dream where you desperately want to run, but all you can do is stand and watch as you are being mauled to death before waking up all sweaty? Well, your prayers have been answered. Now you can experience such helplessness whilst playing this game. And here’s why. Default movement speed is of a 98-year-old amputee senior. Running is slow, casting is slow, and spells are useless unless you charge them, which makes the gameplay even slower. When moving and casting at a snail’s pace you get interrupted, slowed down and even paralyzed. Most of the time, you will feel like a mortally injured peasant who is running through a swamp, trying to escape a pack of wolves, rather than a powerful mage. And I am not even kidding. Practical example: Die for the fifth time – respawn along with the 40 enemies you just killed in the last half an hour – forget to re-toggle run - approach enemies like a snail - get frozen – lose one and half of your three lives - charge a spell - get knocked down – get up - charge a spell - interrupt yourself by avoiding a flurry of five projectiles, coming at you from a single enemy – get hit anyway - miss your hit because of the frame rate issues - charge a spell - shoot - enemy dodges it - get frozen – loose some more of your life - charge a spell - shoot - hit enemy's shield, doing zero damage - charge a spell - shoot – hit - congrats, you just cast a necessary debuff - charge a spell - get slowed down - wonder if your spell has charged or not, since you cannot hear the ""charge ready"" sound during the slow-mo - fire an underpowered spell - hit for 700 damage, as opposed to 13,000 when you charge it – charge a spell – shoot – hit a rock – get hit with a slowdown spell from an enemy who is so far away he takes up one whole pixel on your 4K monitor – charge a spell – shoot – watch as the spell automatically redirects to a different enemy you did not want to hit – deal 53 damage, since he hasn’t been hit with a debuff – regret your life choices - try to avoid vast poisonous clouds that have been spammed all around you – try to be a clever mage by casting a shield spell – find out that it is absolutely useless - walk backwards to find a cover – get damaged by two hitscan enemies who just appeared behind your back – escape some more - hit an invisible wall on perfectly climbable stairs – get slowed down because of that – watch as the tentacle monster teleports across the whole screen killing you with one hit. What else to say… it is a fast paced action for everybody but the player. At the 8 hour mark I wished it would end. 18 hours in I defeated the final boss (after experiencing few bugs like monster invincibility, magical health replenishment, and broken effects of spells that I have been levelling up the whole game). Luckily I managed to beat the boss with sheer luck, since you cannot block nor counter most of the attacks. All of this ordeal because of my completionist complex. Until it’s redesigned, never again.  "

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a decent, but monotonous game.As I started playing my first reaction was: ""Why I can't jump!?"". It turns out - this game has no jumping mechanics. You can shoot fireballs, lightnings and other stuff, but you can't jump - it's to difficult for them mages.. I guess.This game is very linear. Sometimes it has open spaces, but there is only one way to the main objective all the time. You can press a button to see the line where to go (that's always the wrong way if you want to explore the area and find its secrets ^^, but that's why I liked it, because you always know the right path + you will never miss something valuable if you go the other way).The story is ... baaa... oook... decent enough. Nothing spectacular. The problem is how it is told. It's always in the same way - through some holograms from the (recent) past. Some dialogues/monologues are just dull and without any value. Everything feels so stretched out that in the end it just becomes really boring.The graphics of this game is really good. Lighting, spell effects, enemy animations - everything is really well done (this actually saves the game from being bad). Visually pleasant, but overall just ... empty game.You can use 3 out of 8 different sigils (spell types) (can switch between them at checkpoints). Usually you can combo them for more efficient and faster killing. There is no loot in this game. You automatically collect all the ""items"" ... a.k.a. augmentations from the enemies you kill. You can use those to upgrade or craft new and better spells. It can be a bit hard to understand how all this works, but this game has some automated crafting system, so you don't need to waste much time here if you don't want to.The gameplay itself is very straightforward. All you have to do is kite all the time and juggle through 3 different buttons. In other words - shoot, run, shoot, run, shoot, run (and sometimes die because of stupid bugs (knockback + damaging aura combos from the enemies doesn't help either)).This game has really stupid bugs, You can make the enemies teleport from one area to another (randomly) by using one of the spells, but sometimes it happens that they teleport outside of restricted area and you can't kill them anymore and then you can't progress any further. Then you have to go back to the main menu and restart the area and waste another 5-7 minutes doing the same thing you just did.Or you can fall off the stairs and get stuck between the wall and the stairs. Remember, that you can't jump in this game. Yeah. Time to reload once again...I really liked those little hidden challenge areas. They each provide massive rewards but first you must fight through several waves of enemies and only then you will be able to collect all the loot. Most of them I managed to do in one go, but some are really challenging and you can die once or twice.Oh, and this game has swamps too. Why so many games have swamps? I hate swamps. They should be deleted from the games forever. uhhh. But hey, it's linear so it's not THAT bad.I only recommend this game if you are prepared to do the same thing over and over again for 20 hours and if you get this game on a big sale, otherwise - it's just a waste of your time and money.

												Lichdom: Battlemage brings to the table exactly what it promises: an unshackled mage.You are limited and doomed only by your own inability to use the surroundings, kiting path, specialization of spell combinations and staying mobile.You can have active 3 schools of magic and in this build that I tried, the choices are:•	Ice - Perfect for control and for lining up the big guns  o	Increased duration of chill  o	Damage reduction while casting  o	Slowing/Freezing enemies  o	Increasing critical damage of subsequent spells•	Fire – De-Buff and Destroy  o	Damage over time in an AOE area or as single point spell  o	Stagger your foes  o	BBQ what is frozen for nice explosion•	Kinetic – Just started with it  o	Does low damage in itself but on a frozen target, it hits like a truck•	Parasite – Just started with it  o	Gives a De-Buff of flash eating parasites to one or more foes•	Control – Just started with it  o	Mind control of enemies, self-explanatory•	Lightning – Just started with it  o	Forks out, electrocutes bunched up groupsYou are given 3 spells per school and a barrier that you can customize:•	Barrier  o	Protects you  o	When activated while being attacked, you can trigger a Nova of the currently active school of magic•	Nova  o	When triggered (timing during getting hit) unleashes even ranged damage to the attacker (thorns effect)  o	Can freeze foes around you/burn them/maybe toss them away?•	Target Spell  o	Single target spells with various effects and shapes•	AOE  o	AOE can deal damage or de-buff everything that is caught in it.The only loot in the game are spell components that you can mix up or split up again. There is a rarity in spells (white, green, blue …).You can combine it as you want.I love foes getting entangled in corners while being hammered.The game style might feel a bit repetitive: dodge, freeze, hit, run – repeat but its fun.The story line good and involving, I would love more content besides the N+ as I really liked it for the 50+h I played it.I definitely suggest getting it, it’s well worthy the 15 Euro!

												Note: It says I've only played 13 minutes of this game but I've played between 1 - 2  hours in offline mode.I was very excited about this game because it seemed like a game I'd love to play. I love Fallout, Skyrim, and all thoose first person games, and Litchdom seemed to have a simmilar feel. I was even more excited with crafting your own spells and such but when I finnaly played it... I was very disapointed. Was it fun? YesWas it as fun as I expected? NoIt lacks story you see, I couldn't tell what was going on all the game truely told me was that I was a man and my wife was killed and now I have super powers and I need to kill things and there are these other charters who will repeat the same dialouge in fights until you finnaly just mute the damn game. And finnaly there's not much wiggle room, it's very linear and straight forward.If you were like me and expecting something like Skyrim or Fallout just with spells as weapons think twice before buying it.If you enjoy games that are quite linear and have a variety of spells and crafting then I suggest buying this.

												Buy this game on sale and regret nothing.Spellcrafting is really fascinating.Just treat it like a singleplayer for 1 walkthrough and you won't be dissapointed.It reminded me of Painkiller series, but focused on exploring and experimenting how your weapon works rather then just shoot everything with anything.Also, game's difficulty mostly defined by your spellkit. You can faceroll or suffer, so it's your choice and challenge after all.I've read a couple of ""No"" reviews and didn't get why these people were so dissapointed, it's a quite solid and complete game. Though I agree it just don't worth more than 50% of it's tag price.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a bit of a mixed bag. The storyline is simple and forgettable which is in stark contrast to the actual gameplay.The devs delivered on what they set out to do, this is the first game that makes you feel like an actual mage.That being said the pros -  Fantastic gameplay, wide assortiment of spells, create your own spells!                            Graphic quality is superb (indie dev), no bugs, very stable ( 80 fps here),                            has the right level of challenge.The negative aspects would be - Story is weak, your standard good guy out to stop the big bad with very little intricacy or development in the plot. I could imagine this being a 80's action flick, like The Beastmaster or something.The level design is also a weak spot as the levels are very large and seem to drag on and on at times. They could have made them considerably smaller and it would have been far better albeit shaving a few hours off the final product. Bigger isn't always better.So the question is, should you buy it? For me its a resounding yes based purely on the gameplay alone. I wouldn't pay the full asking price however, best to wait on a sale which happens on a regular basis.			"

												For the price it is most definately worth it.  I believe that the negative reviews are a result of the complicated mechanics being misunderstood by the majority of casual players.  All of the sigils offer a unique way of playing if they are applied correctly.Combat is difficult but rewarding.  Much of the difficulty can be tempered by making good use of the mastery mechanic and unique spells.The graphics and effects are pretty and some of the kill aanimations are over the top which make you feel a little more powerful than you actually are.On the flip side, the story is poop and there are a limited number of enemy types.  Some enemy variety would be nice to make the long levels more interesting.A few beers, a few hours invested.  Win.			"

								Despite being in Alpha, this game is AMAZING.  I have always been a fan of mages in general, so the idea of ""unshackling"" the mage and being a godly being of death and destruction without needing swords or bows is just wonderful.  Better, I think they actually managed to pull it off!Pro -  Fantastic First Person Casting.  Spellcrafting is the best, most awesome idea in the world!  The voice acting isn't terrible!  (The conversations between the Female Dragon and Male Gryphon have made me chuckle a bit).  The boss fights are actually REALLY hard!  (But really cool.  Shax's summoned demon took me FOREVER to beat!  Hint hint:  You want to use galvanize.  it works REALLY well.)Con -  It's still in alpha, and there are a couple of random bugs here and there.  Strangely, it's a really really smooth game for being in alpha.			"

												Just not very good.It seems like it is half finished game.  Good concept, but half way through someone decided, ""hey let's just ship it anyway.""Fighting is pretty tedious. The only way to improve is through crafting new spells, which sounds like a good idea but the crafting system is convoluted.  First boss fight insane.  You can just see them standing there.   No option for strategy though as everything is just waiting for you to run into middle of areana to begin sequence.  Demon & guy are both chasing you (besides pile of minions) are both one hit kills.  Super tedious... strafing around pillar trying to slowly pick off these guys while avoiding one hit kill.  It's like they worked on the engine, worked on the story line, but they did no testing of game play before shipping. "

A text review is provided below.Lichdom Battlemage is essentially a linear hallway-based first person shooter, but instead of shooting guns you’re shooting magical spells. That’s sort of an odd concept. What’s even odder is how all of the advertisements tried making the game look more like some sort of open brawler instead of the narrow linear experience it is.The gameplay is alright. For a while. It’s extremely slow-paced for a first person shooter, but the placement and selection of your spells and constant action of it all keeps it very intense and engaging. It’s single player so unfortunately you can’t bring anyone along to fight by your side, and honestly that is exactly what this game needed. The game likes to spam you with the exact same enemies over and over and over as you drudgerously pace through spell upgrades in a surprisingly in-depth customization system that I didn’t even try to wrap my head around and instead just let it upgrade things for me, which I realized is actually a pretty bad idea because it takes any tiny upgrade it can get, even if it sacrifices a boatload of effect damage for 2 more base dps.The graphics of this game are pretty damn good looking if a little hard to immerse yourself into with your floating hands which shadows reveal to literally be held up in front of you like an idiot at all times. The sound effects and music are nothing memorable. They get the job done.The story is...well, it’s a story. Basically you pick a lusty-for-vengeance male protagonist or a ♥♥♥♥♥y ♥♥♥♥ everyone female protagonist and whichever you don’t pick becomes a useless scout that gives you information so useless that even the game makes fun of them. The story is boring and so rare that there’s no motivation to really grind through the slow paced boring levels. Ultimate bad guy corrupting the lands? Yeah ok, I’ll find the same thing in a different game but with better mechanics, easily.Overall this game is not worth your time. I give it a 4/10. It has some solid mechanics.It’s almost an average game, but average games are fun. Lichdom Battlemage is not a fun game if you’ve ever played any good shooter or RPG before, as this game tries to be both, but manages to be neither.			"

												  Well, after playing several hours of this game, I think I am now qualified to make a little review about it. I'll make a little pros and cons list to start this off, then add my more detailed opinion afterwards.Pros:- The controls are fairly solid and responsive (if you have a computer that doesn't lag too much).- The magical effects are amazing, so much so that I just want to launch fireballs in all directions just to watch them explode.- The graphics are superb; the game in itself is a form of eye-candy and makes gameplay all the sweeter.- The art style (which mostly shows in the cinematics) is brilliant and fits the style of the game quite well.Cons:- I found that the game was riddled with glitches, such as my companion character constantly phasing through walls, getting caught on things, and, at one point, going in mid-jump to teleport only to freeze in the air for a while. However, this could just simply be due to my computer and I have not been able to compare this with other's experiences.- There is very little explanation in the game at all for most things, especially the magic crafting system. I found it to be bizarre and confusing and mostly just wanted to give up on making any spells.- The game is very linear; while this is not a bad thing in and of itself, it becomes very boredom-inducing when it is coupled with a rather uninteresting story. Half the time, I couldn't even follow the story and was more concerned about figuring out which of the linear paths I was supposed to take to get to the next checkpoint. Which brings me to my next con.- The checkpoints are placed in odd portions of the game, areas that are too far apart from one another or just bizarre. I found that this irritated me many a time when I died just before the next checkpoint and was sent ALL the way back to the last, which was what felt like half a continent away.- The gameplay, although fun and engaging at first, quickly becomes mundane due to a lack of diverse enemies and a strange tendency to throw in enemies which seem far too powerful for the level.  In short, I would recommend this game only when the prices is reasonably low. I somewhat regret buying it for however much it was ($40 or so I think) way back when. It's not too bad a game and has some really cool and interesting gameplay mechanics, but lacks in an engaging plot and consistently-entertaining gameplay. But, overall, it's not a must-play by any means.			"

												This game is just too repetitive. The enemies are pretty much identical, and as a result it just gets a little bit tiresome fighting the same people over and over.			"

								Written on first day of early access. Good potential to become a great game but as of right now save the money it has no story no voice over no cutscenes missing sound effects messy animations just to mention a few problems its playable tho not any game breaking bugs but the feeling is just not there i played for 3 hours and all i did was kill monsters after monsters witouth even knowing why. and so far it is VERY linear no open world at all which is holding it back a little in my oppinion but its not at all a bad game just wait a little so they can polish it up andmake it a little less repetative as during my 3 hours all i needed to use was my firebolt didnt need anything else. and so far it is Very limited in all aspects including the spell crafting which i hope will change would be cool if you would be able to mix different magic sources but we will see when its done.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game has a lot of potential. Really cool idea, great graphics and satisfying combat but it's full of bugs, unbalanced and has a really confusing crafting system. If you don't understand this system you're gonna have a bad time. Not sure if it's worth playing just yet, but when they finally finish it I'm sure it's going to be something very special. Seems like it will be a mix of Dark Messiah and other FPS games like Hexen.Full video review:

								So far, any gripes I have with the game are more than understandable for an alpha (hell, the pre-alpha was more polished than most betas i've engaged on, save ones with pre-established gameplay, etc; read WoW/similar games):-get 'stuck' on environment objects every once in a while-graphical glitches (minimal which is a bit surprising running an SLI setup, game is in alpha, etc etc)-needs some gfx polishing, fps can be a bit choppy on what is a rather high end rig (which again, more than understandable in an alpha)-crafting system still has some key flaws, or missing features-the plot/dialogues/voice overs/animations all need some polish/syncing/fleshing outOkay, enough of the entirely expected issues with an alpha, on to the pros:-unless you 'screw up' creating a number of spells (which used to be more or less impossible, but with the revamp of the spells and crafting system, definitely is a possibility now, and this is NOT a bad thing....more on that later) you can feel both effective and badass, while still experiencing an urgency or need to pay attention....more on this next-the enemy behavior, abilities and dmg have all been heavily revamped, and in general they do more dmg, have slightly better behavioral patterns/AIs, and this is AWESOME.  it all lends to that need to pay attention/the feel of urgency I previously mentioned.  before, the enemies felt...threatless, beyond all their howling, now they pose a real threat, but their HP hasnt been beefed up (or maybe it has, but the spells have been as well) because you can still blow them all to hell >:3-spell crafting has been largely improved; more types of single target and AoE spells, the augments have more, varying effects they can apply.  I did mention in the cons that this crafting system has some flaws, the biggest of which, imo, is the fact that you can end up with HUNDREDS of patterns and augments in your inventory, and due to their varying degrees of quality, and the way you have to upgrade spells (combining a great number of higher quality spells with the one you are looking to improve), it can be time consuming, unwieldly, and just plain annoying to deal with :SRight now, for 24 bucks US, this is a STEAL in my opinion.

												There are postiive and negetives to everygame and in the end, the negetives out weigh the positives for Lichdom: Battlemage. When I started playing, it was fun. You are a powerful mage, crafting spells to destroy enemies. Like advertised, you get to run through enemies as a mage unlike RPGs where you have to level up before you feel really strong. As you progress through the levels more types of spells become available to you and keeps you enticed with variety. Then, as you get further, the repetitive, monotonous nature of the game begins to reveal itself. The levels are very linear and you fight the same enemies. The spell ""crafting"" was a little confusing to me at first but even after figuring things out, it didn't really matter because the type of spells you start out with will be your most powerful. You level a spell the more you use it, so as you find those new spell types later in the game, you can't really use them because they are so much weaker than the ones you've had. WIth that, all fights end up the same. You pop the same order of your same spells against the same enemies. Even the boss fights are the same repetitive spell casting, only difference is the boss is stronger, has a tougher attack, and takes longer to kill. If this game was more of a horde/wave/survival game, it would make more sense and be more bearable. Some rooms in the levels have a wave mode but it is just a small part of the game.Overall, the game's repetitiveness makes it unenjoyable and frustrating.			"

Early Access Review
								Game play Its a good game at first but the introduction part is looooooooooong!!!! (at least 2.5 hours in and still figuring when the f- chapter is going to end). The game ends up becoming a smart idea turned into a frustrating rush of button clicking and key stroking unforgiveness. Such as constantly shooting the one spell all the time, it becomes boring and you start to wonder is this all that happens throughout the game? ""Shoot spell, blink, shoot spell, ward up"" repeat, repeat repeat..... Combat Gettting a pillar or wall stuck behind you is seriously annoying, so you blink forward to get out and straight into an attacking enemy is ANNOYING. And the enemies hit and health points are way over powered (stop trying to be like Dark Souls difficulty!! ). Charge times and shoot times are too long, and becomes a brain grilling chore Enemies Those F___ damn distance enemies are annoying and really detract from a fight when youre getting a good hold of the battle. Interaction There are no mechanics when shooting spells at 'barrels and tables' (with money on them) or any kind of physical manipulation. There are also no item pick ups, (there is, but only scrolls and chests, which dont yeild any interactive items)So no I dont recommned this, unless some better mechanics, game play and design is implemented with a variety of different spells in the beginning, better environment manipulation and a better save/ checkpoint system.I know this is Alpha, but getting foundational design right is crucial!

												After dealing with the disappointment that your ""badass"" mage has a whopping three spells available to him at any one time, the inability to describe how anything works really keeps you from enjoying the game.  Not to mention, your mage is squishy as hell and can get killed by trash mobs if you're not careful.  Then the disappointment that you're only walking around in a corridor fighting the same enemies over and over until you get to the boss who's only more difficult because it's a massive bullet sponge.  This is Lichdom: Battlemage.Xaviant started off well with some impressive looking spells in nice looking environments, then shot their own foot where it counts; making the game interesting.  Instead, you get a generic revenge story with mystery man who gives you magic.  As you run around, someone else drops in and out of the game telling you some useless garbage that's supposed to get you interested about whoever you are supposed to be fighting. It doesn't.  My first though about this individual who seems to have much better magic was, ""Can't you just teleport into wherever and kill that guy so I don't have to play anymore?""Instead, we wander through one level to the next following one corridor to the next while the devs refuse to tell us how to play their game.  Their instructions go as far as telling us the three buttons we can use while we should be learning about the different spells we create and what each of them work.  It would be so easy to get an explanation every time we pick up a item.  Nope figure it out for yourself.  We have things that do this and that but it isn't until we actually craft them that we realize that cool freeze ray we crafted only has a range of about three feet, or that ""Strategic"" shield is different than the ""Tactical"" shield is different from the ""Agile"" shield and the only way to figure out the differences is to test them out and die.  After enduring the corridor run for a while, you also pick up additional effects such as Fire, ice, lighting, kinesis, etc., but they don't seem to matter much.  Fire burns, ice freezes, lightning shocks but it doesn't seem to matter what you use. You would think a ""badass"" mage wouldn't be so squishy either.  Originally, I kept telling the devs the ""tutorial"" level was way too hard for first timers to figure out.  Supposedly they made it easier in a recent patch, took them long enough, but at the cost of getting sigils.TLDR; Walk around in linear corridors pressing the left mouse, the right mouse, and the two mouse buttons together until you die.

												I had a bad time playing Lichdom: Battlemage, it has somewhat feel of power but lacks speed. Bosses are typical ""bullet sponges"", enemy variation is dissapointing, ai is very dumb. Player is expected to be very casual since lmb attacks are homing. Story is cliche and not engaging, after playing for a hour i stopped giving a damn about it and. And when you take out the story all that is left are repetetive enemy fights that could be made more interesting with beter introduced crafting system. Sound and visuals are the only upsides of this game which is expected having in mind that Lichdom: Battlemage was made using cryengine. If you feel enjoyment of torturing yourself then this game will perfectly fit you. 3/10			"

												TL:DR - You'd probably have a better time playing Skyrim with infinite magicka on.This game does have some pretty cool mechanics and it's fun moments, however...Here's my playthrough in a nutshell:Freeze enemies, switch to KinesisTether enemies, switch to FireBlow everything the ♥♥♥♥ up, then switch to IceSprint around like an idiot and repeat twelve million times.And occasionally getting two shot by incredibly cheap enemies, and die by that one boss from the snow level 20 times, because underleveled shield and dat difficulty spike.Yeah there's other elements, I tried them, they felt like sidegrades more than anything else, so I went back to the initial ""vanilla"" loadout because it worked and I was used to it. The game is really repetitive no matter how you slice it.So the game is pretty much:Run through vast levelsMurder tons of dudes that appear out of thin airOccasionally sidetrack and murder more dudes for crafting materialsFiddle around with an overly complicated crafting system, give up, use the smart inventory, which then eventually ♥♥♥♥s up upgrading your meteor synergy spell and literally tosses it out the window, thanks game.Generally the game isn't too hard unless your stuff is severely underleveled, and you're not paying attention to using your shield and dodging out of the way and whatnot. I mainly died by the really cheap stuff, like stunlocks, and those oversized dudes that like rooting you in place.Only give this game a try (On sale/bundle) if you have undying patience for frustrating and repetitive gameplay, and also like having your CPU hit the temperature of the sun constantly, because Cryengine.

												NOT WORHT IT. Too linear. Gets boring after a while. Not worth paying 47 bucks for this. Watch gameplays before playing, you'll really see how the game is. When I first saw this game I though it was like Skyrim, but with badass and powerful magic. It's not.I have played this game over 3 hours, and this is not an RPG game. In an RPG game, you have freedom to make your decisions and build your character, but this game has a linear story and the only decision you make is to be male or female. Tryes copying Skyrim's magic system, but fails. Even though in the description it says you have 'Thousands of spell posibilities', don't imagine that you have lots of awesome spells that do completly different things. In this game you only have three spells: a missile, an AOE spell and a shield. It's true that there is crafting, but it only changes the spell stats (i.e. Critical Chance, cast time, etc) some decimals. But there are different elements, thats true; like fire, ice, lightning...Not really, they are all the same, only the graphical appearance is changed.Magic does not feel as powerlful as it look likes. You just go through single-way dungeons trying to dodge enemy attacks and throwing 5 fireballs to every single enemy to kill them (actually fire is the only elemente that makes some damage to enemies).Conclusion: not worth it.But, I have to say that the only decent things in this game are graphics and particles.

								Combat mechanics such as blink (instant dodge to 5 feet in any direction), unlimited casting and reaction based shielding make for a lot of fun and basically carry the game entirley. The spell creation is labyrinthine but rewarding. Unfortunatley the story is unengaging and a little flat, the pacing of the game is constant with relentless running through a linear map filled with combatants which can get a little numbing. Graphics are good and seems generally bug free although as its still in beta you will get the occasional floating wig or spawning with your head in the snow. It's also nice to be challenged and not just fly through every level without hitch like in a lot of modern games. The damage indicators and the loot collection give the game an arcady feel which although perfectly suited to this games complete focus on its great combat mechanics does nothing for story emersion although judging by the plot so far they've probably decided that its for the best that the plot fades into the backround. quick note, the voice acting isn't bad at all and although the protagonist does speak he keeps it to a minimum which is nice. prepare to die alot.

												OK, that was a lot of fun.  Just finished the game, and now I'm wondering/hoping for more.  I'd like a DLC, or even a sequel.  I'll admit the game was hard at first, and I even put the game down for several months.  I've found that it was important to learn the crafting system, and make a good set of spells that allowed me to control the battle field and deal tons of damage.  When I found that rythem, the enjoyment for me went through the roof, and I couldn't put the game down until I completed it.The game was visually stunning, finding myself looking all around, and not just for all of the hidden areas.  The voice acting was great, but what would you expect from the line-up they had, other than the best.In the late game when I had a couple of synergy spells, like meteor and super nova the throw at the enemy dealing 10s of thousands of damage.  I was having the time of my life.This game did have a bit of a Skyrim feel for me, because all you see are your hands, and the game looked beautiful.  It also had a bit of a Dark Souls feel, since you're dropped into this world, and you have to run around looking for clues, and read the journal entries for the lore.  Also, if you want to beat this game, it's not going to hold your hand, you're going to have to just get good at the game.  It also helps a lot to figure out the crafting of synergies.			"

												Pretty good for what it is; and to differ with many players, I liked the story pretty well. Primarily because the townspeople have been drained of will and vigour with looming shadows overhead, it seems like an obscure metaphor for life at this time in history. But I may be looking way into that.If you are able to enjoy it as is, that's awesome- but I felt the lack of a loot system (robes/armour, weapons, a ♥♥♥♥ing magic ring even) makes advancement feel somewhat lacking. A short cast of monsters to battle with, and usually the same approach can be used again and again.. so unless you choose to change things up, fights can pretty much stay the same if you like. Also, the lack of even a slight open world feeling would have been beneficial, something I think Borderlands and games like it got just right.Crafting is not quick to understand imo, and I spent 24 minutes watching a video on YouTube before I was able to feel moderately comfortable.This game looks good, and generally feels good to play; but I think it's just missing a few things, and lost my attention quickly. Nothing glaringly ""wrong"" with it, though. Give it a try if you're into this sort of thing. "

I spent 30 hours, as long as 30 hours for one pass. Boring and monotonous location, did not help in this?4) Archmage.The game positions you as a Archmage! Then why from the beginning to the end of the game you have to constantly dodge, die, and get off the critters super magician say?5) Checkpoints.I understand, to put a lot of checkpoints bad, but ... Dying and rolled away for 30-40 minutes?6) Bosses.We are tired of the easy bosses. But if you make the boss a lot HP, that does not make it more difficult - it just make you poke a button and dodge.Subtotal: Simulator adept, who until Archmage thousand levels, requiring nerves.This game is not worth $ 60, the maximum is $ 10 on steam sale.

								tl;dr: Monotonous, slightly modified version of Skyrim's magic system, sans mana bar. Everything else is the same. Game's not bad, looks good, fun for a few hours. Doesn't feel too much like early access (not many bugs to speak of), but there are some obviously in-progress set pieces.Personally, i didn't find the game all that compelling. The magic quickly becomes an exercise in ""blink everywhere you go"", each enemy takes exactly the same amount of damage to kill, the spells take just long enough to charge up that you never feel like you're playing something ""quick"", and overall it's just monotonous. Different spell effects claim to do different things, but ultimately you wind up with one damage-dealer, and a couple of ""i wish these were cooler"" spells. The crafting is good, and it's required to get through the game - but it doesn't change how you play. You're just min/maxing your spells when you craft, they all act the same otherwise. I usually don't mind these sorts of things. Especially not when the game is trying to do something unusual. But in this case, it just doesn't feel like it's worth buying. Maybe they'll put more effort into it, maybe they'll fix the monotony. But as it stands, I can't honestly recommend it.			"

												This game is a new genre, I can describe it as  Action-Magic FPS.Its not like most RPG games, I didn't play much RPGs, but its totally different from skyrim and others alike.everything is about making your spells and mastering them, upgrading and so on. Its more like a classic shooter FPS games, but not with guns, with cool spells and magic.So to enjoy the game you have to try different combination of spells, different abilities.Gameplay is solid, sound effects are great, story sounds OK or generic so far. Its built on CryEngine3, the graphics are very good.So when you want to buy, consider what I said above, don't expect a casual RPG game, this is how to be a Battlemage.The game does well in what it describe itself, however it seems many have expected different things about it, and that's why there are negative reviews, and some just couldn't understand its mechanics as I said its a new thing. (also could be the price, I got it on sale so I won't talk about that aspect)When I first started and didn't know how the game works, I just died a lot, but when I got into it,  I had a good time, spells and shield change the gameplay. (see community guides if you need anything)In short, if you like to try another kind of old school shooter with better graphics and some spell crafting, get this one. Otherwise, don't .. you won't like for any other reasons.I will add more details later as I advance in the game.			"

												Note: I do not recommend this game but it can go on very steep discount (like 99% on third party resellers), it may be worth checking out in that case just to see if u might like itLichdom: Battlemage is a wizard shooter with unique spell crafting system that offers lots of variety with playstyles and the game also has great visuals. Levels are linear but they have impressive scenery and a lot of effort was put into building the levels, visual effects, sound effects and just about everything. I played the game only for 5 hours before growing bored of it but it can take up to 30 hours to complete, so there is a lot of content.But despite great production value the game in my opinion falls flat in design, mainly combat, which is like 90% of the game. You can sprint, dash (short teleport) and throw different types of spells at enemies (missile/bomb/beam, area of effect attacks and charged teleports that also does AoE) but the combat is still tedious, slow and annoying. Casting spells takes a while as they have to be charged fully to do decent enough damage or u will have to spam a lot of them. The enemies can get really annoying as the game has numerous crowd control status effects that can affect the player as well, sometimes u get slowed down to 20% movement speed with sprint and dashes disabled. When I said the levels are linear, they really are exactly that with very limited playble area and no jumping.			"

												This is a innovative game that is only held back by the fact that it gives you a sense of what it would be like to have ADHD in the sense that it never lets you sit still.The magic system is extensive, lets you create a matrix of different elements, ranges, effects, etc.  But at the same time, you can't really enjoy it.For me, at least, when I have access to such an extensive set of possible abilities, I would like to sit down somewhere safe and just experament for a few hours.  In this game, there is no home base.  No safe haven.  Nowhere to rest your virtual head and just enjoy what the devs have done.It is a great game for people who want to engage in exotic or bizzare or just strange enemies to the exclusion of all other things.  But me, I can only take so much of continuous fighting before I want to focus purely on building something instead.  This game has no place for that, so I am afraid I cannot reccomend it for the vast majority of casual players out there.			"

												Describing why this is a ""do not recommend"" is largely a matter of person taste, so keep that in mind. But I'll try to leave things at comments that anyone would fine helpful. I got the game quite some time ago and tried to get into it, but simply couldn't muster a whole lot of enthusiasm for it. I didn't get very far and simply quit at the time because I had so many other recently bought games that were... better. Today, I decided I'd go back and give Lichdom another try. Again, I am having difficulty liking this game and, out of frustration, have decided to write a review because now I know it's not a flaky feeling.Good things:1. Graphics. Almost everything about the game's visuals are pretty much top notch. The textures and other assets are good enough to rival mid-tier Skyrim graphics overhauls. The partical effects are satisfying. Just about the only bad thing about the game's visuals are that some animations don't look organic at all (such as watching your shadow run: it looks like a stick figure or stiff robot).2. Sound: absolutely no complaints here. The background music is subtle yet enticing. The effects are meaty and satisfying. Etc.3. Performance: With every setting on max, you'll have a constant 60 FPS (if you framelock/use Vsync like I do) with almost no stuttering, so long as you're not playing it on a potatoe.4. Tutorials: the game does an excellent job of introducing mechanics as you go through the first mission. The only exception where the turorials fail is the crafting system, which is, frankly, an unintuitive mess that makes me wonder why it was designed that way at all. More on that later.5. Story telling: the game isn't super heavy on story. This is no Elder Scrolls or The Last of Us. You're shoehored into a fairly generic ""da bad guy iz doin' bad thingz"" plotline where you play as a hero who was chosen by a powerful, mysterious wizzard dude who gives you power to save the day. That's... that's litterally the starting primiss of the story. You'll pick up on that immediately. But the reason why this is under ""good thigns"" is two reasons: 1, the game doesn't really need an amazing story because that's not what it's trying to do; and 2, what story there is, is actually very well delivered (other than some jarring and unorganic animations).6. Continuing off of #5, the writing is pretty good. Nothing comes across as super cheesy. And the voice acting is really good. You might actually notice that the voice actors are even better than the writing itself, which I suppose is a bit of a shame considering the game isn't trying to be an enthralling story teller.Bad things:1. The combat is repetitive. Really... really... really repetitive. Lay down some gravity wells to trap enemies, spray them with necromaner juice to raise zombies, hit em with a bit firestorm. Rinse, repeat. The fact that you have entirely different spell types (i.e. using mind control instead of necromancy, lightning instead of fire, ice instead of telekenisis) does not remedy this problem. Regardless of what you decide to play as, you'll be repeating the same 3 spell types across 3 bases you rotate through over and over and over. If the combat was more fluid or faster paced or... something... this wouldn't be a problem. But put  ~5 hours into this and you'll start to notice the repetition because combat and traveling is all you're doing.2. The spell variety is an illusion. There isn't really that much of a worthy difference between how different spell modifications work. Yes, there are noteworthy and obvious differences, by they fundamentally are interchangable. It's more a matter of what you find most convenient to use.3. Going off of #1 and 2, the crafting system is downplayed. I've already mentioned that it isn't very intuitive. There's actually a ""smart inventory"" mode because of how unnecassarily complicated it is. There are some great aspects to it, such as the spell crafting menu. The way you actually make and modify a spell is really cool. But other things, such as upgrading individual items, leaves me wondering why it was designed the way it was. I actually ended up using the ""smart inventory"" to just auto-upgrade individual items and then switch to the advanced menu to craft the spells.4. Defense is frustrating. Your shield blocks a good portion of damage taken, yes. And if you time it right, you cause a nova and take no damage at all, yes. But, referring back to my complaint about animations... good luck telling when you should block to trigger said nova. A lot of enemies (most, actually) have animations that are too long, too misleading, etc.  You might see an enemy in melee range start to swing at you and so you reactively throw up that shield only to watch as their attack animation takes well over a second or more to get to the ""hit"" portion. The end result, of course, is that you don't trigger a nova and instead only block a portion of the damage. This is especially annoying against bosses (god help you) and groups of enemies all chasing you.5. Combat in general is slow. A lot of times, enemies will attack you, then stare at you for several seconds, then go back to trying to hit you. Other than being immersion breaking, it would make the game way too easy if it wasn't for the fact that there are times when you get swarmed and, if not for that unrealistic pause in action, you'd be dead very quickly. In addition to this, actually using spells just... doesn't feel good. The spells feel clunky to charge up and cast, even casting without charging, and upgrading and modifying spells to charge or cast faster doesn't entirely eliminate this problem. If you're used to playing some game like Skyrim where playing as a mage is slick and smooth, you'll find this very, very jarring.Hopefully others will find this helpful. Perhaps some of these issues I have are remedied later in the game, such as getting better upgrades, but even if that's true... Litchdom: Battlemage just isn't doing a good job of holding my interest. I dare say that Skyrim with a few nice magic system modifications (that you can get for free btw) provides you with a better mage-roleplaying experience than this game does. That's really disappointing for me because this game's design has so much potential, but the end product simply isn't entertaining me.			"

												This game has its weak points, but it really has it's strong points. I've been sick of all the dumbing down games have been doing over the last 10 years. This game brings back that need to think on your toes (fingers).  This game has made a very small list of games that I have, that don't hand you over powered in the early stages of the game, and expect you to grind through the next few hours, or days just destroying your enimies without thought. Now, I did say it has it's weak points and there is still grinding, and the story imho is meh, but the rewards you recieve from the gameplay style such as satisfaction and or excitment far out weight the negitives. That first boss I tried to beat without trying and got may @$$ handed to me really p!ssed me off, but I adapted and killed him. I've found that this game has alot of simple guys (hence the grinding), but it also has a good deal of variety in the bosses and they throw in mini bosses here and there to keep to on your toes (fingers). Overall this game is about 4 out 5, but could become so much more in future games.			"

Lichdom Badass!If your superpowers, like kinesis or electricity ... or corruption, aren't nearly as good as you want them to be ....means: you must get up and walk to your coffee.means: your toaster will not work applied to a tree.means: you pay full.In this case you may try some alternatives or get some playtime as mage and roast some *sses!Great game! Great skills! Great crafting!Playing it since EA and the game is still updated / improved & i am not bored.Many bad voices about difficulty (enemies or crafting / mastery) - so Xaviant made it easier and adjustable.For myself i never played this on easy or normal and i like the difficulty. Sure, i will die sometimes before i finish but that's the game.			"

												Imagine Bioshock redone with Crysis 3 graphics or Diablo 2 first person but instead of collecting armor and weapons you collect materials to make spells.  There is no warrior, barbarian, demonhunter, or rogue class etc.  In Lichdom it's all about being the mage and a battlemage at that.  I have a good pc and this is the first game I got that I can't play on the highest settings - well actually I can run it on highest it's just hard to control at 20-30fps so medium is for me!  At medium settings the game looks spectacular with so many special effects and the realism so good obviously with the great graphics.  Even at low settings the game will look amazing and is better looking than other games on their highest settings because of the engine.  As the game progresses you will become stronger and stronger as you craft more powerful spells and unlock additional sigils (elements) of magic.  There are places to explore and you can revisit areas but remember this is a dungeon game not an open world sandbox  (although it looks so impressive you will see it as a world) so it differs from the other games in that sense.

												Pros:+ Interesting and versatile spell crafting system.+ Interesting spell variations.+ Interesting and varied schools of magic.+ Decent story.+ Well written dialogue (completely different for entire game depending on player gender).+ Combat is shiny and has nice feel to it.+ Good graphics.+ Good level design.Cons:- Combat/levels can get repetitive.- Game is quite easy (I played through it once on normal or easy, I forget, and it was extremely easy, with the final boss being killed in about three casts. I am currently playing on the hardest difficulty, and I can't really detect much of a noticable difference, although it has been while since I first did it, so my memory of details is hazy).- Although this isn't really a pro or a con, I'll put it here as it did get a little boring: levels are very long. I mean VERY long. There are (I think, if my memory serves) four areas in the entire game (excluding tutorial). The levels are quite varied though, so it wasn't that much of a biggie. Just thought I'd mention it.- Game is relatively short on the whole.Summary:Sorry guys I'm tired bye.			"

Early Access Review
								Endless casting... crafting your own synergy spells....and watching this amazing game develop from it's roots? I'd buy that for a dollar! Lichdom: Battlemage currently sports 6 sigils (base patterns to craft spells on), damn near infinite number of augments (stuff that adds additional effects / bonuses) as well as some absolutely gorgeous locations. The combat system is developing nicely, and already I've seen dramatic improvements in the AI engine - which also silo's a tiny sliver of fear inside my soul as to how the AI will perform when the game is out of Beta.If you've ever wanted to run around in a beautiful fantasy environment throwing spells to no end, Lichdom: Battlemage is your cup of tea.

												First off, let me say that Lichdom is amazing! If you love wizards, magic, or just want experience what it would feel like to be one... this IS THE ultimate spell caster simulator. On top of that... the game is very well polished, looks and plays amazing and is very fun. As you can see there is a ton of negative comments and feedback but these neighsayers have not looked deep enough into the game to realize this is NOT Call of Duty... or your typical FPS. Lichdom is a RPG spell caster simulator.  You are gifted with the power of magic and learn how to craft and wield it to work toward your goal. There are no vast inventories of items like armor and weapons... you are a mage... you collect Sigils... and that is all.  Consider sigils the magical essence of a soul that only you (a wizard/sorceress) can harvest. That is your currency... that is your lifeblood...  Learn to get them, learn  how to use them, learn how to craft and make them better. You take a simple lightning bolt and make it into a lightning ball ... you can take that and make it an area effect explosion trap... then  you could add in chain lighting. Seriously, once you learn how the sigil system works... it will click and you will see that this is a really deep crafting game to your design. The enemies so far have been challenging and every new area surprises me with something new and deadly each time. The graphics are top notch and very well done... down to the back grounds that go on for miles and miles.The game is mostly linear but having a world open sandbox might be too much initially. Regardless, I love it.Now, it can get some what overwhelming to learn the sigil system... an Idiot's Guide to Sigils would help as would a Mage Mastery Spellbook (hopefully these will come out in the future). So far the environments have been beautiful and deadly to traverse... and I just made it to the 3rd area... and can't wait to see more!I notice the team is very quick to put out fixes/patches and add new items for the game owners...  I respect that.Just to have the ability to create any type of spell you want to use in your arsenal over time... and blast through levels and have fun doing it... mastering the game itself is just as fun!Boss monsters?  Oh yeah... they are tough and they can be tricky!  Some thought and uniqueness has been designed with them also...  Kudos!You can even craft new spells and go back in previous trodden areas and test it out (and get loot while you do it)...Sure it could play like Call of Duty or Skyrim but the main focus is you are a mage... you cast spells and you design your own spells.  No inns, no taverns, no swords or bows you can get... no chainmail or leather armor you can don...  You are your own weapon...  you have a mission... DO IT!   :) "

	Lichdom Battlemage is a first person RPG action game that centers aroundyou becoming an epic battlemage with limitless powers and spells at your fingertips.Looking at this game objectively, the graphics are decent, and the music does a great job of conveying the atmosphere.  	The story is very simplistic and disconnected;  your character, a shopkeeper whichhas a sister who is captured and taken into slavery.  Instead of trying to save your sister, you are being used as a tool by an experienced, older mage, toget revenge on the one who captured your sister.  You are playing as a 'battle-mage'who has had no training in magic, but instead is using magical bracelets thatchannel power from a true mage.  Huh?  	The interface is minimalistic, which means what you are able to do islimited.  The game is centered around 'spell combinations', but that is not a true representation of what is used. You can upgrade abilities, which makes thema bit stronger, but the true power comes from crafting ""spells"", and augmenting them with runes that you farm during gameplay.  You have to farm, andfarm, and farm for these runes in order to really get a spell that is worthwhile, and even then you may not find the runes you want or need to make the spell augmentation you desire. To make it even worse, the game does a bad job of explaining the interface;  I had to spend time reading up and watching videos from outside sources in order tounderstand the capabilities of the complicated crafting system.	Tactically, the game is basic.  Very basic.  You face the same enemiesover and over again, and once you develop a strategy, you pretty much just rinseand repeat with every enemy encounter.  The lack of intelligence in the AI makesit so easy to destroy.  The bosses ad a bit more difficulty, but even they canbe defeated  in a straightforward manner once you have the correct spell combination.	The game tries to make the game unique by adding minor nuances, but itdoesn't change the experience of the game.  You are still using the same power,and inflicting the same damage.  Unfortunately, this combined with limiting the number of spells you can use hurts the game more than adds to it.  You face the same enemies that have no tactical abilities over and over again, and then relentlessly farm, making the game repetitive and boring.  This is not agame I can recommend. 	This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

Early Access Review
								If this is the only part of my review you read then I'll make it comprehensive:Crafting that is intelligent, encounters that make you adapt, graphics that are stellar, and customization that is close to bar none.Now, on to the details.I was skeptical at first, reading the reviews, all were positive except one. While this game is not for everyone, the same can be said of any game. Lichdom however, does manage to capture and improve upon many elements of well known and liked AAA titles (Skyrim/Morrowind, Dark Messiah, Diablo to name a few) in a polish that is almost non-existent in the early access phase of development/release.A word on the magic, as it is the sole focus of the game. You DO feel as if you have a multitude of options at your disposal while at the same time not being overpowered or underpowered. There are 3 primary banks (slots) that you start with: targeted - a not quite homing/not quite free fire charged spell, AOE....should speak for itself, and barrier....again should speak for itself. Where Xaviant have diverged from typical gameplay is in the way you customize these banks and create new spells through the crafting and synthesis system.This bring me to my next point, the crafting. When done well can be a great experience in making the way you play the game unique to you and offering you freedom to explore that uniqueness. When done terribly...Diablo III, looking at you, it can be a lesson on tedium and pointlessness for the sake of artificial longevity. Again, Xaviant have succeeded in using what is considered established procedure but, redefining how it is done. There are NO tables, benches, tools, etc. etc. required to craft/synthesize/equip/reforge...it's just a menu. This means that you can change how you play when you like (I chose not to say ""when you want"" there because combat does not stop simply because you are in a menu) depending on what available resources you have.I'll define resources so there is no confusion, this is not Skyrim or Diablo, (dont mean to pick on these titles, they just stick out in my mind as crafting that could've been so much more) the resources you collect are in the form of orbs. The orbs are RNG based (random number generated) and can be either a new type of spell form, e.g. a ray/laser instead of the targeted type of primary attack, or ones that increase a certain type of damage, duration of effects, type of effects, form of damage dealt, method of damage dealt....there is TRUE customization here. While you spend these resources on crafting new spells, the game does something interesting. It doesn't penalize you, in the conventional sense, for wanting to explore different options. You can reforge a currently crafted spell and choose to either store the ""points"" towards a legendary item, or choose specifically which component out of the current spell you have selected you want to keep and use for another idea.All this being said, the game does have room for improvement. I have a...I guess...beastly rig and with everything turned all the way up, there were sections that I was getting 30fps. I believe this is due to TressFX (tesselation of hair if you're into that thing) and is mentioned in the patch notes provided, so I wasnt upset or disappointed when my frames chugged while having this enabled. The only other thing I can nitpick about is, and this may just be in my case, there are no facial animations for dialogue. Again, may just be me.All in all, if you're considering supporting this developer, thought the game looked good, liked the premise/concept, are looking to play a fun loot grind (which its not solely about I should add), enjoy crafting with actual customization, are a fan of Dark Messiah combat and Skyrim FPS magic....then don't fret over the ""early access"" status of Lichdom, it's well on its way to being a worthwhile AAA title.

												This game is boring.The plot is rudimentary at best. Gameplay is awkward and the controls are incomprehensible.Instructions and tutoring is minimal so you learn what works early on and repeat it until you are bored.After 4 or 5 hours of cumbersome gameplay having little or no plot to keep your interest you ask youself, 'why?' and move on to something that makes more sense and is more fun.A few weeks ago, this was rating 79 on metacritic, today it is 68. The game is beautiful and gets high marks eary on. But as you progress into a game it takes more then pretty pictures to keep you playing. This has nothing behind the graphics so as you progress it just gets confusing, anti-climactic, repetetive and boring. Watch for the numbers to continue to drop on this 'game'. By the end of the year it will be rating in the 50s and the price will be < $20 USD.It still won't be worth your money.			"

												At first it feels a little underwhelming. Probably because, just starting out, learning, that kind of stuff. After the first ""Area/Area boss"" it comes into a life of it's own. Within 2 hours of gameplay I absolutely adore this game. The Necromancy is highly interesting in that, you can technically choose the kind of minion you want under your control, rather than having a seperate spell for all minions. You can do utterly devastating combos, one that I've recently been using was Kinesis/Fire area, with fire having igniting instead of area strike. Ticking for 100+ with kinesis proccing each tick. There really feels as if there's no end to combinations between the magic, crafting and synthesizing. 10/10			"

												While this is going to be a mostly negative review, I will say this: I did enjoy the spells and spell crafting system. It was interesting to see what you could do with various mixes of the spell components. However, the statement of ""Thousands of spells possibilities!"" is misleading. It is really the same spells with different modifiers time and time again. You choose your element (Fire, Ice, Lightning, ect.), then you choose the shape (Missle, Ray, Trap, Burst, ect.), then you chose whether to make it a damage spell, a status-effect debuff spell, or a stacking debuff spell that does extra damage when set off. Changing the element only really effects the status-effect that is inflicted, with little other effect.Spells aside, the rest of the game just feels... flat; as if the developers put so much work into the spell system that there wasn't much drive left for anything else. The level design is very linear, with a few side sections every now and then which eventually turn to dead ends. You'll find yourself doing about three minutes of walking between each battle, with little to do but take in the scenery.When you do find a fight, the battles are simple and predictable. You have melee types who run up and smack you, long-range types who rapid fire weak attacks and floating enemies that have AoE freezing attacks. Once you kill them, it's time to start walking again until you reach the next fight.All in all, the game did not live up to any of the expectations I had for it gameplaywise.			"

 Play the first game where the Mage is NOT a total badass...  I have to admit, at first I thought,  ""A first-person, badass-mage-with-endless-mana RPG? Whoah!"" So I bought it...And I am still  regretting it...  TL;DR? Just buy Skyrim with half price and x10 more content and play a Mage. There are  MANY deceptions about this game  and I want to make them clear now, so you can at least save your money for something that's worth it, unlike me. 1.  Open World? Nope. It is just a linear game, following the same fixed, linear route, without being able to interact with anything in the environment and groups of 3-4 enemies popping up from the ground at certain points to get you - will get to that in a sec. (No.5)  Also, I've barely played for 3 hours and I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY that the game is repetitive as hell - you simply do the same thing over and over again: Move in small linear corridor > enemies magically pop-up from the ground > move backwards while shooting the same freakin' spell at them > REPEAT.  2.  Badass mage? Nope.  You are basically a weakling who spams weak magic spells. You would expect badass explosions with spells and blowing enemy heads with your non-stop magic - Nope, nope, and nope.  All you can do is wield one spell in one hand and an annoying shield at the other which is only needed to block some ranged arrow attacks that are so lame that you can simply walk to avoid the arrow while it is coming at you. There is also a small radius AOE attack if you hold both Mouse Buttons but I rarely used it since it is weird to hit.In addition, the one spell you can actually wield has a strange casting bug (I hope it's a bug.)  When you hold it down for a power attack, the spell charges, and upon releasing the mouse button to launch the Fireball like you would do in any other casting game, it takes an extra 2 seconds to actually shoot it, creating huge confusion on whether the spell was cast, failed to cast, or bugged out. Something like: *Holds RMB* > 2 seconds to charge in hand > *Release RMB to throw spell* > wait another awkward 1-2 seconds with no hand animation > wonder if you actually held RMB long enough for it to charge properly > *hand makes the animation of shooting while the Fireball is still not fired* > *suddenly sees Fireball being thrown, after 2 sec of delay* 3.  Difficulty? Nope. Even on high difficulties which can be rather challenging, but due to the game 'cheating' on you, all you do is move backwards and spam RMB to shoot your magic (I repeat, it's confusing to hold it down for a Power Attack since it is apparently bugged). And who needs to aim? You don't even have to aim. There is not even a crosshair in the middle of the screen to aim. All you do is cast and shoot, apparently Fireballs automatically find their target, even if he is 100 yards away. 4.  ""Awesome"" Crafting Spells system?!?!?! NOPE.  There is no precise tutorial and no logic behind spell crafting.  Somehow, dead enemies drop a magical sphere/rune like thingy that, want it or not, just follows you and you collect it. That thingy is used to craft spells. Good luck figuring out how. A big menu pops up which I had to google it to find out how to bring it up (thank god for the in-game tutorial!) A list emerges before you with runes that you have no idea what they do, you pick one, then you pick another without even knowing what it does or what the term ""mastery"" refers to since the game doesn't explain that properly, then you pick ANOTHER extra rune and craft the spell.I crafted ONE spell out of luck, without knowing what it does.I equip the newly made spell which just replaced the default Fireball. Apparently my spell was a beam-like spell that you hold down and hits the target. Fun part: the spell did NO damage at all.(Then I had to figure out how to re-equip the default Fireball cause I couldn't kill a damn enemy with it.) And I am thinking: even if the spell simply added a buff for extra fire dmg on the target that someone mentioned (after all, I made the spell out of luck) even then, how are you supposed to take advantage of it since you have to unequip it and then RE-EQUIP the Fireball from the menu, which requires a game pause to happen, ruining the game's momentum?  5.  Enemies just pop from the ground and  run stupidly  at you while they are hit by your spells. Simply move backwards guys. Even the enemies with the arrows fail at hitting you. I encountered 2 mini-bosses that they too, just run after you... so you either spam Space to Blink and/or simply hold Shift to Sprint and outrun them. Hardcore mechanics... 6.  You can choose between the male or female  story  mode that has no difference in spells, just the story. Which is also - at least for me - poorly developed, with pictures for the cinematics that pop up once or twice in your playthrough. ""Sister is taken by evil bad-guy with mustache and beard (AND a bodyguard), then a crazy MFer gives you spell powers so that you can take revenge"" (Female storyline, I believe there is no need to mention the male one.)  7.  The environment is literally DEAD. All you can interact with in the environment are some weird pillars that show you a weird ghost-story that you can  simply ignore since you have no time for such BS... you signed up for an all-action, badass mage game after all, didn't you?  + Some orbs in awkward places that restore some of your health.  Sorry for the sloppy review, but I am still sobbing for my 36.99... plus, I wanted to give you all the details of my experience. The list could go on but I think that everything else is just adding to the inevitable - AVOID THIS GAME.  EDIT  due to recent patch: They added tutorials, FINALLY, but this is something they should have done from the beggining. My recommendation will STILL remain negative and I am making this a 3,5/10 from 2,5/10.Score: ~3,5/10  I do NOT recommend this  "

												An amazing and beautiful game with interesting mechanics, really satisfying combat and cool level design. Though Lichdom is pretty linear and straightforward in terms of level progression, the gameplay itself delivers enough thrills to keep playing after the story is finished, just to try new ways to blow stuff up or for the fun of it.

												At first it feels a little underwhelming. Probably because, just starting out, learning, that kind of stuff. After the first ""Area/Area boss"" it comes into a life of it's own. Within 2 hours of gameplay I absolutely adore this game. The Necromancy is highly interesting in that, you can technically choose the kind of minion you want under your control, rather than having a seperate spell for all minions. You can do utterly devastating combos, one that I've recently been using was Kinesis/Fire area, with fire having igniting instead of area strike. Ticking for 100+ with kinesis proccing each tick. There really feels as if there's no end to combinations between the magic, crafting and synthesizing. 10/10			"

												The game concept is good, and I had great hopes based on what the dev team kept promising, but unfortunately the implementation is very, very lacking. The only strong point this game has is the world design, and even that is plagued with annoyance as levels resemble labyrinths for no good reason.The gameplay itself is quite boring and incredibly limiting and repetitive - for all the talk about making a ""powerful battlemage"" character, the game locks you into having three different spells at any given point, with upgrades to them being farmed in a boring and a very non-obvious way. The ""thousands of combinations"" come down to selecting an element and a delivery level. Every enemy encounter is similar, and the game features plenty of invisible walls to make sure you can't engage enemies without running up head first.I do not recommend this game at all.			"

												Damn this game couldn't be over fast enough...Ok sure it's pretty and I mean pretty. The elements and visuals are fantastic the story leaves much to be desired. I could care if anyone won, lost, or other. The spell crafting is a joke of really create your own anything my royal butt. Most of the game I'm either running and man do you do nothing but run in this game. Long spanses of nothing with a linear gameplay or repetative get it down to a rythm boring uhg. I'm sure the creators cared greatly of what they were attempting and hopeful they learned a lot in the production of this to not make the same mistakes twice. No replay ability imo, deleted and happily going to forget this even exsisted.			"

												I bought this game back in 2014 and forgot about it until 2015 because it was not a finished product back when I bought it.  I tried to get as far as I could with it, but frustration and repetition set in.  The combat was nice at first, but it quickly became a chore to play.Few spells gave decent damage for later levels and boss fights, and the game did not reward experimentation with spells.  If anything, it promotes sticking with the basic elements, fire, ice, and lightning.  All other spells become obsolete once you start making synergy spells because you can't combine any other triad of elements, and at badass difficulty, you're punished for swapping elements by having unequipped elements reset to level 1.  Whatever was the developer thinking when placing such limitations on spells when the entire game revolves around spell-making?After a while, the novelty of the combat wears off, and you realize that spells don't really evolve over time.  You just shoot the same fireballs, the same lightning, the same ice shards from beginning to end with very little variance in either appearance or stats.  The lack of progress eventually made me too tired of the game to even finish the story mode.  I didn't even make it to the portals and Newb Game Plus.  I simply couldn't take the repetition and seemingly endless supply of enemies to kill.  I wanted more depth and more story; I wanted less running from point A to point B.			"

												OK this is the most important thing about Lichdom Battlemage:Crafting spells is deeper than it looks at first glance, and spell schools can and will interact with eachother in ways you don't expect.Lemme give you one uber strategy that you can destroy the first boss with right off the bat, craft an ice control ray, some sort of AOE pool mastery builder, and a fire missle to crit the enemy. Drop the mastery pool, freeze the enemy in the pool and crit them with the fire spell(you always crit with spells if you charge them for a second or two, there is a visual indication) and you will annihilate the first boss. Ray spells also destroy projectiles shot by those crossbow undead so keep that in mind as well.Now lets break down how this works: Mastery is stored damage on an enemy it looks like blue fire, Ice control spells also store damage on the enemy and how much is listed in the spell description. When you crit an enemy with mastery on them you do even more damage based on the damaging spells mastery stat, a percentage number upwards of 240%. This can stack with ice's stored damage for almost double the effect, on top of the mastery.Keep in mind this is one combination of spells that I discovered on accident, all of the other schools of spells interact wtih spells in very different ways so they could change up this setup in a number of different ways. Corruption will pop out things that apply mastery, do damage or CC enemies if you leave it long enough. Lightning will arc to other enemies, Necromancy will summon  minions if you kill enemies tagged with it and you can infuse the minions with other spell schools by shooting them. Ice will store damage on enemies. Kinesis will knock them back. Fire will burn them. Delerium control will mind control your enemies pitting them against one another.Every one of the spell schools listed above(are the ones that I know how they work at the moment) interact differently depending on the type of patterns you put into them: Nova, missle, lob, ray, pool etc. and additionaly interact differently with the secondary patterns: damage, mastery and control. If you aren't getting an idea of the depth of the game yet, I'm not even done yet.On top of all this there is the shield system which is your defense, you have three health bars that regenerate as long as they aren't completely depleted. Craft better shields to get more health in these pips(as they are called ingame). On top of that you have the ability to block and to do a quick dodge, depending on which type of shield you have you can do a timed perfect block to cause a nova of damage around you and negate all damage. Or you can do a charged dodge and drop a nova where you land. And the nova changes depending on which spell school you have equipped and you can craft new ones for every spell school you have out.I hope this review helps you understand what this game is, its an arena based linear spell sandbox. And its a lot of fun if you have the patience to pay attention and press the i button to open up your inventory and expieriement. If you don't feel like expierimenting don't apply, if you don't feel like trying out the spell crafting system don't buy this game. But if you want to feel what its like to be a truly powerful mage through fairly open ended spell crafting pick it up.			"

												The trailer for this game really hyped it up for me. I bought it for 4$ on a sale and that's about how much the game is worth in my opinion, certainly not $40. After fighting the first boss and moving on to the next area, I was hoping to encounter new and exciting types of enemies to unleash magical destruction upon, but I still fought basic melee enemies, archers, and the occasional spellcaster who would freeze me. The game does look really pretty though, and the crafting system is neat, but it isn't enough for me to continue spending time on this game.			"

												Got tired of this game after only 4 hours, too repetitive, charge your spell, launch it, charge your spell launch it, after some time enemies becoomes more resistant, still dumb but you have to charge twice more often to kill them, gets boring very quickly.On the visual side of the game, at least they did a good job there, they use some cool shaders for the flashback in time through purple smoke, overall graphics of the environment cool too, sometimes I wish I could explore more, but it ends up being always one line path.

												With the mixed reviews of this game, I really wasn't sure if it was going to be a regret, but I'm pretty darn happy so far.  I think a lot of the Early Access problems have been solved because I don't really have too many complaints.  The game runs fine on a 2 year old rig, the crafting is lots of fun, and the actual gameplay feels fluid and fun.  There is a good amount of tension and the difficulty seems to ratchet up at a steady pace.I feel like the story is an excellent balance between invasiveness and being able to blow it off.  Between the Griffin popping in, and the rifts, they reward you for keeping track of the story without endless cutscenes.Not sure if it's a perfect value at $30, but if you can catch this on any sort of sale you will definitely get your money's worth.

												This game is awesome...magic...spellcrafting...dismemberment...but I will say it was a bit surprising that the synergies were just...mediocre.

												Just finished the game after about 20 hours of play and I can say that I loved it.I thought the story was a bit stale at the start but began to increasingly ramp up in quality and in doing so I grew more invested and actually started caring for one or two characters.I dabbled a little bit in the game mode that is playable after thegame is completed and from what I've seen it looks promising.Spells - They are the gameWhen it comes to the spell crafting system I almost only have positive things to say about it. It is a bit rough to get into without reading about the different stats and such in the journal, which can take some time. But once you get a hang of it, it becomes very enjoyable. You truly feel a sense of achievment when you create a spell that is really strong compared to what you used to have.I've found that mixing and trying other seals out is key to get the most out of the system. (P.S. dont be afraid to unfocus a sigil to lvl up another because once you use them they level up pretty fast)I have yet to try out any of the synergy spells (the spells ranked over legendary rarity) since I have not found any that seems useful to me, so that random part of it can have you waste three legendaries. But at the same time you will drown in legendary spells towards the end.But to conclude, my advice when it comes to the spell system is just experiment and find things out for yourself.Justified price?YesIt is well over 20+ hours of gameplay if you try to explore the entire levels and then add the hours it would take to complete the additional missions recieved after end game, plus playing the opposite gender in your second playthrough just to get some different dialogue and some small changes in story.As you progress through the game you change spells a lot. That in turn makes the gameplay feel fresh and renewed which is sorely needed after having spent a few hours seeing the same visual queues from your spells.Highly recommended! "

												This game has had great potential. Using Magic feels powerfull and fighting enemys is a lot of fun. At least for the first few hours and the game also doesn't look bad,But after 13 hours i had enough.These are the reasons why i can't reecommend this game:-The system for finding Spell Fragments and crafting Spells from it is absolutely obscure and more then badly explained.-The crafting system doesn't really make much sense or at least you can't make much of it because information is obscured by a terribble, fiddly Ai that hides every bit of info, makes it hard to understand what does what, makes it a chore to compare different elements for crafting spells and barely if at all makes it possibble for you to logically follow the process so that you can aim to craft anything specific you want.-The game is SUPER BAD ar explaining everything. For example: after beating the fourth boss i still have no idea what the blue bar under the boss obvvious healthbar actually means or what causes his rising and falling and what that means for me.-A lot of the in itself interesting forms to throw magic around are utterly useless. for example the Lob where you throw a magic projectile in an arc. But you have no real idea where it is gonna land and the rays or better the aimed projectile with a slight homing abbility will ALWAYS be better.-The levels look nice but are empty and liveless. Aditionally they are badly designed. Surfaces that look like you could walk on them are in fact an instant death. Wich makes no sense because you can't juimp nor can you really bosh enemys of ledges so why have it there at all?- Checkpoints are terribble. As mentioned before i more then once died because i tried to avoid enemy attacks onto a surfcae that looked walkable. That often then meant that i had to play the last 20 to 40 minutes of battles again because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoints are so far away from one another. You also can't save anytime and have to rely on those.-You will fight the same enemys again and again and again and again. Repetition is the big word for this game.-Especially Archer, that can hit you instandly and in quick succesion and are going to be the bain of your fun.-Seriosuly, the designers obviously know this too, since Archers are THE ENEMY you are gonna have to fight the most BY FAR. Increased diffculty in battles often means, how many more archers are gonna spawn at the same time?-I mean seriously SERIOSULY. It often feels as if the designers thought: ""Hm that boss isn't challenging enough lets spam Archers with throw down effects so it's a bit more difficult.""All in all, if you can get it for around 5 bucks, sure throw a look at it.But i would not recommend the full price or even half the price.

												Lichdom: Battlemage has a few things going for it, unfortunately those things were soon lost on me during the endless gauntlets that every level is constructed by, containing a seemingly limitless amount of small groups of enemies of which there are way to few variants of.The story starts of fairly well but takes a turn for the generic and never returns to being interesting. There's a few side-characters that serve no purpose at all which ends up being highly irritating after seeing them a few times. All in all it's unfortunately pretty bad.I got the game based on it being very numerical and construction heavy RPG. Being a huge fan of Pathfinder and D&D based RPGs I figured I'd be able to delve in and create varied and extremely potent mages to combat the games challenges. Unfortunately the only numbers involved are in a poorly explained crafting system that in its most basic function allows you to create three types of spells which can be delivered in a few different ways. Had it only been difficult to create optimal spells I would most likely have enjoyed delving into the system and made good use of the mechanics, few though they were but the components you collect get better as the levels go by and thoughtful crafting felt pointless as later components blows your builds out of the water anyway. The levels are pure gauntlets with a few hidden arena-type areas in which you can battle some extra minions to get even more spell-components. You'll be fighting the same enemies over and over and over, and did I mention over again only to end up at a boss-fight that's more likely then not only a slightly harder fight then everything else you've encountered so far. The hardest fights I had during the entire game was when one of the rare mobs mid-lvl randomed a few abilities that made them absolutely dreadful to deal with, mostly because you're more of a glass-cannon then a fighter and when something heavier actually hits you it hurts. These rare-mobs were few and far between and when encountered easily defeated with some wall-ducking (provided you understood their threat-lvl in time).In the end I never tested all the elements the game provided because I had found the triple set that worked well for me, and the resources and time invested in them deterred me from deviating from them. The last few levels I gave up and just ran past everything I didn't need to kill because it felt completely pointless and at least the amount of enemies at my back made getting though locked doors slightly more interesting. I'm not sure for whom this game would be interesting, but it's not something I'd recommend without clear disclaimers.			"

												This game is rather bland and boring.Not very interesting or much to do, just walk around narrow corridor environments that you can't interact with.  And attack the same boring looking enemies over and over again. With a FPS it needs to be interesting moving around the environment, not just having restricted narrow, linear corridors.That would be alright if combat was fun, but it's not. Just hold left mouse button shoot fire at enemy, block with right mouse button, press left mouse button, repeat yawn loudly and fall asleep from how boring and slow it is.The game is like they took the mage element out of Skyrim without anything else, such as fun and variety.There is not enough enemy variety, there are like 3 different eneimes to fight. An undead archer, warrior and leiutenant. And enemies just don't feel like worthy opponants, it doesn't feel exciting to kill them.There's no variety in what you can do in this game, it's very boring, lacking, repetitive and linear with no depth, you can't really explore or see anything interesting. The story was also bland and failed to grab me. And is quite lacking in RPG elements, what RPG there is, is very basic can only choose male or female and can't even edit or choose how your character looks and there are no stats to put any points into or interact with the environment or have indepth conversations with NPC's. You can't grow your character, just choose spells to upgrade and craft and put points in which doesn't seem to improve them much. The crafting system is complex and hard to understand if you're doing it right.I tried to give the game a chance but it does not get any better or interesting or fun.All this game is travelling down narrow coridors and shooting flames at boring enemies.The only things I like is the environments look nice, the voice acting is  good and that you can choose to play as a male or female.No wonder they were giving this away for free, not worth paying for.They had a good idea for a game, it was just poorly executed and did not contain the elements that make a great, fun FPS.A FPS should be fast paced and frantic, not slow in every aspect with a variety of exciting weapons. Spells don't seem  different from each other. Fire giving  the best damage and the rest being simular but weaker and a different colour.I also thought necromancy would be fun, but nope, the summons are incredibly weak and hardly do any damage. I tried different variants of spells, DOT version is horrible, takes way too long to kill anything same with other spells. So you're just stuck with using fire if you don't want to take forever to kill things.I can't reccomend this game, it's just lacking any feeling of fun and excitement.It's major flaw is it's extremely repetitive and linear, combat is boring, feels slow and overall feels like a chore to play.I'd rate it 4/10 bad. It's not even a average game, I find it worse than average. "

												So I got this game when it was back in pre-alpha (i think) when it was 20-30 dollars, and i can confidently say that it has turned out to be a fantastic game with extremly delightful graphics to help with exploding enemies with fireballs and such. I can say that it was worth the amount i got it for, however now that it is up to 40 dollars I only recommend this to people who absalutely adore mages and have a decent income of money. So if you do have the money and the love for mages I do say that you MUST have this game, it is 'Brilliant'. P.S. the crafting system will make sense sooner or later and when it does...the power is yours! XD			"

												The Art of the leveldesign is so gorgeous and the fact that the level are huge, i mean gigantic, makes the detail put everywhere even more impressive. These gigantic levels are filled with checkpoints where you save and respawn and everytime you didnt die and come along the next checkpoint a socalled raritybooster goes up, so all the loot will be better, which makes you want to play as much as possible in onego. But still the actual gameplay is repetitive, becauze you walk around with only 3 spells equiped and always cast them in a combo, 1,2,3...or 3,2,1. for each and every enemie in the game.Thats a little strange becauze the upgradesystem of the spells itself are realy impressive. When you upgrade a spell und have to compare like 10 weird %-based multiplier against eachother.			"

												Many very smart and eloquent people have already brought up the things that make Lichdom a bad game- misleading blurb, repetitive gameplay, clunky crafting, laughable story.  I won't bring all that up again.I WILL, however, say that if you want to make a game about a ""badass, unstoppable mage"", make a game along the lines of Dynasty Warriors.  Hordes of simple little mortals swarming the field, and there's you throwing fire and lightning like an angsty teenager with a flamethrower and a Tesla Coil.Somebody give that a think.			"

I have been playing this for some time now and can easily say that it's an outstanding game, graphics are one of the best, gameplay is crazy, sounds, music background give it atmosphere.   what else do you want?  perfection? i would say that it's not perfect but then again, nothing is.  if you are a gamer and not a wanna be gamer then play this and see if you can hack it.  ladies and germs, i'm old school here and I should know a thing or two.Good work to the team and I hope you come up with other unique games in the future.

Early Access Review
								Hmmm, hmmm where to begin.At first i was extremely sceptical. Into the tutorial already I've encountered bugs - some of them were pretty funny tbh -, voiceacting was not super awesome, quite boring story... but it was one thing for sure: eyegasm.beautiful scenary, even tho the begining made me yawn for 10 minutes straight. But when the real combat started, oh yeah... I wanted a real mage-based game for a long time. The hack and slash of fire, ice, lightning and whatelse you want. Really enjoy the game so far even when i die 10 times in a row at the same spot. :)Whoever out there likes playing a mage, i recon this game is worth it... but whoever wants an RPG, then just flip the page and go to the next one.

												I went into this expecting to feel like, well, a badass battlemage. That definitely didn't happen (insert sad face because I had such high hopes for this game). I went into this thinking I was going to be a badass mage that had a crazy amount of spells (not just 3 different ways to toss like 7 different types of spells at my enemies) with no cooldown on cool spells such as the black hole or fire/ice tornado (but what I got was a build up meter which is basically a cool down just in a roundabout sort of way). And I understand it has to with balance and everything, but if you REALLY wanted to make people feel like a badass battlemage while still offering a good challange as it appeared to be advertised, a better idea would have been to make things like synergy spells your basic form of combat while throwing HUGE hordes of enemies at the player. This game throws maybe 5-10 guys at you at a time and you just pick them off by tossing a fireball or an ice blast at them or whatever in a way too repetitve type of gameplay. TLDR: Do you want to play a game where you actually feel like a badass mage? Skyrim with mods. Cheaper, better story, amazing graphics, much more content, being a mage is only one of the many options you have, and most importantly, you would actually be a badass mage (especially with mods).

												If you were to mix Crysis with Magicka this game would probably be the love child. Which is to say that it is an FPS (First Person Spellcaster) wherein you craft spells and unleash them onto your foes. No mana and no cooldown. The only limiting factor is your preferred strategy; AOE spells take roughly 2 seconds to charge, longer to fully charge (for max damage), while 'targeted' spells are relatively quick to full charge but come with the dilemma of what style of spell to choose (Ray, Lob and Missile). There are Nova spells which are activated either through precise blocking or by charging up a short range blink spell.These make up your basic types of spells, then you attached a 'flavour' (sigil) which is an element type that does different things depending on the element. After that there is a more nuanced system of damage, control and mastery.The long and the short is that the spellcrafting of this game will keep you busy for a long time. Gameplay wise it's almost a corridor shooter, but the arenas in which you fight are often sprawling and allow back tracking - much like other semi open world FPS (like Crysis). Some areas require you to fight in small rooms to open passageways and boss battles will trap you in a much smaller arena, but everything else is expansive.Which brings me to levels, each 'act' is sprawling. Easily 2-3 hours of game play per act. The game maintain a steady tempo of encounter fights which vary in size, but there are very few times in which you will be surprised by the appearance of a new group of enemies. Boss fights vary in quality; some fall prey to being kited, while others suffer pathing problems that can be exploited. The boss battle that throws you into a small arena seems somewhat unfairly balanced against the player, but given the easiness of the first few bosses seems fair.Graphics-wise the game runs on the Crysis engine so things look good, textures vary in quality, but particle effects are gorgeous. Story and voice acting is fantastic with particular care taken with the gorgeous cut scenes. If you are less interested in story the game leaves it open to you as to whether you want to read the journal entries or ignore them. This game is definitely worth your time at full price, and if it goes on sale it's an even more highly recommended buy.			"

												A Buyers Guide to Whether or Not You Should Pickup Lichdom: BattlemageReasons To Buy:-Steam Cards: it has em, we love em-It could be on sale: Any game can be an appealing buy at a 70% off or higher, and discount prices are all anyone should be expected to pay for this-Need a way to blow a few hours and remind you how good the other games you play are: I have never appreciated the quality of other games i play more than I have after this trial.Reasons Not to Buy: *Deep Breath*-If you believed the store page's claims: The selling point ""the first game where the mage is truely badass"" should come with a huge pulsating asterisk next to it. Lichdom's protagonist would be a a badass mage, in any other fantasy game, you know, ones where you have teammates. The game gives you a nice arsenal of defensive abilites, but again, they would all be better in a game where you acted as part fo a group, as a way of fending off a lone foe the tank has yet to take control of, as it stands, if more than one enemy tries to attack you and their swings arn't exactly synced up, wave bye bye to that chunk of health, because most spells don't stun enemies out fo thier attacks and are just sad when defending against anything other than one attacker.-If you have an attention span: Dear god this game is repetative. You cast every spell with the same animations and even the more appealing looking spells get reduced to so manyy boreing lgihts once you have cast it for the 7,000th time. All the enimes are interchangeable, and all the levels are just hallways which are about as interesting to explore as the inside of a toilet paper tube.-If you like playing a mage in fantasy games: For a game world that was designed with the sole intention of being played by a mage, i am baffled by just how poorly optomised it is for that. Every single boss fight leaves me longing for a tank to take the aggro and most of the enemies spread out so far that the AOE spells are useless. You are about as squishy as the mage in any other games, expect unlike other, games like skyrim, you can't aquire any followers to compensate for the feeling that the game hates you for picking the mage class. Against other projectile users it basically becomes any other cover based fps, if you gun had crappy fire rate and no headsot potential.-If you like stories: people just talk at you every so often, it feels like every bit of interesting story is taking place without you, to the point i occasionally wonder why i am even still pressing forward. Even the inital cutscene that introduces the main chracter's motivation was so rushed and blut as to seem comical so don't expect much in the way of imersion.Bottom Line: If you see this on sale consider picking it up for steam cards, if you are interested in that sort of thing, but if not just wait until one of the Elder scrolls games goes on sale instead and just download a bunch of magic combat mods. It will be about the same but with more content and a higher concentration of fun.			"

												Verdict: wait for the sale. Good game, but not worth the full $40.Pros: game looks good and was worth the price of entry. Combat is very fun for a good 10 hours and the spell crafting is neat. Bosses are challenging and fun.Cons: Total amount of spells is less than you hope. I can count the types of enemies on 1 hand. Combat gets repetitive quickly.Lichdom Battlemage was great for the first 10 hours or so. It was fun to level up spell items and find the special challenge areas to get a load of upgrades at once. The challenge of the game steadily progressed and you continue to encounter new enemies. The combat kept changing as you keep finding new elements to play with. Each element seemed to play as damage, support, or passive. The game breaks the spell types into Destruction, Control, and Mastery. Destruction is damage, control is typically a hold with delayed damage, and mastery is a damage multiplier. I honestly never used mastery as I was able to use necromancy as a more consistent source of damage. Taking the time out of you control/damage rotation for mastery buffs that only occur on successful hits seemed pointless to me.Concerning the amount of spells you can use, it really boils down to six types of spells. Primary = missile, grenade, beam. AoE = normal AoE, DoT AoE, and a trap bomb AoE. The shield also counts as a spell and procs a nova when you counter a hit, but.... I never used it as blocking interrupts spell charging. You can proc a nova when you charge a blink, but I always used quick blinks instead of charges. Finally, I never actually finished the game. Towards the end of the game I found myself running through areas because I was tired of using the same spells on the same enemies. In my final 4 hours of game play the only thing that changed was the environment. The enemies were the same, but they just got harder to kill. They also start adding barriers to the area so you are forced to fill enemies. I’d like to see the end of the story, but it’s just too much of a hassle.Overall it was a fun game. I can see a lot of potential and great ideas in here, but there could have been so much more. If this game had double the enemy types and double the spell types I could see myself finishing the game. I just got bored before the end. "

YouTube™ Video: Lichdom Battlemage . . . Control and Mastery demonstration 

			Views: 6,166		

			Most of the spells i use in these sigils are Control and Mastery. The only direct dps i use are the fire nova, fire aoe, and the targeted kinetic.		

I bought this game the day it came out on Steam when it was nay more than a wee tech demo.  And its expanded and grown into something beautiful.  Skilled players can be impressive battle mages, chaining together different spells and effects, blocking with devastating results and teleporting around like a ninjas nightmare.  I am in no way a skilled player, but i fully enjoy creating the nukes that i want to use and then putting them into effect against baddies that provide me a good challenge.  I feel the difficulty is on par with darksouls for me personally, because you learn the pattern and effects and create your spells to counter and persevere against the mobs.  The level design while nice, is no more complex than any other corridor based shooter (so far). Graphics are fantastic, spell effects are not the best ive ever seen, but more than complex enough considering that in most situations there will be so much fire and lightning flying around, you dont really want to overdo it.This is a great game and i look forward to playing more of it soon, and i cant wait to see if they decided to bring this spell system into another project.

												Gameplay / combatLichdom: Battlemage is an action RPG where you control a single character from a first person perspective. You are a badass mage on a personal revenge quest and you've got a wide range of spells to choose from.You've got traditional fireballs and AoEs as well as grenade like ""lobs"" and ""rays"" that are short range constant beams. You don't have any melee weapons but you can block, and if timed correctly, this will trigger a ""nova"" which damages everything in a radius around you. There's also a very useful dodge move. There is no mana limit or cooldowns so you can cast as frequently as you desire.Each of these spell ""shapes"" can be given an element which identifies the basic damage type, but also has unique bonus attributes. For example ice can freeze your enemy, lightning can chain its damage to other nearby enemies, and kinetic can hold an enemy in place. And this is just a small selection - there are several others to choose from. Its kind of like the magic equivalent of Borderlands' guns.Enemies include Human warriors and mages, undead archers and powerful demons. Many of them have access to the same range of spells as the player, as well as special abilities that allow them to shield allies, summon minions, teleport behind you, slow you, freeze you and more.Lichdom is approximately 25 hours long and is heavily focused on combat, but with such a wide variety of spells and enemy types, there's a fantastic tactical depth and I honestly never got bored.Level design is mostly linear, but many of the areas are quite wide so it doesn't feel too restrictive. You have room to approach enemies from different angles and plenty of objects to take cover behind. There aren't any side quests, but there are some hidden areas branching off the main path where you can find challenge rooms - kill multiple waves of enemies to be rewarded with lots of loot in the form of spell crafting components.CraftingYou gain new spells by crafting them. Each spell requires an element and a shape, and these components are rated from ""common"" and ""rare"" to ""epic"" and ""legendary"". More powerful components have bonuses to damage, critical chance, casting speed, etc. Sadly I found the crafting system to be very confusing. Whenever I tried to manually create a new spell, it was always weaker than the one I currently had equipped ... even if I was crafting with top tier components. So after a while I just let the game automatically upgrade my spells when a better version was available.StoryIts not as detailed as most RPGs, and the player doesn't have any control over dialogue, but there are a few interesting characters. I especially liked the interactions between the two heroes, Dragon and Gryphon, and two villains, Hedaro and Hedira. There is some excellent voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect), Troy Baker (Bioshock Infinite), Gina Torres (TV's Firefly) and Jaime Murray (TV's Defiance).TechnicalLichdom uses Cryengine3 so as you can expect, the graphics for environments and spell effects are gorgeous. However, its also quite demanding in terms of PC spec.I'm running an i7 2600K at 3.4 Ghz, 8GB ram and a GTX 770 with 4GB Vram - well above the recommended specs listed on the Steam store page - but I can't maintain a constant 60 FPS on maximum settings (very high) at 1080p. The early areas seem fine, but after a few hours I started to encounter fights with lots of enemies which killed my framerate. I hate screen tearing, but with Vsync on I was getting dropped to 30 FPS.For the last few hours I've dropped everything down to high, and enabled adaptive Vsync in Nvidia control panel. Its still not perfect, but performance has improved, and it still looks pretty good. I'm not saying this as a massive critisism, it hasn't hurt my enjoyment of the game too much, its just really a heads up to expect to have to do some tweaking.I haven't suffered any crashes or noticed any bugs. Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.RecommendationIf you're a massive RPG fan like me, I recommend buying Lichdom at full price. I don't like using numbers to review games, but lets just say the 69% Metacritic average shown on the store page is too low.			"

												Okay, so this game kinda lost me at first. I wanted to make powerful spells but lost interest due to the complicated crafting and not-so-great turtorials. HOWEVER, with the latest patch and the ""Smart Crafting"" system, the game got me again. I think I'm still early on in the game, but i will finish it when I have time.The ""Smart Craft"" is essentially like this. Say you have one spell with A Lob effect, a Trap effect, and your usual Nova. The smart crafting will take what would work best with your current set up and give you the option to upgrade it. It'll even let you know and quickly synthesize your weaker upgrade items into more powerful ones. So basically, pick what effects you want for your spells, then the game will help you pick what's best for it. It's for those who don't wanna use a lot of time on the crafting system.This is especially good for the game since a lot of the bad reviews are because of the crafting system.			"

												This game was meh... It was really pretty and the effects were cool looking, but honestly I was on the fence when I started. I played as the girl until I got to the first part where you can actually select a new spell line, but after another hour I got bored with Necromancy and decided to try something else, was equally disappointed with Lightening on the male as well. I think it mostly comes from the long charge times on spells in general. I understand for a more powerful boom that it takes a few seconds but omg. Even just quick clicking them instead of charging takes forever. A lot of my friends that played said ""it's like a FPS but with magic"", uh, yeah no. I don't remember any gun having several seconds to wait after pulling the trigger for it to actually fire something. This was obviously not the only issue I found with the game, but it was enough to make me stop playing after like an hour each time I tried. Playing the game is pretty easy but holy god the crafting system to upgrade spells. I had to just let the auto upgrades do its thing and just look at the results, if I liked the upgrade I used it, if not I waited until I got something else... if you're going to make a crafting system that almost requires the auto-upgrade system to figure it out, why bother even having it? Even the tutorial hints at ""hey just use the auto crafting, it's easier"".  With all that in mind, when it comes down to it, if a friend asked if they should buy this game, I would likely say no. Glad I got this on sale with a 50% of coupon through Loot Crate else I might be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Still a waste @ $12 IMO. Sorry.			"

												If Serious Sam & an aRPG got frisky in the Magicka Motel, this is the deranged child that would be birthed.  Massive levels with tons of secrets & nooks, spell crafting, leveling and grinding a-plenty, while going through waves of enemies that'll take everything you throw at them.If you find any sort of grind or pattern of 'attack phase/exploration phase/repeat' boring, then you should avoid this.  If you like to get crafty with spell combinations and mercilessly mow throw hundreds of enemies then drop the cash and kill kill kill.  If you're still uncertain, it's on sale often on either Steam or a few other legitimate sites that sell Steam keys to reduce the risk.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage has the makings of a good game, but MMO-style design choices ultimately cripple the experience. For every positive the game has to offer, a negative just drags it back down. I enjoyed the game, but I don't think you will.I love the combat in the game, but the game actively DISCOURAGES experimentation with different sigils, especially on the highest difficulty, where trying a new spell RESETS another spell's progress. Basically, you are forced to use the same three spell types for the entire game, and can only experiment after the final boss is defeated and you can lower the difficulty.The game is also bogged down by a ludricrous MMO grind. In a single player game. And yes, if you want the most powerful spells in the game, the grind is not optional. Think about that. The best part of a single player game is locked behind an MMO grind.The levels in the game are utterly gorgeous, but they drag on for far too long. Enemies are also poorly introduced, and some have special effects that are not explained at all. I still don't know what the Ensconsed effect does, and I probably never will.Ultimately, though, the game just gets repetitive. The storyline is boring, and once you beat it, there is little left to see.			"

  Lichdom: Battlemage review  TL;DR  Lichdom: Battlemage is a game with a good idea but fails to implement it in a good way. Overview  I had high hopes going into the game. I've always liked the idea of mages and being able to combine different spell enchantments to make new spells sounded like a good idea. However after only 10 minutes or so the gameplay starts getting repetetive. The whole game is basically spamming your fireballs untill mobs of enemies dies. The crafting system works fine but different type of spells is clearly better than others so if you don't want it to take forever to kill one out of all the mobs you don't really have a lot of choice, which is a shame because the options itself are fine. The way they punish the players for dying is by making the crafting parts they find not as good as if they didn't die. This makes it so if a player is having a hard time in the game it makes it even harder for them because their spells wont be as strong so it'll just get harder and harder for them as their spells gets underpowered. Pros At first the fighting is fun.Fully voiced characters.Crafting system has a lot of options.The graphics are pretty and the spells are really well animated. Cons Some enemies are really ""bullet spongy""If you experiment with the crafting the game punishes you for it because you don't get good spells and there's no way of trying out spells without crafting them first.The story is not very intresting Final words Even though I really wanted to like the game and be able to recommend it there is just too many flaws in it to be able to recommend it, especially for the price (36,99€ by  the time I write this review). If it goes on sale consider picking it up as you might have some fun.			"

												This game is pretty good. Not the best, but for the money you pay, it delivers on everything. I personally only have a few issues with it that I'd like to see addressed in an expansion or sequel, but other than that it's pretty good.The spell variety is there, not much really needs to be added. You have Fire, Ice, Lightning for the basics, and then get to use stuff like Corruption and Necromancy later on just to name a few. The combinations of spells you can make though only varies from missile attacks, lobbed grenades, rain attacks, pools, traps, and some wierd blink mechanics. Not too varied IMO but each of those basic categories can be changed around to do three (3) different effects based on the core spell you chose. For instance: Shoot a fireball that only does a damage over time effect, drop a pool that teleports people that walk through it, lob a grenade that levitates people, etc. Pretty nifty.What I'd like to see in the future (should there be one) is a few more additional core spell groups, and more dynamic attack styles. Lightning for instance operated just like everything else until you got the special effect to trigger from the mastery buff, in which case it was actual lightning and not just a ball of energy. Why not some powers that fork upon hitting an enemy? Cluster bomb style lob attacks? Clouds that shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥at people? Walls, barriers and personal shields? The list can literally go on and on, and while some of these effects are in the game, they are actually so rare in occurance that focusing on those core spells because you like those effects actually hurts your ability to progress.More enemy variety needs to happen. As much as I enjoyed fighting Undead, Demons and Cultists, there really needs to be more than just those three things in the game.Character customization for any possible future game or content.Co-op play would be great as well with as hard as the game is.

												Beautiful graphics, the environment looks like art, no visible polygons, stunning. If you've ever enjoyed playing a mage but wished you could customize the spells, this game is for you. Paid full price and worth it. I was in one of those ""all my games are boring and everything sucks"" moods yesterday, bought this game, now I'm having fun again.			"

												I cautiously recommend this. Let's do a small breakdown as to why:The goodIn short, it's a linear FPS (First Person Spellcaster :-P) with a lot of neat mechanics and insane, yet rewarding crafting system and it is fairly well executed and polished up. So far so good. If you play your cards right and learn the crafting system, you have the very real possibility of becoming a skeleton-summonning necromancer who drops meteors on the heads of his enemies, infects opponents with swarms of insects, debilitates them into fear and betraying their comrades, teleports them around the battlefield and manipulates time itself. But all of this takes time and a lot of mastery over the game's mechanics. Now I'll delve into the complexities of how does it work and why do I like it...The game technically delivers on what it promises. You do have a bazillion of spell combinations, sort of like you have a bazillion of guns in Borderlands 2 or bazillion of distinct items in Diablo, but let's look at facts - there's 3 basic elements, being Fire, Ice, Lightning, Corruption, Kinesis, Delirium, Necromancy and Phase, there's a bunch of patterns in which you can cast said elements such as guided missiles, continuous beam, curved lob and various kinds of area of effect patterns, and lastly, there's three kinds of modifiers - Destruction, Control and Mastery.Now, the incredible variability of the game's magic comes from the fact that every one of the 8 basic elements gets a distinctly different effect based on which one of the three modifiers you use. The differences vary quite wildly, so let's take Corruption and Fire here - When you combine corruption and mastery, your corruption spell infects an enemy (or a group of enemies) with a blister which slowly grows and matures, and if you kill an enemy after it manages to mature, a swarm of flies will emerge from the dead opponent and start to seek and attack other enemies on the field. If you use mastery, however, the blister spawns a nest upon maturing, which orbits around you and infects enemies with insects that then increase your damage output done to them. Fire, on the other hand, just deals damage over time with control and stores its damage to be released later with mastery, IIRC. You can see some common patterns - destruction increases direct damage done, control causes some indirect effect and mastery debuffs enemies and increases damage done to them later down the line.And then, when you master the crafting system, you'll find that there are also synergies between the individual elements, which will allow you to do things such as summonning suicidal, burning corpses, conjure a small black hole and so on and so forth (hint: You can get these by upgrading a legendary trough synthesis screen)Now, it took me some time to get used to all of these various systems as these are the most important and unique part of the game, and for some time, I couldn't quite decide whether or not I like them. See, for an action game, Lichdom is an extremely slow burner and it'll take you several hours to get to the actually awesome bits, and it really takes a lot of getting used to. But after you do, it's a blast - discovering various new ways how different spells can synergize with each other, creating different patterns and seeing how it can affect your playstyle, it's just really cool, but it does require player to actually put in the effort and experiment - if you choose to remain stuck with basic three elements, which you can and nobody is stopping you, I can see the game getting very old, very fast. Oh right, three elements thing - at any given point in time, you can only have three elements equipped, where each element contains three spells - single-target, AoE and block/blink spell. That's 9 spells equpped at any given time, with some having similar roles.Of course, then there's the actual casting of spells itself. You're a glass canon, so you have to be very mobile (depending on the sort of shield you have equipped) and while there are no limitations on casting, casting a spell properly can take up to 2 seconds - doesn't seem long, but it does serve to change your traditional twitch gameplay style into something much slower and deliberate, which isn't something I've really seen in any other First Person action game, not to this extent anyway.There are other good bits worth mentioning - graphics and aesthetic design are fantastic, post-release support is absolutely stellar and murdering stuff does actually feel very good, but none of that is quite as unique as the core mechanic of the spellcasting itself, why is why the game has earned my recommendation. However...The badRight, here comes the biggest flaw the game has, and I feel it's gonna be a dealbreaker for some - and that is enemy variety. There are ranged dudes, meele dudes, dudes spawning other dudes and dudes who are casters, but are actually just a more difficult kind of ranged dudes. They come in unded and living variety, but you hardly ever notice what it is exactly you're fighting, unless it's a boss or a miniboss. I would have definitely liked to see more distinct enemy types, which would ideally force me into switching my sigils around to see if I can get more effective against them.Then there are the 'powerful' enemies - I don't have issues with those per se, I have actually enjoyed the major boss fights the game throws at you, it's the randomly generated mini-bosses I hate. Sometimes, and note it doesn't really happen that often, sometimes the game just generates boss abilities which lead to extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, where the enemy one-shots you without you being capable of doing all that much about it. Thankfully, this does not happen all too often.And lastly, there's linearity. Aside from an occassional side-dungeon here and there, and a few quite open maps, the game is extremely linear, with slightly more open arenas for larger battles. There is some exploration involved, but not quite enough.JudgementThe game is extremely ambitions, but flawed. I'd suggest getting it on the sale, unless you want to support the dev who's extremely generous with functional updates. All in all, have enjoyed the time I have spent with it, and I would recommend it.			"

												This game has potential, for your first game it isn't bad... it isn't great but it isn't bad either.  There are some serious flaws in the game which prevent me from recommending the game.  If the rating system was 1 - 10 stars I would give you a 6, just above ok.The graphics are top notch, the animations are good, the music is great.  Those are probably the best things about this game.  But it isn't enough, the combat is repetitive and after a while just got plain boring.  The storyline really didn't flow and in the end I felt I was just clearing the map and getting to the end.  The loot system and crafting system are bland and tedious.  I need a reason to look forward to keep killing, after I was done with the story I didn't think ""Oh boy, now I can clear out some areas and maybe find some cool loot"".  I felt more relieved that I was done.  The levels are just way to long, and it was the same mobs over and over again.  Heck I couldn't bring myself to do the portals at the end.Also I would like to repeat what others have said, I did not feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage.  If you had made it where we could clear out masses of mobs with a spell, maybe less small groups of high health mobs and lots of groups of low health mobs and spells where we could clear them out in a specactular display of gore and blood... that might have been something.You have a good start, and I hope you can clean up and make the next game fun... but I can't recommend this game, I just didn't enjoy it enough.

												Hmmm, not bad. Not ground-breakingly good either. But it's not bad.The best way to imagine this game is to take a typical FPS, but instead of armor and weapons, you use perfectly timed shields or short 0.5meter teleports to evade, and spells for weapons. As for the weapons, you get the basic item called a Sigil, and you craft a spell from it adding all kinds of characteristics to it and such. Suppose your spell is Fire, Ice, Lightning, Necromancy. Then you decide whether it is a projectile (homing or artillery), contnuous ray, or area of effect, etc.That, and it is linear. Sooooo linear.Get it at a discount. Worth it at a discount.UPDATE: I am finding myself using the Lob characteristic for my spells. The Ray and Missile characteristic is weak and seems pointless. The thing is, the Lob characteristic is the same for all spells. You ""lob"" the ""magic"" at your enemies (fire, ice, lightning, necromancy, etc), and when it hits, it explodes into tinier lob balls.The Ray is the same for all spells. And the Missile is the same for all spells as well. There really isn't any real variety to the magics.UPDATE (Dec12,2014): After 30 hours of gameplay, this game DOES make you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥Battlemage. Like, ""You wanna piece of me? Well I want a million pieces of you, ya little prick!"" ""Oh, what's that? You a big scary demon? I'll send you to the Abyss!"" ""I'LL BURN AND FREEZE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!!!"" ""Let's see you get resurrected after the Nothingness eats you, you incestous narcissist!""Yeah! I just wish Quick Blinking was quicker and covered more distance as you upgrade your shields. That, and Charged Blinking was also quicker.			"

												If you're on the fence about buying the game and it's on sale, go for it. You'll get a good picture of the game in the first hour or two and if you're not happy you can still refund it.My feelings overall are somewhat mixed, it's not a great game but it isn't bad. It took about 13 hours to complete with some rushing towards the end. It takes so long to complete because of all the long fights. You run to a trigger, it spawns 3-6 dudes, you kill them and it spawns 3-6 new dudes to kill and this is repeated over and over again throughout the game. I wish they would have made a lot larger, crowded fights so you could use all AoE spells.Combat gets repetitive; everything starts to feel very bullet-spongy even when using mastery spells to amplify the damage. The magic system is cool but the augments really just took too long to combine and tinker with that I wish they were removed or replaced.The ""hit detection"" also felt very off. Monsters would swing and hit me mid swing. Ranged monsters also had incredible accuracy and fast projectiles which made it hard to avoid and next to impossible to galvanize block.Even with all the negatives the game is pretty good. It's beautiful to look at and the spells feel very powerful. The story isn't amazing but it was good enough to drive me forward.			"

								Even though I have only played this game for a little, it is still amazing.  I am a player who tends to play as the mage and it is always a pain trying to level and keep your mana up etc etc.  Right from the start of Lichdom, you are a battlemage badass.  For an alpha it looks amazing and I cannot wait for launch.  My only problem is the crafting.  It can be confusing and I feel it is not explained well enough.  Other than that it is fantastic.  Of course you can except to run into a few bugs ( Lips not sync/moving, texture pops, etc.) but for the alpha and $25 it is totally worth.  Get it!!!			"

Lichdom not only makes the mage ""viable"", but also incredibly powerful and fun. The ability to cast as much as you want whenever you want, with no mana or spell CDs, is quite thrilling. The level already look gorgeous and the game is only in Alpha. Highly recommend.			"

												Excellent gameplay and graphics are at a level rarely seen in indie titles.  Game is a little tough but enjoyable.  Intricate spell crafting system.  One of the early release purchases I've made that hasn't dissapointed.Update after Early Access:  Game now has difficulty slider, and has a simple interface and kind of an automatic spell updating system that makes the updating of spells much easier for those who found all the crafting and updating difficult.  This mode may also be disabled for those who are use to original mode.  Still a very good game.I run this on a i5 2500 Sapphire HD 7950 at 1080p with everything maxed and get a constant 60 FPS.  Do not listen to those who say game has poor performance.			"

Early Access Review
								How can we start, First I started playing at the end of Alpha and played through Beta,First thing to note this is alpha/beta, it is not even close to being the full game. From what I can tell it drops you after half way/ 3rd Boss in the game, before you kill a man named Shax and then sends you into the continuation portion of the game, that is very similar to Hellgate London's style of multiple portals you can enter and try your hand at objectives to strengthen your spells by gaining chances at loot or spells.Graphics = 10/10 This game runs higher resolution texture packs and looks amazing, physics effects are blended well, Character models are amazing. Side note - Glitches, TressFX hair anomilies, wierd spectral blue emination from ghosts and spectral beings, sleeve physics & character model clipping. None of these are a big deal as they know and have stated they will be taken care of for official release. No FPS issues, a few instances of frame timing issues that cause a stutter effect, folks this is an AMD optimized game and I am runnning NVidia(EVGA 760 SC ACX 4GB) and even unoptimized it doesn't make a dent at max settings 1080p Tress FX on, typically it stays completely even in the most complex scenes between 50-60 np with little variance. My complements to the team on this.Sound = 10/10 Environmental, music and ambient are well put together, fit very well and although they aren't completely distinguishable in their own right, they don't come off as sub standard either. This game could only really use a  catchy unforgetable symphony piece to amend that. Voice acting is done well enough with a dash of humor that you will find it funny but overall the submersion of the reality is never broken making the game come off as one big joke (Diablo 3 - I am looking at you, slapstick misplaced humor doesn't belong in a dark atmosphere) and the dread of the situation isn't lost. The bad guys can be a little over the top with banter especially the Evil tropes when thrown around are pretty well done, and don't feel misplaced.Story = ?/10 simply put so far its great, not mind shattering, but its a well piece of fantasy fiction well thought out and conveyed in a decent way. Until it is fully released we will not have a full story and as I have a few guesses where it may lead with a twist here and there honestly its done so far in a way I can't really see what is coming next(Diablo 3 Im really looking at you if within the first 30 mins I can guess the entire plot and story you need better writers) as there is subtle hints that the story can turn multiple directions. If anything its a little confusing but extremely fun moving forward to find out what is happening and putting the pieces together of several mysteries. RPG Mechanics = 7/10 I am being harsh because I am a huge RPG fan and customization is king for me, making a character my own and different from everyone elses is what matters to me. There is no way to choose how you look or to visually distinguish yourself other than a Male/Female Variant(-3). There is no Gear aka Weapons and Armour to either alter your appearance or any statistics on your character that can differentiate yourself by leveling up your character in any way in which you have choice in how the character is built as you progress through the story(-5), yep they are at -1 already on this, so how can I give it a 7/10 well they get 8 points by impressing me with itemization of sigils/spells and their components, the ways the spells are put together and the multiple options you have make for a never ending funfest, this is the type of game you can argue with 5 other people about your sigils/spell combinations the way you have them set up and the way you utilize them, truth none of you are right or wrong and you can pick and dissect and discuss to your hearts content, there is no I win button really but instead you are an overpowered castor with every I win they can give you. Sigils are limited right now, but they assure more is on the way, so no complaints here on that measure. Even then the customization with random lot patterns make for an unlimited possibilities , on top of that they have something similar to Baddass token in Borderlands for each sigil spell combo that is awarded when completing a required leveling task. Congrats the RPG isn't dead in fact I think we are heading for a new golden age.Action Mechanics = 6/10 Jump is replaced by a teleporting dodge in this game aka Blink, and it is your friend as you will eventially set the character up for a blink kite or a galvanizing tank sort of style, The spells have a feeling and weight to them that feels satisfying however the downside to combat is that its a little repetative, well no more than an Elder Scrolls game can be, a great impovement though for an FPS castor TBH. You have 3 spell types, Targeting(ray, lobbed grenade, missile), AOE( set trap or area of effect), Ward ( damage effect for a timed block of sorts) and a Shield , each RPG augmentation changes the Action of the game completely with synergies that give amazing effects giving weight to you are a badass mage. with 7 Sigils/Elements that play differently and effect the action themselves as well as the pacing of combat. Other thoughts =  This is well worth the purchase price, there is no multiplayer although they have stated it would because they would need to sacrifice way 2 much of the vision of the game to make it happen. That doesn't however mean its completely out of the picture either as stated by them, perhaps a standalone expansion focused on an arena of sorts where multiple players can take on waves of enemies and bosses would be a likely choice for an implementation without giving up anything on the main game itself, that would be my suggestion anyways. In the future I would like to see more sigils added to broaden the field of RPG aspect. Also to the developers and players they don't hold your hand in this game the tutorial is ok and gets the point across, but as for an explanation of how spells work, patterns, augments, and synthesis can and should be explained a bit better from what they currently are, a game needs to be challenging and have some exploration buyt in this case its vital information that can fustrate players when they realize they missed something important. Overall Good Job Xaviant I lok forward to release and to your future games I really think you created a special IP that in the future could expand in so many ways, just plz remember something that so many RPG studios have forgotten, RPGs are meant to be complicated beasts with extreme amounts of options and customization, streamlining and simplifing is never an answer, or a good choice.

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on July 1, and have been able to log about 9 hours of play time so far.  My first impression was a bit scary because as soon as the game launched for the first time, the screen went black and sat there for about 2 minutes, then my PC went into a loop between loading the first production splash screen in a window frame, and then back to a black full screen.  It did this for about 5 minutes and I couldn't even get to task manager long enough to kill the program.  Eventually I managed to time an ALT+F4 correctly and the program closed.  Given this is an ALPHA release, I figured that maybe it was just a resolution detection issue, so I gave it another try.This time the game loaded, but it took a couple of minutes to get to the load screen, whose resolution was at 1024x768.  Given that I'm running a GeForce 770GTX I poked around in the options and set it to 1980x1024 with everything at the maximum available settings.  Not all options were actionable, but again I suspect this is due to ALPHA status.  The graphics are beautiful on this game, and for me, the framerate hasn't dropped for even a moment thus far.As for the gameplay itself, I found the first few minutes of gameplay to be lackluster because I was really expecting some sort of tips on how to move, and what the various keyboard keys do.  I had seen in videos that (i) was inventory so I pressed it and nothing happened.  Upon examination of the key mappings, I found that the (j) key is journal, and spacebar was blink. I found that the journal and inventory (crafting) panel don't unlock until a little later in the game.  The intro is hand drawn sketches, that I suspect will be a cutscene animation at release.  I'm hoping that at some point they make the NPCs mouths move during voice-over events.  Presently the character models just stand there closed-mouthed while the voice-over audio is playing.  Again, this is ALPHA, so I am just hoping they are working on this immersion breaking aspect of the game.After I reached the point where the blink ability tutorial popped up, I thought something was broken with my spacebar or the game itself because the 'charged' blink wouldn't work.  It wasn't until much later that I discovered (via experimentation) that the default unattuned defensive sigil disables charged blinking.  When you create a new defensive spell, you can create one that either disables quick blink or charged blink, or galvanize... or at least that's what I've found thus far.  Fortunately, the charged blink isn't really needed until you reach a canyon with a chest on the other side of a broken bridge in the underground cavern.The crafting system is very cool, and I suspect that with the right spell components, you will be able to customize your spells to your own play-style.  For me, this is a tremendous feature because I might like to go a different route from the norm.  So far, I've been greatly enjoying the use of mind controlling a monster, debuffing the enemies and letting the pet go to work on them.  I love the AOE Lightning with a 7 second stun that adds 'stored' damage upon critical, combined with a targeted chain (arc) lightning spell is incredibly powerful, but can be the death of you if you aren't playing strategically.  The AOE I created gives the enemy haste when the stun wears off, but it is worth it, usually.I love that you don't have to just blow things up if you don't want to.  There are so many ways that you can progress through this game that I cannot wait to unlock the next tier of spells.  If you enjoy a challenging linear progression across a map (with the occasional excursion to optional areas), and releasing mayhem upon your foes, then this game is definitely worth a look.			"

												The Good-You are unshackled from mana bars and cooldowns, able to unleash torrents of shiny, shiny murder.-Enemies are more varried than I first thought and have enough difference in their abilities to keep you on your toes.-The crafting system is engaging and sigils are varried enough to allow for a surprisingly deep level of options. Dunno if it meets the ""thousands of spells"" mentioned in the store page, but it's enough that you can have fun tinkering around.-Several playstyles are viable: blink around unleashing quick-firing missiles? Stand still and parry your opponents then counter-attacks with devastating novas? Cause a chain reaction of exploding parasites that lay waste to a room? All possible.-Environments are very nice-looking and, while linear, are varried and have enough crannies to allow for some minor exploration.-The journal is very informative and can answer most questions easily.-The voice acting is quite good and the banter between you and your partner, plus the little 'echoes of the past' you can watch, are nice breaks in the murder.The Bad-The tutorials are terrible. The journal is a godsend due to this, but still.-No difficulty settings, but fortunately it's not, say, Dark Souls difficult. Best comparison might be to Expert on skyrim?-The crafting menu is very intimidating when you first open it and a lot of the stats on sigils aren't explained. It's all much simpler than it looks, fortunately, but the first impression can be a hurdle.Summary: A solid and fun, if bumpy-starting game that lets you unleash your inner magical murder machine. Best enjoyed an hour or two at a time.			"

Early Access Review
								Imagine being thrown into an endless arena and repeatedly flinging spells at enemies so you can watch them die in entertaining ways and constantly coming up with more efficient and/or entertaining deadly combinations?If this premise sounds like fun to you then Lichdom can provide endless hours of grinding enemies into the next generation of spells that would become much worse for the next enemy you'll meet because in Lichdom you're only as great as the spells you create.Sure, the story can be interesting and the voice-casting is excellent but the main draw is being a Battle Mage and being able to take on multiple enemies who would kill you if you gave them the chance! The more you play, the more powerful you become and that's a great promise for any RPG to deliver on.It's also refreshing to see a game that doesn't make melee combat be the focal point of damage while Casters must cower in the back row and fling a Fireball every once in a while! The game looks amazing and the ownership of every death you plan for each enemy feels great and keeps me coming back for more. The spell-crafting feels empowering and it's difficult not to feel smart the first time you use a new spell you just crafted into that new Sigil you've just unlocked.I recommend this game if you can get it for the $20 price-tag it originally had but I whole-heartedly hope the story/plot and other aspects would prove the game worthy at the $40 price tag post-launch.

								Updated: 23-07-2-14 (beta update)here is an update as to my findings of the beta until now!+- Ui looks better (health bar, fast travel station, sigil selection at equip screen.- The reforge and synthesize upgrade are a good improvement.- Casted spells look more realistic.Improvements- Maybe a targeting cursor so i can see where i am casting my spells?- Maybe a double tap movement for sprinting?- Maybe a higher rare loot multiplier (to my findings didnt go above 5)- Maybe that once crafted spells can also be upgraded by the synthesize upgrade (and not only the   ""ingredients"" for the upgrade)Question- will there be permanent health upgrades like longer health bars or 4 or max 5 health bars instead of   3? (besides the shield/barrier health upgrades i mean)So these are my findings until now! Hope to update more later on.Please dont bash, just trying to help improve the game!			"

												Excellent gameplay and graphics are at a level rarely seen in indie titles.  Game is a little tough but enjoyable.  Intricate spell crafting system.  One of the early release purchases I've made that hasn't dissapointed.Update after Early Access:  Game now has difficulty slider, and has a simple interface and kind of an automatic spell updating system that makes the updating of spells much easier for those who found all the crafting and updating difficult.  This mode may also be disabled for those who are use to original mode.  Still a very good game.I run this on a i5 2500 Sapphire HD 7950 at 1080p with everything maxed and get a constant 60 FPS.  Do not listen to those who say game has poor performance.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is one of those games that pulls you in with enticing screenshots and explosive trailers that showcase its frantic violence, but turns out to be a crushing disappointment and an empty promise of what could have been. Any potential is trampled by the mind-numbingly tedious gameplay, levels that drag on for far too long and the supposed crown jewel; an underwhelming and prosaic spell system. You will engage in fights that are challenging and enjoyable; however, these are few and far between, and as you progress further into the game you feel less and less powerful as enemy encounters take an increasingly absurd amount of time to grind through. The visuals are gorgeous, particularly those of the landscapes and spells, not surprising given the engine it was created with.The search for playing as a truly unstoppable killing machine of a mage continues, as this does not provide it.4/10			"

												After playing this game several hours, I can say for a discounted price it's quite worth it. Don't expect too much from it though.The centre of the gameplay is crafting. You find tons of parts to craft your spells. You first start off with just 1 spell-""element"" and gain another with each level you finish. By using them you can level them up and choose between 3 things to upgrade which are damage, critical chance and critical effect.The whole crafting thing is pretty much too complex to explain in detail here. With wrong crafted spells, bosses can become hard in a dark souls kind of way. With well crafted spells you might be able to kill them in under 2 minutes.The fun really lies in discovering what spells you can create for your special needs.Basically there are 3 type of spells you can cast. One of which is a offensive ball or ray. there are different types of those too. The other one is an AOE which can have many different effects and a shield (which I barely use ever so it's pretty useless to me).The story doesn't really get rolling and isn't that exciting. The levels - although not open world but very linear - are beautifully crafted thanks to the Cryengine 3. Enemies spawn every few meters and you gotta defeat them. New enemies are introduced only about every level and there is much re-use in enemies. For less than 10€ I'd still recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								How can we start, First I started playing at the end of Alpha and played through Beta,First thing to note this is alpha/beta, it is not even close to being the full game. From what I can tell it drops you after half way/ 3rd Boss in the game, before you kill a man named Shax and then sends you into the continuation portion of the game, that is very similar to Hellgate London's style of multiple portals you can enter and try your hand at objectives to strengthen your spells by gaining chances at loot or spells.Graphics = 10/10 This game runs higher resolution texture packs and looks amazing, physics effects are blended well, Character models are amazing. Side note - Glitches, TressFX hair anomilies, wierd spectral blue emination from ghosts and spectral beings, sleeve physics & character model clipping. None of these are a big deal as they know and have stated they will be taken care of for official release. No FPS issues, a few instances of frame timing issues that cause a stutter effect, folks this is an AMD optimized game and I am runnning NVidia(EVGA 760 SC ACX 4GB) and even unoptimized it doesn't make a dent at max settings 1080p Tress FX on, typically it stays completely even in the most complex scenes between 50-60 np with little variance. My complements to the team on this.Sound = 10/10 Environmental, music and ambient are well put together, fit very well and although they aren't completely distinguishable in their own right, they don't come off as sub standard either. This game could only really use a  catchy unforgetable symphony piece to amend that. Voice acting is done well enough with a dash of humor that you will find it funny but overall the submersion of the reality is never broken making the game come off as one big joke (Diablo 3 - I am looking at you, slapstick misplaced humor doesn't belong in a dark atmosphere) and the dread of the situation isn't lost. The bad guys can be a little over the top with banter especially the Evil tropes when thrown around are pretty well done, and don't feel misplaced.Story = ?/10 simply put so far its great, not mind shattering, but its a well piece of fantasy fiction well thought out and conveyed in a decent way. Until it is fully released we will not have a full story and as I have a few guesses where it may lead with a twist here and there honestly its done so far in a way I can't really see what is coming next(Diablo 3 Im really looking at you if within the first 30 mins I can guess the entire plot and story you need better writers) as there is subtle hints that the story can turn multiple directions. If anything its a little confusing but extremely fun moving forward to find out what is happening and putting the pieces together of several mysteries. RPG Mechanics = 7/10 I am being harsh because I am a huge RPG fan and customization is king for me, making a character my own and different from everyone elses is what matters to me. There is no way to choose how you look or to visually distinguish yourself other than a Male/Female Variant(-3). There is no Gear aka Weapons and Armour to either alter your appearance or any statistics on your character that can differentiate yourself by leveling up your character in any way in which you have choice in how the character is built as you progress through the story(-5), yep they are at -1 already on this, so how can I give it a 7/10 well they get 8 points by impressing me with itemization of sigils/spells and their components, the ways the spells are put together and the multiple options you have make for a never ending funfest, this is the type of game you can argue with 5 other people about your sigils/spell combinations the way you have them set up and the way you utilize them, truth none of you are right or wrong and you can pick and dissect and discuss to your hearts content, there is no I win button really but instead you are an overpowered castor with every I win they can give you. Sigils are limited right now, but they assure more is on the way, so no complaints here on that measure. Even then the customization with random lot patterns make for an unlimited possibilities , on top of that they have something similar to Baddass token in Borderlands for each sigil spell combo that is awarded when completing a required leveling task. Congrats the RPG isn't dead in fact I think we are heading for a new golden age.Action Mechanics = 6/10 Jump is replaced by a teleporting dodge in this game aka Blink, and it is your friend as you will eventially set the character up for a blink kite or a galvanizing tank sort of style, The spells have a feeling and weight to them that feels satisfying however the downside to combat is that its a little repetative, well no more than an Elder Scrolls game can be, a great impovement though for an FPS castor TBH. You have 3 spell types, Targeting(ray, lobbed grenade, missile), AOE( set trap or area of effect), Ward ( damage effect for a timed block of sorts) and a Shield , each RPG augmentation changes the Action of the game completely with synergies that give amazing effects giving weight to you are a badass mage. with 7 Sigils/Elements that play differently and effect the action themselves as well as the pacing of combat. Other thoughts =  This is well worth the purchase price, there is no multiplayer although they have stated it would because they would need to sacrifice way 2 much of the vision of the game to make it happen. That doesn't however mean its completely out of the picture either as stated by them, perhaps a standalone expansion focused on an arena of sorts where multiple players can take on waves of enemies and bosses would be a likely choice for an implementation without giving up anything on the main game itself, that would be my suggestion anyways. In the future I would like to see more sigils added to broaden the field of RPG aspect. Also to the developers and players they don't hold your hand in this game the tutorial is ok and gets the point across, but as for an explanation of how spells work, patterns, augments, and synthesis can and should be explained a bit better from what they currently are, a game needs to be challenging and have some exploration buyt in this case its vital information that can fustrate players when they realize they missed something important. Overall Good Job Xaviant I lok forward to release and to your future games I really think you created a special IP that in the future could expand in so many ways, just plz remember something that so many RPG studios have forgotten, RPGs are meant to be complicated beasts with extreme amounts of options and customization, streamlining and simplifing is never an answer, or a good choice.

												Oh boy I gathered my toughts about this game for quite a long time. I simply couldn't decide is it worth recomending...Sigils:A good variety of sigils but still most of them works the same way (in destruction) as debuffs well we have a good variety but still AOE spells ICE/Kinesis/Phase anchor the enemies more or like the same...I hardly can put Kinesis as a spell so I find it a bit hard to place in Battlemage role... It would be better to have Air based sigil instead of kinesis but thats just my opinion. Necromancy... I got a love hate relationship with this one... (spoiler) we fight undeads by creating more undeads well fight poison with poison but still somehow wrong... Summoning system is well executed you need to mark enemy and after You kill it you will get an undead.Rest of the sigils did its work for me. Specialls were good just trigering them takes more work than effect...Overall - YES it was good - still could be betterSpell crafting: Its a nice thing to have smart inventory and custom you cook your spells as you want. All options with crafting are good. I wanted more AOE effects and more targeted effects. Elemental summons would be nice to have not only as synergy type... thing is with one type of sigil and one type of spell you can actually beat the game so it is a bit linear... System itself is ok but it needs expansion. My expectations were much bigger... overall- NO needs expansion...Shields: 3 types and they work ok. Idea with shields is a good one - YES for mePlot: (spoiler)As we play plot seems to be ok. We wanted mostly to kick♥♥♥♥♥with magic so who needs a plot? :D We have a vengance thirst for power, undeads, we meet a friend the friend gets killed and we need more vengance... In the end I think creators dimply run out of ideas how to end plot line... its really linear and borring and incomplete...Plot overall - NO it sucked...Graphics and animation - looks good all flows in nice colors and animation - YES it is goodBoss fights: Some minor bosses were worse than the main ones... I had my time YES it was funSecrets and specials: not so secret and not so special anyone with a sharp eye can get it all... NOFight in general: As I was closing to endgame I was begging for it to end... After some time it gets boring - It needed a bit more of variety.. But bashing the sh*t out of my foes still was fun - so lets say YES :DI recomend this game but ONLY on some good sales its not worth its basic price... If you buy it just to mash the undeads and other minions demons etc it will do its work. "

												I find myself having mixed feelings about this game.In short, it's a flawed action game that is still worth your time nonetheless; It's got beautiful particle effects, but the environments are bland. The spell crafting system is interesting and offers you to play it the way you want, but the menus make it a little confusing. The story lacks development when it comes to the world you're in outside of the magical elements, but the dialogue has this campy feel I enjoy. I don't recommend it at the $40 price tag, however, as I'm writing this, it is 3 dollars in a bundle on Bundle Stars. This is not shilling or anything, but at 3 dollars, I'm glad I got to try it.EDIT: Obviously, the deal on BundleStars is over, so wait for it to be ~15 bucks on a steam sale.			"

												Final Review Update:Who the hell rated this game 10/10 in the trailer and all those comments praising how great the game is? This game is at most a 5/10 for a $40 game.   So what if the game has pretty good graphics? Whats most important is the gameplay. And how does it scale up? The story is boring and I couldn't give 2 sh*t about the characters in the game. They have zero worthwhile character development that gets me to care about anyone. Also the gameplay/enemy type is too repetitive. The same f*cking pattern over and over again. Reach an open area, a couple skeletions pops out and you just spam your spells until they die, rinse and repeat with other mobs. Bosses are just damage sponge, just dodge a few heavy blows and  spam your spells away. Uhhhrgh, i wish i could take this game and some others off my game library, it doesn't deserve to be in there with the other great games. Full Game Release Update:This game does not live up to its hype or concept. Limitations to the doge have been made. You are no longer a badass mage like the game was first advertised. The Alpha was a lot more fun then the official release. The game is boring now. It makes having tons of spells pointless as they are all pretty much the same and you choose based on your prefered elemental effects. This game isn't worth the $40 bucks. Wait till its on 75% sale then consider getting it. Its so unfortunate that it didn't turned out the way it could've been. The game isn't terrible but not good at the same time. Its just plain and boring at times. I couldn't even be bothered to complete this game becuase of how dull its become. 17th June 2014 Alpha Update:Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥has the game been improved! The graphics are so much smoother and better then before. The load time is still a bit long but thats fine. The new updates added effects animation to your hand so now the game feels more personal as you seen your hand burn up/freeze up with your skin cracking as you cast a spell. The story has been improved tremendously, no longer are you some wasted drunk dude that a mage just picked up from the bar, but rather a pretty interesting back story with a f**king scumbag douch wanna choke him to death nemesis. The beginning of the game sets you in the mood for revenge as you see a rich control freak/cultist ruins your life over some small matter. You can now fast travel so that means its a semi open world game. The scenery is beautiful and damn does the spells look better with each update. This game looks like it will be around $40-$60 at release so i recommend you guys to grab a copy while its still cheap. This game is definitely heading the right direction and the developers deserves a huge round of applause. The other improvement i wish to see within the next few updates are reduced load time and add epic soundtrack!!! This game needs really epic and heroic choirs or chants while you do battle. The bosses are DAMN GOOD LOOKING!!!! If looks could kill, then its definitely the case here in lichdom battlemage. I will update this review again when the next major update comes out. 10th May 2014 Update:The gameplay is much smoother compared to the previous update. I only encounter 2 glitches so far. The one thing that has gotten worse is the loading time. It took 79 seconds to load the menu screen and 64 seconds to load the game (yes i timed it with my stopwatch on iphone). The loading time has always been pretty long, but after this update, it just gotten longer. This is my just my personal experience. Other than that, since i have not finished the game, I can't give my opinion about the story or boss fights. I only had 1 boss fight so far and it was kinda anti-climatic. All you need to do was run and ""gun"" which in this case is run and spam your spells. And what happened to the girl that was with you before the boss fight? It would've been better if we get to do tag team boss fights or even tag team through certain areas of the game, I just feel kinda lonely sometimes. The story is not griping at all, I don't feel like i should give a damn about my character or anyone else. There is a story but its really plain, like no big deal. I don't feel intrigued or gripped by the ""story"" thus far. I will update my review when the next update comes out. 2nd May 2014 Update:This game has tons of potential. I bought this game from just reading the description. The concept of having infinite mana and the idea of being a powerful mage just attracts me. We have seen lots of games such as Skyrim, Guild Wars 2 etc where you have to either wait for mana to regenerate, use mana potion or wait for a certain amount of time before using another attack. I'm not saying they are bad games, no, those are fantastic games but what I'm saying is that this game brings something new. Something we've never seen before. The game is still in pre-alpha so don't expect a polished finished game. Rather, this game needs your support. I usually don't support early access games but this one has my full support. Now for the gameplay, its still a little rough around the edges but thats totally understandable, come on guys its pre-alpha so relax. The combat feels a little stiff and i'm not sure if its a good or bad thing but bascially you are a mage with aimbot. No matter where you aim, your attack will automatially hit its target, not all the time but most of it. The other improvement that i think will greatly raise the bar of the game is to increase the spectacularity of the attacks. I'm talking about huge explosions, pillars of fire, ice, lightning and area destructions. Those are my only concerns so far.The recent update greatly improved the performance of the game and of course added a story, so now we know whats going on, kinda. The attacks looks better then before and there are still some minor glitches but those can be fixed easily by the developers. There is a downside to being a badass. After  a while, the game feels repetitive, and a little boring at times. So far I don't see it as an RPG than can last very long. Maybe its because i didn't finish the game? I hope the game can add in huge side quests to increase the length of the game. These days a 50 hour RPG is pretty average. I also wish that there would be a clearer leveling system. Right now we get these achievement points which can be use to upgrade certain attributes of the character, such as criticall damage, critical chance and increased damage. Overall I just hope this game turns out great, with plenty of content and lengthy quality playtime. which means no boring side quests if they are adding those, more variety of enemies, plenty of boss fights, more variety of attacks, add in some lore into the  story to make it seem llike there is a depth to the story. Thats all for now. I will update the review once the developers update the game again.			"

												I think most people can agree the combination of an open spell crafting system, no mana bars and hordes of enemies to be annhiliated is pretty tantalizing.That's what Lichdom purports to be. I was imagining unlimited Bioshock plasmids or Skyrim dual wielding with no cooldowns, but the end result is a much spottier affair.The combat is the sole focus of the game - there is no exploration and a vapid narrative - and it is extremely daunting to the unitiated. There are multiple base damage types (fire, ice, lightning, etc), a handful of manifestations for the damage (AoE, missile, ray) and modifers upon modifiers, all represented with changing values and percentages. This in actuality is the real game - combining spell components and modifiers to produce more powerful versions of your spells, to counter the increasingly powerful enemies. The use of the crafting system is virtually unexplained: the number of confused and mournful comments in the game's community hub tell the tale. Lichdom begs to have an excel spreadsheet built into it's interface.The game is basically Serious Sam - a corridor shooter pitting the player against utterly mindless suicidal enemies, punctuated by occasional boss fights. Despite an A-List voice cast the overtones of a narrative are laughable - small player activated scenes are placed directly in your path to tell the tale entirely with ghostly visions of the past, and in fact can be completely bypassed, begging the question of why the team spent the money on the talent. The world itself is dead and empty, devoid of interaction - the levels, long and desolate, filled only with the morönic screams of your suicidal foes. The game world and mechanics feel so streamlined that it's sacrificed any character it may once have possessed. That leaves the fighting. The number of people unable to get past the first boss fight should be telling. There's no guidance presented in game, leaving you to spend hours analyzing the spell crafting system, read guides, or (most commonly it seems, based on the comments section) simply attempt trial and error with the game's ponderous crafting system and hope for the best.It seems like the developers decided to continue adding more layers and systems to their game as development wore on, adding more complexity to the crafting, more stages to the boss fights, when that time might have been better spent adding more character to their world, or trying to tell an engaging story.As it is I think they've crafted a very niche product for themselves and greatly limited their success. The only thing to keep you interested in playing the game is the act of crafting new spells itself. There's no compelling plot, no new areas to explore. If keeping the steam overlay open to research your spells and calculate modifiers sounds like a delight, this is the game for you. If you were expecting a visceral action trip, look elsewhere.			"

								It's been a long time since a boss battle has been so hard, but so rewarding.This game is a great combination of high fantasy, spellcrafting and difficult fights. The very little health you have adds to the value of the experience. The spellcrafting has some great ideas, but a better menu would make it more accessible when comparing statistics - a spreadsheet based menu would work like a charm (no pun intended). Overall it is a great game. The graphics are very nice, although the TressFX seems a tad glitchy. The story is well presented and I think that characters are very thoughtfully formed, however I think some character customisation like The Elder Scrolls would not go astray. Even though there are no physics weapons to choose, some mage clothing would be nice.I would certainly recommend this game, and I am excited for what it has to come.			"

												The concept is great, but the execution is flawed.  While being a powerful mage who can burn/freeze/electrocute anything that isn't air without the need for mana pools or such sounds cool, it would be a lot better if it felt like you were actually doing something effective.  While not needing a tank to hide behind sounds good, the swarming, repetative enemies and your severe case of ""squishy"" will leave you wishing for a meat-shield. Combine this with a spellcrafting system that looks good on paper but makes most choices severely underwhelming, stir in a dash of ""generic"", bake at ""mediocre"" for way too long, and you have this game.

												A wonderful game with incredible character depth. I haven't gotten terribly far but I am already impressed with everything I've seen. The two player characters have their own unique feel and story, and the characters are written in such a way that you WANT to see them succeed. Furthermore, the ""bad guy"" is actually a fairly well rounded character, something even game companies like Square Enix and Bethesda sometimes fall short on.			"

												This game is excellent but it requires a keyboard, don't let the 'partial controller' support fool you. It is REALLY partial, such as there is no interact button on the controller so you can interact with any of the spells beacons to upgrade or change your powers. You HAVE to use a keyboard for that. There's also a couple of abilities, like charge, that don't seem to work. If youre able to play this on a keyboard purely then it's quite good. It's got good graphics but it's pretty hardware demanding, I've run this on three different computers I own, all for gaming but only ones a serious gaming machine. On almost any graphics setting it lags pretty bad and is pretty choppy on the two weaker systems, on my main gaming PC however it runs beautifully at full settings. In the end my biggest issue is the 'partial controller support'. It's junk, literally the game cannot be fully played with just the controller and what makes that upsetting is that a handful of controller buttons simply aren't used in the game, it's like they started to develop support and then just dropped it. Overall if you're a PC gamer, loving your keyboard and mouse, it's great fun, but you'll need a pretty beefy system to play it smoothly. If you're a part of the controller trend like myself, then don't buy this, simply put you can't play Lichdom with a controller alone. Over all 7/10 as it stands, if they add FULL controller support it's an 8.5/10 easy. Excellent action, great combat, wonderful visuals, amazing magic/combat system.			"

The magic system is also fantastic, although i havent gotten very far, the speels all have nice effects and feel like they do damage. The exception to that would be the AOE spell, to me, it feels kinda underwhelming. Like a big build up and then plop. Never the less, the game is shaping up to be an awesome experience, and now that it is in beta, things can only get better.			"

												A nice game, but i don't entirely feel like a badass as a mage in this, i don't like being limmited to only using three types of runes, could've easily just assign all of them from one to nine. If i see ""The mage is total badass!"" and yet.. we can only use three types of magic? i'm sorry your mage is nothing but a cheese puff, get skyrim and a couple of mods to become a badass mage.That being said the story so far seems pretty nice and the voice acting is great, though i was expecting a hell of alot more from this game, though so far the only thing that is interesting about this game is the story so.. if a good story is what you like then get this game, if you wanna be a badass mage? look somewhere else.I for one wanted this game because i wanted to be a badass mage, and i was disappointed.

												Don't be fooled by the Great Concepts. Besides a good core mechanic, this game is very average. Shallow and unintersting story line mirrors the constant and repetative bore that is the combat. Exciting at first, You feel quite awesome and powerfull, But then, after hours of fighting the same enemies in what looks like the same narrow hallways and tunnels, you realise you no longer care about getting to the end. A handfull of different spell animations do little to distract you from the fact you have 2 attacks and a block. The Concept of the Ulitmate Mage was lost somewhere along the way, when they designed spells to be so week you'd be better of throwing rocks at enemies. One Expects to see a Force Unleashed like game play with Magic instead of force power, Throwing thousands of enemies into they abysss, but instead you get waves of the most boring combatants that take a couple of hits each. The real problem is that they've called you an ultimate powered mage and then done their best to ballance the combat, to give it a challange. Increasing dificulty by mixing up enemies types rather then putting any real thought into how that affects the persona of Ultimate Mage. Basically, its an average game, but not what it says on the cover.			"

												Wow! This game really does what it promises - create a kickass mage character that kicks♥♥♥♥♥ It boldly casts aside the notion of class equality so prevalent in fantasy RPG in favor of a model that says, ""Seriously? The skinny thief, musclebound oaf, clever ranger, and decadent bard are all equal to the mage, who wields the cosmic power of the universe as a weapon? Not in this world!""At first this game was unplayable for me. I just tried playing tonight and the new beta release performs very well. So well that I just played for four hours straight, stopping only to get drinks from the kitchen. This is going to be a great game when it is finished. It is already a lot of fun, and has its own unique character and spin on the usual fantasy revenge tale. The magic system allows for a great variety of spells, all of which are very powerful, with different modifiers creating a smorgasboard of carnage choices. No more spamming magic missle (or equivalent) over and over to kill a single opponent. Enemies will fall fast and hard in a multi-spectrum rainbow of death and destruction. Oh. and finally a protaganist who responds to being killed, resurrected and granted tremendous power somewhat realistically - ""Ok. So you're just going to give me all this power?"" in a bemused tone of voice.I will finish by comparing this to Bound By Flame, another game aspiring to turn you into the ultimate magical badass. The key difference is this - the combat in Lichdom, in beta stage, is better and more fun than Bound By Flame in its fondest creator's dreams. The magic system is creative and feels powerful and smoothly executed. Bound By Flame's system is rather restricted, and made unnaturally difficult by the combat system's clunkiness. Also, the story is better, and better told.			"

												I really didn't like this at all.  As you can tell, I didn't get very far in.  I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to games and I like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this was just incredibly frustrating.  First, the way the game tries to teach you about the spell system is not good at all.  It rushed through and doesn't explain things very well.  Also, there is no ""press space"" to advance through... it's like an embedded video that lasts a few seconds and then goes away leaving you confused.  It also explains and tries to demonstrate spell abilities before you even get them, which is even more confusing.  Lastly, I was cruising along nuking things just fine, so I was OK with how disjointed and confusing everything was.  I figured I would learn in good time.Until I got to a room in which there was my first mini boss and I got repeatedly owned in a matter of seconds.  The field of view was terrible, and the mini boss 1-shot me.  I usually don't give up easy, but the combination of all the above made the game far more frustrating than enjoyable, and I play games to relax and have fun, not be frustrated.  Uninstalled.  Wish I could get a refund.  Do not recommend.			"

								an Easy 8/10 as it is now, completed version seems to be a promising 10Playing through this game can be a very exciting experience, it is clear to see why the game is still in beta as some parts are rough around the edged but gameplay itself remains perfected. the play style of this game is very different than other first person RPG's. there is no weapons/item inventory and the whole game revolves around battling to progress the story and finding new magic schools as you craft new spells.I enjoy playing around with the battle system as some magic is ineffective offensively but can be used to support your other spells, interesting combinations of spells can be made and while cinematic scenes seem a bit dry, the story is interesting and simple enough to follow.definitely worth a play, but you may be spoiling the game for yourself by purchasing it in early access.  if you want a real element of surprise and exploration from a complete game, i suggest waiting a little longer until it's released.

												Sooo much fun... it is what Xaviant says it is.  Don't expect an experience driven by set-piece narrative movie-in-a-game ""Call of War Honor: The God of Battlefield Duty 7: with Medals"" kind of stuff or any kind of meta-game like leveling up in multiplayer or something.  Instead, expect a fast paced thrill ride of reigning mass corrective services on the silly monsters that would dare keep on attacking a walking Nuke with a brain.  Although, to be fair, there are story reveals throughout to break up the killing spree, and you know, keep the flavor alive.  But I didn't really care... I was busy showing off my Virtual Mage-BadasseryTM to friends or destorying in visually attractive ways for my own gratification,  Feel the power!!!Oh, anything less than 4 gb's of RAM will cause the game to crash randomly FYI.  And the in-game info on the crafting and magical systems is very shallow: read a basic guide on the forums or elsewhere to get the systems' ideas down before consuming vital items.... if you just wanna figure it out then stay cool and keep a keen eye on what the outcomes are of your randomish item uses.  Good Luck			"

												Don't be fooled by the Great Concepts. Besides a good core mechanic, this game is very average. Shallow and unintersting story line mirrors the constant and repetative bore that is the combat. Exciting at first, You feel quite awesome and powerfull, But then, after hours of fighting the same enemies in what looks like the same narrow hallways and tunnels, you realise you no longer care about getting to the end. A handfull of different spell animations do little to distract you from the fact you have 2 attacks and a block. The Concept of the Ulitmate Mage was lost somewhere along the way, when they designed spells to be so week you'd be better of throwing rocks at enemies. One Expects to see a Force Unleashed like game play with Magic instead of force power, Throwing thousands of enemies into they abysss, but instead you get waves of the most boring combatants that take a couple of hits each. The real problem is that they've called you an ultimate powered mage and then done their best to ballance the combat, to give it a challange. Increasing dificulty by mixing up enemies types rather then putting any real thought into how that affects the persona of Ultimate Mage. Basically, its an average game, but not what it says on the cover.			"

 It's an FPS with magic. If we look what kind of a game this is. It's basically an FPS where you shoot with fireballs and lighting bolts, instead with guns.This gets ofcourse boring after a couple of hours. The maps/levels are linear (if you ignore the art, it's basically tunnels).The graphics and the game-mechanics/physics is good, but the storyline is week and seems to be unable to be altered by the player's choiches.  Actually you don't have choiches, so to me this is not an RPG! When I bought this game, I was hoping for something revolutionary for the RPG genre. But it's not! It has more in common with an single player FPS, than an RPG.My tip for you: Play Skyrim instead, you can be a powerful mage there. And it will give you an unique experience each time you play. (If you where looking for an RPG).			"

TL;DR: I had this game on my library for a long while, had previously bought it during a sale (phew!). While this game have strong aspects, the lowdowns are too big to bring this game as recommended.You are a ""DRAGON"", a callsign for a Battlemage in the Lichdom game. As you progress further, you unlock new SIGILS (spheres of magical power: Fire, Ice, Kinesis, Corruption, Necromancy, Lightning, Delirium and Phase). You start with Fire sigil and you will be playing the game from start to finish with that one, as it is an all-around-handy sphere! My second most recommended sphere is Kinesis as you can stop/freeze enemies in the air (levitating) so you can focus on other enemies. And my last most recommended sphere is Necromancy. This one is so damn useful as you mark an enemy with an necromancy hex and once it dies, you get a spawned ally (ally varies from a select spawns)... and that gives you lots of room to focus on what enemy to kill first and move on. The undead allies can do some damage too but they're mostly handy as being a distraction!Another big recommendation I can give you is whenever you can mess around the Shield upgrade/crafting, make sure you have the ""AGILE"" label and fiddle around the upgrade parts until you see ""Unlimited Blink"". This is such a lifesaver as you can move around all the time, avoid melee and ranged attacks!Lichdom story is pretty weak... and it is mostly being told in ""ghost-like"" apparitions once you trigger it. I'll leave you up to find the story for yourself but it is very bland!The controls of Lichdom works well. You run surprisingly fast for a mage (actually handy!) and with the blink power, you are much harder to hit. Spellscrafting is strange at first. Takes a while to see how it works and especially what the result is. Again, mess around this and craft what you seem to like! On my fire sphere, I used mainly a fire ""lob"" (fireball) and it get's the job done fast! On Kinesis sphere, I used a levitating ray (stops foes and hurl them in the air) and Necromancy sphere pretty all does the same thing... hex foe then spawn ally!Impressive voice casting on this game. Many known actors participated on Lichdom!I played the game on the second hardest setting. I had read about how hard and unforgiving Lichdom gets... especially for the first boss fight and I kinda agree. I'd advice to play on either the easiest setting or on ""normal"". A protip for the nasty first demon boss... ALWAYS MOVE and lightning his a$$ up!And now, rundown of PROS and CONS.PROS:+""Not-so-bad"" visuals but could have been better for a CryEngine 3 game. My biggest pro here is the 21:9 support!+Strong voice acting.+Frenzy spellcasting.+Simple loot system that's directly linked to your spellcrafting abilities.+Challenging gameplay.CONS:-WAY TOO LONG PLAYTIME... Xaviant, if you ever make a sequel, cut half of the game! Too many ""filler"" in this game!-Highly repetitive and linear level design.-Weak story.-Lacks enemy variety.-Difficulty spikes throughout the game. At beginning, it is unbalanced (especially the first demon boss). You can always change the difficulty in-game at all time.-Not enough checkpoints. When you die, you gotta re-kill previously killed enemies and that get's irritating! I can't imagine how frustrating it could be on the hardest game setting!-No point in replaying the game once you beat... but there is some ""post-game"" stuff to do. I didn't cared what it is as I'm done with Lichdom but it seems to be ""Skirmish"" stuff so I'd imagine replaying the game in a NewGamePlus Mode style.-Pricey for its normal price. Get this on a big sale!OVERALL:While I've enjoyed Lichdom mostly throughout the whole game, I just had enough of it once I met the final boss. The game is WAY WAY TOO LONG, and I did played on a slightly hard game mode, tried to finish levels as fast as I could but honestly, this was my biggest con of the whole game.RECOMMENDATION:Well, you gotta enjoy a LONG game! But for all that I've mentioned, I cannot and will absolutely not be replaying this game for sure.And one last thing, if you do consider this game, get it at sale! "

												A great first entry, beautiful to behold, and one that makes first-person magic combat look and feel like it should.  The crafting/synthesizing abilities also create a great deal of magic depth as you try to craft the most potent spells.  Spell combos are also sweet, making for massive damage.  Did I mention the eye candy?  The game is not just beautiful but it has atmosphere.  The game is linear, and may feel shallow in comparison to Skyrim, but it is a first entry and hopefully a sequel is in the works.			"

												Full disclosure: I've been in the early access for this game since it was first available on steam, so some of my opinions are coming from a different perspective than many others, which got to see the completed game for a first impression.This game starts off easy enough, with the player being able to just one-shot or two-shot most enemies in order to give you a feel for the nature of combat but then quickly starts to throw enemies that require more than just throwing a basic fireball at in order to kill without explicitly explaining how to achieve that higher damage threshold (here's a hint, read through that journal thing that keeps popping up, it's useful). Once you grasp how to actually deal damage, most enemies become cannon fodder that you can 1-shot at pretty much every point in the game provided your spells are somewhat up to date (here's another one of those hint things, you need to set up for your damage spell with either a control or mastery spell, or maybe even both.)The spell system seems somewhat paradoxical to me. On the one-hand it seems to encourage experimentation, since different sigils and how their spells are attuned will require a different play-style and sometimes even a different build to get the most out of. On the other hand, leveling progress in a sigil will have been lost, which means a number of free small bonuses to that sigil are lost. However, since you can replay any previous area in the game once you beat the first boss this becomes a moot point since you can quickly blitz through the first level later on to level your sigils back up. Once you get past the hang-up of worrying about your bonuses (which usually amount to at most +10% to some stat for that particular sigil) and actually play around with sigil combinations, you'll realize how much flexibility you have with how you can build (a lot), although certain build patterns are stronger than others.Enemy variety is kind of lacking until about level 4 or 5 when suddenly there's a healthy mix of different enemy types being thrown at you every fight that requires you to actually prioritize certain enemies above the others instead of just killing whatever approaches you first.Since this game runs on Cryengine you can expect it to look good, which it very much does. However, that also means you can expect it to be very demanding on your hardware. I was struggling to get above 30 fps for most part with a computer above the minimum specs on the lowest settings, although even then the game looks far better than most games coming out these days, even if there is a feeling of a lack of polish in some areas.One gripe I have with this game is the complete lack of a crosshair, which may not be an issue with the single target missile spells which have inherent auto-aim (which is annoying sometimes when it will decide to randomly target some minion other than the one you have designated to be obliterated via your CC/debuff of choice), but when using lob-type spells there's no sort of way to really gauge where your throw is going unless you develop a feel for it.If I had to summarize this game I would say it's a glass cannon corridor shooter* that requires you to think about how to build and use your resources properly. It's very pretty and actually fairly challenging even when you know what you're doing, so I can genuinely recommend this, however I would also wait for this to go on sale first. I paid $20 since I was in the early access, which feels like a good price.			"

												Very disappointed to see so many negative reviews on this game, but I guess everyone has different tastes. I like this game because it takes me back to a time when games were very simple. This is like a beat 'em up or a hack and slash where you basically go through an entire level killing everything you see. I would have liked to see greater variety in the enemies and spells. Locations are nice though, varied and visually appealing. Overall, a good game to play while listening to music in the background. Just turn your brain off for a while and enjoy the destruction.			"

Lots of minmaxing stats to make sure you are playing optimally - which is not fun.Several times I have also fell into pitfalls that are really hard to see with all the spell effects going on (and because the pitfall is not very noticeable) which is incredibly infuriating.Overall verdict: Not worth it.

												First of all, let's call a cat a cat. This game is an action game with rpg elements tied to the spells you get to learn and not to the character itsef. The gameplay is really close to what you find in  Quake or Doom, but this time around, you burn your ennemies, corrupt them, use them at your own will. Now, if that doesn't turn you around, go on and buy the game and enjoy it for what it is. Xaviant has done a really good job with Lichdom battlemage combat. And that's the game: a big, yet varied arena filled with hordes of ennemies coming at you with special effects, lightning and fire blazing everywhere. And yet, under this simplicity, lie a good crafting system that will make you want to loot for components to upgrade your spells, and most importantly, a soul. The game is like a good blockbuster - you won't get strong lines of dialogues, nor a deep story, but, you'll get one hell of a ride if you can enjoy a good chunk of pure action well executed. Bravo Xaviant! Can't wait to see your next time guys!			"

												Hi, I'm Crow-Father and I used to be a guy that wrote lengthy reviews on games that I had only played for a few hours and quite possibly have never finished. This is one of them. So I'm going in and editing my over hyped reviews for games that I liked and trying to make them more realistic for the amount of time I sunk into them. Before I get to my review I want to remind readers that a gamer can only judge a game by his/her own experiences with said game. Don't just go by what others say about it, but do take it into consideration for a lot of people may have insight that you don't.Lichdom Battle mage is decent. It's not amazing, it's not aweful. That in itself makes it a little disappointing. Here's a game where your supposed to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage with almost no limitation on what you can do. Sad thing is your limited by sigils and swapping out crafted spells for stat differences. In my honest opinion I do believe the game suffers from trying to keep the RPG aspect a little too much. The crafting system wasn't really necessary and it gets tiresome to deal with. Swapping spells you can use like you would guns in FPS games makes sense so that was pretty solid. However I believe this game would have had a better time being like old Quake, Duke Nukem, Doom games where you picked up all the weapons in the game and scroll through them with the mouse wheel or switch using the num keys 1-7 (or 8 I can't remember how many sigils are in the game right now). I do like how you have different methods of firing off said spells, like using a fire ball single target attack or the area of effect attack. I also like that you can have a Ray of fire instead of a fire ball, or how the fire ball can explode on impact and do the maximum amount of damage or start burning a target over time based on what you crafted the spell to be like. That brings me to how spells could have been a little more interesting.Now I'm all for challenges and intricate game mechanics but this game feels like it couldn't decide on being an FPS fantasy game or an RPG. Now with that being said I still don't understand why every one compares it to skyrims magic mechanics and yes I have played the game. Anyway, like I said earlier about being like the old FPS games they should also take mechanics from games like Crysis and others that allow you to switch the fire mode of a rifle capable of being automatic to semi-auto to burst, with just a key stroke. The switching between fireball impact, fireball burning, and heat ray should have been simplified. I'm using the one spell as an example because I haven't unlocked Necromancy yet and there is another spell type I have that I don't wanna use as an explanation besides you start with the Fire sigil. However instead you have to go through this crafting system inventory that seems pretty cool at first but then become pretty tedious later on. I feel the crafting system should be replaced with a skill tree or skill trees that give bonuses and buffs to the players abilities when leveled and yes I know the crafting system was made so that you can switch things out and not be stuck with your choice by deconstructing spells but you could easily do that with a tree system where you just switch out what skills you want. Kinda like you can have one perk or the other activated at a time.The gameplay it self is pretty linear now where most may find that annoying I actually can see why it was necessary for this game. Besides it gives the chance to encounter really cool monsters and bosses... and stuff. Like I said trying to be realistic I think I've fought one boss and I can't remember who that was and the last time I played this game was a few months ago. The story isn't the most interesting but it's not dull either. Your characters motivation for wanting to kill the antagonist is simple. He killed your wife/sister (depending on gender choice) and a wizard type guy who has a history of showing up in times of stife (and also has a history with the dude to boot) revives you and turns you into a dragon. (Battlemage) Now I am actually intrigued with the story between the antagonist and the wizard guy, and there are these memory things that you find through out the game that give you some insight on the last dragon this wizard dude had. I have this weird feeling that your mentor isn't all what he's cracked up to be, but hey I need to beat the game to find that out.Ultimately I still recommend this game because I do really like it but it gets kind of repetitive and the crafting system is really bloody tedious. It's nice that it's not too open but it does have secrets to find. It's a little too linear and it would be more understandable if there was variety in gameplay but this game is reminiscent of a game where you do nothing but be involved with combat and moving forward. No back tracking or anything and from what I have seen so far no real puzzles to solve. Maybe wait for a sale but definitely check it out.			"

												I saw this game and it looked promising. One review related it to Serious Sam but with magic, and being a huge fan of Serious Sam I was sold. Let me say I am suitably impressed.The good: The gameplay is excellent. Very fast-paced and enjoyable, the controls are pretty responsive and I loved that there's controls for keyboard and for controllers.The game is beautiful, this place is screenshot heaven and the massive levels have such breathtaking and expansive environments. All of the spell effects are spectacular and the enemy design is excellent.The lore of the game is engaging and I love finding it scattered around for you to discover. Those were elements I greatly enjoyed in Metroid Prime and I think you guys could take some more notes from that and expand.The crafting system is complicated but I chose to forgo the Smart Crafting that does in automatically in favor or manually learning it, I had a blast making myself absurdly powerful and fine-tuning my build. Speaking of that...The difficulty is decent, it's not too hard but the game will kill you if you slack off or get complacent. It might come across to some that you're too powerful, but the entire point of this game is to make yourself a godlike figure and obliterate anyone foolish enough to cross you. However...The Bad:The developers relied a little too much on cheap abilities to make the enemies challenging. I understand that with someone so strong, it's challenging to think of ways to make enemies difficult without them just having ballooned up health or cheap abilities. That being said, the only thing that ever DID kill me was the cheap enemies. Now I've been gaming for over two decades and I've played a lot of RPGs so that's to be expected but still. I don't enjoy getting killed by being knocked prone and frozen solid in an endless cycle. I'll suck it up when I screw up and get killed, but the game always suffers if you die from stunlock.The world itself offers glimmerings of having the potential to be very deep and have flavorful NPCs with emotional and meaningful interactions but damn it guys it fell just short. I understand limitations and hope to see it better in the future, it's still great and promising but it could be so much more! There were parts of the story that I didn't get closure on.Overall: It's a great game for its price, this game is like the lovechild of Serious Sam and Path of Exile so if you've ever liked those games give this a try. Some people argue that the enemies get repetitive and while they could use more variety I think it's an unfair criticism of this game. It reminds me greatly of many good games I loved, it has a lot of replayability and you'll easily sink 30-50 hours into this game just clearing it once. I'd say that's worth its pricetag, given games these days offering half that for more price. It definitely has the replayability to offer 100+ hours, which very few games achieve even today.			"

												I purchased this game back when it was still in its alpha phase and til this day I will never regret that.This game has improved greatly and it's a very good game to play if you're a Wizard at heart.To those people out there who are similar to myself, loving Mages beyond all else, this game will be a wonder purchase to add to your gaming collection.

												I like this game and steam says I've got 15 hours into it already. It's not a super amazing game that you need to play at full price. I'm not sure I'd recommend it for $40, but if you like being a badass mage and killing stuff it's definitely worth picking up on sale. I'd rate it as a good value at $20 or less, and an obvious choice at the current 70% off sale. My primarily complaint about the game would be that it's linear and repetitive - experimenting with spells and combos is fun but you'll get bored quick if you're not constantly trying out new things.

Tons of spells, loads of enemies, and no messing around waiting for power to regen or running out of stamina. Just lots of explosions and strange magical effects.			"

												As one that has always loved playing mage in RPGs and other games, this is like a gift from the heavens, or at least in theory.Don't get me wrong, I have loved every second of this game so far, from the slaughtering of helpless undead to defeating powerful bosses and learning the rich crafting system.However, the game does indeed have some flaws.The combats is, although fast paced and good looking, kinda repetitive. You don't get bored, but it's not varying battles or something like more open world games. Here you got 3 spells and then 2-3 variations of them, depending on your spell-setup.Also,the variety of enemies isn't that great. You usually (as far as I've come in the game) just face off against some skeletons, zombies or the cultists that control them. The only exception is bosses and mini-bosses.But enough about the bad, focus on what's great!The graphics and setting of the world is stunningly beautiful, with varied environments and views.It's actually fun to craft once you start getting the hang of the system in use, and there are great posibilities here. Sure, I don't know it all yet, but I'm getting there!And of course it's always a pleasure to burn your enemies to death in a great blast, only to raise them as your loyal servants the next moment!All in all I highly reccomend it for most people. It is story-driven and kinda narrowed down, so if an open world is your highest wish, this might not be for you though.This is how mages should be, always badass!			"

												Full disclosure: I've been in the early access for this game since it was first available on steam, so some of my opinions are coming from a different perspective than many others, which got to see the completed game for a first impression.This game starts off easy enough, with the player being able to just one-shot or two-shot most enemies in order to give you a feel for the nature of combat but then quickly starts to throw enemies that require more than just throwing a basic fireball at in order to kill without explicitly explaining how to achieve that higher damage threshold (here's a hint, read through that journal thing that keeps popping up, it's useful). Once you grasp how to actually deal damage, most enemies become cannon fodder that you can 1-shot at pretty much every point in the game provided your spells are somewhat up to date (here's another one of those hint things, you need to set up for your damage spell with either a control or mastery spell, or maybe even both.)The spell system seems somewhat paradoxical to me. On the one-hand it seems to encourage experimentation, since different sigils and how their spells are attuned will require a different play-style and sometimes even a different build to get the most out of. On the other hand, leveling progress in a sigil will have been lost, which means a number of free small bonuses to that sigil are lost. However, since you can replay any previous area in the game once you beat the first boss this becomes a moot point since you can quickly blitz through the first level later on to level your sigils back up. Once you get past the hang-up of worrying about your bonuses (which usually amount to at most +10% to some stat for that particular sigil) and actually play around with sigil combinations, you'll realize how much flexibility you have with how you can build (a lot), although certain build patterns are stronger than others.Enemy variety is kind of lacking until about level 4 or 5 when suddenly there's a healthy mix of different enemy types being thrown at you every fight that requires you to actually prioritize certain enemies above the others instead of just killing whatever approaches you first.Since this game runs on Cryengine you can expect it to look good, which it very much does. However, that also means you can expect it to be very demanding on your hardware. I was struggling to get above 30 fps for most part with a computer above the minimum specs on the lowest settings, although even then the game looks far better than most games coming out these days, even if there is a feeling of a lack of polish in some areas.One gripe I have with this game is the complete lack of a crosshair, which may not be an issue with the single target missile spells which have inherent auto-aim (which is annoying sometimes when it will decide to randomly target some minion other than the one you have designated to be obliterated via your CC/debuff of choice), but when using lob-type spells there's no sort of way to really gauge where your throw is going unless you develop a feel for it.If I had to summarize this game I would say it's a glass cannon corridor shooter* that requires you to think about how to build and use your resources properly. It's very pretty and actually fairly challenging even when you know what you're doing, so I can genuinely recommend this, however I would also wait for this to go on sale first. I paid $20 since I was in the early access, which feels like a good price.			"

												Very disappointed to see so many negative reviews on this game, but I guess everyone has different tastes. I like this game because it takes me back to a time when games were very simple. This is like a beat 'em up or a hack and slash where you basically go through an entire level killing everything you see. I would have liked to see greater variety in the enemies and spells. Locations are nice though, varied and visually appealing. Overall, a good game to play while listening to music in the background. Just turn your brain off for a while and enjoy the destruction.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a first person spell casting action and adventure game where you, a human turned into dragon (not literally anyways) is framed for murder. Who really did it? That's what we're about to find out. Oh but wait. Is it a linear storyline? Yes, yes it is. It gets even better. The numerous amounts of spells you can cast that it claims to have is abysmally small. I mean there are a lot of different combinations to craft with but honestly, it just feels like you're casting the same things over and over again, having to go into your inventory to change different spell types and spell elements is just immersion breaking, and frustrating. After several hours, it's infuriating to find myself not able to pass a simple part in the game, just because there are too many enemies for my small splash damaged, and single-targeted spells to do anything against. Oh and not to mention the ultra linear, generic plot and story. This game is lackluster compared to what it had, or claimed to offer. Although it's great graphics is well delivered, as it's built on the CryEngine, it's gameplay is what it should have been.			"

												Amazingly repetitive gameplay gets very boring very fast. The supposed endless item combinations is a joke. There only seem to be 2 or 3 augments or shapes for each type of spell. Only 3 possible projectile shapes so far, same with AoE spells. Gameplay is much more linear than I was expecting. All of my chosen Sigils seem to have become almost completely ineffective 2 hours in even when I manage to pull off combos with 2 or all 3 of my Sigils. Spell charging takes way too long to be effective if enemies get close and non-charged spells do nothing. This game was also a letdown graphically. The recommended system requirements led me to expect a Skyrim quality game but this looks quite dated compared to other games released recently.			"

												Lichdom is fun and challenging, the crafting of spells and spell combinations adds infinite options to how you want to play. However, the enemies lack diversity so when you find a combination of spells that works there really isnt any reason to change them. I enjoy that you get to be a badass mage, and you do feel powerful in your encounters. The game is missing something, and its hard to put my finger on it. I really look forward to a sequel, but i would recommend this game as it is now. The dev team keeps upating and patching the game to make improvements which is great to see the pride and care they have taken to make this game the best it can be by addressing mistakes such as balance issues. This is a good game that i really enjoyed my time with and will revisit for at least one more playthrough. 8/10			"

												This game CANNOT be compared to Skyrim. This game is actually a first person Diablo. Long levels, fight pack of mobs room after room, low enemy diversity, huge focus on loot, etc. Since your weapon is magic, instead of looting actual weapons you are looting materials for crafting spells, which is in my opinion much more interesting than weapons with different colors.So, you're this badass mage who can control the elements of magic, but doesn't know how to jump. Collect loot and craft new spells, learn how spell synergies works with each other, cast crazy magic combos. The key to having fun with this game is understanding it, not just the crafting but how the spell actually works. I'm not gonna dive into the details but every time I would try a new sigil I found out crazy spell combos with other sigils. Like for example when you apply corruption to a mob then bugs spawn after death; if you are using lightning, the bugs will transfer the lightning status effect to other enemies (a shocking stun) which will result in all other enemies around you stunned by your lightning-corruption bugs.It's like diablo, you always hunt for better loot. In Lichdom, you try to get that perfect shape with the right stats to deal big numbers damage. And then, mid-way through the game, you discover the SYNERGY shape, a special upgrade to the legendary item which enable you to mix two elements to cast some kind of ultimate spell. Now you're hunting for those special legendary items who can upgrade to the synergy shape and cast flashy spells that deals tons of damage.Graphics are beautiful, the spell effects are amazing, the combat can be dull if you let it be, but if you're trying to combo elements and discover new ways to use your differents shapes with different elements it becomes a lot of fun for the whole game. The default BATTLEMAGE difficulty is challenging, not too easy not too hard. If you're dying often, your shield is too weak, craft a new one with higher HP.Conclusion; it's been a while since I've enjoyed a solo game that much. I hope there's gonne be a sequel or a DLC.

												I bought this one on sale for less than 10€ and really dodged a bullet - for not wasting more on this absolute tat of a game.This is by far the worst mage game I have seen in a very long time, it makes every mistake a game designer possibly could make.To start with the player is extremely weak. Bosses will kill you in 3 hits and average enemies will spam you down in about 10, which equals ~2 seconds of taking damage. You are meant to use your pathetic 3m long lodges (only 3 of them every 10 seconds or so) or your shield, which slows you down to a crawl (considering you already move at the speed of a drunk snail, this is basically stationary), and blocks 50% damage at most. You can counter attacks by timing the shield, but as you are being attacked by 8+ enemies simultaneously, that is as useful as a rowboat in an ocean. With no paddles.Furthermore there is zero variety in gameplay. You can choose between different colours for your spells but if you think this crafting system is gonna turn your kinetic AoE into a gravity well that pulls enemies inwards, that you can shock for some crazy combo? No. You can prime enemies with any element, using Mastery or Control attunement (very logical), and then use any Destruction charged spell to detonate. Damage is not controlled by how well you use the spells, but rather by the stats on them. And stats it has. You will collect hundreds of blobs that add the glorious ""+11% fapping time"" to you jerk off spell. So in the end you will end up with a spell that takes half a screen to display it's stats, but is the same fireball as that other one you had. It just pumps out bigger numbers.Then also the enemies are all exactly the same. Melee guys, ranged guys and support guys. They mindlessly charge at you using their enormous health to tank your ""Ultramega testosterone-powered oldspiceguy glorious battlespells"" like it was nothing. Average fighting time is around 5-10 minutes per area (well, sometimes its 2 minutes, but feels like 10, because you always do the same thing), and if you die, you get set back half a level and have to do all the spam all over again. Every fight is basically kiting the enemies as they charge at you. No combos, no skill, or tactic will make it go any faster. Stats might, once you grind enough, but why would you?Of course this is a railroaded magic FPS and has no story to speak of (well none that would make you care anyway). I was told the woman is being voiced by some big celebrity. I am told I should care. I can't find a reason why. Basically you get screwed over by a cult and go off to kill hordes of the same bad guys because revenge and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mostly♥♥♥♥♥♥though.If you are thinking of buying this for the story, don't. If you are thinking of buything this game for crafting, don't. If you are thinking of buying this to feel like a badass mage that sets up the whole arena for a combo and nukes the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with one gloriously timed combo, absolutely don't. If you are thinking of buying this game for the visuals, then yeah. It does look good. I guess graphics is all their talent and focus went into. This is the worst and weakest I have felt as a mage in many many years. This game does the exact opposite of what it advertises.			"

												Lichdom suffers from it's own design.The premise is simple. Design your own spells using the parts received by killing in combat. Easy enough, right?There's even a Smart Craft systen in place if you can not be arsed to deal with the more complicated crafting system.Only... the game punishes you, especially on harder difficulties, for not doing so. In fact, trying to learn and experiment is never really encouraged because your resources are finite and the new elements you unlock start with weakly powered versions.It's incredibly disappointing to find out a certain element doesn't work together well with the others. Which makes choosing them (an irreversible choice) all the more disappointing. Guess you'll have to suffer through your terrible build for another chapter and see if you can get lucky!Now, truth be told, that issue could be alleviated with proper information. But at the time of writing, Googling answers for specific questions is absolutely ineffective. The best you can find is the same articles explaining the basics of the game you already know. I get it, charge up damage with the one skill and activate it all with a damage skill. BUT WHAT DOES THE SKULL DO? (apparently the Necromancy's skull, will fully negate any damage during block for a period, a fresh steam guide had to inform me of that)If you want a game where you can mindlessly be a mage, this game is not for you. It's not ""Skyrim 2, the linear hallway shooter.""Sticking to the classic setup will not carry you, even if you use Smart Cast to upgrade the levels. (which is a huge waste of resources by the way)No, instead you need to figure out the best synergies with, again, too few information on any of them. And the information provided often proves confusing. The game simply makes poor work of conveying the information regarding it's mechanics.Fine, you start experimenting. Hey, some combinations work and some elements are interesting in concept. It's like the game wants to reward you for thinking for yourself!Only, they barely prove to be viable when the combat really gets heated. Which can suddenly happen, as well.You'll be pitted against Bosses and Minibosses that, for some reason, are perfectly capable of withstanding your combo. Freeze is ineffective, Fire doesn't do enough damage... Meanwhile their skills overpower you and you can't figure out why you can't even dodge them.The excuse that is being made then, when complaining about the bosses, is that you can actually easily beat these bosses with SPECIFIC COMBATIONS. This goes against the idea that you can craft any combation of spells in this game. Yes, you can craft them, but very few will be viable on long term and you won't even realize your combination is faulty until you've respawned 10 times wondering if you're just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodger.The game really doesn't inform you well on HOW you died either, or what is to blame. Just that you took enough damage (or with some cleary overpowered enemies, just take ONE hit right as they spawn) and died. You can't even look around for a final glimpse.The lack of information, more than anything, is what infuriates me. It took me five respawns (not counting the respawns just trying to get to that point) to realize that it was a huge worm spawning in a direction I never was looking in, spitting it's insanely powered, slowing goop. Leaving me up as prey for the crocodile-like creatures to be chewed on and knocked back. Dear God, I shudder at the idea of being knocked back AND frozen at the same time.Lichdom: Battlemage has an insanely interesting concept and completely falls flat on executing it by making only a specific set of combinations strong enough to take on anything. That counters creativity, a game that shamelessly says it WANTS you to create and experiment. What use are a 100 combinations when only 2 work?The worst thing is, in some cases it's just the default spells being underpowered and you just need to craft a better version. But when that's not the case, you just wasted resources on an element that you won't end up using anyway, and have to go back to your slightly underpowered elements you were using before. Praying some enemies may drop some Rare parts that you can use. It's not fun to constantly die just to pick up scraps. Especially considering that dying once will reset the rarity chance, meaning that once you start losing, you'll have to get lucky or scrape by.Storywise... It's nothing to write home about. You can pick between a male or a female. The character, then nicknamed Dragon, gets wronged by an Antagonist and is joined by a the other charater now nicknamed Gryphon.Then you go on a tour of destruction through several settings while the plot dumbs down to ""follow the trail to your target and kill them at the end"".If you can deal with constantly respawning with no satisfaction or feeling of progress, the game might be worth it. Yes, indeed, the crafting is interesting and it's probably a lot of fun on the easiest difficulty where efficiency doesn't matter a single bit. Doubt it'll be challenging or satisfying.But if you want to get serious and play a harder difficulty, you'll need information that's poorly conveyed and hard to find on your own.What use is innovation if it's poorly implemented.

												It is okay, but then the game is a bit annoying such that there are few save points, so if you die you have to start battling many enemies from the last checkpoint. Yes, it is a challenging game but then if we can save then it will be better. There are  too many monsters to battle and the game is lacking of RPG elements other than the spellcrafting element.			"

												I can say for certain that this is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time, and I'm only a few hours into it.  The action gets intense, and when you get to fight big boss battles, it's amazing how your guy can maneuver around and take giants down.  It isn't the fastest kills, but they are intense, and some of the most impressive visuals on any RPG at the moment.  I have a R9 295x2, and maxed out settings, this baby is buttery smooth.  If you want to play something different, but oddly familiar, then give this game a try, you'll be glad that you did.  It feels good to ditch the mana bar;) And at this price, you’d be crazy not to snatch it up right away!			"

												If you have ever wanted to be a badass mage then this is definitly the game for you. It is very challenging and rewarding if you take the time to master it, but at the same time it is infuriating at times. With some really bad checkpoints and bosses that seem to be impossible. And the game feels too long, since you do the same thing over and over. The only thing that makes the game recover from this is the excellent crafting system, which is suprisingly deep, although I would like a few more spell types. When you reach the higher levels and unlock the synegy spells it really gets awesome.Definitly worth the money. And impressive considering it is an indie game. Definitly a pretty game!			"

												SOOOOOOOOOO MANY COLOOOOOOORS!!! I don't know why this has gotton any bad reviews, this game is like it says ""POWERFULLY BADASS"". You just have to get the hang of it. Pretty much my favorite indie game. 5/5 StarsOh and by the way, try using smart inventory to craft your spells. It's alot easier, and will prevent you from running into enemies that you'll do absolutly ZERO damage to.			"

												This is a really cool game, but it's also disappointing. On one hand, the concept is awesome: be a mage that's actually a badass. But the execution is a bit lacking, because you don't exactly feel like a badass. This feels like a solid first game in a series, but therein lies the problem: you feel like you'd be best off waiting for a sequel that fixes the problems.For starters, you can only cast one spell at a time, which effectively eliminates all real experimentation with combining spells. Sure, you can (for example) freeze an enemy with an ice AOE then switch to a fireball and blow them up with flames, but it feels slow and sorta clunky. That example process which would take a fraction of a second in a game like Skyrim instead takes a full 2-3 seconds or so to execute. This rather slow-feeling casting system, combined with the oftentimes exorbitant amounts of health of enemies, means that in my few hours of play so far, I've spent most of that time kiting enemies and repeatedly throwing a lightning ball in their faces. Yes, it's absolutely awesome at first, but then the repetitiveness starts to set in. I spent an hour and a half doing nothing but kiting enemies and throwing my fireball-equivalent spell at them and repeating. Offense is pretty much just a test of your ability to backpedal without running into things while spamming your basic direct attack.Defense isn't a lot different. There are three primary types of shields in the game; I've thus far really used only one, the 'agile' shield. It has the fastest recharge speed and enables you to dodge infinitely. Dodging is done via teleporting a few feet instantaneously. But while I've only used one shield type for any real period of time, I don't think any of the others would be worth using in terms of in-game efficiency. Mashing the 'dodge' button and spamming attacks makes every fight a cakewalk, it's simply a matter of time before any group of enemies dies, oftentimes without even hitting you. The few basic enemy types have a nearly impossible time connecting with any attacks when you're dodging constantly. I've yet to die from a single standard non-boss encounter playing on the 3rd of 4 difficulty levels ('the intended difficulty for Lichdom: Battlemage').This game is also extremely linear. Not every game needs to be an open-world sandbox like GTA or Assassin's Creed, but this feels almost like Medieval Fantasy Hallway Simulator 2014. You walk straight ahead, occasionally explore a short, basic side route, then continue trudging forward. It's sorta like Frodo and Sam in the Return of the King trudging towards Mordor and Mount Doom, except you don't have hairy feet and you can blow skeletons up with fireballs. There is nothing extra to do aside from kill whatever's in your path; there is one type of 'chest' per level that you can destroy for extra spell components, but that is it. The closest things to collectibles are journal entries you can pick up that you don't really care about. I'm all for games that are pretty linear (Call of Duty singleplayer, Max Payne, Shadow Warrior, stuff like that), but this is a little too much.It might seem like I hate this game. I don't. I'm just disappointed in it. It had the potential to be one of the coolest, most different games of the year in my opinion, and it turned out...decent. The magic crafting system is really cool (if slightly confusing at first), the concept behind the combat is amazing, and it is fun to throw fireballs into a skeleton's face. I just wish it didn't feel so repetitive in so many ways. I hesitantly recommend buying this game, but not at full price. I don't feel like I'll get $40 of enjoyment out of it, but that's okay, because I WILL have enough fun to justify the $13.60 I paid for it. If you want to play something different with a great concept, go ahead and grab this for $20 or less. If you want flawless execution of a concept, pass. I'd give this a 6.5/10.			"

												Maybe, considering I payed $10 i'm satisifed with the game!For $40 though, you might be dissapointed.StoryYou play as a enraged basketball player and try to defeat Shaq O'neil. As you progress through each arena, you aquire new MAGIC which allows you to fight.Will you be able to make 1000's of spells? Who knows. Their are 8 sigils, with 3 different spells each.I used at least 24 spells. Make that 16 because I never learned how to use nova spells.WITH THAT OUT OF THE WAY HERE IS MY ACTUAL REVIEW OF THIS GAME. BELOW.The game crashed about 3 times for me. I'll come back to it sometime.The gameplay is somewhat repetetive after a while. It feels like fighting waves of the same enemies for some reason it feels like Painkiller with magic to me. But its fun, their are 8 different sigils which are basically elements. These include lightning, necromancy, fire, ice, etc. I played through with the necromancy, fire, and telekenesis sigils. Which was quite a combination.You have 3 different types of spells, AoE, targeted, and nova (Which after 4 hours I never learned how to use and I don't see it explained in any of the tutorials.Things I like about this game -It's expansiveAlot of combatVariety of spells to use, if you dig into the crafting system there's quite a bit of variety.Things I don't likeThe bosses are really strong, they have ridiculous amounts of health.You find spells that work against them and spam them, while killing extra enemies that spawn.The difficulties ARE BROKEN. They range from casual to Badass dificulty. I played on all of these dificulties and the differences between each are slim at least at the time of my playing. The boss I was stuck on I changed the difficulty from battlemage to casual, and he still had the same amount of health and did the same damage.It seems the same even with enemies. Throughout all the dificulties enemies seemed to die just as easy, and I took high damage regardless. The enemy variety is okay, but as far as I am into the game I would like to see more.You fight undead, soldiers, armored soldiers, undead mages that fly around and cast shields. The other enemies include cultists, some ranged monks and a slower mage basically. For $40 get ready for some repetetive gameplay, maybe some crashes. On a sale, I could definetly reccomend this game alot easier.This is a solid game, I would reccomend it to anyone that likes ALOT of combat. The story is here, it's told by these rifts that you find throughout the game which basically tell the past.			"

												First of all! There is now a difficulty slider! The lack of one was among the biggest complaints about this game.Now that is covered.Pros: 1. This is basically a newer version of Heretic. (if you don't know what heretic is, it is amazing, go do your homework [and get dos box])2. Awesome spell crafting3. Completely original inexhaustible magic user idea that makes you feel genuinely like a bad @#%, as promised4. Very beautiful scenery and spell effectsCons:1. If not for fast travel, the game is completely linear. Which isn't the biggest deal cause you are here to kill and spell craft, not to enjoy walking from town to town.2. Story is only so-so... Which isn't the biggest deal cause you are here to kill and spell craft, not to play a visual novel3. The biggest deal is that combat is not the off the chain best I've ever had, though it is still very fun to anchor and blitz something with a critical that pops it like a zit. It could've incorporated more 3d aspects or more interaction in melee, but not bad at all.Now, most importantly this game is about crafting spells. If you enjoy working on how a spell functions and toying with just how much of what a spell does you will probably enjoy this game. This is the most important and fundamental part of this game. This is kinda the thing, where you should probably decide if you like personalizing spells or if you probably won't like this game.			"

								I played this game at PAX East over the weekend and I was hooked! It was great to finally have a first person caster game, and to have a mage that could take a few hits.  So the first thing I did this morning was to download the game and start playing. For a pre-alpha release, it's quite good! Pros: Crafting your own spells, synthesizing new abilities, not being limited to just one school of magic.Cons: Controls seem a bit sluggish, scenery blurs when moving, and the names and text that pop up to help you with your questing is buggy and laggy.

												Some people say the Spellcrafting system is unoriginal and hollow. It is my belief they have not really delved into it and tried that many combinations. In addition to that, there are more to the spell types you can use (Sigils) than shooting differently colored fireballs or area of effect explosions.Your spells are divided into three categories. Nova, AOE and Targetted and Shields. Novas are explosions that center around you that occur when you block attacks in the nick of time (counters, really) or, with certain types of shields, when you blink on enemies.Targetted spells come in the Missile, Ray or Lob variety. Missiles are projectiles, rays behave more like breaths, being cones of energy, and lobs are like grenades.Your AOE come in the basic area of effect explosion, traps and patches that deal damage over time or apply an effect for the duration of the spell.Your shields dictate how your block behave, whether you can quick-blink or not and how much damage they block and hp they add.Now all that is just for the basic ""mechanics"" for your spells, every single type of spells does something different and synergizes accordingly with the other sigils, of which you can carry only 3 but can do some godlike stuff if you study the system a bit and NOT JUST chuck stuff at enemies. For example, you can charge enemies with ""stored"" damage from a Lightning AOE and then unleash it all at once with a critical hit (guaranteed if you charge your AOE or Missiles). BUT you can also stack that with breaking free a frozen enemy for more damage, so you could, say, throw a AOE Ice spell on top of that and finish the combo with a quick charged Fire projectile. You just need to craft your spells carefully and wait a bit till you get proper materials, and then you'll suddenly find that your character can indeed be a mighty mage.Now if you're not convinced, here's a spoiler. At the point I'm at (not too far really) I can Synergize Fire with Corruption, and Ice and Fire. Synergy comes from spells above the Legendary Tier, given from fusing (Upgrading) three Legendaries together. What these synergies let me do is, essentially, summon a FIRE GIANT and a tornado of FIRE AND ICE to basically, clear whatever it is I'm fighting at the moment. I don't fell badass, I feel like LIVING GOD. Just play the game, think your♥♥♥♥♥♥through and you'll get there too!TL;DR: The real attraction to this game is the Magic system, but you need to try and learn it and wait till you get at least some decent crafting materials before you can use some good spells, but once you get there you're not a Wizard, you're a God.

								It is still in the PRE ALPHA so it may be a bit buggy and repetative but overall its one of the best concepted and fun games ive playing in a while. By far the best first person game out there and the fact that you're a mage that can take hits, and deal damage and not have to rely on a team to help is great. Buy this now and keep up with the updates its GREAT.			"

								Amazing.....and its early access? well if your wondering is it any good let me point out this game as is better then many AAA titles. Thats as is. The combat is exciting with many twists and ways to change how your spells react. This game is massive and if you like wizard type of combat i dont think you will be disappointed. Just amazing!Spells impact npc...slow knockback control....theres so many ways to expand your spells by crafting new ones and also creating new spells from old. I highly recommend.			"

I've always wanted a game like this and here it is, can't wait till they add more to it. Would be cool if you could mix your powers together i.e Fire/ice.			"

								I played this game at PAX East over the weekend and I was hooked! It was great to finally have a first person caster game, and to have a mage that could take a few hits.  So the first thing I did this morning was to download the game and start playing. For a pre-alpha release, it's quite good! Pros: Crafting your own spells, synthesizing new abilities, not being limited to just one school of magic.Cons: Controls seem a bit sluggish, scenery blurs when moving, and the names and text that pop up to help you with your questing is buggy and laggy.

												excellent game if you like skyrim. Intro helps but the upgrade spell system is difficult to grasp in the beginning. It is all explained but when you have a system that provides that much customization it requires some time to master. Also it can become difficult fast if you choose to chase the side quests (green crystals, floating green crystals with  4 orbs attached, etc) with the first playthrough. Very fun game overall and good combos to try.			"

												Lichdom's tagline is making a mage feel badass, an admirable goal bogged down by glaring limitations, poorly designed upgrade system and lack of enemy diversity.Want to cast a bunch of Magic? Too bad you're limited to three schools at a time, all of which are follow a template of Projectile>Shield>AoE making each school little more then a color palette swap and ultimatly are watered down versions of skyrim spells. Add to the fact they include a ""Mastery"" system that makes you apply other spells in order for your main damage dealers to get damage boosts, I felt it only served to make an already boring and tedious combat system even more tedious and boring as all that you're doing is casting a fireball-esque spell and then switching to an actual fireball. *Yawn*Enemy Diversity is this: Archers, Mages and Sword wielders. Sometimes they sprinkle a boss in there but its pretty much a beefed up version of one of these types.The only slighty redeeming quality is the story but I could'nt be helped to slog through the rest of the game to see it.All in all this game doesnt make me feel like a badass mage, it makes me feel like a magic gimp.

												Wasn't what I expected when I bought it. Game play is repetetive - VERY REPETETIVE -. You simply go here and there and use monotone spells with no real creativity.Story line is good enough and plot is good. That's about the only thing that made me play the game actualy.Maps are very big and usualy that should be a good thing. BUT!!!! Check point system is rather a pain. The distance between is long and you will have to walk all over if you die. (And kill people again... I'm all for it actualy, if it wasn't for a VERY MONOTONE fight / spell designs. Really, so much potential but they didn't add anything for real. Able to throw fireballs but can't interract with world objects as a badass mage should. -Let me correct it, you actualy DON'T INTERRACT WITH WORL OBJECTS AT ALL!- All you do charging your spells and shoot them at enemies. That's the ONLY THING you do in fight. One missile type magic and one AOE magic. Spell varriations change as ice / fire / lightning and blaa but the spell casting and effects are the same. Liked Necromancy though, making a horde of undead to fight your battles is the least tiring way to win.)I would recommend you to buy this game only if it's on a discount. (That's what I did, thank goodness.) It's good, but nearly good enough.			"

												It's got an interesting concept, but to be blunt, this game gets boring quickly. The magic is flashy but it loses its luster the 400th time you cast the same spell. The enemies pretty much do nothing but run straight at you. The writing is subpar, the optimization is middling at best, and the ""loot"" system is so cluttered it becomes meaningless. Most ""new"" spells will be the same spell you already had, but doing slightly more damage, or lasting 300 milliseconds longer, or something like that. You feel like a powerful mage for about five minutes. Then you just feel like an accountant. The worst sin this game commits, though, is being called ""Lichdom"" while not being a game where you play a lich. You're just some dude who can't even cast spells without his magic bracelets. Shameful. You want to be a badass mage? Go play Magicka or Hexen or Dark Messiah or something. Skip this snoozefest.			"

												Very good game if u read the spell crafting instructions in order to actaully do good damage/control.  Don't use SMART INVENTORY past Sigil Tier 5. You'll have plenty of time to farm after the campaign section so keep the good spell bases with the most augments in your inventory until you know for sure you don't need it anymore for a specific map's fighting strategy.  During the campaign you have to be a bit of a miser with them to get them crafted best.The NGP HUB after the campaign is still fun because it remains challenging even with the drops capped at Tier 20.  If anything it's harder on some of the open terrain maps (due to some crazy ranged enemies) which is good since you have to actually work at completing them; changed sigils/spell combos up depending on the portal type.  I found the game balanced enough to keep playing, and there's enough sigils and augments to keep you guessing which combo works best for max dps and the easiest/best synergies.  The missiles were the easiest targeting spells to use (I highly recommend), be careful of crafting too many rays since they tended to bind the hands up and slow you down when you needed to do real quick Nova blocks or to just run like hell.No regrets buying this one (especially after all the patches had been completed before playing).   I didn't have any real tech issues other than having to back out of the spell crafting menu to get upgrades working correctly; i.e. wasn't recognizing an upgrade was possible, but no crashes, or major bugs in game-play/crafting like some other reviews/community discussions mentioned; pretty fluid game IMO.  Regardless, it's polished enough to play the campaign or the NGBs a few times every so often.  I really liked it.  Have fun.			"

												At first Lichdom looked great, crafting your own spells, throwing them at enemies in action packed combat.. I needed to play it and then I found out, most of negative reviews are true. The main problem is that the game gets frustrating really quickly, it is hard, because the game just throws lots of enemies at once at you and you cant manage them all at once in further levels, but combat get dull quickly, you perform the same tasks over and over in each combat. You might like, but you might also unistall it after a few hours and never come back.			"

I haven't had the chance to play beta or any other early release so I can't really tell what's the problem with all the cry babies out there but I still find this game to be a bit refreshing. The only thing that bugs me a lot are the movements. I just can't get those mouse settings right, but that's just me. Anyway 8/10			"

												This review is more of a summary - I don't go in-depth like I usually do; I honestly don't feel this game needs a bunch of analysis. Read the end for my final score. Disappointing on many levels. Graphics are solid and is one of the better looking games. Everything else is underwhelming. The game is revolved around you being a badass mage - too bad none of that really shows up. Some spells you can create are pretty solid, but the majority of them feel either weak or recycled. Throughout the game, you will make spells. These spells range from fire, ice, mind control and a few others. Since there are three main types of spells; Targeted, AoE and Nova, the amount of spells is a lot on paper, but there is less variety than you think; the majority of spells feel too similar; and that's a big shame. Throughout the average yet somewhat compelling story, you traverse through linear levels that have pretty looking environment. The enemies that are on these levels are too simple and there isn't much variety in the enemy types either. If you can catch my drift - the game is repetitive. In a spell-crafting game, you want variety. This game doesn't have much, which causes it to be surprisingly boring. The game looks great, plays well - with solid framerate and controls; it also has a good loot system. The cons however, overflow the pros and the game is a letdown. It also feels like Skyrim's magic - which isn't a bad thing in my eyes. (Skyrim with magic mods)Now, I payed $30 for this game. Would I say it was worth it? Not at all. I don't have the drive to play it anymore - it was decent while it lasted and was fun for the first few hours, but I'm just not interested in it. If I did have the motivation to play it, I'd play it once through - you'd only play it again for new game plus (Doubt anyone would) or for achievements. The concept was solid and fundamentally, it's decent; the full fleshed game is lacklustre. Extremely disappointing.

												At the end of the day, there are some major issues with Lichdom. Mostly it drags on for hours without giving much story at all. After putting in nearly 17 hours, I don't feel any closer to beating the game than when I was 5 hours along. Boss fights are overly difficult, and by not giving any enemies weaknesses there is a massive difficulty wall, especially if you don't get the crafting system early on.  On the subject of crafting, it may be the least explained tutorial in the entire game. It tells you how to make a variety of things and do upgrades, but it doesn't give you any idea about what affects what. It ends up being trial and error without much of a reward.One other major issue I have is the lack of spell variety. When it boils down to it, there are only a handful of spell types with a handful of elements. The only synergy that comes from it appears when you waste away three legendary loots to make a red one, which will only give you a bonus spell type if you have both elements equipped. Not usually an issue until you realize you've spec'd into the wrong element for the synergy you just aquired.In the end the game is barable at best until you get to the swamplands. By that point I have all but given up trying to... what was it? Avenge my wife I think? The lackluster story never really cared enough to bring it back up once the game went all Michael Bay. But hey, at least it looks pretty amazing.			"

												If you enjoy doing maths repeatedly, and sometimes killing mobs then this is for you. I fully expected to just shoot some stuff for a while and actually enjoy the game. But after somewhere near 90 attempts on the first boss, I now understand that this is actually impossible to enjoy. The maths is somewhat fun, but there are VERY limited resources to actually explain how things work in this game, effectively you are left in the dark for several hours while crafting spells which genuinely do nothing. The entire crafting system is overly complicated and then when you finally actually produce something worth having, it one shots everything in sight. Some may enjoy this, but I find it to have way too much complexity and no where near enough actual gameplay.			"

New ""smart inventory"" makes it easier.Right now I'm running a build based on Fire/Ice/Corruption.Bascially Fire and Ice are my main dmg dealer/crowd control but i use corruption to infect enemies with bugs so when they die those bugs come flying out and kill other enemies, which releases more bugs if said enemy was infected and so on. Next playthrough I'll probably do a necromancy build that focuses on minions fighting battles for me Very fun game if you like being a mage, lots of spell variety in the spell crafting system.

												Pros:•Energetic gameplay •Great graphics •Good interfaceCons•Gameplay becomes boring from linear maps and repetetive enemies.•Very steep curve between normal combat and boss fights.•Storyline was good yet predictable.•Crafting and other functions are not explained well.•Worst of all was how much this game crashes, now it may just be and issue with my system but it would crash seemingly randomly and with how widespread the checkpoints are this is infuriating. Not once did i ever close the game manually, it would crash and i would give up because i couldn't be bothered to to the same 20 mins of combat again.But aside from the things that drag this game down, it is good to pick up every now and again just to cause havoc and have a break from regular games so all in all it's a good pick on sale.

												On ""ok"" game. Nothing special, not horrible but not good either. If you want to get it on a steam sale for super cheap then it may give you a few hours of fun. I just have better games in my library that I would rather invest time into.Was fun for the first few hours but then got boring. I really wanted to like this game, the spell crafting intrigued me and I thought it would be an awesome mechanic. The spell crafting isn't amazing or anything but its pretty neat, it just doesn't have a ton of variety. What really made the game boring though is the repetative levels and enemies and fights. I don't mind that its on rails as its not supposed to be an open world game but you pretty much follow a path and once in a while the same few enemy types will pop out and you pew pew them down. The scenery changes but its all superficial really and the same concept of following that path and pew pewing seems to just keep going. Admittedly I didn't play for a ""very"" long time so maybe the game changes things up later but in the 18 hrs it shows I have played it stuck to the same repatitive formula.I really hate giving bad reviews because I know these games take a lot of time and are often a labor of love. I don't want to crap on someones work. I can't really give this a good review though. The graphics were very nice and the game looks good on Cry engine 3.

								Fifteen Minutes - that's how long it took me to fall in love with this game. The realistic movement, enemies, textures and effects make it look beautiful, even on the lowest settings. This game is for all those people out there who love to show what they've got against the surprisingly difficult enemies that arise in this game. Some POSITIVE points about the game:COMBATNow, when this game is finished, the combat will be ten times better, but already now, it's tricky, well-done, not too easy and overpowered but quite powerful. I love nothing more than tossing a firebolt, beaming a huge bolt of Lightning upon my enemies and blocking some green fire with a shield of ice. Using the dodging in the game as well as the sprint, tactics come in to play in this action-packed combat that is Lichdom - Battlemage.CONCEPTI always liked the Elder Scrolls games - perhaps you've heard of them (wink) and always thought there wasn't enough magic built into the most popular game, Skyrim. This is litterally that, but the opposite. With more spells than you can imagine, I cannot wait to unlock the abilities to make black holes, controll the minds of my enemies and send a toxic shudder through their bodies. I've only played 100 minutes of this, and I can't wait to play more.ENEMIESHoly. Crap. This... this is some darn good AI here. When an enemy is wounded, it will retreat quickly, searching for a corner to hide around or a pillar to camp behind. If it cannot find anything, it will stand for a moment, panicked, and then attack again. The Minibosses are also excellent, with the occasional spells they cast they can demolish you pretty quick, and I'm sure the main bosses are even better. I haven't gotten the chance to meet one yet!Some things to IMPROVE about the game:MENUI know this is very touchy and not a priority, but this Menu needs to be fixed. I like how it's at the side, it's just very... stiff? When I hover over something, it instantly has a backround. I'd prefer if it lights up with a small animation, maybe with a nice little sound effect? I know this is just a small thing, but it'd make it look more professional.NPCsI don't know if this is just because I can only play 100% smoothly on lower graphics, but at least when I play, NPC's mouths do not move. This irritates me - please add this feature a.s.a.p. Also, when someone is talking, I can turn my head to hear them quiter - I love that - but the logic doesnt make sense, because if I just walk away it stays the same (Loudness? How do I say this? :I). Maybe make it so the character locks into conversations.That's it, really. So if you're considering buying this game, make sure you do, it's great, and has a bright future!- VioletCooki (a.k.a The Bounty Hunter) [8/10 Stars] "

								A great game, definately makes you feel like a classic spellcaster. Almost completely removes all restrictions to your spells. I greatly enjoy it because it makes me feel like there is a great advantage to using magic that no other game does. It's fairly short, but it is in pre-alpha. I would recommend a higher tier video card if you are into having your games look good, but it isn't required. I run it on very low settings and I still get a good gaming experience.			"

Cons- Spells (could use more variety..may be there is more later in game haven't played much)- At times the motion blur feels clunky.- Linear and no voice acting makes it worse.- Story - I don't want to constantly keep reading - voice over needed.Worth a buy?

Early Access Review
								Lichdom: Battlemage is a very fun game, the gameplay is fun, but I find it a bit too difficult. The world is drawn up well and you are able to explore a little outside the main path. The one thing that really hurts my view of this game is that you are never really taught how to play. It just kind of expects you to figure it out. Also, I don't really like the health system. You have three barriers and once one is gone, it is gone until you find an orb like sphere to regen not all, but one layer. And they never seem to be around when you need them. You can create shields but you never really have an idea how to do it. I might as well close my eyes smack few things together and hope it works. The archers are really annoying because it is very hard to deal with them while fighting so many others; they either need less health or damage. Other than that, the game is very fun. I like the idea of being a mage without cool downs or manna. I was afraid the game was going to be too easy because of this, but it defiantly is not. All in all, the game is worth it if you like playing as a very powerful mage. I am hoping the developers may change/work on some of the things mentioned before, but the game is still fun to play. --AlphaEdit: after playing the game more and restarting after a big update I realized one thing: This game is way too hard. It always makes you feel like you are doing something wrong.  I can not advance a decent amount in this game without dying.  I really think they nailed one thing about the mage: NO. HEATH.  I never feel like the charecter is powerful at all. But hey, It's still entertaining while you're not dying , and there are some pretty unique ways to attack the levels.  If you like a challenge  more than I do, this game may be worth your money. Also, the archers suck still; beware they're annoying rapid fire attacks that are almost as strong or stronger than the melee attacks from the other creatures. They're annoyingness exceeds even that of skeletons in Minecraft (this was the best comparison that came to mind).  --Beta			"

Early Access Review
								There is very clearly a design focus and a great deal of skill behind this game. First impressions were mixed -perhaps because the game seemed to behave like a shooter rather than the more deliberate mage experience some RPGs seem to aim for- but soon the gameplay loop asserted itself, and boy, what a satisfying loop that is. Blast enemies, acquire new crafting elements, design new and better spells to blast enemies. Encounters are short and sweet, and it has a strangely addictive quality to it: five minutes after closing the game, you get the desire to go back and keep going.There is also skill expected from the player. Spell stats alone will not always be the key to victory, and learning how to move, to teleport and to parry appropiately is essential. It feels good to see the mage as an active, agile character rather than one destined to lob spells from behind a fighter.The aesthetics are also clearly very deliberate in their design, and all elements fit together to reinforce that you are, indeed, a badass. Some spells kick back mightily; others leave a trace of icy spikes in their wake; fire spells in particular sound like God's shotgun. The game goes big from the get-go, and doesn't stop. That, of course, can also be a downside: few moments of peace to counterpoint the action mean that it may feel repetitive, and the linear nature of the game can catch some players by surprise, since nowadays ""mage"" is almost synonimous with ""open world RPG"".As this is an Alpha build, some bugs are to be expected, and options are missing; most annoyingly, the motion blur is very strong and cannot be turned off. For me, this means keeping play sessions short, as motion blur strains my eyes and gives me motion sickness, not to mention the performance hit mid-range PCs take from it. Some better feedback when damaged would also help: keeping an eye on the shield bars (pretty much your health meter) constantly can de distracting, and without a stronger visual indication that you are getting pummelled, death often seems to come out of nowhere.All in all, the ideas behind the game are solid, and there is a vision in place. As time goes by, I'm confident the execution on that vision will become more polished. I expect to update this review as I play on: so far the worldbuilding shows hints of something interesting, but without more playtime, it's impossible to tell how that may be realized.			"

												For a game that promises the experience of a 'badass wizard', it falls short on it's core concept. The generic 'glass cannon' mage feel is a better summary of what you will expect.You will spend most of the game running away from enemies, hiding and repetitively charging spells that all feel the same. Personally I would say I felt like more of a badass in Skyrim than Lichdom: Battlemage.			"

Just one other person would be fine with me.   :)- combat system is a little weird, and making the sheild an instant kill? TOO OVER POWERED.

												In short, Lichdom: Battlemage is a decent game with some uniqueness, that would be a fair purchase if it were $20.This game is a decent game in small quantities.  As other reviews have said, the combat is unique and the crafting is very well done.  However, the game is very repetative and the spell variety is not that great.Combat in this game is fun, but gets boring after about an hour.  The game then gets quite grindy.  There are about 8 or 9 enemy types I've encountered so far, and each time I find a new one I begin to enjoy the combat again.  However, the time in between new encounters is quite a while, long enough for bordem to return.The crafting, while quite rewarding, is so tedious.  The UI in the crafting screen does not have enough filters and scrolls too slowly, which means I've spent over an hour of the 20 or so hours I've played this frantically scrolling my mouse wheel.Synergies, which are like your super powered spells, would have made this game so much better if they were done right, but as it stands, synergies take a very long time to grind out and even then, you'd better like which two elements is uses or you won't be able to use it without completly changing your spell build.This game can be very fun, but the novelty of it comes and goes, and this game feels like a boring grindfest when it isn't there.Worth something, just not worth $40.

												This game has such potential, but the combat is very linear and grindy, and the bosses/mobs are either too weak, or WAAY TOO TANKY.The second boss for instance. I cannot beat the guy. I've been at it for an hour, and I cannot, not matter how I approach him, get him under 50% HP... The game is WAY too difficult. It NEEDS proper balancing and definitely a rework of the enemies health/damage. And they lied. I don't feel like a badass battlemage, I feel like a glass puppet carrying a large magical cannon.I had a lot of hope for this game, but as I played through I saw more and more fallbacks.

								Hello guysLet me start with saying tis is an amazing indie game but looks nothing less than a AAA game. The graphics and combat feels fluid. This may be the first game i have played that allows a mage to really feel like a mage. There is no cooldowns or mana cost or stamina cost or helth bar. But there is a price for all these powers, in the game u get three charges to ur shiled. One hit can take almost a full shield charge. Once u deplete all the charges u respawn to the previous safe point. The A.I. in this game doesnt feel that monotonous. They have dodge mechanisms and sometimes can suprise you.But keep this in mind this is not even the final game or its not even the alpha version, its a pre-alpha version. Keeping all that in mind, i would say its worth the price and time to play this game.			"

For being in pre-alpha and for $20 I am super impressed.Something that I noticed while playing is that at time it would get a little choppy, but again for the game being in pre-alpha it is in super good quality.Yes I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a challenge, because it is not all hack n slash where you charge right in to battle. You must be careful with how you fight.I will do more reviews as this updates and I play.Have fun and battle on!			"

								tl;dr - Extremely Impressed, highly anticipating the full release. If watching any of the videos even remotely peeked your interest, get it. Do not let ""Pre-Alpha"" scare you off, I've bought games from steam in beta that were less well put together than this. I've bought alot of Alpha games on Steam and been disappointed - this game has vindicated all of those purchases. The game is beautiful, the mechanics are solid, and the RPG elements (spell crafting from dropped mats, multiple spell schools, spell challenges that allow you to upgrade said schools) are interesting and engaging. I've played AAA titles that would have a hard time stacking up to this game in its Pre-alpha form - it's a steal for 20 dollars, and if you were even slightly interested in any of the video's, you'd be foolish to not pick it up now. I had originally intended to list some cons to the game, only to realize I haven't found any worth mentioning yet. The games crafting and spell specifics could use a little more explanation, but seeing as the game isn't complete yet, I feel extremely comfortable assuming they'll be there by release due to the high quality just oozing from the game in its current form. I haven't even finished the current playable portion yet, and I'm dying for more.			"

								This was a good game, for a beta.I found it to be a bit jumpy or slugesh, like when theres lag in an online game. The controls were easy to get and work well. The  magic is standerd fire, ice, and so on, but the ways you use them are new and inovative, yet not unfermilier to players of games like Skyrim. The visuals are easly compaired to Skyrim also, but seem of a bit less quality.On the downside, The game is far to linier for me. I often found myself going down what looked like a different path, but to my disapointment it was a dead end and just to make the game look nateral. Being a game about magic, it makes sence that magic is the main weapon of the game. However, it is agrivating to not have a close range attack. Because I didn't have a sword or dagger, my only tactic was to hit enemys while backing up. The tactic gets repeditive very early on.All in all Battlemage is a good game, but I found myself wanting to play Skyrim enstead. The main problem here is that this game seems to have taken that one aspect out strait out of Skyrim and embelished on it.			"

								Pre-Alpha ReviewIt's a pretty good game with lots of potential. It would be a lot more fun if it was open world. I hope they change the save game feature since you currently have to find checkpoints. Once they add more content with the spells and add some open world parts, it will be an extremely fun game.Pre-Alpha 2 ReviewThe game has been improved a lot. They added 3 new sigils. I've only used 2 of the 3, but delirium and kinesis were both a lot of fun to use. The tutorials and cutscenes also made the game make more sense. Crafting has also been improved and is more straightforward than it used to be.			"

												Lichdom battlemage, first of all, is about playing as a combat mage. Not a wizard. That means it's more like Borderlands than Skyrim.First of all, there are 3 parts to every spell, 3 kinds of magic (necromancy, fire, ice, etc) per slot, and 3 types of spells: sheild/teleport (think similar to telefragging, damaging enemies by teleporting, called ""blinking"", ranged, and charged area of effect attacks.This game is quite like borderlands. There's a spell grinder. There's spell merging. there's tons of havoc-inducing combat. There's tons of enemies. There's bullet-spongy enemies, etc. Just like borderlands.Here's the thing: this thing isn't an rpg. it's the mage character from Hexen/heretic meets borderlands, minus the open world aspect. BUTIn borderlands, you couldn't forge your own guns with parts. In this game, you can.The result is a fair-feeling loot-based first person shooter with tons of havoc and mobbing and spongy super enemies.If any of this interests you, buy it. If none of it does, don't. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.			"

It's a little rough and daunting at first, but once you get customization down and tailor your spells to your specific playstyle, it's a ton of fun. Whether you're making giant AoE lightning storms or throwing giant frost bombs, it's a good time for sure.			"

Pros: - Unlimited Magic powers- Graphics are top notch- Combat is easy to learn and use- Updates usually have lots of new content- Effects look astonishing- Storyline interesting- Enemies are fairly challenging Cons: - Updates aren't very frequent- Mildly repetitive combat- Good graphics require a really powerful PCSo, in a nutshell, I think this game is greatI'd rate the game  8.7/10  "

Early Access Review
								The game concept shows promise.....  As an alpha it is great so this review is subject to change.  The Story, seems sort of..well strange to me, vengence, got it, simple and effective.  Gameplay... the unlimited magic is nice, but the game is not really challenging, I can literally drink coffee teleport randomly around the battle field, the enemy can never catch up to hit me, nor can there spells/ arrows and what not, and I just shoot lighting at the enemy which is easy to do since it auto aims for me most of the time, though sometimes it just completely misses my target and autoaims into an enemy behind a wall....One Gripe I had, is the lack of a jump button, now some may say, what do you need a jump button for when you can dash move... well there are places some hidden with treats, that you have to jump a small stone (that you can reaslisticly just step over) or a Bannister to stairs that is broken, that you would be able to jump over, but instead have to go all the way around it to get there... hopefully they add a jump button, as the lack of a jump button is just there to test the mapping of the game and the levels with out the quick bypass.  We can customize spells and such... but how about armor?  is there ever going to be anything else other than my hands glowin on the screen with the associated elemental powers (i.e. red= fire, blue = ice, white = lightning...etc)  as Alpha level graphics it looks good, but My skyrim with mods looks a whole lot better, I can imagine they will upgrade this to when the game is in a more finished level.  Playing the mage, and only the mage is great.... but lets hope by limiting the player it doesnt bit them in the butt.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I am recommending this for its future potential, not for current content. I will split this up into several parts:For those thinking of buying the game:This game has a great idea behind it; being a mage without the constraints of a mana-bar. That being said, the game itself has little content thus far. If you are looking for a game that you can enjoy and put hours into right now, I recommend buying an elderscrolls game and modding in infinite magika. But if you want to see this game become something great and you don't mind waiting, than by all means purchase it!The nifty stuff:The game is gorgeous. The game has a beautiful design whether it be the cave systems or the city streets, I have played plenty of games that lack the natural feel of the surroundings. As of the most recent update there are now voices, which sound very good.The not-so-nifty stuff:When I first purchased this game I couldn't get the game to load up to the menu without my CPU maxing out and my PC crashing. I have a decent build, so the reason was just the game not being optimized at all. This frustrated me, since I payed for it and I couldn't even admire the menu screen...Once I actually got it running, the first thing I noticed was that the character animation was off slightly, however, after the update that was fixed. I also noticed the controls sometimes bug out and I end up walking into enemies. Also there is no jump, and the warp cannot go up, not even a little bit. I mean, I tried warping up hill and I didn't move, I tried warping downhill and that worked fine, just no up.Overall:The game has potential, it is super linear, but the story isn't bad. For now I will stick to playing elder scrolls games with a infinite mana mod, since this game doesn't yet have very many spells. The gameplay is tedious and repetitive. There is no real reward for playing the game again. Also, the archers are the most over powered things in the game... DO NOT get shot by them, you die from only like 3 arrows (exaggerated). The game developers and it's community are kind, so that makes it a bit better. The spells feel right when being cast, and I think that is important, that they feel sort of ""heavy"", and they do. So the game will get better and probably be worth playing later on.			"

Early Access Review
								I'd like to start  by saying that the concept of this game is outstanding, and as such, has massive potential to be a game for the gaming history books. That being said, the game does still need a lot of work, which you obviously already know since this was an early access download. Firstly, and as a general idea throughout the game, you need to add more diversity to virtually every aspect of the gameplay. For example, the system you use for the spell trees, interesting idea but lacks complexity. Despite the fact that you have four separate spell trees, (fire, ice, corruption, and delerium) you only gave the character three spells...shoot, block, and Aoe. Furthermore, to my knowledge, there is no difference in the spell resistances of all the enemies, i.e. they are all equally vulnerable to all the spell schools. As result, this system negates the need for multiple spell schools and discourages the player from ever swapping between them, with the exception of utilizing the different AoE effects you get when using the blink ability. I recommend branching out and diversifying the players spell portfolio. Next, I feel that the progression of the enemy difficuly and the progression of the character's skill are out of sync. What I mean by that is that the enemies get tougher faster than the character gets stronger, which creates two problems. First, it slows down the game pace, because it starts taking what seems like 30 spell casts on each enemy to finally kill them so a handful of enemy peons can take 20 minutes to kill while the player is ""kiting"" them around in circles. Second, it robs the player of the experience of being an all-powerful mage. In every game with multiple class choices that I can think of, the magical classes (aside from healers) are the ""glass cannons"" of the game, basically a bit squishier than the other classes but they compensate for dealing outstanding damage that other classes can't hope to compete with. By admition of one of the creator's of the game in a gameplay trailer, the idea behind this game's creation is to let the player experience the power of a DPS class like the mage ""without the shackles that are always being put on them to keep them from being overpowered compared to the other classes."" In short, you should give serious consideration to pumping up the DPS output of the mage to nuclear levels, and adjusting the player/enemy progression so that they scale together more appropriately. You can do so without worrying about making the game too easy by adding more enemies, as well as more bosses and mini-bosses. In this way, the players can get their kicks by plowing through tons of trash mobs with ease and the satisfaction of seeing big damage numbers ticking over the heads of their enemies, then presenting them with significant challenges during all the boss fights. This brings me to the next subject...The custom spell creation and synthesizing systems are an excellent edition to the game, keep it, but again I recommend adding more complexity to it. Always the same three choices, shoot, barrier, or AoE. Being able to add properties like crit chance and extra damage through augments is a good start, but as I said, it's still always the same three choices, (offense, defense, AoE). I suggest you expand into sub-categories. Single-target spells, multiple lock-on targeting spells, knockback spells, stuns, snares, healing, summoning, damage over time spells personal buffs, the list goes on and on, there's a lot of room to expand here. This is essentially the first game in its class, a whole new genre, which means you get to write the rules and boundaries however you want, so get creative with it. How about adding distinct advantages for each spell class. Maybe when you use fire spells you have increased speed and damage, whereas with ice every spell slows your enemies but you yourself are also slower and maybe less resistant to damage because your cold and brittle like ice. Furthermore, I recommend you get rid of the corruption spell tree all together and replace it with something better. Corruption and Delerium schools are too similar to ever need, want, or use both, and as long as the player only needs one affliction style, delirium is vastly superior to corruption. Maybe exchange corruption for arcane, after all, what kind of mage doesn't use arcane magics.Also, Barrier and shield are different, but similar enough to make barrier seem like a placeholder spell. Especially because it's completely unecessary to have a seperate barrier spell for each different school of magic yet each barrier does exactly the same thing with no class related benefits. Consider merging the two together. Barrier aspect being the active side of the ability and the shield benefits being a passive ""side-effect."" In the spell assigning page in the players inventory, put the barrier spell where you currently have the shield placed, and when creating a barrier spell, simply add shield health into the properties improved by augments, (example: let either mastery, or control increase shield health). Also consider adding a mechaninc so that a barrier can reduce incoming damage by more than 50% if the player wanted to make a stronger barrier. If necessary you can omit some of theless useful augmentable properties like extra blink distance. Extra blink distance could be advantageous but not practical if you must choose it over all the other, more useful addons..One last thing. randomized results of the synthesis system could be fine tuned a bit. A bit more predictability/consistency in the results of synthesis would be good. I recommend a system more like the possessed weapon crafting system from the game Darksiders 2. Where the player can choose the properties they want to have on the item they craft, based on all of the properties that were on the materials they used in the synthesis process. That way the players can customize their mage more appropriately with their playstyle, thus providing a more unique experience for every player, and also making the game more suitable for people to play more than once. each time they play through the game they can ""create"" a different kind of mage and enjoy a different play style. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read my suggestions, I hope they are useful for you guys. and I can't wait to see the game as a finished product. Good luck.			"

								This game is extremely promising and i hope that Xaviant will continue to develop it into a more full-feeling game. This is their first game and yet AAA graphics, even in pre-alpha. There are some cons: The game is extremely linear and has very little replay value, and runs at very low framerates due to poor optimisation, but im sure that Xaviant will fix most of these problems, and the pros outweigh the cons. The combat in this game is engaging and very challenging, while, as a result of the lack of cooldowns, a mana bar, and your classical mage-like squishyness, still let you feel like a total badass god of the elements. One thing that this game needs is a co-op mode. Not yet, finish the singleplayer WELL first, but when they are done, Xaviant should definitely release a 4-player co-op mode so players can enjoy it with friends. Also, although unlikely, the game would be sooo much better if it was open world... So much better...			"

												The crafting system is a little clunky, but once you figure it out, you can do some amazing things with it. Just make sure you check what kind of spell your making when you make one, and you'll be good. The numbers on the bottom of a spell component are, in order, left to right, Destruction, Control, Mastery. The number in the center is the tier your working with.Give it time, a decent amount of thought, and you'll wreck everything you come across.Rush it, randomly throw things together, and you'll hate the game.

												Murder things in cool ways with cool spells. I have always hated games when you play a mage and you just don't feel like a god that could bring the end of the world. Well this game fixes that. Stop worring about resosrces(Mana? who needs that?) and just think about creative and better ways to overkill hoards of enimies.There are some annoying things like the lack of crfating system tutorial. There is no good totorial on how to use the crafting system. But once I learned how to use it I came to like it a lot.The game did get a little easy first playthrough in the middle but as soon as I felt like a god that could never die the game would throw something horrifiing at me and fix that.The bosses are difficult. There was one that I trounced with ease but the rest were all very epic in their own way.Hands down one of the better games I have played this year and amd looking forward to New Game +.			"

												The game starts out interesting enough and the idea of crating spells in a game fully focused on magic was fun. But about 30 minutes i nyou'll realise that your basically going to spend the whole game doing the same 3 step combo to kill enemies, mastery,control,destruction. Anything else will just take forever. If you don't bring mastery along, expect boss fights to be marathons, the game offers heaps of customisation, but if you want to get anywhere you aren't going to be able to use it.Expect to fight a few undead, a few cultists, and the same 4 demons for pretty much the whole game, they're recycled endlessly with maybe one or two new editions for that level.The requirements seem ridiculous, The game stutters and lags terribly on Medium settings, and after testing on High and very high, aside from being unplayable on my setup it still just doesn't look that good. Attempting to change graphics settings has frozen the game on several occasions as well.I brought this on sale, and still want to try and finish it, but honestly it's just a chore at this point. "

												The game tries to sell you and ""being the mage"" and having no cooldowns and such, but this is one of the most boring games I've every played in my life. The levels are long corridors with pointless little chatter and flashback moments to break up the monotony. The problem is, this just makes the game even more monotonous. The spells never feel very special no matter how much you mess with the crafting system. Theres no reason to be fancy as the game is so ridiculously easy leading with a control spell serves no purpose. The one thing that really bothered me is how SLOW your character felt. The dash limitation is almost as bad as having mana and cooldowns on your spells. This game has some good ideas, but even if you got it on super sale, I couldn't get through even 2 hours of this game without almost falling asleep.			"

												Completely imbalanced. You progress more or less smoothly through the game until it suddenly becomes nearly impossible. Great potential, but inexperience from the part of the developers killed any chance of this game becoming really great.			"

												I'm changing my review for this game because the randomness for enemy buffs towards the end just leaves it being frustratingly difficult. What I like about this game is the customization for play that's presented. A caveat to that, though, is that the tutorials for how to craft your own spells is not great. Halfway through the game, I could have been using the synergy spells, but it was unclear that I had to craft a 'unique' spell shape AND THEN also craft a spell using it. I thought, based on the selection menu, that it just was a passive ability you gained once you crafted it. On that note, the synergies, once I got them figured out, were pretty lame. I had a combo going that would routinely do targetted 17k damage vs. the snyergy 'oh, this cloud is going to randomly wander around the battle field - it's not doing any freezing or damage.' COME ON! THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST SPELLS IN THE GAME!Otherwise, as others have said, it's a really linear and drawn out trek through some beautiful landscaping. I picked this game up for $1 and got like 15 hours of play time out of it, so it's not that bad; the question is 'do I recommend it?' which is no. Getting one- or two-shotted during the final level that doesn't have checkpoints put me over the edge for how much I cared about playing this game to completion. It is repetitive, but I had fun outmaneuvering enemies and etc. when their power was somehow balanced. Once they can knock you down and then kill you within 1 second, it's just broken. Better luck next time, Xaviant.			"

												Expected so much. Got so little.Nice graphics,Poor story,Poor crafting mechanics,Poor variety of desctructive spells,Too much ""weaklings"" to kill and be rewarded with nothing but... Nothing.It was a nice try, but it is almost like everything that was on early access, feels like it came to early and with plenty of things missing.2/5			"

												Where to start...The bad: I started out with my controller only to switch to keyboard after 5 minuttes. It simply doesn't feel right to use the controller with aiming and all that. I found the shield spell hard to comprehend, like there is missing some information to the player. This also made it hard to manage my hp and life. The crafting section is by no means userfriendly, it is in no way intuitive, which might be the reason that added a smart crafting function to do it for you. I then felt that I couldn't get influence on how my upgrades were spend. So you will have to choose the lesser of 2 evils. The tooltips on spells didn't seem to have had a test player in to give their opinion, I found myself moving around to find the actual tooltip for the spell, and not the spell class. Spell class mastery (fire, ice ect.) levels were only visible if you went into the custom crafting section.. hardly where I would expect it to be. Numbers, I was missing a bit of information about enemy hp, my own hp and shield hp. They give little introduction to that, only says that you got 3 bars - don't lose all 3, it is possible there is settings that can add this. I didn't use time on it. First time I wanted to upgrade my fire mastery skill, it took me almost 10 minuttes to find where it is. Once you know it is nice, and they did also give information about how to get there the first time, I could however not find it by pushing every button on my controller.. and the menu didn't have a link. I was about to go to the internet to figure out how to open up the charactor tap (Inventory).The good: It does however have decent artwork, and the controls for movement and combat is easy to learn.

												The good: Decent first-person-magic-shooter with solid graphics, reasonably compelling loot system, and clever magic abilities. Can build your own spell combinations out of the loot you find.The bad: World, settings, theme, and other elements highly derivative of other, better games. Level design is extremely linear (at least you won't get lost). Gameplay feels one-dimensional: the entire game is basically walking from one end of the level to the other, with predictable periods of combat interspersed. Magic system ""levels up"" the powers you use most, so by the time you feel comfortable with it, you're effectively penalized for trying other powers. Lack of developed vendor system means you must rely on grinding/farming to find the last few bits of spells you might need to make what you want.English voiceovers are fine (albeit a bit generic) in terms of quality, but the dialog/writing feels a bit inappropriate. I guess if you're fans of Xena, it'll work for you. Ultimately it's a fine way to kill a few hours here and there if you don't have anything else to play.			"

												The game feels very repetetive, the levels are usually very long but have nothing interesting inside them. They feel like a grind in a poor MMORPG. The story is completely incomprehensible. One level you are in some kind of arctic territory and the next stage you're in a freaking desert without any explanations.I absolutely can't seem to make sense of the crafting system, I get a ton of items but can't equip any of them, and the ""smart craft system"" only offers some upgrades to damage. So far the most effective combo I found playing the game is to use the Kinetic thing to pin enemies down and then crit them with fire. Over and over again. Of course this gets very boring after a while.The graphics are fairly nice though, thanks to the CryEngine 3. "

												I really wanted to love this game.  The primary promise of the developers, to break away from the the typical, ""wizards are fragile"" paradigm is a really appealing one, and frankly, far more in line with most of the popular fantasty stories out there.But, Lichdom:  Battle mage doesn't deliver the fantasy of a powerful battlemage, as promised.  The biggest reason for this is that enemies absorb too much damage before going down.  How am I to believe that I am a baddass when random moster x takes three hits from my fire spell before going down.  Have you ever played a FPS, scored a headshot on a human, with a .50 caliber rifle, and then watched him return fire?  It feels silly, and that was how a great deal of this game felt for me.I am pretty sure that the shield system is supposed to make you feel more powerful, by giving you an alternative to retreating from enemies while you charge a spell, but the feedback from that style of spell is poor, and so it is difficult to know when you are ""doing it right.""  The result for me, is that I found myself giving up on the shield system and just back pedaling from monsters as I tossed (too many) spells at them until they dropped.  This was tedious, and made and certainly did not make me feel like the badass spellslinger that I thought I was going to be.Other issues are also frequent.  The game does not seem to be well optimized in terms of performance.  I find that my system chugs while playing this game, wheras I can play other, more graphically intense games with no trouble.The gameplay starts to feel reptitive, as while there ARE technically thousands upon thousands of spells to create, most of them are just minor variations on each other.  This fire spell has a bigger area, this one burns for longer, that one has a stronger impact, et cetera.  There is little motivation to create lots of varied spells, as most enemies can be approached in exactly the same way.  Hence the tedium. "

												I installed it, tried it and uninstalled it again. Did this 2 times already. Some day I will get this game finished, but I dont know when.Beside beside being a challenging game, there is nothing that stimulate you, to finish it.The pros:- very good looking grafics- simple to understand controls- learning from mistakes actually keeps you going- adapting to enemy behavior changes whole fightsThe cons:- completely linear levels- boring bossfights (only encountered the first)- boring fighting mechanics- boring fighting animations- stupid hopping around and kiting enemys all day long- unpredictable enemy behavior (you have a block-counter attack ability, but you cant actually predict how long an enemy takes to hit you, so often waste time with this)- total confusing crafting system- confusing overall interface- each of your items has a ton of stats and numbers on it, but beside damage and health I never understood any of them- not enough tooltipps- no item tutorial which teach you the item stats- no free choosing of your damage type at the start of the game-engine- save points- the whole saving system (never knew if I actually saved if I quit the game)- crafting systemSimply the whole game is a big confusion. I played a lot of complicated games, seldom used tutorials and always learned really fast how to use all features to my best advantage. But in most of the games, learning new stuff is fun!In this game, it is frustrating, confusing and overall doesnt feel right. Its like forced learning a school topic you really dont like.Lichdom calls you a mighty battle mage. You dont! You always have to run away, run in circles, walk backwards, blink, blink more and most of all...why the ... is your blinking ability only forward, while 90% of your combat movement is backwards. Have they even played their own game?No cooldowns. And why cant I use my blink as often as I like?Using spells like cooking a soup. First you dot them, then you dot them, then, when they start pulsating, you blast them away with a damage attack. While having normal attack powers, a big part of the game is about spell combos, that marks enemys with debuffs, so if you finally hit them with your damage spell, they get impressive bonus damage and instantly explode with great amount of overdamage that actually activate synergy attacks. I dont know what that is, because I never manage to activate such a thing. Like that, every combat is a big quick time event, where you always have to do the same thing. No combat tactics, no cover, no use of terrain.Last and I think least, the developers are really in love with themselves, which is the worst, that can happen to a creative mind. Never loose the ability to criticize your own work, or taking critics.When I opened a thread about the dull combat and bloated crafting system, they told me (and others) like ""go back playing COD if you dont like this"". Thanks a lot. Never played COD. I played good RPG games like NwN and good RTS like SC and AoE. Your game can be as challenging as it want, as long as it bores me to hell, I wont be able to finish it.			"

												To be honest, if I could I'd give this a ""5/10"" review, for a few simple reasons.First off, there is a lot of good here, the spells are great, you feel like a mage and the world looks great, the voice acting is great, but thats kinda where it stops.Movement is slow, you're like a sponge absorbing damage because you cant dodge anything and because of this some fights make you feel like a turret, unable to move. Bosses have very high HP, they dont go down easy and eventually they get boring.The game is very repetitive, you'll have experienced everything the game has to offer after only a few hours.The game doesn't explain things very well, most of the time you'll just be clicking random things hoping to craft a good spell, a lot of the time you dunno what the hell you're even doing.Its a good game to look at because its different, not because its great.Its quite standard and really you should only purchase this if its on sale for cheap, or in a bundle.

												The game tries to sell you and ""being the mage"" and having no cooldowns and such, but this is one of the most boring games I've every played in my life. The levels are long corridors with pointless little chatter and flashback moments to break up the monotony. The problem is, this just makes the game even more monotonous. The spells never feel very special no matter how much you mess with the crafting system. Theres no reason to be fancy as the game is so ridiculously easy leading with a control spell serves no purpose. The one thing that really bothered me is how SLOW your character felt. The dash limitation is almost as bad as having mana and cooldowns on your spells. This game has some good ideas, but even if you got it on super sale, I couldn't get through even 2 hours of this game without almost falling asleep.			"

AI is stupid, small rewords, some small secrets, but rewards again pointless, waisting  your timeI really, really wanted to enjoy the game, but I just can't, I reached to my peak I was worried this can happen, ppl was saying that, game is only fun for like first 1.5 hours, after that gose down, all the same really fast  i will not recomend this game .

												This game doesn't try or pretend to be anything it isn't, while very strongly delivering on what it does want to be. It gives you a very large and highly customizable toolset that allows you to be an incredibly powerful battlemage in lots of very intense combat situations that really keep you on your toes. If you don't make use of your entire arsenal, or if you let your concentration lapse, you will fail quickly. But if you do it right, you are every bit as badass as advertized.The latest ""Use your tools"" video is I think a pretty accurate description of the reviews you see here and elsewhere. Most negative reviewers find themselves fleeing around the battlefield charging up their fireball spell and spamming it at the enemy, Whenever I find myself casting a fireball more than 3 times in a row, I wake up to the fact that I'm a badass battlemage and then I go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and destroy everything and anything in my path.The combat is great and versatile. You'll need strong situational awareness to make sure you're targeting the enemies that need to die asap and that you're crowd controlling whatever you're not killing so you don't get overwhelmed. You've got both targeted and AoE spells to freeze, stun, DoT, burn, explode, you name it, and you can always decide to let the enemy attack so you can go for a timed shield block and nova the entire area.Customization is strong, with lots of options to tune your loadout to your liking depending on whether you prefer to go for a freeze + destroy build, a slow + bleed build or any other style you can think of that synergizes well together. You'll need to figure out a well balanced set of spells to use, not just stack up destruction-only spells and hope you won't get your face smashed in.The story so far isn't very special. It's very black and white but I've never needed an excuse to be a badass before.The crafting is in-depth, but my one gripe is that the menus don't really support the huge number of items and variety that the game has. It's a little hard to know whether this item you're looking at could be best recycled or used in a spell somewhere, simply because the list of options is so large that only a tiny set is on-screen at a time.Level design is fairly predictable (oh look, a combat arena type of space, I wonder if there will be enemy spawns) but the combat arenas are well balanced and the visuals aren't terrible. They're not too special but they don't detract from the experience at all.Spell visuals are great and you feel really powerful vaporizing groups of enemies at a time.			"

Early Access Review
								Just finished my first session and so glad I took the plunge and bought it. Gorgeous visuals even at this stage. Nice textures, even up close. For the most part it was really smooth even with DX11, sync @ 1080p. SFX were nice at this stage. The crumbling rubble/rocks from the ceiling throughout the cave really do add to the atmosphere. The spell wielding hands in view really do remind me of the classic Hexen of yesteryear, but brought up to date visually. Would of been nice to even have a warrior, archer, rogue class as well :)  Eitherway, I am pretty excited at what these talented guys have in store for us. This is what Skyrim should of looked like. A few bugs or glitches to be expected, but from what I have seen so far I have no regret in buying this (my first Early Access purchase). If you like RPG/Fantasy style games then buy today... 100% recommended!			"

												The first of many? The first and Last!Maybe it's just me, but i expected more... much more.-There are many ways you can create spells with different screen effects, some are magic balls that you throw at long distance, some are like beams with impressive short range.They're both useless, only charged attacks make actual damage and it s*cks charging them.-There is no melee, but there is a magic shield, you just need to time it more perfectly than humanly possible. When it works, though, it blasts almost everthing in ""melee range"" (wich is very, very short), it blasts your eyesight too.-Space Bar does not jump (Seriously, what were they thinking???), instead, there is a cooldown limited dodge that often makes you ""blink"" to the nearest enemy, always a heavy melee one. If you charge enough by holding space bar, you unleash a small area attack just like the shield counter, but with surprisingly shorter range, less damage to your enemies and your eyesight.-Your freeze magic does no damage at all and slowly slows slow enemies for a short time, but it gives enough time to swap to a spell that could actually make something, if you had one. Perfect to waste time if you are facing one enemy, and to get killed if you are not.-Freezing enemies attack fast, freeze you instantly for a very long time and you have to start whatever spell you were using from zero (Trololololol)-Melee generic enemies AI:Run towards you > Play Weird/Cute/Funny/Pooping/Sneezing Scream > Attack > Repeat.Simple, it would be too easy to dodge:When you hear the scream, just press the ""not jump"" button + escaping direction = Win! - 100% Easy.Since the ""not jump"" often makes you ""not dodge"", it makes it a bit harder... - 60% Chalenging.What if when you succesfully dodge they hit you anyway? Like 2/3? - 20%! Now That's Badass!Put 3 or 5 of these per wave and let's add some archers!-Skeleton archers AI:Attack you a couple times > walk a little at a random direction > play annoying laugh sound > RepeatSkeleton archers are the most pure essence of evil, they carry bow-shaped assault rifles that almost never miss, does not matter if you are behind cover, dodging or surrounded, they will hit you and they will laugh until they♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.If you were bullied at school, you will absolutely hate this game.Archers also come in freeze attack versions.-There is also a strange mana-ghost-entity that has extremely high hp and launches area damage attacks, they also freeze you. Not much to say about this one, found only one and i died about 3 times fighting it... Plain pain in the♥♥♥♥♥..-There are hidden places scattered through the map where you can fall and die, just because.-The game is Linear, with a few extra paths that give you less sh*tty versions of the same ingredients you will repetitively get, take you to the same places and/or make you walk in circles, since the visual is very confusing, and there is no map.Oh, i forgot to mention! When you die (and you will, a lot), you lose the all the variable points that increase your loot value. And when i say loot, i mean repetitive spell ingredients. These points you get randomly when you kill something, and tend to go up the more useless spells you use, but sometimes not, it's random, try it if you are feeling bold, it's no fun and makes no difference at all, you'll die anyway...To say i expected much more from a game with no currency, no equipment, no side quests, no ""jump button"", no melee attack and shattering video card experience would be an understatement... Quest 64 (Or Holy Magic Century as some may know) is a better game than this...			"

												Re Review of this game.After playing the game Post-Release (presumably, considering there are areas that still show early access, including the review category) I'm sadly disappointed.Lichdom Battlemage has revealed itself to be nothing more than a laggy hardware tester/oculus rift dev kit toy. Why do I say this? read on.First, the story.The game's ""story"" hasn't changed at all from early alpha; badguys killed your wife, stereotypical old man figure gives you powerful tools for revenge, you go on a murderous rampage until the end. It's revoltingly easy to outright ignore at best, and that's the best advice I can give you, aside from this:DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS GAMEthe story is bland, and cliche. ther is so little substance to it that I can't provide much of the review for it because there was simply nothing to review about it. With that said, on to more important aspects.Sound.like the story, the games sound is somewhat a slur where it is hard to understand what stereotypical old man's words of wisdom are, compared to the wild cacoughony of fireballs and undead chanting. It's one of those ""we're gonna need subtitles"" games. to make matters worse, the voice acting is so out of place I genuinely believe they tried to make it that way. its clear the intent was to make the characters relatable by their voice acting (god forbid they try giving them any actual character), but placing actors, phrases and terminology that comes from this day and age in a game that is principally designed to provide a fantasy atmosphere (and do absolutely nothing else) is borderline stupid.Next up, graphics. this is the big one.so clearly, now that we know that the game has no substance there's only two things it could be: a game-mechanic experiment or a graphical sandbox with obligatory linear storyline. or both, in this case.Now I will admit, the graphics on the game are throroughly worked through and incredibly high detail. unfortunately there isn't a computer on the planet capable of handling how poorly the game is optimized, and thusly, if you are intending on playing this game on maximum graphics with your Rift, you'd better get ready for an FPS that's measured in decimal numbers. The game is bearable on medium difficulty, and thats on a higher-end rig, and even then, theres stuttering. in short, the grapics are as great as they say, but you won't be able to actually play the game on those graphics.AND THE FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC OF THE REVIEWGAMEPLAYBECAUSE THATS WHY YOU LIKED THIS RIGHT?well guess what buddy?its nowhere near as spectacular as I would have liked for my ""Groundbreaking super-mage game""in my early access review I stressed the point that a vast majority of the spell Sigils/Elements are Identical in operation: one ball spell, one shield spell, one AoE, and a Blink. In the updates they did change the order of the elements, and they did actually give some of them different utilities (even if this makes some of them far too niche to be practical in 99% of battles) the frost spell is now an actual beam of frost that actually freezes enemies, rather than ""fireball with a frost skin"".while this is a benefit, the fireball still trumps the utility of all, and you really have to upgrade the other spells massively in proportion if you want to use them (in which case, why not just upgrade fire and one-hit everything, or should I say continue to do so) DOminant strategy is still rife in the game, I found. On top of that, the blink is still broken, meaning that you can't perform the attack as advertised within the game, as it doesn't account for holding the spacebar AT ALL.Finally, crafting spells: the other cornerstone of the game.in the E-Acc review, I mentioned that the ability to craft from inventory was debuggy, which is expected in early access. however it was introduced to the player early enough for them to experiment with it as a gameplay element.Three levels In on this playthrough and I still haven't been given any indication whatsoever that crafting even exists in the game anymore, aside from all the components, sigil level notifications and the tutorial (which explicitly ignores how to get to the crafting menu).♥♥♥♥ing. useless.In summary, the game has improved from Early Access, but you can't polish a turd, and thats as much consideration as you should give to Lichdom Battlemage			"

												YouTube link with gameplay at bottom!This game rocks! They took a very new concept of both FPS and RPG and merged them in a very unique way. Bravo to the developers. The game is diverse enough to allow you to change your character and adapt for new roles on the fly. Even with this limitless power, you have to make strong decisions on what you craft and how you use it. Even a simple battle can feel rewarding when you snare the enemies in you magic and defeat them with out ever being touched. The story is my only issue. It is pretty hollow. However, the original Borderlands was as well and look how that turned out. I can easily compare this game to Borderlands. The developer took a risk with random generation in an action RPG and it paid off BIG.Character creation has a lot of trial and error, but even bad spells can make for interesting combat. Nothing is useless. Sometimes you have to adapt, somtimes you need to change. It's all up to the player.I recommend this game. If you want to see some gameplay, check out my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMDqBlbIF7n9rXVOM3Griw~MattmonThe Frigid Gamer			"

												What is this game about and who should play it?This game is a shooter. But not a typical shooter, since you will use self-combined spells instead of weapons and you won't need any ammo or even Mana. So you can fire as long as you want using the spell that you want. In short: The game focusses on beating up tons of evil opponents with spectacular effects. And mostly everyone you meet is evil.That is why the story is straight without interaction. It is just a nice narrative way to justify beating everyone up. The huge and detailed levels are straight, too. So you don't have to look for the next fight too long or walk the same way several times while nothing happens. Furthermore you don't need to be concerned with equipment like armor or any other secular stuff except the spell system.You start the game as a so called dragon with unlimited power to cast and forge new spells. The tutorial is well done to show you how to control your character and how to cast several types of spells like Nova, Area of Effect or targeted spells. You will also learn the basic principles of creating new spells in the tutorial. The rest is up to you to experiment on new spells and spell combinations. But you are free to read the journal where mostly everything is explained.During the game you can use classic elemental powers like Fire, Ice and Lightning but also Necromancy, Corruption, Delirium, Phase and Kinesis to weaken your foes and finally smash them with a huge explosion of what spell you ever used. As said before you can cast these elements as Nova, Area, Trap, Pool, Missile, Lob or Ray spell with three orientations like destruction, control and mastery (which is explained in detail in the journal) which is a total combination possibility of 168 different spells, each featuring different effects. In addition each spell consists of a shape and one to five augments, each with special characteristics like casting speed, critical chance and so on. So the developers don’t lie when they talk about thousands of spell possibilities, just like the developers of Borderland (another great shooter) promised millions of weapons.As conclusion this game is real fun for hours with great replay ability. And when you have once learned to use different spell types to weaken or control your foes before killing them the fights remain challenging but not impossible to win. By the way no spell needs three seconds to charge and you don’t need to block each enemy attack. Just blink away. ;)			"

												Many options for customizing your gameplay exist, but can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning. Combat makes you feel powerful, and the controls are fairly intuitive. If you are looking for a decent story, a dark, immersive setting, and the ability to blast things to dust, then give Lichdom: Battlemage a try!

								Just finished my first session and so glad I took the plunge and bought it. Gorgeous visuals even at this stage. Nice textures, even up close. For the most part it was really smooth even with DX11, sync @ 1080p. SFX were nice at this stage. The crumbling rubble/rocks from the ceiling throughout the cave really do add to the atmosphere. The spell wielding hands in view really do remind me of the classic Hexen of yesteryear, but brought up to date visually. Would of been nice to even have a warrior, archer, rogue class as well :)  Eitherway, I am pretty excited at what these talented guys have in store for us. This is what Skyrim should of looked like. A few bugs or glitches to be expected, but from what I have seen so far I have no regret in buying this (my first Early Access purchase). If you like RPG/Fantasy style games then buy today... 100% recommended!			"

												Unnecessarily HUGE updates, never smaller than 6GB. Only way to beat some bosses is to spam them with crap spells until they get more powerful after dying OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Unexplained spell crafting that SUCKS. Mastery and control make no sense, i've tried switching b/t all types of spells hitting in different orders and none of it does anything other than damage category spells. Enemies spawn randomly and unless you have GREAT 7.1 you'll get killed by a weakling in the back while others annoy you from the front. Too much time spent on cryengine scenery and not enough on making ACTUAL thousands of spells. Yeah, thousands if you count everything you'd never ever ever ever use. I regret the cheaper alphsa purchase. This game should not be in full release if i'm still dl'ing a 7GB update today. Unless it's changing how EVERYTHING works and adding an even easier difficulty I'm abandoning this turd.			"

												So even doh this game has allot of bad reviews I still took the risk of buying it on sale.And to be honest in the first 2 hours I didn't really digg it, wasn't very good at it but I decided I wanted to finish the game.I also did not understand the crafting system, nor do I now really. Just to much effort to learn it, I just craft stuff up if it do's more damage and don't make my own spells.I can't have been that bad, because i finished the game on Battlemage Difficulty. And it took me 22 hours to complete the game on the first go, so thats a very great ammount of gametime.The Developer could have done a bit better of a job, because yes it can be very repeative.Ow I've been walking for 15sec and it's a big empty space I wonder if I get attacked now :PEven doh yes it can be repeative, it's still allot of fun the game for sure has allot of creativity in it.Different Elements you can use against monster at somepoint I made a great tactic to be effective against the monsters and do allot of damage.To recap it all, great game, allot of gametime and it can be repetitive and if like me you bought it on sale for 80% off then you had a good deal.

								The game is too linear.Casting (which you do all the time) is frustrating as it takes too much time to charge the spells.All the spells feel the same.And I don't know how they managed to make spell crafting simple and confusing at the same time.I'd rather just run through the whole game without killing any enemies if that was possible, I just dislike the combat that much.

								Fun for a few hours but gets very repetitive, very quickly and it's pretty mind numbing once you get past the oooh and aahh of it all. It's pretty and could be more in the end, but there's not enough there for me to feel good about the $20 I dropped on it.			"

												 First off the games story is pooring and uninspired. For a game that prides itself on ""Makeing a Mage the badass"" you start out as some grease stain nobody whos girlfriend(boyfriend) is killed and now some wierdo in a robe gives you magic bracers. Your not a student of the arcane who spent years reading through ancient tomes to learn how to throw just one tiny spark of fire across a room or a knowledge theif who broke into a wizards library and too their secrets for your own. Nope you are just some idiot that got themselves killed and now has magic handed to them.Right off your not so much a mage as you are a dude who throws a few fireballs around. The second problem I ran into is that some of the game controls do not work as described in the tutorial videos(which themselves are disruptive to gameplay). The game tells you to hold down space while targeting to do a combo slide spell attack. This never worked for me after several minuets of trying all different combinations of the controls. The game also tells you that you can attune different elements to change how they fire but does not explain how to actually do this. It seems like something that is suppose to open up later in the game leaving me confused as to why it is brought up at all.The game boasts being able to mix and match magic but right away you are locked into only using fire or ice and have to cycle between them. Trying to adjust this at one of the waypoints(the only place you can make changes apparently) the slots are all locked at the begining. Some master magicial huh?These issues might be forgivable if the gameplay felt at all exciting or interesting. The few levels I played where all linear rail shooters designs with really predictable enemie A.I. In fact old school rail shooters like Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, and Doom have more inspired and open world designs despite being graphically dated. Additionally the 3 shield health system is an unessary break up of a normal health bar into 3 arbitrary bars. If they regenerated over time or gave you more power the fewer bars you have it might make it meaningful. Maybe this happens later in the game but I couldn't be bothered to struggle through many boring levels to get there.And to everyone out there who thinks I was not paying attention or just didnt give the game enough of a chance to figure thigs out the truth is the game didn't hold my interest enought for me to care to dive deeper and learn more. Also reading other reviews it looks like the gameplay stays the same throughout and you MUST have mastery equiped to a spell to even make it worth using. TLDR: I felt like more of a badass master mage plaing Darksouls and Magica.			"

The one problem is that this is one of those games where the devs release it as an ""Early Access"" game, and then abandon it a few months later.  Overall, the concept and gameplay was excelent, yet the devs kinda ran away with the game left unfinished.			"

Kind of hard you feel weak at first but thats every game  I dont understand the problem of repeditive game play(borderlands doom duke nukem diablo  and others)but to me i felt like ii hade to think more on what the it takes to kill some thing than just shotgun to the face story is lacking and with a good opener it kind of makes you wonder if the story was rushed or if it was two of them smashed together. I like it though NOTE  Go in to this game with hack and slash mind set and its real fun you go in to it with RPG mind set or True fps and you will be dissapointed			"

												So far I have enjoyed Lichdom Battlemage. It takes a few hours to get used to the fighting mechanics and what your preferred style of playing will be. I will say that the game is a little more difficult than it should be at times; boss fights take several tries unless you're a natural born prodigy, and I have yet to see a way to change the difficulty level. Just make sure you have a system that can handle this game. It was built using the Crysis Engine, so if you are someone who NEEDS to play games on the highest visual levels, but don't have a TRUE high end system, be prepared to lower some video settings my friend. Basically what this game comes down to is : The more time you put into the game, the more you begin to like it (even if you don't like it at all at first).			"

								Played a bit, I had some trouble getting it to run smoothly on my system (though it shouldn't be a problem for those of you with more high-end rigs). I love the idea behind this, and the ability to tear through enemies with massive spells is great. It would definitely benefit from an in-depth tutorial, though, to go over basic spell functions. It isn't the perfect game yet, but it's obviously in Pre-Alpha, but all in all, I am happy with my purchase and I can't wait for future updates!			"

												t's like diablo, you always hunt for better loot. In Lichdom, you try to get that perfect shape with the right stats to deal big numbers damage. And then, mid-way through the game, you discover the SYNERGY shape, a special upgrade to the legendary item which enable you to mix two elements to cast some kind of ultimate spell. Now you're hunting for those special legendary items who can upgrade to the synergy shape and cast flashy spells that deals tons of damage.Graphics are beautiful, the spell effects are amazing, the combat can be dull if you let it be, but if you're trying to combo elements and discover new ways to use your differents shapes with different elements it becomes a lot of fun for the whole game. The default BATTLEMAGE difficulty is challenging, not too easy not too hard. If you're dying often, your shield is too weak, craft a new one with higher HP.			"

												This is a first-person ""caster"" game (as opposed to ""shooter""), where magic is the only weapon. There are no cool-downs, no mana potions. Just a limitless well of magical ability, abetted by a unique spell-crafting system, good graphics, great voice-acting, long (occasionally boring) levels, great boss fights, and a serviceable-but-not-special story. First the magic. There are no other weapons. There are nine elements; each can combo with the others in different ways. Only three elements can be equipped at a time, so there are limits. Results can be explosive (like 27,000 points per combo). The spell-crafting system is deep. Guides are a must, but only the most rudimentary tutorials are provided in-game, so prepare to trawl the forums looking for tips. Fortunately, all spell elements have detailed descriptions; you can spend hours in the crafting window, tweaking and building new spells or breaking old ones apart.Unfortunately, the combat can actually get boring after a while.The enemies are don't vary much from beginning to end; you'll be fighting the same baddies in the final level that you fought in the caves early in the game.  While general level combat is ""same-y"", bosses offer a lot of variety. Several of them are hard as nails and require strategizing and careful spell-crafting to defeat. The path through the game is linear . Arcade levels with massive loot drops hide in caves and corners, so explore throughly. You can only save via checkpoint. Graphics are glorious; it's CryEngine 3, so expect the game to look as good as Crysis 3 (it will also strain your hardware). The voice-acting is superb; Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker have an excellent rapport, presided over by the somber tones of Clancy Brown (remember him from the original Highlander movie?). The story is passable, but after a while I stopped caring.While the repetition wore on me after a while, I still had great fun with Lichdom: Battlemage. It's kind of a hit-or-miss game, though; get it when it goes on sale if it tempts you. If you like it, you'll think you got a bargain. If you don't, then you won't have spent much.			"

								A lot of what I didn't enjoy about the game can be found at the link below, but suffice to say the game is more about spamming combinations of fairly weak, basic spells than about crafting awesomely powerful spells. Movement and casting felt very clunky. And while it is technically true there is no mana bar or spell ""cooldowns"", there is still a casting time and it does take time to charge some versions of spells, so same difference really.http://steamcommunity.com/app/261760/discussions/4/37470848423377721/So unlike the commentary, my mage never felt like a badass.Also be aware that many of the gameplay videos are of pre-alpha and alpha gameplay, so are drastically out of date and show features that have been removed (such as the nova on quick teleport and time slow teleport).

								I've only played a short amount of the game at the time of writing this, but I think I can see a lot of promise in this. This looks like it'll be a great game when finished. The minimum requirements are a bit steep, but with this being pre-Alpha I wouldn't expect anything to be optimized yet. Again with the level design seen here, I wouldn't be surprised if the gameplay here doesn't even show up, or is completely different.I love the idea of being an aggressive, close-quarters mage. Other games have you feeling like a soldier with a magic gun, using only available spells. This game has you using magic as a dynamic power source, almost as if YOU are the person making the magic with your mind. No choice of applications, just whatever you want to do.There are bugs in this game, and I did experience a decent amount of low FPS (although I am running a fairly average 3-yr old system, so that is likely from my end). However, being pre-Alpha, it is to be expected. I'm actually surprised that this isn't just a closed, boring test room with no real background. In short, I highly recommend this game. There are rough edges, but that is to be expected for pre-Alpha. I am very excited for what this will be like when just in Beta phase, let alone fully finished.			"

								Want to know if you should buy this game? Stop, you violated the law! (Oblivion reference in Lichdom? Yes, please!)In all seriousness, hold on for a second. This isn't a final product. You're not buying a finished game when you buy this. It's called ""Early Access"" for a reason. Yes, it's a game, but it's a work in progress, with special emphasis on the ""in progress"" part.First, let's adjust the Settings for your Expectations before you make your purchase decision, shall we? (By continuing to read this, you agree. Otherwise, Vine has some cute cat videos you can watch instead. Moving along...)If you expect this game to have:- Finished graphics, nearly no bugs, lots of features, perfect gameplay, flawless AI, balanced mechanics, etc.Then this isn't the game for you. And also, stop beta-testing and stop alpha-testing. Heck, stop buying ""Early Access"" games altogether, because you just don't get it. If you're going to buy an ""Early Access"" title, it's a preview. Alpha and Beta-testing mean you're there to find bugs, give constructive criticism (when needed), positive feedback (if deserved), and detailed/helpful suggestions to help move the game so it ends up as a masterpiece.This game isn't just ""any old game"". It isn't ready for prime-time yet. And that's alright. You're not buying a finished product, you're checking a preview and being able to give better feedback to the developers, so they can make this game so much better than it is now. If you buy this game early on, before final release, don't whine and complain about it, and don't be mad or emotional. You bought a preview of an unfinished game, and you got exactly what you paid for.If you aren't willing to put down money now for an unfinished game that isn't perfect, and if you aren't willing to give feedback, constructive criticism, and helpful suggestions, don't buy it. Just wait for the final version, and check some YouTube reviews before buying.Lichdom isn't like any of those other AAA titles you find out there, that give ""two weeks beta access"" which is just their way of milking more money from their customers and getting free marketing and hype for their game before full release. This is an *actual* game in progress, not a marketing ploy. I know in this day and age we're getting used to the idea of Beta-Access being a way of getting a head start in a AAA game before full release, but Lichdom isn't going for that. They actually *want* (and probably need) your help to find what works, and what doesn't. If you're willing to be part of the solution, join the community, because we need more people like you here (and in general!) to make this game go from good to great.Now... if you're someone who wants to know what seeing a game in development looks like, if you want to know what beta-testing games is like, and if you want to help shape the future of this game to get the features you want, fix the issues you have with the preview, and be a part of a community that is passionate about creating the ultimate battlemage game you've always wanted, then check out the next part. I'll cover the good, the bad, and the ugly in a moment (best cowboy movie ever reference? or best cowboy movie reference ever?).The Good:- Graphics are amazing, but that's what a CryEngine3 game should be like. (I run it @High Settings with resolution of 1280x1024 using a GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB, and I get very little fps drop. @Medium settings I get no drop in fps.)- Great magic system. Simple, lots of damage, great effects, shows a lot of potential for combat.- The Crafting System is amazing! (Press ""I"" for ""Inventory"", and you'll also bring up the Items, Crafting, Equipment, and more areas for your character.)  It isn't perfect, and there's a lot that needs to be fixed before release. But there's so much potential here. If you're willing to put forth both time and effort into offering helpful and detailed suggestions for the developers, then you can help make this game great!- Monster sounds, soundtrack and in-game environment are *very* immersive - and sometimes terrifying. Play this game in the dark, with surround headsets on, and try playing until a monster spawns right in beside you. Just make sure you have an extra set of undergarments, because you will need to change them.- Combat is great, natural, flowing, innovative. I may be a gushing fanboy (or I probably sound like it), but it really is great. I love what they've done. Sure, there are some flaws here and there that can be overlooked, and a couple that can't, but it's pretty solid for such an early start, and that potential is why I don't regret buying this game.The Bad:- AI gets stuck. Monsters spawn only when you get close to a certain point, and you can easily kite them or get them into a tunnel where you can hit them more easily. It doesn't feel like you're fighting intelligent beings - it feels like you're fighting a simulation, which is 100% immersion-breaking when you cross an invisible line on the ground and monsters start retreaing while you pummel them with fireballs and ice bolts from a distance, or when you keep appearing from behind a corner and the monster sees you and doesn't dodge or blitz to take you down.- Fire magic is really weak compared to Ice Magic, and isn't really a viable option right now - which is bad since it's selected as your default school of magic, compounded by the lack of Tutorial, and that most keys don't show up the in ""Controls"" screen in the Options/Settings area of the MainMenu (""Press F1 for Help"" after you press ""Esc"" to get to the GameMenu screen when you start a new game). Besides giving Ice Magic some slow effects and some paralyze (read: freeze) effects, Fire doesn't have much going for it. I'd like to see Fire Magic as powerful as Ice Magic is now, rather than Ice Magic being nerfed so it's more like Fire Magic. (I guess, as a PC enthusiasts, I can't be blamed for always wanting ""Moar Pow-ah!"" Wait, why is there a forehead-shaped crater on my desk, and why is my forehead bleeding? Let me read my previous rambling and - ouch, that hurt!)- Barrier spell doesn't work well, and it's very difficult to time-block an attack. The lack of visual indicator to show when the time block starts and ends is a bit frustrating. I found dodging to be the only useful defensive thing. RMB doesn't have much practical use, other than LMB+RMB combo.- No voice acting. (It isn't a part of the game yet. That's why it's a preview, and not the full release.) Lore isn't immersive, even though it seems like it might be epic. Right now, it feels like we're stuck in the middle of a game and we don't know why things are happening the way they are. It feels like we've been dropped in the first stage after the tutorial, but with no tutorial, no lore, no background, and we're just left to explore and fight for no other reason than to survive.- Minor graphical shading/lighting bugs, with minor flickering of some objects and textures. Longer-than-desireable loading times. Occasional crashes to desktop.The Ugly:- Long-range damage is very heavy-hitting, and your character has very low health, so he's dead in very hits, with very little regeneration before, during ot after combat (except through items). It sounds nice, but I think I'd prefer something more rewarding, like gaining a bit of health for killing enemies.- Mini-boss fights have way too much health, and you've pretty much got to kite them all the way, while dodging the ranged and close-quarters attacks from the monsters they summon. There's a lot of grinding involved.- Lack of tutorial. Although I've added one here on Steam, in the ""Guide"" tab for this game if you feel like checking it out. If you're new to the game, here's the link:

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comNever before has a game made the mage feel so powerful when compared to Lichdom: Battlemage. There are other good games out there like Magicka, but Lichdom feels different and better. Maybe it’s something about the first person perspective, I’m not entirely sure. I’ve gone back and forth on this game as to why it’s so good and where the difficulty actually lies in it. I’ll try to elaborate for you guys.The difficulty in Lichdom is hard to pin down. It’s not that it’s terribly difficult, but it can be if you end up making the game harder on yourself. This all revolves around your spells of choice. You’ll have more choices then you’ll need when it comes to classes of magic here. By all means, pick anything you’d like. The early game is easy and lets you get a feel for how it all handles. Then, sometime later in the game there is a bit of a difficulty barrier.That point in Lichdom is when you will you’ll need stronger or more well crafted spells. There’s a basic crafting tutorial in-game, but most information can be found outside of the game proper. While this works with most games, this time it doesn’t jive well with me. There are some really cool combinations you can create when crafting and there are some really crappy ones. You can be busy exploring your options and end up screwing yourself over by having spells that will only add up and/or store damage and not have one that deals the direct damage to unleash all that you’ve setup. (I know it takes a special kind of someone, but I am speaking from experience here.) There is a lot of combinations to work with. You seriously need to pay attention when the in-game tutorials pop-up or do some extracurricular reading to get those awesome spells to work out for you. Unfortunately, I haven’t found a guide on making specific spell combinations to be really freaking awesome… I’d like one… a lot. I’m not 100% on how it would work, but something like: find these components and put them together like thus to make X spell. That or a guide on how to get my freaking Undead Hulk from Necromancy and Delirium.On the other hand, you could pick up Necromancy and call it good. It’s definitely not as shiny as well… any other spell class, but it does make things worlds easier. When you kill something with a Necromancy mark on it, that will summon an undead minion to your side and it will fight for you. This is too freaking useful to pass up for first-timers who may like a challenge, but don’t want to get too frustrated. It’s not a cake-walk, but it’s a lot nicer if you’ve got the patience to back it up. I’ve beaten a few of the challenge levels/instances (marked by these artifacts that look like ancient green laser pointers) on my first try with Necromancy where it would have taken me maybe four to five tries with other spell combinations up to not being able to finish them at all.Since I’ve found my groove with Necromancy, the difficulty isn’t much of a gripe. My main gripe with Lichdom is in how the game “feels”. I really enjoy it in a general sense: the spells, the power and the story that makes you want to punch that weasel of a villain in his mustache. Also, I like the first person perspective too! It’s just that the game is so linear. I’m usually the guy that loves a good ‘ol linear game too. The story drives the game well and there’s enough to explore and find on your way so that’s not really the issue. I think it’s the fact that you’re playing a mage… and that’s usually in RPGs… and lately those have been more open. This doesn’t reduce the fun had at all, but there is a tiny lingering thought in the back of my head most of the time wanting to not be constrained to a path that only really arches if there is a side-challenge to be had. The guys at Xaviant are trying to establish an I.P. so they are just laying the groundwork here.I really hope Lichdom has done well because I cannot wait to see what else they’ve got up their sleeves the next time they put out a game. This was a great concept for a game and with this much work done already on the systems and lore, can you imagine what the next game would be like? I hope they don’t make the main focus as a versus multiplayer experience, but I would love a two player (at least) coop experience. It’d be sweet to be setting up and making things explode with a friend! I’m reaching out to see if they have any plans for a sequel.EDIT: Xaviant got back to me and Lichdom did well enough to warrant a sequel! There is no comment on how soon we’ll see it, but the fact that it is in the works is awesome. Great job guys!Score: Gewd.Lichdom has everything you would expect from a AAA game while not being made by a AAA company (kudos to Xaviant for that!) The graphics are amazing, the controls are good, they’ve got a well implemented crafting system all while the story keeps you playing because it’s actually interesting. (I love revenge in my games more than my movies.) It feels very linear because it is, but this is one of the best ways to tell a story and not have you get too lost. There is also no multiplayer, but they are laying the groundwork for an I.P. so it’s forgivable (read as: get over it). It’s easy for me to do because I’m still one of those guys that misses my longer that three hour campaigns in my shooters. Also, it’s better to have a solid single player campaign than an almost finished one with a tacked on multiplayer. It’s only natural to have a game make you feel completely B.A. and want to flaunt your powers in front of your buds while destroying them or helping them destroy another team. We’ll just have to be patient is all. Over all, Lichdom: Battlemage is completely worth the money if you want a game that treats the mage like you feel they should. (Next time let me jump though.)

												This is a first-person ""caster"" game (as opposed to ""shooter""), where magic is the only weapon. There are no cool-downs, no mana potions. Just a limitless well of magical ability, abetted by a unique spell-crafting system, good graphics, great voice-acting, long (occasionally boring) levels, great boss fights, and a serviceable-but-not-special story. First the magic. There are no other weapons. There are nine elements; each can combo with the others in different ways. Only three elements can be equipped at a time, so there are limits. Results can be explosive (like 27,000 points per combo). The spell-crafting system is deep. Guides are a must, but only the most rudimentary tutorials are provided in-game, so prepare to trawl the forums looking for tips. Fortunately, all spell elements have detailed descriptions; you can spend hours in the crafting window, tweaking and building new spells or breaking old ones apart.Unfortunately, the combat can actually get boring after a while.The enemies are don't vary much from beginning to end; you'll be fighting the same baddies in the final level that you fought in the caves early in the game.  While general level combat is ""same-y"", bosses offer a lot of variety. Several of them are hard as nails and require strategizing and careful spell-crafting to defeat. The path through the game is linear . Arcade levels with massive loot drops hide in caves and corners, so explore throughly. You can only save via checkpoint. Graphics are glorious; it's CryEngine 3, so expect the game to look as good as Crysis 3 (it will also strain your hardware). The voice-acting is superb; Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker have an excellent rapport, presided over by the somber tones of Clancy Brown (remember him from the original Highlander movie?). The story is passable, but after a while I stopped caring.While the repetition wore on me after a while, I still had great fun with Lichdom: Battlemage. It's kind of a hit-or-miss game, though; get it when it goes on sale if it tempts you. If you like it, you'll think you got a bargain. If you don't, then you won't have spent much.			"

												The whole ""battle"" in Battlemage doesn't hold up to it's name. A great grab after the %70 discount, but I would sill not recommend this.All you do is fight enemies, go to another, have the story advance and then fight more enemies.The enemy AI can be buggy at times, the tutorial video is tell you things you can't do, there's seems to be a looting system that the game clearly doesn't explain what it does. The status of your character is unclear, I don't know what's my shield, hp mana, stamina is.Main Points-Linear-Looting-Tutorial-HUDThe artistic side of the game looks fantastic.			"

												t's like diablo, you always hunt for better loot. In Lichdom, you try to get that perfect shape with the right stats to deal big numbers damage. And then, mid-way through the game, you discover the SYNERGY shape, a special upgrade to the legendary item which enable you to mix two elements to cast some kind of ultimate spell. Now you're hunting for those special legendary items who can upgrade to the synergy shape and cast flashy spells that deals tons of damage.Graphics are beautiful, the spell effects are amazing, the combat can be dull if you let it be, but if you're trying to combo elements and discover new ways to use your differents shapes with different elements it becomes a lot of fun for the whole game. The default BATTLEMAGE difficulty is challenging, not too easy not too hard. If you're dying often, your shield is too weak, craft a new one with higher HP.			"

												As is indicated, I liked this game overall. I played it on one of the lower difficulty settings so that my health refilled itself more thoroughly. I still died several times, but the game handles death well.Anyway, for more of a review bit:Things I disliked:- Inventory Management. This game has a ton of it, primarily due to the way synthesis works. Synthesis is the term they apply to upgrading spell components, which come in two varieties: Shape and Augment. I won't get into full detail of all you need to worry about with these here, but suffice it to say that there is way too much complexity with this upgrade system, which requires a ton of planning in order to use well. I don't think the game is well served by this, but I can see how it would be hard to simplify as the developers of the game, so I have sympathy for why they didn't. They did add a ""Smart Inventory"" system that automatically upgrades stuff for you, though you lose all control in the process.- The limited variety in debuffs that enemies could apply to the player. There were basically two of them: two different temporary complete incapacitations and a time slow/snare effect. For the incapacitations, there was a freeze condition and a knockdown effect, both of which lasted for a short period of time and both of which could be extremely annoying when spammed. The time slow/snare effect was far more interesting, as it slows the player down and prevents dodging (but not shielding). As I said, all of these effects get overused primarily because they are the only effects the developers have to lean on aside from damage. I think the game would have been well served with a few more interesting debuffs for enemies to inflict on the player.- Lack of variety in ranged enemy attack patterns. Ranged enemies typically either fire one projectile at a time or do a burst of four projectiles, and it is very easy to tell which enemy is going to do which. This makes enemies extremely predictable. I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety in this.- Certain mechanics force specific styles of play. While there are a lot of different types of spells you can make, various mechanics in the game really emphasize playing a certain way over others. In general, damage over time effects are bad later in the game because of the functionality of synergies, which I'll touch on in just a moment. Also notable is that the lightning sigil (name for elements, basically) has a cool special mechanic that really wants you to not use a ray.- Synergies, while awesome, appear very late in the game and force a specific playstyle. I like synergies. A lot. I'll get into why more in the ""things I liked"" section below. However, there were several things I disliked about synergies. Probably the thing I had the biggest issue with was the charging method. To explain: To use a synergy, you must overkill enemies; damage beyond the enemy's health pool goes into the synergy meter. When charged, you can then use the Synergy move, which is a powerful, unique spell. In order to get huge amounts of overkill damage--and thus charge up the synergy--you need to build up mastery (a sort of damage multiplier effect), then hit the enemy with a charged destruction (raw damage) spell. Doing this well will result in huge amounts of damage. The result: Damage over time effects are very bad at building up synergy moves because they tend to deal very little extra damage. That makes damage over time effects bad. I also would have liked to have seen the synergies designed such that, for any three equipped sigils, you could have three synergies. This is generally not the case. It isn't a huge deal, but it would have been nice.Things I liked:- The variety of spell types. There are a lot of different ways to play, and combining different sigils and how you set them up leads to a lot of variety. It is fun to see how to match different sigils and spell types together to create different playstyles.- A decent variety of enemies, especially as the game progresses. There are some neat designs among some of the later enemies as well. Additionally there is a skill in learning which enemies to prioritize, how to react to certain enemy behaviors, and what to focus on.- There is a lot of room to develop skill in the game. Between learning spell functionality, and how to combine effects, as well as how to handle different situations, there is a ton of room for skill and mastery of systems. Understanding how things combine together, and what effects they have, is a key part of doing well at the game, and a lot of fun to learn when those ""aha!"" moments happen.- Synergies are awesome. I love having powerful, unique spells to unleash. I also like the consideration that goes into when to unleash them. There is also a pretty reasonable amount of variety in what you can do with them.- A lot of different sigil effects. I really appreciated how many different types of elements there were in the game. It gives the player a chance to find combinations that they really enjoy, and I appreciate the work that the developers put into the game to make the sigils feel distinct from each other, each with their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.- A variety of environments. The areas in the game have their own looks and feels, and I think these were done pretty well. While overall fairly standard (swamp, snowy mountain, and desert, to name a few), they were overall visually distinct from each other and had a good feel.- Challenge arenas for more loot. I liked these, as they provided, well a challenge in how to handle waves of strong(er) enemies.- I really like the base idea of a Mage-based FPS game.- They do a good job of implementing an ammo-less FPS game.- They have skillful defensive mechanics, which is something I really appreciate.- They handle player failure (death) well, making it part of the game. This is something I really like, and I want to call it out here. I dislike games that rely on quicksave systems and the like; a system like that would be extra brutal in a game like this that has such a huge emphasis on both loot and inventory management. Instead, they have a simple checkpoint/respawn system, and punish death with minor amounts of backtracking, refighting a few battles (which does provide more chances for loot), and a reduced loot quality drop rate (which increases whenever you reach a check point).The TL;DR is: A solid magic-based FPS game that makes you feel like a powerful mage in a good way--by learning how to use your magic well and how to coordinate your spells. Unfortunately, a complicated spellcrafting system can lead to serious problems with inventory management for those that want more control than the smart inventory system provides.As a note to all first person games: If you implement camera-bob, please make an option somewhere to turn it off. My stomach thanks you.Finally, I'd love to see a sequel with a simplified spell crafting system (I like the essence, but there is too much to track, ESPECIALLY with limited upgrades per item) and more synergies.

												I should've listened to the reviews I read. The story line seems reminiscent of a bad porno, trying so very hard to have a plot, but failing miserably. I only bought this because this was on sale and I had hopes that the mage would be a badass. Yes you can customize all you want, but combat comes down to boring rote. There are no redeeming qualities of this game. Plot is terrible if not nonexistent. Combat is outplayed and just plain bad.  Graphics could be put to shame by most games made a decade ago.  Sound and background music actually gives me a migraine. Save your money. Go elsewhere.			"

												They certainly nailed it with this game. Normally you see mages in most MMORPGs out there that are severly nerfed and can hardly use the powers to the max. Its a different story here. Suddenly you have unlimited power that revolves from blastingfireballs from the sky, or even causing enemies to fight among themselves. And to make it all better the potential is limitless. No matter how you play it you keep finiding spells that speak to YOU and only you. For example i managed to make a spell combo that causes enemies to face exploding skeletons and an army of toxic ones. And to make it all cooler i had an army of undead of my own. Simply i was fighting them with their own weopon.I heavily recommend this game. Its a MAJOR challenge for even the most experienced gamers and every run feels and acts differently.			"

												I'm not recommending this game BUT, if the combat and spell crafting mehcanics interest you and you have money burning a whole in your pocket and a steam library already full of better games, you might wanna get this anyway. I bought this game a while back when it much cheaper, I think when it was still beta, I can't remember exactly - ANYWAYI had a lot of fun with this game untill I recently reached a point in the game I can only describe as unbalanced. The game was going pretty good for me up untill this point, the graphics are pretty good, the spell effects are nice, the crafting mechanic is fun and varied (once you learn how to use it which admittedly could use more explaination game wise) and all the different ""sigils"" or spell types are fairly unique. The combat was to a degree repetitive, the game is very linear, but I still really enjoyed the combat and mixing up different spell combos and figuring out how different sigils interact together, crafting spells that fit each one etc. The story is another well... story, its... probably not the worst story ever, but certainly nothing to praise, the characters are not too interesting, the story's not any better, the voice acting meh. probably one of the games weaker points. I was not capitivated by any part of the narrative, and I'm someone who can appreciate a good story. This is not a game one plays for the narrative is all I'm sayin'. You can probably figure out if the combat portion is for you by reading my and others reviews, and if it doesn't sound like you'd love it, you'll probably hate this game.Despite all that I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience, I was just playing on the default difficulty lvl 3/4 I believe, and for the most part having a grand ol' time blasting enemies away with my spells. I managed not to die (except for one time i slipped into water and drowned, oops) untill I reach this big boss, now this boss killed me probably around 8 times and ate over an hour of my life. If I was looking for this kind of excruciating frustration, I would've bought Dark Souls. Keep in mind this game has been for the most part easy to slighly challanging up untill this point (which is generally the kind of experience I look for in a game) so I was quite taken aback at how drastically different the difficulty was. It was like someone turned the amp from a 4 to 11, I honestly think this is a fairly big flaw in the game, something of a balance issue, since even if you like getting your guts ripped out your♥♥♥♥♥and handed to you on your tibia, youd have to mow your way through around 9 hours of squishy punching bags. I take no problem with games that demand alot from their players, I admire the Souls fans, but a game that goes 0 to 100 (real quick) with no warning like this is simply flawed. Myabe i'll return tomorrow and swallow my pride and just lower my difficulty, or maybe i'll just buy Dark souls finally, or maybe i'll just shoot myself, I don't know which yet, but I WONT recommend this game unfortunately, despite its many good aspects. I personally feel that this game came close to being a good game, but didn't quite make the cut.			"

Gameplay is one-dimensional and the story is not particularly interesting; with everything else I could live with one of those, but not both.It's a good combat system but there's just not enough to do. It's a corridor shooter, basically. But not a particularly interesting one.			"

												wouldnt recommend it except if you love long drawn out levels with way to many enemies overly op enemies at times and like being told theres more spell combos then there are (most of the combos are same♥♥♥♥♥♥different element and theres only like 8 elements most of which you wont use as only two elements are actually decent the first being fire which you instantly get and the second is the third spell you get which actively buffs the fire spell for a bit) honestly I cant recommend this game while the first few minutes are fun the same enemies just keep appearing with no change but stats after a few chapters which are made to draw out the game way longer then it should be the story is shoddy at best be main character hunt down bad guys (who just to draw out the story like to run away aton) and yea its really not worth full price I honestly wish I hadnt bought it full price and wish I could get a refund honestly but due to well first of all only now getting a pc that can run it and being bored enough to just go through it to say its finished its safe to say I cant refund it anyway if you want it get it at low price not high			"

												People have unrealistic expectations I think...So let me help you out; If you want a game like Skyrim look elswhere.  If you want a linnear, well made, magic based FPS then this is your game.The game IS very linnear, but it is also VERY fun.  There are a lot of ways to mix and match spells.  You can get really deep into the spellcrafting and micro manage your items to maximize the effect, or you can auto craft and just play.  First few hours I auto crafted until I got the hang of the spells.  Now I can craft EPIC spells.There are only a few types of enemies, and you will often feel overpowered, but then a strong enemy will come along and put you in your place.  The boss fights are tough, sometimes really hard in fact, but all managable.  The graphics are pretty sweet too!  I couldnt play (well) on my laptop, even though I easily met minimum requirements, playing on lowest settings.  Still only got like 20fps a lot of the time, it was pretty rough.But the game IS really fun IMO, but do a bit of research, because it is a very linear straight forward game.  But it is fun as hell to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up with awesome magic.78/100- definitely worth it during a sale under $15			"

								its an interesting game idea but so far the character seems to be draged down by charge time restraining you from an op experience i havent yet seen what abilites lay beyond ice and fire but if possable summoning would be an epic adition to the expereance. these are just a few sugestions but i am excited to see this game finished. also the archers are a little op and kill in 2 hits witch kinda sucks but i can live through it. GL on the game hope its awsome :3			"

								What can i say about this game... it is every spellcasters wet dream. think about it the stuff that makes us mad, cds and mana bars, yeah they're gone. you may think that makes the game to easy, your wrong. it the enemys in this game have more health then you can imagen, it takes alot to kill them and high damage attacks some even have shields of they own, making the game a challange. i have been having SO much fun despite the many bugs. 1 suggestion when i make and cast a persistent spell id like it to be well... prersistent. single target spell turn into channeled rays when they're persistent and AoEs are like constent say like a persistent hailstorm make it a hail STORM. make the time it storms based on mastery or somthing. but yeah that has been the only down side.

								You're a magic warrior. You control different elements and abilities and you can make your own elemental powers and upgrade them. Now that's pretty sick! I love how, as the mage, you constantly fight off hordes of undead and enemies and monsters.Although I can't say for certain for I haven't gotten very far as of yet but I feel the game is missing a basic concept a lot of ""big world"" games have. A home, as in a place you go back to, to hang out or uprgade your spells with a staff of something if there happens to be such an item in the game. So far you're using just your hands which is actually pretty sweet, but it lacks that sense of secrets. Will there be items and customization, will you be able to go into 3rd person? Will there be secret areas and items? These are just things that come to mind, when I think of things that would make this game even more badass.Keep up the great work, the graphic quality is amazing and the animations and physics seem great as well, minus small stuff like characters talking without their mouths moving, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								This isn't a great game. I really expected it to be; I really, really did, but it isn't. The way magic is implemented in this game is a great concept, but the execution is mediocre. The interface for crafting spells is overly complicated, and the only thing spells are good for is blowing stuff up. Where's the healing? Where's the summoning? Invisibility? Where's the COOL? Ok, there is 'blinking'. Not quite teleporting; more like a fast dash-dodge move that calls itself magic, but still a slight redeeming virtue.The graphics had potential. I'd be thrilled if they weren't so close to their finished form. Unfortunately, they need a little bit more than refining and polish. They manage to take a top of the line gaming engine and highly sophisticated techniques and produce something that, in terms of the way the characters move, reminds me of Warcraft III. The environmental scenery is better than that, maybe close to Skyrim, but... it's really easy to spoil the overall graphical feel of the game by neglecting one area, and that's really what happened here.The plot had potential. Unfortunately, it was wasted on what amounts to a TV show where you happen to twiddle your fingers a bit. Where's the interaction? Where's the drama? Where's the picking-what-your-character says??So. The game had potential, but didn't live up to it. I know, I know, it's still in alpha, but... I'm starting to think that alpha versions are actually fairly far along in the development phase, and they're not really going to change it all that much. So I'm prepared to conclude, now, that these flaws and shortcomings don't make this a BAD game. They just make it a MINOR game. No Skyrim here. Just a little placeholder time-waster to fiddle with while you wait for the next real game to come out. I'm giving the game my recommendation because at the moment, and by modern standards at least, it's still a fairly cheap game. But, if they ever start charging over $30 for it, I'll change this to 'not recommended'. The game just isn't worth that much in today's market. Sorry guys.			"

												This review is a Great Wall of Text, but if you're going to read anything, then at least read the disclaimer about content.*CONTENT DISCLAIMER*The content in this game is graphic and mentally disturbing. Not ""Cthulu"" and ""We're-going-to-show-graphic-depictions-in-slow-motion-close-ups-of-people-getting-dismembered-limb-by-limb-and-then-eviscerated"" graphic and disturbing, but very disturbing all the same. The content alone should earn this game an M-rating, and I don't say that out of personal offense. I enjoy the game, but you HAVE been warned.The language in this game, while not constantly M-rated, is definitely deserving of an M-rating, simply because of how often the characters swear. It's completely understandable, given their circumstances, and realistic to be sure, but it's not kid-friendly language, so don't get it for your pre-teen thinking they won't hear a few new words and look them up. Because they will.Seriously, anyone who considers this game: it's more disturbing than the original Prototype. (Not nearly as much visceral gore though.)*END OF CONTENT DISCLAIMER*Also, I use terms from the game, instead of trying to describe them as something else. Watch a Youtube video of it, and you'll understand why.Still reading?Excellent. Let's get to the good stuff.Okay, first off, it lives up to the premise of 'throw out the stereotype of the squishy magic user'.You're pi$$ed-off, you're powerful, and you wreak havoc. Almost constantly. (Hey, even the hero needs a few minutes to catch his breath, right?)Additionally, the variety of spells available to be created is truly enormous; the game lives up to its big promise here.I've only managed to craft a handful of Uniques so far, and they're the endgame content.ABOUT SYNERGIES:Not all Uniques you can craft will have a Synergy, and not all Synergies will be usable***, even if you have the right sigils.Be aware, it's also possible you might craft a Unique and get a Synergy, only to have it not be for a Sigil you've been leveling - which, from what I've been able to discern, really sucks.********Continued in the 'MINOR CONS' section below.*****Continued in the 'MAJOR CONS' section below.Now I'll break it down into distinct pros and cons (of what I've encountered so far - I'm still playing through).PROS:The game surprised me with how long each section is - pleasantly so. If you like this style of game, then it's worth it, considering the amount of content.The tutorial system included in the game was well-written, and well-explained.For the true explorer-types, there are little hidden areas that can only be found with a careful eye and a bit of experimentation, and they're pretty rewarding finds, so keep your eyes open.Old spells can be recycled, in a way, though the amount of each spell which can be recycled lessens as the game progresses.There is a fully-functioning, lore-based save system, and while you lose environmental progress, YOUR progress remains.The villains in this game? Oh, you have no idea. They are evil. As in 'If they were fighting Hitler, you'd be rooting for Hitler*' evil. I'm not kidding. Extremely good job on making us hate the villains.*(I didn't say ally with Hitler. You'd just beat him after the even worse guys are dead.)CONS:MAJOR CONS:*****I don't know if it's possible to re-level a Sigil you stopped leveling. The game informs you ""this sigil will lose all leveling progess if it loses focus"", and it does lose the progress - possibly permanently: it isn't clear if it's possible to re-earn the previous points/bonuses.AT FIRST GLANCE, ALTHOUGH THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, I AM NOT CERTAIN IF I AM CORRECT. If it is impossible to regain lost Sigil levels and upgrades (instead of forcing you to re-earn them), that's a very poor mechanic.If ANYONE is able to verify whether or not this is true, please, let me know - I'd rather have an accurate review, especially as this is a major part of the game. (Also, I really hope it isn't true!)MINOR CONS:***While it is possible to have up to 9 Unique spells equipped, you can only have a maximum of (I surmise) 3 Synergies ACTIVE at any one time (one for each spell bank). (Meaning that, when you trigger a Synergy from the equipped Spell Bank, THAT Synergy is the one that is used.)This is based on my character having two Synergy-Spells equipped on the same Spell Bank (Kinesis, in this case), and being able to use only 1 at a time, despite having both of the other required elements in other Spell Banks (Fire and Lightning).There is no way to cancel a Synergy that you're charging/have fully charged, without actually using it. You will start to hate muscle-memory when you forget this.Some of the more difficult battles (boss battles) can be VERY challenging if you don't have the right sigil combination, and/or you can't figure out what makes the boss 'tick', because NOTHING is explained in those battles; you need to play it by ear, and you need good reflexes.There is no 'try before you buy' (so to speak) selection process for sigils; you don't even get a description of the spells for each sigil until you've already selected it. (You do, however, get a brief overview of each sigil when at the reliquary).VERY MINOR CONSYou can't sprint when you're charging a spell (although you can Blink) - any spell. This can get annoying, but I will concede that if they removed that limiter, the game would become significantly less challenging in certain parts.PRO/CON (personal choice):Somewhat repetitive gameplay, so don't expect to play through it all at once unless you REALLY like this style of play. (And have a LOT of free time on your hands - though I admit that I'm playing this like I play Skyrim: leave NOTHING unexplored.)The entirety of the game is in 1st-person view. I personally prefer that, but I know some people who HATE 1st-person.There is no save-scumming, at least so far as I've been able to tell.*FAIR WARNING*THE ONLY WAY TO PAUSE ALL ACTION IS TO USE THE 'ESC' KEY. NOTHING ELSE WILL PAUSE. REMEMBER THIS WHILE CRAFTING.And the only gameplay tip I'll give:ALWAYS observe the habits of enemies. You can play to the enemies' weaknesses if you know them well enough.FINAL VERDICT:All-in-all, the game seems to be a cross of twich-based, high-adrenaline spellfests, and tense hyper-alertness in atmospherically-fitting environments. Or moments of revulsion at the actions of the villains. STAY AWARE of your surroundings, and how best to use them to your advantage.

Early Access Review
								The very idea of a badass mage game was very interesting so I took on shot on this early access game and I am very glad I did. The controls and simple and intuitive and pretty quickly I was teleporting in and out of close range mixing it up with long range AOE attacks, well timed blocks that reflect whatever the current element you're weilding back on your attackers and the blink nova attack attached to your teleport. Like a lot of action oriented games I can see the game maybe becoming a little repetitive but since this is early access I have high hopes htat the devs will mix up the combat more as the game progresses. Although early in my playthrough so I only have 2 elements so far the idea of swapping elements on the fly to mix up attacks and strategies is a fun one. The crafting system is also fun as you try and discover the different ways the sigils combine to boost everything about your spells from the pure damage, to damage over time status effects and even the speed of the casting or charging of the spell. The story is interesting so far and hasn't detracted from the game at all like so many games have done in the past. All in all a good start and I wish the devs luck with the rest of the games creation. It is good to see another Early Access game that is working and fun to play. Get the fun down first and you can refine the experience as you go.I definitely reccomend this game to anyone who likes to be a badass magic user but is tired of the whole ""glass cannon"" trope that means you can't take many hits before going down. In Lichdom you can take a few hits, nuke the landscape in revenge all while blinking around the battlefield owning face.Keep up the good work guys.			"

								I saw this mentioned in the latest GameInformer...it caught my attention just by the title...or better yet the word ""Battlemage"" The preview review given was positive, so i hoped on steam and watch the trailer...needless to say i was impressed and got the intial alpha.They are making changes pretty quickly to the menu, but i was not upset as i figured things out, the mini tutorials were a nice.Xbox controller support indicated on the inital run, but i haven't actually checked if it works yet.Enemies take a couple of hits to bring down, the variety so far from the intial alpha to now is interesting and forces you to think not just long range attacks but up close with the different types of spells and the elements involved.Still haven't mastered the ""perfect block"" shield technique, but its a clincher in fightsExperimented like crazy so far, currently like producing an ice attack that freezes my enemies, then following up with an AOE fire attack that does burning damage afterwards.My latest run i just got the gravity element...haven't experimented enough attack wise or creating spells yet, but created another ice spell that makes me feel like Sub-Zero :)I look forward to the finished product.

												I'm not recommending this game BUT, if the combat and spell crafting mehcanics interest you and you have money burning a whole in your pocket and a steam library already full of better games, you might wanna get this anyway. I bought this game a while back when it much cheaper, I think when it was still beta, I can't remember exactly - ANYWAYI had a lot of fun with this game untill I recently reached a point in the game I can only describe as unbalanced. The game was going pretty good for me up untill this point, the graphics are pretty good, the spell effects are nice, the crafting mechanic is fun and varied (once you learn how to use it which admittedly could use more explaination game wise) and all the different ""sigils"" or spell types are fairly unique. The combat was to a degree repetitive, the game is very linear, but I still really enjoyed the combat and mixing up different spell combos and figuring out how different sigils interact together, crafting spells that fit each one etc. The story is another well... story, its... probably not the worst story ever, but certainly nothing to praise, the characters are not too interesting, the story's not any better, the voice acting meh. probably one of the games weaker points. I was not capitivated by any part of the narrative, and I'm someone who can appreciate a good story. This is not a game one plays for the narrative is all I'm sayin'. You can probably figure out if the combat portion is for you by reading my and others reviews, and if it doesn't sound like you'd love it, you'll probably hate this game.Despite all that I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience, I was just playing on the default difficulty lvl 3/4 I believe, and for the most part having a grand ol' time blasting enemies away with my spells. I managed not to die (except for one time i slipped into water and drowned, oops) untill I reach this big boss, now this boss killed me probably around 8 times and ate over an hour of my life. If I was looking for this kind of excruciating frustration, I would've bought Dark Souls. Keep in mind this game has been for the most part easy to slighly challanging up untill this point (which is generally the kind of experience I look for in a game) so I was quite taken aback at how drastically different the difficulty was. It was like someone turned the amp from a 4 to 11, I honestly think this is a fairly big flaw in the game, something of a balance issue, since even if you like getting your guts ripped out your♥♥♥♥♥and handed to you on your tibia, youd have to mow your way through around 9 hours of squishy punching bags. I take no problem with games that demand alot from their players, I admire the Souls fans, but a game that goes 0 to 100 (real quick) with no warning like this is simply flawed. Myabe i'll return tomorrow and swallow my pride and just lower my difficulty, or maybe i'll just buy Dark souls finally, or maybe i'll just shoot myself, I don't know which yet, but I WONT recommend this game unfortunately, despite its many good aspects. I personally feel that this game came close to being a good game, but didn't quite make the cut.			"

								I really like the cast system. the graphics are pretty good, as good as many AAA games. The cast system is something that you will have to learn, if you want to become really powerfull, but it is deep and fun. I will have many many hours of fun playing this overpowered mage!			"

Early Access Review
								This isn't a great game. I really expected it to be; I really, really did, but it isn't. The way magic is implemented in this game is a great concept, but the execution is mediocre. The interface for crafting spells is overly complicated, and the only thing spells are good for is blowing stuff up. Where's the healing? Where's the summoning? Invisibility? Where's the COOL? Ok, there is 'blinking'. Not quite teleporting; more like a fast dash-dodge move that calls itself magic, but still a slight redeeming virtue.The graphics had potential. I'd be thrilled if they weren't so close to their finished form. Unfortunately, they need a little bit more than refining and polish. They manage to take a top of the line gaming engine and highly sophisticated techniques and produce something that, in terms of the way the characters move, reminds me of Warcraft III. The environmental scenery is better than that, maybe close to Skyrim, but... it's really easy to spoil the overall graphical feel of the game by neglecting one area, and that's really what happened here.The plot had potential. Unfortunately, it was wasted on what amounts to a TV show where you happen to twiddle your fingers a bit. Where's the interaction? Where's the drama? Where's the picking-what-your-character says??So. The game had potential, but didn't live up to it. I know, I know, it's still in alpha, but... I'm starting to think that alpha versions are actually fairly far along in the development phase, and they're not really going to change it all that much. So I'm prepared to conclude, now, that these flaws and shortcomings don't make this a BAD game. They just make it a MINOR game. No Skyrim here. Just a little placeholder time-waster to fiddle with while you wait for the next real game to come out. I'm giving the game my recommendation because at the moment, and by modern standards at least, it's still a fairly cheap game. But, if they ever start charging over $30 for it, I'll change this to 'not recommended'. The game just isn't worth that much in today's market. Sorry guys.			"

												This review is a Great Wall of Text, but if you're going to read anything, then at least read the disclaimer about content.*CONTENT DISCLAIMER*The content in this game is graphic and mentally disturbing. Not ""Cthulu"" and ""We're-going-to-show-graphic-depictions-in-slow-motion-close-ups-of-people-getting-dismembered-limb-by-limb-and-then-eviscerated"" graphic and disturbing, but very disturbing all the same. The content alone should earn this game an M-rating, and I don't say that out of personal offense. I enjoy the game, but you HAVE been warned.The language in this game, while not constantly M-rated, is definitely deserving of an M-rating, simply because of how often the characters swear. It's completely understandable, given their circumstances, and realistic to be sure, but it's not kid-friendly language, so don't get it for your pre-teen thinking they won't hear a few new words and look them up. Because they will.Seriously, anyone who considers this game: it's more disturbing than the original Prototype. (Not nearly as much visceral gore though.)*END OF CONTENT DISCLAIMER*Also, I use terms from the game, instead of trying to describe them as something else. Watch a Youtube video of it, and you'll understand why.Still reading?Excellent. Let's get to the good stuff.Okay, first off, it lives up to the premise of 'throw out the stereotype of the squishy magic user'.You're pi$$ed-off, you're powerful, and you wreak havoc. Almost constantly. (Hey, even the hero needs a few minutes to catch his breath, right?)Additionally, the variety of spells available to be created is truly enormous; the game lives up to its big promise here.I've only managed to craft a handful of Uniques so far, and they're the endgame content.ABOUT SYNERGIES:Not all Uniques you can craft will have a Synergy, and not all Synergies will be usable***, even if you have the right sigils.Be aware, it's also possible you might craft a Unique and get a Synergy, only to have it not be for a Sigil you've been leveling - which, from what I've been able to discern, really sucks.********Continued in the 'MINOR CONS' section below.*****Continued in the 'MAJOR CONS' section below.Now I'll break it down into distinct pros and cons (of what I've encountered so far - I'm still playing through).PROS:The game surprised me with how long each section is - pleasantly so. If you like this style of game, then it's worth it, considering the amount of content.The tutorial system included in the game was well-written, and well-explained.For the true explorer-types, there are little hidden areas that can only be found with a careful eye and a bit of experimentation, and they're pretty rewarding finds, so keep your eyes open.Old spells can be recycled, in a way, though the amount of each spell which can be recycled lessens as the game progresses.There is a fully-functioning, lore-based save system, and while you lose environmental progress, YOUR progress remains.The villains in this game? Oh, you have no idea. They are evil. As in 'If they were fighting Hitler, you'd be rooting for Hitler*' evil. I'm not kidding. Extremely good job on making us hate the villains.*(I didn't say ally with Hitler. You'd just beat him after the even worse guys are dead.)CONS:MAJOR CONS:*****I don't know if it's possible to re-level a Sigil you stopped leveling. The game informs you ""this sigil will lose all leveling progess if it loses focus"", and it does lose the progress - possibly permanently: it isn't clear if it's possible to re-earn the previous points/bonuses.AT FIRST GLANCE, ALTHOUGH THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, I AM NOT CERTAIN IF I AM CORRECT. If it is impossible to regain lost Sigil levels and upgrades (instead of forcing you to re-earn them), that's a very poor mechanic.If ANYONE is able to verify whether or not this is true, please, let me know - I'd rather have an accurate review, especially as this is a major part of the game. (Also, I really hope it isn't true!)MINOR CONS:***While it is possible to have up to 9 Unique spells equipped, you can only have a maximum of (I surmise) 3 Synergies ACTIVE at any one time (one for each spell bank). (Meaning that, when you trigger a Synergy from the equipped Spell Bank, THAT Synergy is the one that is used.)This is based on my character having two Synergy-Spells equipped on the same Spell Bank (Kinesis, in this case), and being able to use only 1 at a time, despite having both of the other required elements in other Spell Banks (Fire and Lightning).There is no way to cancel a Synergy that you're charging/have fully charged, without actually using it. You will start to hate muscle-memory when you forget this.Some of the more difficult battles (boss battles) can be VERY challenging if you don't have the right sigil combination, and/or you can't figure out what makes the boss 'tick', because NOTHING is explained in those battles; you need to play it by ear, and you need good reflexes.There is no 'try before you buy' (so to speak) selection process for sigils; you don't even get a description of the spells for each sigil until you've already selected it. (You do, however, get a brief overview of each sigil when at the reliquary).VERY MINOR CONSYou can't sprint when you're charging a spell (although you can Blink) - any spell. This can get annoying, but I will concede that if they removed that limiter, the game would become significantly less challenging in certain parts.PRO/CON (personal choice):Somewhat repetitive gameplay, so don't expect to play through it all at once unless you REALLY like this style of play. (And have a LOT of free time on your hands - though I admit that I'm playing this like I play Skyrim: leave NOTHING unexplored.)The entirety of the game is in 1st-person view. I personally prefer that, but I know some people who HATE 1st-person.There is no save-scumming, at least so far as I've been able to tell.*FAIR WARNING*THE ONLY WAY TO PAUSE ALL ACTION IS TO USE THE 'ESC' KEY. NOTHING ELSE WILL PAUSE. REMEMBER THIS WHILE CRAFTING.And the only gameplay tip I'll give:ALWAYS observe the habits of enemies. You can play to the enemies' weaknesses if you know them well enough.FINAL VERDICT:All-in-all, the game seems to be a cross of twich-based, high-adrenaline spellfests, and tense hyper-alertness in atmospherically-fitting environments. Or moments of revulsion at the actions of the villains. STAY AWARE of your surroundings, and how best to use them to your advantage.

												Meh. Bought it on Sale. Pretty game overall. Storyline is decent. But gameplay gets repetitive. They claim that you can make thousands of spells, but there isn't really that many. They could of done much more work in making more unique spells and options for crafting.  Changing the graphics a bit to give the spells some design would of also been nice. Really, there are about 6 different spells; missle, lob, ray, Burst(shield), Ranged bomb. And then the super ♥♥♥♥♥in black hole one you see in the trailer that you probably want to use. But really that's just another ranged bomb. Overall 3.5/10 Could of been much better.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is still in pre-alpha so it's under heavy development. The update yesterday for example had ~ 4 GiB of material, so rest assured that the team is working hard to deliver a pristine experience. It plays very well already, there are not many nasty bugs, and this game does exactly what the guy in the video says it would. It makes you into a mage badass.With the latest update they added a bit of an introduction into the game as well as a tutorial, and what previously was solely combat focused is now getting molded into an RPG. I'm quite impressed with the game so far, I wouldn't suspect it's not even in the alpha stage.While I wouldn't say that it's the only or the first game that unshackles the mage, it's definitely one that decided to take a unique approach to it.In any case, it's an Early Access game, and if you feel you want to get a sneek peak into the game as it develops, or if you want to support the vision of the game, I would most certainly recommend it. So far it was well worth the money.			"

												This game is great, all the downvotes here are butthurt people that can't comprehend the crafting system. Literally play around with it for like 2 minutes and you will understand the intracacies of it. Gamers these days need a bright glowing animation and a wall of text to explain stuff to them because they don't care, or are too stupid, to try to figure out anything themselves.It's a fun game, linear yes - bosses are somewhat challenging in that you have to keep up with them for a long time. The people who say it's repetitive are the ones that are too stupid to figure out the crafting system and are missing like 70% of the game because their inability to logic. Story is pretty interesting too,  noticed a lot of the ""crafting too hard"" people also couldn't follow the story - imagine that.			"

												I voted this game down for one reason, which may seem trivial to most people but which is important to me.  In a game which is all about making magic cool, and which has the the word ""battlemage"" in the tiitle, I would expect to play a mage.  In Lichdom however, you are not a mage at all, but rather a mage's lackey with no powers but those which come from a magic glove your puppetmaster gives you so you can better do his bidding.  This seems like an incredibly stupid design decision, basically a slap in the face to players.As I said, many people may not care about this, and if you're one of them ignore this review.  It was a deal breaker for me though.			"

												Here's where I'd put my review of Lichdom...If I could play it.  It crashes to a black screen after five, maximum ten minutes of gameplay.  Turning the graphics settings down to the absolute minimum does delay the crashing, but doesn't eliminate it.  If this issue were unique to my PC alone I would understand; my card is a fairly uncommon, problematic model (nvidia geforce gtx 690.)  However, some googling and reading of others' reviews has told me that I am not alone here.I bought this game for five dollars, and I ""five-dollars"" like it.  I do not, however, ""five-dollars"" and ""five hours of googling and dicking around with settings to fix endless crashes"" like this game.  At this point, I would rather have that money instead of this game.  I'd use it to buy a fast-food hamburger, and have fewer regrets.			"

												This game really isn't good, i bought at 70% off and still regret it.The crafting system is overly complex and conveluded without much explanation given to the player. Levels are linear and monotonous and enemy fights are repetitive and uneventful.Boss fights even worse so as you can't move much when casting but still need to dodge boss attacks and the vast amounts of mobs that spawn. Do too much damage too quickly to a boss and too many enemies will spawn for you to handle.It's really not a well developed game and leaves you feeling like you're having to fight against the game to play it.Don't buy it			"

												This game is a great example of why I hate FP games.  Clunky poorly animated hands flopping around in mid-air in front of you. ALWAYS looks cheezy, Follow a path while monster after monster comes at you. I don't think the graphics are as impressive as everyone else seems to think they are. They look nice for circa 2006 to me.   I did only play for .3 hours, so I didn't get a chance to explore much of the spell system, but god it was a hard, painful .3 of an hour, I didn't even want to play for that long, but was trying to get to a save point.  I got this game as a free bonus when I purchased the Culling. I should have stayed away from both of them.  Now it's a hassle 'cause i have to let the game run in the backgound to get the trading cards to sell to dumb a$$es that actually liked this game.			"

												• Gameplay 8/10 a little hard to master in the beginning, I had to experiment with elements and parts, and read some of the tutorials to learn how to craft better spells and how to combine them in combat, but once you get a hold of it and you start to dominate it gets very satisfying, you only have a small pool of health even with the strongest shield so learning how to ""manage"" enemies when overwhelmed is crucial. Advanced crafting lets you create devastating spells called Sinergy Spells capable of turning the tide of battle in seconds. The gameplay is almost completely linear, though there's some hidden challenges and loot in secret areas.• Story 6/10nothing groundbreaking, the voice acting is hit or miss and the dialogues can be cheesy, but otherwise it gets the game flowing• Graphics 9/10as with every other CryEngine game out there, it looks impressive even your PC is unable to max it out. Great particle effects, animations and shading. Some of the areas are quite beautiful.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is not a perfect game, but it is a fun romp that I'd recommend.  First off, I'd classify it more as an FPS than an RPG; it's more crysis than DA:O.  Secondly, the claim that there are millions of spells is a bit misleading.  Really there are 3 spell varants: Targetted (ones you shoot), AOE (ones that affect an area), and Nova (ones that go off on your locatoin if you parry block or charged blink in) that you mix with 3 types of augments that will either 1) make the spell do damage 2) make the spell control (like freezing them in place) or 3) mark enemies to multiply damage taken.  There are no mana bars so you can cast spells in any way you see fit, though they take time to cast and charge up (though crafting mods can change the times as well).On the good side, there are some really original ideas here, and the campaign is not skimpy in the least -- it took me about 30 hours being thourough and doing all of the side challenges.  There is some really beautiful enviroment art, with a few standout set pieces that are top notch.  The story is fairly straightforward but works.  The crafting and loot finding can be fun with some issues.  But mostly I liked how they made some great decisions to really let you go wild.  Want to blink around without cooldowns or counters?  With one of the shield types you can!   Want to maximize a spell to just crit like a mofo -- you can!  The combat is fluid and fast paced and exciting by and large.The crafting system is neat and I had fun crafting spells along the way, but it does become clunky and hard to navigate so it is a mixed bag.  It is hard to compare spells you may want to build with spells you are using because of some bad design (like you have to unequip spells in order to look at their parts).  Also, the upgrade system requires you to keep upgrading the low rarity spells into higher ones so your higher ones that you might care about have food to upgrade on - this becomes a chore that takes too much time.  All this can be interesting to some, but could have been much more streamlined. My main complaint is that the enemies always spawn in at intervals.  This to me completely takes you out of feeling like these beautiful, lush environments (very pretty Cryengine3) are really a place that is lived in or has purpose.  Instead it makes it feel like wallpaper that you run though, fight, move forward, fight etc.  Another issue is that I feel like the inclusion of ""Mastery"" spell type (that marks enemies to take multiplier damage) was original, but ultimately a poor design choice.  There seemed to be a best solution that I came upon early:  control enemy, add mastery, then hit with crit or super crit damage.  Once I had a few spells with high Crit chance or Apocolyptical chance (when a crit crits), this by far was the best combat tactic that rendered most of the other sigil powers useless in comparison.  Why infect with Corruption? Why confuse with Delirium?  Why move enemies around with Phase?  Why do any of that when the add mastery + crit damage is 10x more efficient?To not end on the negative, this game was pretty, fast paced, fun, original in a lot of ways and definitely deserves to be played.  I look forward to what else this developer can come up with!			"

												This game looks great and appears to have an amazing gameplay style filled with action and adventure, nope. I spent $40 of my money and 7 hours of my time giving this game the chance it deserved, but it failed me. The gameplay is incredibly repetitive and tires before you even get to find the good spells. Sure the graphics are pretty stunning and there are beautiful landscapes but they are drowned out by the monotonous gameplay and the completely lackluster storyline. One of this games main points is that the enemies are brutal. All enemies are easy to kill except the bosses which are just huge spikes in difficulty. All that happens is they get an insane amout of health and take almost 15 minutes of your time just to kill them. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless it was on sale. Do yourself a favor and spend your $40 on something that deserves it.			"

Early Access Review
								You just end up left clicking through the whole game, because it becomes pointless to even use any cc. Really boring spells, game tries to be hard (Dark Souls wannabe style).Was hoping for some cool spell interactions and abilities, they ended up just being 3 different kinds of spells with some minor additional effects depending on the element used...

												The most exciting part of this game is when you ALT-TAB out of it to figure out your crafting plan in an Excel spreadsheet. That sounds like a joke, but if you don't, you won't get past the first mini-boss. It's arbitrarily rigged to require a particular build. I mean, I do like Excel, but still. This game is a slog.			"

												You know at one point in its early stages i would have recomended it it was really fun the story was filled with mystory and the spells were powerful and the enemys weak but now they have swaped to story out for a supper generic one about revenge with not a single piece of mystory. so now you know the villen and every thing that happend and why and that just make the story encrefibly boaring and ontop of that you are now weak and have to backpeddle to kill any thing the archers kill you in 3 volleys unless you can block or avoide the mass ammount of arrows and spells feel so so so lame it not funnywas looking forward to where this game was going but they killed it dont buy it			"

												At first I really liked the gameplay and the graphic style in the game. The first 2-3 hours are amazing, but once you get to the snow level it gets extremely repetitive, every encounter comes down to casting the same 3-4 spells over and over again until the enemy dies.  The game is so poorly optimized (see all the posts in the forum) and the developer is literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, telling us that the whole problem is based on the poorly done v-sync and that the game is highly optimised. ♥♥♥♥ off mr.

The game is on tighter rails than call of duty.The spell crafting system is boring, unrewarding, and poorly explained.Spells are pitifully weak against anything but trash mobs and crafting never gets you a much better spell in the first couple hours I played it.  Not worth playing longer.This game is nowhere near as good as folks are claiming it to be.  Wait until it is below $10 before purchasing if ever.Final opinion: Teasing Trash			"

												I had a blast playing this game. It feels more like a fast paced RPG shooter than a magic game. You can customize and tweak the spells you use to fit your playing style. The spells you use have to be leveled up, so you have to farm bosses and grind a bit to get past some of the bosses.I must have started playing this after the patches were released, because my game played 100% error free on a mid level Alienware R3.

On top of that, the spells and magic are not very deep dispite all the hype saying that it has thousands of spells.The first BOSS is was out-of-line with where you stand as a character and your only way past him is to build your character to beat that boss.

												I got a voucher for this game along with a copy of the ""Guiness Book of World Records: Games Edition"" entitling me to 50% off the game. When I went to purchase it the price was already down 75%. Neither of these is what convinced me to purchase this game. The card came with a concise description: ""... a first-person caster that gives the Mage the spotlight... with limitless magical power and brutal enemies around every corner, victory hinges on skill and strategy... craft a vast array of spells and learn to cast them in the heat of combat."" Suffice it to say this is exactly what I got.Walking into the middle of a group of brutal enemies (who will kill you in pretty short order if you stand and do nothing) as the single combatant, charging up magic and blast it off to a number of great effects, no waiting for cool-downs or mana recharge was in a way addictive. I my time drunk on the power. With a little thought to the crafting system, and using the built in journal for a very complete description of how the system works I was able to turn almost any combination of the 8 available and very nicely flavoured sigils into a proverbial recipe for mass destruction.Even when the game was hard, and this was often (especially during bossfights), I found myself ensared. In games I've played in the past a humiliating defeat at the hands of a boss was usually enough (after the third of fourth time) to have me put the game down for a while. Not Lichdom though. I found myself fighting the second boss for what must have been the thirtieth time at roughly 2:30am one morning unable bring myself to leave the zone and go to bed. I persisted for what was easily another thirty attempts and finally, satisfied and content, went to bed to dream of frying more skeletons. This fight was a comparison being drawn. I am as powerful as the demons that plague this world. I would later decimate four of this same monster in one fight, further creating the fealing that I am an epic badass.The levels are as the other reviews described, mile long corridors with monsters spawns every 30 or so meters. This did not bother me at all. The game is beautifully realized in it's art, the human enemies you fight hate you and eventually almost fear you (often swearing thier f-ing heads off at you), and the demons are just abhorrent enough to get a twist in the stomache the first time they whipe out out nine thenths of your health the first time you encounter them. While the checkpoints are unevenly spaced and sometimes quite far from eachother, this gave me more of a sense of determination to perform well than it did a frustration that I would lose progress. Dying does nothing to reverse your progress other than to return you to your last check point and respawn some of the enemies (I never had every monster respawn). All crafting material and sigil experience is retained. Every attempt brings you closer the necessary power to continue.Other than the marathon length levels there are 3 other types of play throught the game, and bossfights are repeatable (good for farming crafting materials). There are two types of obelisk that when attacked enter you into a separate gaming mode. The first blocks of exit from the area and spawns a number of waves appropriate to your progression. Every enemy killed in this mode drops loot which floats above the obelisk until every wave is defeated. You die, you get nothing, You win though, you take it all. The second is similar however much longer in that it teleports you to another location and separates a number of these challenges between ""rooms"" which are not blocked off from each other. Again, the loot is kept locked up untill the end to really reward you for the effort and every mosnter slain contributes.The third game mode comes along with newgame+ and is very challenging. They're themed fights that revolve around a number of different premises from slay these 6 waves to shut down these machines by standing in their field for enough time (and deal with the onslaught as you do so). The newgame+ portal can be a little buggy at times but this just to add to the challenge for me, exiting the game and loading it up again asks if you want to continue from where you left or start at the newgame+ lobby, one of these options gives you newgame++ regardless of your progress, every time (this is quite challenging after a while but the crafting materials get you very quickly up to scratch).My favorite thing about this game is the way in which the sigils iknteract with eachother. Using a Corruption sigil Control spell, blasting the foe with a Lightning Mastery while I wait for the Corruption to mature and then obliteration them with a fireball for ridiculous amounts of overkill damage actually spews from the monster a cloud of parasites that due ot the lightning stun the foes around you and set them on fire. If I were to use the Phase sigil instead this would create parasites that cause chaos rifts when they hit enemies, and if I used Kinesis they would be rooted to the spot. The same can be said of Necromancy, once marked, the game records the spells you use to kill enemies and flavour your undead minions after them. Want freezing zombies that corrupt your enemies, then you can do it. This feels truely dynamic if a little under-realized.I would recommend this game to any and all of my friends (they're sick of hearing me talk about it). I read a review that this game would have a perfect sequel by ironing out all the kinks. I agree, but the kinks aren't enough to keep me away.			"

												This game just wasn't that impressive at all. Granted, I don't have a lot of time put into it, but I don'y really plan on putting any more into it either, and that should say something.Their big sales pitch was ""be a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage"". Well ... it just doesn't really feel that way, and truth be told, it just didn't really feel that fun to be a mage either.You can get more of a ""bad♥♥♥♥♥mage"" feeling in any Elder Scrolls game, Kingdoms of Amular, and probably several others. Shoot, the wizard in the Gauntlet game was more of a ""bad♥♥♥♥♥quot; then this guy, and I hated that game.Long story short, I could sum up this whole review with just ""meh"", because that's really how this game felt. It wasn't anything special, just kind of another game in the mix.			"

												If you want to master the elemental forces, it's a pretty good game... the drawback is that the learning curve for the crafting system is steep; the min-maxing required to craft some of the truly awesome spells will probably keep some people from truly enjoy this.That said, watching 20 skeletons explode from an apocalyptic-triggered Arc Lightning is pretty damn awesome, and the synergies available in the late game look like their worth crafing the spells for!

												HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥this game! It truly delivers what it promises: spells that make you feel badass. Real badass! Somehow I thought this was going to feel like playing Skyrim with god-mode on but it's actually quite hard in the beginning. There's a ton of mechanics to learn but once you wrap your head around augment effects, how procs work and craft some spells that fit your play style, you're set for pure ♥♥♥♥ing awesomeness! Even though the lore isn't exactly mind boggling and that's typically what I look for in a game, this is definitely the best game I've played in a long time!One downside I found, though, is that the game, while encouraging you to try out new spells, punishes you to swap out sigils. It's an unnecessary limitation in my opinion. Protip: Have at least one destruction attuned barrier nova spell. There's noting as badass as blinking past an enemy and hearing him explode behind your back.			"

												The instructions are fairly pitiful and full of all sorts of unnecessary teminology where regular English words would suffice. You have to hit the forums to have the slightest idea what's going on, and in the 21st century I would have hoped the in-game directions would be better.Beyond the byzantine crafting system the game was fun precicely until I ran into the first real boss. The frustration level jumped quickly, and though I imagine it is beatable by galvanized blocks or whatnot the developer suggests it is NOT doable by most playstyles, and a game that lets you use different playstyles was what I was promised.All told I sorely regret purchasing this steaming pile of software. It may be good if you have tons of time to tool around with the same battle over and over again, but I certainly do not.			"

												Only buy this game if it goes on sale for less than $5. Otherwise its not really worth it. You only need the nuke abilities from the Fire and crowd Control from Ice to win the game. CC, Charge Nuke, Insta-Kill, Win! Kind of boring unless you think kitiing is a part of the challenge. I was initally drawn in with the thoughts of fully customizing spells and mixing the different type catergories, but what is Ice stays Ice, and What is Fire stays Fire. Nope, no FrostFire Bolt here boys! Otherwise I felt like a Skyrim gimped mage with infinite spam thrown into CoD: Fantasy Mage Era the tunnel shooter experience!			"

But you don't actually have that many spells. It's a lot of the same stuff that you can use crafting for to add your own flavor to.

												One of my favorite games of all time.Pros:- AAA quality visuals and voice acting.- Beautiful areas (first ones are fairly linear, but you get to explore a lot later on).Pros that are also cons for some:- Deep, complex and rewarding magic system. Hard to learn and hard to master, but you will feel godlike once you do. IF you do.- Despite your great power the game still feels challenging. Mistakes often lead to death and respawning at the last checkpoint (Dark Souls style) – you can't save/load at will.- Crafting proper spells is only a half of success – you have to learn to use them in an action-packed environment. You have to dodge and block enemy attacks.Let me elaborate some more about the magic system, which is the main selling point of this game, and yet it puts some people off. You'll see a lot of reviews / forum posts saying ""All schools of magic feel the same"", ""All you do is spam your fireball and backpedal till things die"", ""You only have a choice of 3 spells"", ""You have to kite the first boss for 15 minutes"", etc. I hate to sound arrogant, but all those people are wrong. You can use devastating spell combinations, freeze your enemies, teleport them around or dominate their minds, summon black holes and elementals, raise armies of undead, even slow time for everyone but yourself, matrix style (and watch your frozen enemies shatter into a fine red mist, in slow motion). You can kill the first boss in under 30 seconds if you combine Control, Mastery and Destruction spells (and build them properly). Oh, and have I mentioned summoning swarms of deadly insects?All the ""mindless fireball spam"" posts were written by people who didn't try to explore the magic system. Problem is, the game explains how to combine reagents into spells, but it doesn't tell you WHAT to craft and how to use it to best effect. In order to understand this game, you have to read page-long tooltips. (A lot of people just mindlessly combine reagents and see what happens - I assure you, this is not a viable strategy.) Maybe you'll even have to read a guide on the forums. (Although I believe it's not neccessary - just reading the tooltips and trying to strategize was enough for me.)So if you like to explore complex game mechanics, think and strategize - you'll probably like this game. If you just want to have some mindless fun with magic, if reading long spell descriptions sounds boring - this is probably not the game for you.Also, if you uninstalled Dark Souls after playing for 2 hours, this might not be the game for you – the difficulty is on par with Dark Souls until you master your spellcraft - after that it's still challenging but no longer brutal.Ultimately, this game is all about blowing things up and feeling powerful. You just have to do your homework – your power will be even more sweet because you've earned it.			"

												First off i like the idea of the game how ever this game does not have 1000s of Spells you can just Mod all the spells you have and theres only 3 per sigal on top of that the Boss's are not even worth my times b/c of the fact that they can take 1 whole Shield bar on 1 hit thats not what bothers me what does is that all i have to do is blink to the side and Avoid it as easy as taking my morning s hi t this game is VERY easy and not worth the money i payed for it i all so see many people having Trouble with Corrupted Save files not that i do i Save my save files in a folder else where on my computer stopping Steam from failing 100% of the time as its a Fail Prot system people who payed to play your Game should not have to deal with that you CLEALY released it to soon and were Greedy and now your paying for it i only see 300 some online the other day when it came out there was around 1000 or so being lazy on programing is not worth it in the end and if your short on Cash then find another way to make it other then giving the people a Half♥♥♥♥♥Title roflas far as this Games Element go ( not elements as in Fire Ice or anything like that ) im speaking of course about Gaming Elements like how that dumb biddy follows you around she dies more then once and says its like having spikes in your brain or some thing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that she says this more then 3 times in the game .... not only is it a Fail Story its all so Fail as to keep my intrest that Woman does not help your story case one bit every few check points she shows up and states the obvious ( watch out theres an Amry of Pu ssy undead up ahead! ) no.... really? you think so? what a good lil scout your are you fail pos lol i mean theres nothing a Gamer hates more then being treated like a retard when the game its self is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cant even respect the Avrg Human IQ ( rolls eyes )( Combat Elements ) i found the Combat to be okish... i give it a 45 out of a 100 and thats being nice that whole game all i had to do was use a Frost Spell that shot in a line and i could Freeze everyone then just Crit them all and move on with out having to Spend any REAL time fighting 12 people at once i just butt fu cked them out of the way with 2 shots 12 + 2 = not ok your combat system def needs alot of work b/c your just another broken OP MF running around just derping everything in sight its a Mix of Skyrim and WoW Mage imo and yes its to over powered there is no real combat if your just 1 shotting everything i all ready said what i think of the Boss mobs( Graphics ) this is all you had going for you all though looks wont get you anywhere if the rest of the Formula is complete Trash i do NOT think anyone should buy this game..... less of course your like 9 years old or if your older and just stupid looking to Fap some time away once again your Combat is pretty easy your Story details and how your suppose to keep the players interest are 100% bad  do not even think about releasing a Game to soon just for some Chump change b/c it will ruin you ( middle finger ) could wip up an 8bit version of your game that would rack yours in its balls rofl			"

												Only buy this game if it goes on sale for less than $5. Otherwise its not really worth it. You only need the nuke abilities from the Fire and crowd Control from Ice to win the game. CC, Charge Nuke, Insta-Kill, Win! Kind of boring unless you think kitiing is a part of the challenge. I was initally drawn in with the thoughts of fully customizing spells and mixing the different type catergories, but what is Ice stays Ice, and What is Fire stays Fire. Nope, no FrostFire Bolt here boys! Otherwise I felt like a Skyrim gimped mage with infinite spam thrown into CoD: Fantasy Mage Era the tunnel shooter experience!			"

												Sorry for my bad english first!Unfortunately there are so many bugs preventing me to have a good playing experience. Actually, 3 september 2014, i get random crashes during the loading screens between the maps and sometimes after choosing my char name. The game seems to be funny, the bad♥♥♥♥♥mage idea is great, i play RPG since ""Ultima"" only because i love to go around fireballing everything i see :) But in this moment i'm unable to enjoy.

												... Well, so far, so utterly awful. Enemy spawns are thin, spellcasts are boring and the tutorial both drags on forever and doesn't explain half of everything.Also. This is another example of how crytek keeps relying on stronger computers instead of optimizing their code. The game looks average at best, with excessive lighting effects, and uses way too much processor to do so.IMO, not worth the $40			"

												The game starts off nice but soon into the game you get stuck to easy. A boss will atack from behind cover and you have no chance of getting any further. The game play is fair to immpossible I would keep clear wait till it comes down on price it's not worth it.Would have been better in multi player whitch it's not.

												One of my favorite games of all time.Pros:- AAA quality visuals and voice acting.- Beautiful areas (first ones are fairly linear, but you get to explore a lot later on).Pros that are also cons for some:- Deep, complex and rewarding magic system. Hard to learn and hard to master, but you will feel godlike once you do. IF you do.- Despite your great power the game still feels challenging. Mistakes often lead to death and respawning at the last checkpoint (Dark Souls style) – you can't save/load at will.- Crafting proper spells is only a half of success – you have to learn to use them in an action-packed environment. You have to dodge and block enemy attacks.Let me elaborate some more about the magic system, which is the main selling point of this game, and yet it puts some people off. You'll see a lot of reviews / forum posts saying ""All schools of magic feel the same"", ""All you do is spam your fireball and backpedal till things die"", ""You only have a choice of 3 spells"", ""You have to kite the first boss for 15 minutes"", etc. I hate to sound arrogant, but all those people are wrong. You can use devastating spell combinations, freeze your enemies, teleport them around or dominate their minds, summon black holes and elementals, raise armies of undead, even slow time for everyone but yourself, matrix style (and watch your frozen enemies shatter into a fine red mist, in slow motion). You can kill the first boss in under 30 seconds if you combine Control, Mastery and Destruction spells (and build them properly). Oh, and have I mentioned summoning swarms of deadly insects?All the ""mindless fireball spam"" posts were written by people who didn't try to explore the magic system. Problem is, the game explains how to combine reagents into spells, but it doesn't tell you WHAT to craft and how to use it to best effect. In order to understand this game, you have to read page-long tooltips. (A lot of people just mindlessly combine reagents and see what happens - I assure you, this is not a viable strategy.) Maybe you'll even have to read a guide on the forums. (Although I believe it's not neccessary - just reading the tooltips and trying to strategize was enough for me.)So if you like to explore complex game mechanics, think and strategize - you'll probably like this game. If you just want to have some mindless fun with magic, if reading long spell descriptions sounds boring - this is probably not the game for you.Also, if you uninstalled Dark Souls after playing for 2 hours, this might not be the game for you – the difficulty is on par with Dark Souls until you master your spellcraft - after that it's still challenging but no longer brutal.Ultimately, this game is all about blowing things up and feeling powerful. You just have to do your homework – your power will be even more sweet because you've earned it.			"

												This game is definitely worth that price the graphics are amazing the gameplay is super fun and the spell crafting system is soo awesome one of my best purchases ever made such a good game!! I think most of the negative reviews are from people who don't understand the spell crafting system or people who don't have the patience to figure out where they need to go. I rate this game a 8/10 the only negative in my opinion about this game is there is no map or marker to tell you were to go so it is easy to get lost.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												I havent played such a great ""mage""-game before. Here finally being mage feels strong and mighty.The game reminds greatly of Dark Messiah game just that you are mage, you cant sneak/use weapons.Pro:+ 8 different spell classes (Fire, Ice, Lightning...and stuff)+ linear gameplay, you go through and kill enemies via magic spells+ action+ spells can be upgraded/modified from loot via menu for different effects+ cool and satisfying spell effectsContra:- linear!- overall you can say that the spell diversity is kinda fake, because the way you shoot spells are the same: lob (balls you throw and fly in an short arc) and missles (like the name says, more recommendable than lob), aoe=aoe8.4/10  great game			"

												FUN!Remember that? Fun? You know, what we had with the games we grew up with? I haven't had this much fun since Clive Barkers Undying. And that's actually not a bad parallell. Along with Dark Messiah: Might & Magic. If you've played either, you'll recognise elements of this game. To be perfectly clear: This is NOT a role-playing game. This is a shooter, plain and simple. This was one of the myriad of Steam Greenlit games, and one of few to have real promise. It promised much indeed, so imagine our surprise when it appeared to deliver on its promises. I played the early access, and that was... well, it was early access. This version is a different beast entirely. Oh that's not to say it's flawless, there's still the odd graphical glitch to iron out, but I can live with the twisted slavering hellbeast charging towards me being twisted and slavering the wrong way, with its hind legs seeming to stick out from its ears. Such glitches probably happened often, but I only noticed it twice. OK, three times.You see, it's fast-paced. But well-paced too. You get breathers. Moments to explore, to admire the view.No, not like that. It's not an open world. This is, as I've said, a shooter, an FPS. Of the old school. You get dealt a hand, and those are the cards you play. No debate. The game world is a series of corridors and arenas, and it's not that the game is constructed in such a way as to make you forget, or not notice. No, you just don't care.I am glad to see an entry into this long-neglected genre, and I am recommending it to my friends. (Honestly, I'd recommend that people buy it, if only to support a developer willing to take a risk. With game development being as cash-bloated as it has become, risks are few and far between.)			"

												Lichdom Battlemage is a game advertised as a limitless opportunity mage RPG. The object of the game is portrayed as having limitless possibility in the spells you can create and use in an epic adventure, kind of similar in style to Skyrim.This isn't the case at all. Really. The game's crafting system consists of 3 aspects, all of which are decently limited. The type of Sigil (Sigils are most like elements, like Ice or Fire or Necromancy), the type of spell (Beam, ray, ect.), and augmentations (bonus stats). This game is incredibly misleading in the whole 'limitless' aspect. In my time playing, most of the spells I've made pretty much seemed to do the same thing, if not slightly different. Throughout the game I really just didn't feel like I needed to use anything besides a fireball. The game really gave me no reason to use anything else, because all spells are crafted using the same basic typings and that greatly hinders the actual variability of the elements. And, even when the game did influence me to use other Sigils, it was in really bold, childish, and boring manners. Some enemies either had shields that blocked one instance of damage, forcing me to use a ray (And navigating the awful crafting menu to equip it. Mercy.), or an enemy might have been resistant to an element. Also, speaking on categories of enemies and the like, this game was very unclear about anything that was happening. Enemies give you no warning when they attack, big or small, which wouldn't be an issue if the game was intended to be that way. It just feels like big hulking monsters can walk up to my backside and slug me for half of my health without me even noticing. Overall the game was just a big disappointment. Don't pick it up.			"

												I like this game, however it could be better... my only complaints are.1. Enemy AI is terrible.. every unit in the game just runs straight at u not trying to dodge or hide or anything, just autolocks and sprints at u.2. would be 100% better if the game was randomly generated. Seeing areas for the first time is awesome. but then seeing the same exact enviroment never change is kinda lame.3. Bosses: regardless of what boss it just comes down to .. Shoot Shoot kite.. Shoot Shoot Kite. kinda upseting.4. Kinda same for enemies.. harder enemies that dont die in 2 hits is the same.. kite kite shoot type of thing.However VERY skilled players can play the game dramatically different. I have one setup which is ultra  aggressive based on the block mechanic where a perfect block negates all damage. Instead of kiting and shooting you sit in the face of the enemy the entire time. makes the game extremely more fun however is extremely difficult to pull off.			"

												This is the most epic piece of sweet-meat-FX-Techdemo I've played so far. Magical effects everywhere around you and you can't understand a word the tutorials are trying to teach you once the crafting system is introduced. To face the facts: It's really not the most impressive game in the world concerning depth. However, it's atmosphere, powered by the Cry-Engine's mathematical lighting, paired with the impressive Combat-System definitely makes it a great experience and worth the money IMO.			"

												Got this game ""free"" from a lootcrate a while ago, took me a few months to try it because it looked like garbage: I was wrong. It's not incredible, but it's definitely not horrible. The visuals aren't bad and the gameplay is pretty darn fun. The story is probably the worst thing about the game, but it isn't so cringey that the game is halfway unplayable. Difficulty spikes here and there, but I definitely had fun with it. 9/12			"

												Truely a good game. I am only about 10% into the game getting ready to kill the last of the first antagonist and the game play is smooth and fluid not a hic up to be found and I am playing at max settings with only one little stutter that lasted 1 second. Fairly challenging game play for boss fights. I would deffinately reccomend this to anyone that gets into this type of game.			"

												This game caught my eye a while back and it looked pretty cool so I got it in a bundle a little while ago and man was I let down. I didn't even complete the game thats how much it let me down I couldn't even make myself march through the repetitive and clunky combat to see the end as it just wasn't worth it. The game was pretty and had some cool spell combinations (I found myself ripping people apart through teleportation and singularities) but man was it dull after killing the same three enemies for 6 hours hunting for some form of story or cool new mechanic that would keep my interest. But no I couldn't even find that and I'm normally able to sit through some pretty awful stuff for a pretty awful story. So no I can't recommend this game and that makes me really sad.			"

												This game is quite enjoyable once you get into it. The spell crafting system is quite deep. I was playing with an agile shield and found the game quite fast paced and the boss fights just hard enough to enjoy. I am not yet finished the game but I will definitely finish this one. I can't belive how much bad press this game gets. Sure it isn't the most polished thing ever but the graphics are more than good enough and the combat is enjoyable aslong as you keep up with your crafting. I imagine that it would be pretty slow if you didn't create new spells with more power. I bought it during a sale. I would buy it on sale again but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												I like the graphics, is excellent, but other than that gameplay is horrible, 1st, crafting system too complex, without the crafting recommendation you will have no clue what to do, can be improved by making it auto upgrade when you pick up the stuff, till now nothing is done you have to manually craft though i'd just click the recommended craft coz idk what is going on.2nd, combat is huge design mistake, melle is fine, but the ranged monsters are annoying, sometimes i get knocked down and freezed continuously, also you will be continously dodging and running from ranged attacks which is not fun for me, I do not feel powerful at all. I'd like to use all of my spells and not be limited, i don't get why would the designer limit the number of spell you can use to just 3. Ranged monsters should be reduced dramaticly or removed.4/10, just need minor imrovement here and there to make the game good but so far i'm not seeing any patches to improve gameplay.			"

												I'd recommend maybe in the $15-20 range...it's like a graphically polished version of the spell fighting in Skryim but more aim assistance/homing.  You get to build out new spells, i never quite got the hang of it seemed pretty random whenever I tried. The story is solid and the main voice actor is Mr Krabs which is pretty sweet. Worth playing to the end but not much else.			"

												I am not sure where this game came from but I saw it on sale and have been blown away.1) It looks A-MAZ-ING.  The environments, the spell effects, everything2) It has AAA polish.  No crashes as of yet.  Solid animations.  Satisfying sound effects.  Looks good - FEELS GREAT.3) The depth at first is quite frankly daunting.  But its simple enough (thanks to Simple Inventory Option) to have fun right away, but complex enough that 12 hours later I am still learning things and still marvelling at all the mechanics and how they work together.You will like this game if you liked Skyrim (mage play), Bioshock 2 or Infinite, and Borderlands.  Its deep but fun.  Its addicitng.  Its pretty damn fantastic. "

Early Access Review
								A game were the mage is the badass? Count me in!!!!!This game has gne and made a mage the main badass in the game. Your are the Dragon!!! a powerful mage apprintace that on a quest for revenge. The game has a very simple but very rewarding cfafting system that you make the spells from scratch from fire balls, bolt of lighting, to gravity, you have a full arsenal of plain B.A pain enflicting spells to combat the evil force of the cults. The game is just comning into the full ver. still being updated this game is worth trying nice well made great effects to also lots of undead to destroy for zombie slayers so comn and become the dragon you were meant to be!!!!!!!!

												Good concept, good graphics, very competent technical execution. The problem is that it's so BORING!This should be called a backwards walking simulator. You just spend your whole time walking backwards, waiting for your spell to power up.It feels that this game was so close to being something awesome but they padded the hell out of the game to artificially make it longer and it ultimately becomes repetitive and very, very predictable.I do hope they make a sequel as I'm sure they would have learned from their mistakes.A game that you can see had a lot of promise but missed the mark by a looooooong shot.

												This game is definitely worth that price the graphics are amazing the gameplay is super fun and the spell crafting system is soo awesome one of my best purchases ever made such a good game!! I think most of the negative reviews are from people who don't understand the spell crafting system or people who don't have the patience to figure out where they need to go. I rate this game a 8/10 the only negative in my opinion about this game is there is no map or marker to tell you were to go so it is easy to get lost.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												FUN!Remember that? Fun? You know, what we had with the games we grew up with? I haven't had this much fun since Clive Barkers Undying. And that's actually not a bad parallell. Along with Dark Messiah: Might & Magic. If you've played either, you'll recognise elements of this game. To be perfectly clear: This is NOT a role-playing game. This is a shooter, plain and simple. This was one of the myriad of Steam Greenlit games, and one of few to have real promise. It promised much indeed, so imagine our surprise when it appeared to deliver on its promises. I played the early access, and that was... well, it was early access. This version is a different beast entirely. Oh that's not to say it's flawless, there's still the odd graphical glitch to iron out, but I can live with the twisted slavering hellbeast charging towards me being twisted and slavering the wrong way, with its hind legs seeming to stick out from its ears. Such glitches probably happened often, but I only noticed it twice. OK, three times.You see, it's fast-paced. But well-paced too. You get breathers. Moments to explore, to admire the view.No, not like that. It's not an open world. This is, as I've said, a shooter, an FPS. Of the old school. You get dealt a hand, and those are the cards you play. No debate. The game world is a series of corridors and arenas, and it's not that the game is constructed in such a way as to make you forget, or not notice. No, you just don't care.I am glad to see an entry into this long-neglected genre, and I am recommending it to my friends. (Honestly, I'd recommend that people buy it, if only to support a developer willing to take a risk. With game development being as cash-bloated as it has become, risks are few and far between.)			"

												Lichdom Battlemage is a game advertised as a limitless opportunity mage RPG. The object of the game is portrayed as having limitless possibility in the spells you can create and use in an epic adventure, kind of similar in style to Skyrim.This isn't the case at all. Really. The game's crafting system consists of 3 aspects, all of which are decently limited. The type of Sigil (Sigils are most like elements, like Ice or Fire or Necromancy), the type of spell (Beam, ray, ect.), and augmentations (bonus stats). This game is incredibly misleading in the whole 'limitless' aspect. In my time playing, most of the spells I've made pretty much seemed to do the same thing, if not slightly different. Throughout the game I really just didn't feel like I needed to use anything besides a fireball. The game really gave me no reason to use anything else, because all spells are crafted using the same basic typings and that greatly hinders the actual variability of the elements. And, even when the game did influence me to use other Sigils, it was in really bold, childish, and boring manners. Some enemies either had shields that blocked one instance of damage, forcing me to use a ray (And navigating the awful crafting menu to equip it. Mercy.), or an enemy might have been resistant to an element. Also, speaking on categories of enemies and the like, this game was very unclear about anything that was happening. Enemies give you no warning when they attack, big or small, which wouldn't be an issue if the game was intended to be that way. It just feels like big hulking monsters can walk up to my backside and slug me for half of my health without me even noticing. Overall the game was just a big disappointment. Don't pick it up.			"

												I bought this game during a sale for 10€, after hearing about it from Totalbiscuit's WTF-is video. To give you an idea from which viewpoint I'm coming from, I could be charactarized as the type of gamer that doesn't care much for story elements, but rather focus on how enjoyable game mechanics are. The first three (3) issues I noticed were:1) You can't skip the long boring cutscenes [technically not cutscenes since you are still in control, but you can still not do anything].2) Horrible mouse acceleration turned on, with no option of disabling it.3) Forcing the player to play hours before the more fun mechanics are unlocked (which allows you to use loot to craft spells).In summary, I'm very dissatisfied about the lack of polish this game have considering the price (10€) I paid; fights were dull, technical issues were plentiful and gameplay progression was badly paced.

												one of the absolute worst storylines ever crafted so far, horrible voice acting, dialogue, ANIMATION, the only thing goin for this game is graphics, and that's it, they aren't even great, they are just good. Especially for the release date, on top of that the mechanics of the game are busted, can't properly use certain attacks and moves since the game does OTHER things, ie, can't hold space, considering if you tap it, it moves you instantly.The attacks are waaaay too slow in the first place to even be good against a wave, what kind of doom-like game would have slow animations? its ridiculous. Good thing I got this for 10 bucks. And even then, it wasn't really worth a try.			"

												Ignore the metacritic reviews - this is a fun game to storm through.

Certain shield types can also dramatically change the way you play, increasing the variety even more.Could do with some more enemy variety and patterns (a pattern is the 'form' of your spell like a missile, bomb, beam etc).Levitating an enemy then smashing her into the ground with a fireball to explode on all the surrounding enemies just doesn't get old ;)			"

												It's just Skyrim spellcasting with a difficult spell crafting system and unexplained mechanics. Just go mod some spells into Skyrim for a more satisfying and cheaper alternative.Lichdom: Battlemage is really all about building your spells. Yeah, you can cast them too, but the combat is really nothing new; if you've played Bioshock and The Elder Scrolls, then you know how this game plays. Lichdom is those, but without physical weapons, and it's linear.The problem with spell building in this game is the lack of explanation. There are really uninformative tutorials about ""Control Attunement"" and ""Mastery Attunement."" Basically, they make the enemy take more damage, and one ensnares them. But these extra effects don't happen 100% of the time, and Master and Control get consumed by... uh... something and then damage gets stored and... um destruction spells (of which there are more than Fire I guess?) go more damage and release the pent up damage. Except that this uncertain chain of events that you glean from shooting spells around doesn't even happen all the time, and the game doesn't even start you with the spells having their intended function. For example, the game plays a tutorial that says the Kinesis Spell should ensnare an enemy (make them unable to move). I lob my Kinesis at a charging monster, and he's like ""LOL THAT FELT CUTE"" and blades my in the nads. Wait, what? What did I miss? There's Mastery Tutorial, Control Tutorial... What's the actual difference between them, and how should they be used? Why do the enemies sometimes get the sigils above their heads? How does that sigil get there? Oh look, I just killed one with the sigil above its head and my spell does more damage temporarily, neat. Why does a freeze ray freeze the enemy, but the freeze missile doesn't? How come in the tutorial video it freezes the enemy but when I cast it, there's no freezing? What do the two bars mean during a boss battle?

												It's just Skyrim spellcasting with a difficult spell crafting system and unexplained mechanics. Just go mod some spells into Skyrim for a more satisfying and cheaper alternative.Lichdom: Battlemage is really all about building your spells. Yeah, you can cast them too, but the combat is really nothing new; if you've played Bioshock and The Elder Scrolls, then you know how this game plays. Lichdom is those, but without physical weapons, and it's linear.The problem with spell building in this game is the lack of explanation. There are really uninformative tutorials about ""Control Attunement"" and ""Mastery Attunement."" Basically, they make the enemy take more damage, and one ensnares them. But these extra effects don't happen 100% of the time, and Master and Control get consumed by... uh... something and then damage gets stored and... um destruction spells (of which there are more than Fire I guess?) go more damage and release the pent up damage. Except that this uncertain chain of events that you glean from shooting spells around doesn't even happen all the time, and the game doesn't even start you with the spells having their intended function. For example, the game plays a tutorial that says the Kinesis Spell should ensnare an enemy (make them unable to move). I lob my Kinesis at a charging monster, and he's like ""LOL THAT FELT CUTE"" and blades my in the nads. Wait, what? What did I miss? There's Mastery Tutorial, Control Tutorial... What's the actual difference between them, and how should they be used? Why do the enemies sometimes get the sigils above their heads? How does that sigil get there? Oh look, I just killed one with the sigil above its head and my spell does more damage temporarily, neat. Why does a freeze ray freeze the enemy, but the freeze missile doesn't? How come in the tutorial video it freezes the enemy but when I cast it, there's no freezing? What do the two bars mean during a boss battle? Red is health, but what is the green one?When crafting a spell, do I have to worry about attunement? Well the Contagion spell says it's affected by it, so probably. How do I do that, and why would I choose Mastery over Control? How come when I freeze an enemy they take extra damage from Fire but not Lighting?*** The game iteself never really explains any of this, which is a big problem considering that this is the entire freaking point of the game.***So, the one important way that this game is different from Skyrim or Bioshock has been obscured by a complete lack of explanation.

												Lichdom: Battlemage is an interesting case of a videogame especially for a game that came out 2014. As in, some aspects are strong yet others are very weak. The graphics are pretty darn good, but the world itself leaves much to be desired. The voice acting is great, but what they're saying isn't very compelling. The spell system seems cool, but its saddled with a complex and poorly explained craft system that always looms over you reminding you of its existence. The story is also very perplexing from a general design standpoint. It quickly thrusts you into a revenge plot, then quickly gives you powers with little explanation, then thrusts you into a world you know jack squat about. Motivation is at a premium story wise. The spells schools themselves can also be annoyingly similar in a game that claims a robust magic system. Sure you can change some spell attributes and mechanics but what each school does is pretty set in stone and fairly tame. This is especially sad when you only get three schools at a time. Worse when you usually stick to a school because you need to keep pumping xp and craftables to make it better. At the end of the day I can tell the devs did put effort into this game and its by no means absolutely horrific. But there’s too many flaws to really give a solid thumbs up. "

												I had hopes for this game when I first saw it but shortly after starting it I realized it was going to be a bad one. The only pro I see about it are decent graphics.- The characters and story are bland and boring, nothing makes you really connect with them.- There are maybe 10 different enemies repeated throughout the entire game.- The combat is boring and repetitive and the spell creation is confusing unless you spend time trying to figure it out, not to mention you don't get to make any cool spells, each of the spell classes has essentially the same setup. A missle spell, a shield blocking nova, and an AoE.- The levels seem endlessly long and I found myself skipping everything I could half way through the game just to get it over quicker.I cannot recommend this game at all even on sale.

												The only thing this game really has going for itself is the graphics. The settings and landscapes are beautiful. But it stops right there. Nearly everything else about this game just makes is terrible.Cons:-Almost zero story. Some dude murders your wife and you want revenge. Dialogue that isnt pointless might give some insight into back story but its slow and slim.-Combat is completely repetative (for both the enemies and yourself). Its the same 5 enemies thru out the entire game. They do the same attacks everytime... It gets boring fast. The boss fights always throw something unexpected at you tho, so expect them to take a few tries to defeat.-Miserable inventory. So bad they give you a smart inventory that does almost everything for you and Ive almost completely relied on it because inventory and crafting new spells is just a mess. -The game has trouble playing on some systems. I had to reinstall the game after experiencing the most trippy graphical failures Ive ever witnessed. The game worked after the second install with no further problems but Ive read that some people experience far worse.Overall the game just isnt worth playing in my opinion. Too repetative. Too Linear. Even obnoxious at points. Oh and you know an action game is really f'ed when there is no jump key.			"

												When I played it during early access stage I did not like it. Well, it did not have any voice-overs at the moment, no motivation to go forth. Just pure concept. WHen it got out, I did try it again. And I actually lie it. A bit off my style, since it's purely ased on magic and I am more of a slasher guy (like knifes more than guns in real life too), but... It feels pretty good. Reminds me of Hunted: Demon's Forge. And I liked that one. As as with Hunted I want to get deeper into the lore here. I want to know more about the characters. That is enough for me. At least at the moment.Still not sure about the crafting system. Yes, I can see that it may give some small beefits, but.. So far it feels a bit useless. More like a vanity customization. I mean like changing ""forms"" may give some tactical advantage at some points, but other than that, do not see much point in it. Maybe it will change a bit later in the game, though.Graphically it looks quite solid. Maybe not perfect (some animation on female Gryphon seemd a bit odd), but really solid. And yet it runs pretty smoothly. And even though it's mainly dungeons they do not seem to repeat each other (at least not so far).In terms of audio it is good as well. I liked voice actors here. They ar eone of the reason I am reminded of Hunted: Demons Forge. It's similar to it: a bit of humor, a bit of an attitude from both characters, but yet some kind of understanding and acceptance of each other. Like there is a bond there already, that will only get stronger (don't think that in a romantic way, though, since will kill male Dragon's goal).I think I'll give it an 8.			"

												In nearly every fantasy-themed game I purchase, I play a spell-caster first. Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, TESO, WOW, EQ, FF, Divinity, all the BG and NWN games, etc. When I heard about this game, I got excited. Boy, was I let down. This game is repetative. RE-PET-TA-TIVE. I have several hours into it, and I don't think I'm going to play it any more. Much of what I have to say has already been said in other reviews - tons of kiting, one-hit kills, totally linear, story is meh. I won't belabor the point - this is a steam-summer-sale-75%-off purchase, not a 40 dollar game. It has some redeeming qualities (the spell-casting is gorgeous, the voice acting is solid, and the environments are lovely [even though they are just setpieces,]) but I would not have paid 40 (or even 30) for this game, knowing what I know now.

I thought I could use my new fast travel ability and get that shield recharge that was still waiting for me near where I had just defeated the boss. What awaited me were all the undead and the boss was back and kicking too. Additionally my rarity modifier was reset to 0 and because I went to the boss area I could't turn back to fast travel again -.- ...bye motivation, lets play something else.			"

												I find this game hard to review, because it has some really repetitive corridor gameplay, mixed with awesome spell casting, combat and visuals. You are the titular character, either male or female. Depending on your choice, the opposite gender joins you as a companion who pops up now and then to be sarcastic, which i actually found hilarious.But what's craptastic is just how ""go from point A to point B"" the gameplay is, it literally follows the same template level after level with samey enemies, except for the ""wanna punch a puppy"" difficult bosses.And what pretty levels they are, earning the CryEngine 3 badge with honour. Foresty, icy, deserty, it's all here folks! Overall, if you don't mind the painful linearity, then i hesitantly recommend this.			"

												Initial Thoughts. I need more time to play it since I have barely made it past the tutorial stage, but so far I find it challenging and fun! In addition, I can't say I have really played anything else exactly like it in the FPS genre. If I had to describe it, (which I will) it would be Bioshock, without weapons except for plasmids/vigors, and no manapool to exhaust. Your battle effectiveness is solely based on your skill and how powerful you make your ""plasmids"" along with how you modify and upgrade them. There is a hole realm of customization of spells and abilities that I seems to be pretty robust, though I have yet to actually grasp the crafting system for these spells and abilities yet.  There is still a roughness to this game. The gameplay itself is pretty solid, so this is probably why the developer decided to officially take it out of Beta. However, there are still parts, like player direction and a lack of proper explanation of skills, that seem to be lacking. In general it is mostly in presentation more than content where the roughness exists. It's not polished yet. So if you want a game to just be mindless on, your probably better off looking elsewhere, because you might actually have to... read stuff... i.e. the in game journal to understand things. That being said, the story is interesting, and gameplay is challenging. I foresee a lot of enjoyment / rage  in the near future.  I am really looking forward to it.			"

												Great game, but has some notable System Requirements.EDIT: Alright, I have noticed a lot of negative reviews for this game, and also have just a little spare time on my hands, so I am going to detail this up a bit. First of all, this is very much a hack-and-slash sort of game (hack-and-cast?) So if you were expecting Morrowing or Skyrim, look elsewhere, although it has some RPG elements. The gameplay is innovative, with a crafting system that gives you some kind of progression. The game is hard, the minions actually can do a lot of damage in certain parts, and the bosses are tough (although I think they sometimes have way too much health, dragging out battles as opposed to making it hard). Also your spells are pretty amazing and flashy; certain spell combos will make special effects, so that is cool.The game tries to make you feel ultra strong and such, and it really does. To balanced out your seemingly overpowered-ness, you are pitted against a lot of really strong enemies, notably demons in certain parts.Now for pro and con list:+Innovative crafting system, which is difficult to abuse to it's fullest, but is very rewarding once you do+ The spell effects have a lot of flashy effects, which combined with the destruction you are inflicting, gives a real sense of power.+ It is fairly difficult, but enjoyable. You can always tweak down the difficulty to make it easier to play if need be.-The game requires a fairly beefy computer, with some really high system requirements. As such you may have difficulty running the game without heavy tweaking to the graphics and resolution.- Some parts of the game are just agitating. Being frozen solid for 10 seconds is annoying.- Repetitive enemies, mostly just reskins of past enemies but beefier.Overall I would recommend this game, but only for a certain type of person. If you are the guy who always plays mage, or wants a difficult yet enjoyable game, this is a good choice.			"

The crafting system might be very confusing in the begining but once you get the hang of it you can create spells of immence power. The way you cast spells could be a tiny bit different to my opinion but it is still better than I expected for all those spells.All in all this games like an fps version of Skyrim as a wizard and i think it really works.

												Lichdom Battle mage is bad. Pretty bad.Not convincing enough? Okay, here we go:To get the positive out of the way first, it looks good... mostly... but then again, it's built on the CryEngine 3, so I'd be more surprised if it didn't.The levels are visually nice and varied, if a stretch overly long at times. Most of this is skybox and unreachable scenery anyway, and here's why:For starters the leveldesign is an absolute joke. Linear to the point of being forced down a tube. Whatever little branching paths there are, they end after ~15 steps for an optional battle arena. The game started out pretty well, with somewhat expansive levels, but at some point in the first 2-4 hours they dropped the pretense and started stuffing you down a pipe. I honestly can't tell you if the leveldesign gets better again later, because I'm only a few hours in and the game already bores me to tears.There are points-of-no-return every other pace and arbitrary unpassable walls blocking the way forward if you didn't kill all the enemies - which can be gamebreaking in itself, because if the physics spell launches an alive enemy out of bounds it might keep you from killing it, thus blocking you from progressing any further.At times the monster closets are so bad they made me physically cringe. Screenshots of the worst offenders so far are in my gallery - the noted example being a tribal tent, blocked of by a black texture, slightly transparent around the edges and often not properly aligned. Remember, this is in the middle of your path, not in some remote corner only accessible via jumps (you can't jump anyway, but more on that later).The bosses are absolute shit. All of them being exhausting bullet sponges that often spawn a theoretically infinite number of minions (if you keep killing them) who also function as their main threat. Because so far not one of them really packs a punch, except perhaps for being able to absorb a million fireballs. A lot of them are also totally contrived. Not built up or mentioned before, not afterwards...At times the antagonist is even sitting in the middle of the arena, behind his everything-proof-shield, blurting out tortured and badly delivered one-liners, while you blink and jog around the boss-arena.Bosses with much health aren't a challenge if that is the only string to their bow. It's just a nuisance. A boring grind, that you may have to repeat a few times, because an off-screen archer with freeze-arrows nailed you on the spot just in time for the bosses only attack.The other enemies aren't much better, variety basically non-existant. The game attempts mixing things up by giving some enemies special statuses like ""lieutenant"", ""massive health"", ""seething"" or ""cursed"" - all of which manifests as a large white text of aforementioned phrases floating over the enemies head, and a little glowy effect playing on/around the ememy model. Seriosuly, did this game just turn to stealing tropes from MMOs? And even some of those differentiate their 'elite' monsters better.Most of the npc animation is quite awful, uncoordinated and even glitchy at select times. The old mysterious dude in his long flowing robe once turned up with said robe apparently frozen solid, his giant sleeves clipping into his ... well, everything. Also there's a ""visual-audio-log"" npc with a comically stretched face.The movement of your character is somewhat alienating and unimmersive. Moving by foot is just a pace to slow for me getting around the drawn out levels and walking backwards is even slower... in a game that mostly has you backpeddling from hordes of monsters while throwing fireballs at them. Yeah, what genius figured that one out.Also, you can't jump. At all. That alone is always a death sentence for a first person game in my eyes, but in this case it was probably so the leveldesign could employ more invisible walls hidden in knee-high rubble. It can turn into a perilous lack though, when you fall between jagged world geometry and can't jump/wiggle out of it.With certain shield-spells you can blink-teleport a short distance, but only 3 times before there's a cooldown. Not that you'd know that without trial, because there's no UI for said cooldown.The UI on the whole can go do one. The emission of a reticle seems weird for a first person game. I remember reading somewhere that the devs left it out because it would've turned the game too 'shooter'-y... ?Not that the game strictly needs a crosshair, since the main projectile spell has an embarrassing amount of auto-aim. It's so bad that often you can't shoot archers past melee-enemies because your spells take a sudden right turn. There are lobbed spells and ray spells but those don't have the necessary range, so no help there.The ingame inventory/crafting system is such a mess that you can switch between two modes. One where you can mess about with the spells yourself, and one that flatout offers to combine and craft better ones automatically for you. There's no tutorial or wiki to be found anywhere that properly explains a thing and no amount of dicking around will explain what 'mastery' actually is or why control-spells are a worth a damn.Talking about people that don't get the crafting system all being casual plebs would be all very well IF there'd be some merit to the damn system. Instead the crafting itself is largely bland. There are very few combinations that actually shake things up and as for the rest - seen one elemental projectile-spell, seen 'em all. Only thing that changes is the incrementally bigger number that appears when you hit an enemy. It's the whole boring borderlands gambit, in theory an infinite number of spells but all that changes is the fineprint i.e. +X% higher damange numbers and crit-chance. Level-ups are similar: Instead of gaining new abilities, for every level up on a spell-element you get tiny increments of more damage, crit or similar indirect stuff.You can supposedly get synergies and high damage setups by combining different spell-types that apply 'stored' damage and debuffs, but honestly, I have yet to encounter a non-boss enemy that survives long enough for that to be useful. In bossfights it might be more helpful, if you get a chance to apply the debuff, cast stored damage setup and release the payoff with a projectle spell (hoping it doesn't drift of to hit sth. else) before the timer runs out. However between dodging projectiles, slapfighting with the bosses minions and the finicky spell-select I honestly can't imagine it...Aside from the bosses taking half a million hits, there has been no situation where my trusty flamethower and auto aim ice lance have failed me, as long as I occasionally update them to new levels of 'make things +X% more dead'. Most critters die in 1-3 hits anyway, and this is on the second highest of 4 difficulty levels... At this point it seems like a minor complaint that the writing / delivery are quite atrocious and that the overall story is a largely impenetrable mess. The characters are absolute jokes, case and point, the antagonist: poncey hairdo and - no joke - an evil moustache. Orders the protagonists wife murdered for no other reason than because he can, and is generally a saturday morning cartoon villain.So, all in all, a thoroughly dissappointing mess on all levels.Not even the kind of bad that is fun to mock. It's exhausting, boring and irritating.Which is a shame honestly, since I've been looking for a game similar to this, something to replace Dark Messiah as my go-to intense action FP-RPG.If you want a game with an interesting skill/spell-combination element then go for Transistor.If you want a first person rpg with intense melee-combat/magic that very much isn't TES, try Dark Messiah.Whatever you do, don't waste money on this (35+ bucks, srsly?), not whithout a massive discount. Get it for a 5'er maybe, just to see how to not do videogames.			"

												This game is super fun, so much magic,beautiful scenery, and I think there is a somewhat long story line. Also the only somewhat bad part of it is the somewhat long loading screens and it is caped at 30fps but other than that it doesn't take away the fun experience. 7.75\10			"

Early Access Review
								Even though my average fps on this is 12, I have to say this game has some serious potential. Let it be known though it is early access and everything can change. I do have high hopes though and look forward to further updates. Also its a bit difficult to understand all the games mechanics, so be sure to spend a bit of time just f-ing around to learn the basics.			"

												The game is advertised as letting you play as a badass wizard. I at first thought this sounded amazing, looked at the trailers, read the descrition and ended up getting quite excited for this. After a few hours of playing i got so bored of doing the same thing over and over again, all the spells feel the same, Just throw a ball of fire and then a ball of kinetic stuff and they do the same thing with small effects that seem useless to me. nothing during my entire playtime made me feel at all powerfull. Just imagine this scenario; You're fighting reanimated corpses which you would expect to be really weak being corpses and all and in a game that's supposed to make you feel badass you would think that the corpses you're fighting would be atleast exploding or shattering or flying off from explosions or something right? Wrong, all you get after casting whatever boring ball of something you have as a spell at them a few times is just a small explosion at the most.Maybe the game gets better later on, I read the forums and saw people talking about some amazing spells like storms and tornados and summoning a demon. But I saw nothing even close to being badass or awesome for the few hours I played before giving up due to boredom.Overall i'd just say to avoid this unless you love grinding for hours against boring enemies with boring spellsApologies for spelling and such			"

												from what I've played so far, a very fun game, with awesome spell customisation that offers a lot of variety! The downside is I havent played much due to extreme performance issues. My computers spec is quite a fair bit above the recommended spec, but there is awful lag and it freezes and crashes after a few minutes at a time now. Lowering the graphics settings does absolutely nothing to help, so I assumes its issues within the game. It's a very good game, but I would recommend anyone thinking about buying it wait for at least a couple more updates to fix these issues.			"

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordMy friend told me about this game ~1,5 years ago, he said he really loved it and its amazing.Well, he's a huge fan of Magic (Spells and stuff), so, obviously this game is great for him.Well, i didnt talk to him for a year, i dont even know him anymore at all.I personally think this game is pretty cool. It gets boring after a while though.-GraphicsThe graphics are insanely amazing, i love the level-design and all.Some people said this game runs bad on their GTX960 on lowest graphic settings.Well, i can just say AMD>Nvidia. Especially in Price/Performance.Im currently using a AMD Radeon HD7970 and i can run this game on 60+ FPS on the highest possible settings with the highest FOV.-GameplayI really like the idea and all, but sadly the game gets really repetitive. Atleast for the first few hours.The Story is pretty bad. I didnt really care at all.Also the battling gets pretty repetitive. There are 8 different ""Powers"" as much as i've noticed, you can only activly use 3 on your character though. If you want to use the others you need to get to that Checkpoint thing and switch, which i really like :3Also, you unlock them by playing, you start out with fire, then get ice and more stuff!Well, its definetly a great idea, the implementation isnt that great though.I'd still recommend that game, especially for people like my ""lost"" friend who love magic.-SoundsThe sounds are insanely good. The effects, Music, just everything is amazing.Didnt have such a great sounds experience for some time.-ControlsThe game has inbuilt video tutorials that play when you reach a certain area where its required. That way you can learn all the techniques pretty easily.The controls are pretty simple and good. I like them. You can switch your different Magic Powers (Fire, Ice, etc.) with either the mouse wheel or the 1-3 buttons. You mainly use your mouse for attacks (LMB, RMB or both, also TAB works instead of both).-QualityIts definetly a great game. I have not experienced any bugs except once, when i first started the game and changed the resolution, it crashed. But thats it. Other than that the games works insanely smooth.-Overall ExperienceI do recommend that game, its great, but gets really repetitive after some time. I dont think its worth its 36,99€, but if you get in on sale, or in a budle for like 5-10€ its a great game.If you want to get this game for the story, dont even think about getting it. The story is insanely boring. I'd rather spend my time rewatching ""Black Bullet"" instead of playing this game for the Story...Well, i can definetly recommend this game if you get a cheap deal.			"

												Perosnally i think this game is a mix between serious sam and Dark souls.Repetitive gameplay, with the same monsters spawning with almost identical time intervals.I got to the first boss, and i get how the mechanincs works, two adds are present at all times, regardless if you kill them off.There is a massive dude who can one-shot you, which you have to kill, along with another dude who invincible untill you kill of the big dude - what i cba with is to make perfectly timed blocks along with dodging, running and constantly be aware of adds and two bosses.But if you're into that kinda stuff, it might be just for you, if not, you should probably look elsewhere for entertainment			"

												When I purchased this game during the alpha stages for fun, I expected nothing, and I was left disappointed in the alpha.Now, it is fully released and I replayed it again, It is indeed one of the better indie games i've played.If you're planning to play this game, I recommend you click 'J' in-game and read about spell crafting.Without the knowledge about the crafting system, you will get bored and eventually just quit.The levels are VERY linear, putting you through corridors every level. After awhile, it will get boring...IF you dont understand the crafting system. What kept me addicted and playing is the fact that after every boss fight, I find a new spell (sigil). Since I failed to find information about the other spells on the internet, (no one posted anything...weird) I was excited and tempted to find out what exciting spell i will get next. One complaint i have is that some bosses are too cheap. They can 2 hit you or something.7/10P.S- ♥♥♥♥ Delirium (no idea how it works, pretty much useless)			"

												This game starts out pretty fun - you get to feel like a badass mage with a lot of cool spells. Unfortunately the game drags on towards the middle, and gets utterly boring in my opinion. You stand around slowly slinging 8 or 9 fireballs at the basic enemies untill they die, and an obscene amount more against bosses and mini-bosses. The levels become an absolute slog to play through, and you'll just start running through everything instead of playing the game like you maybe should, and feel frustrated when you get to a magical barrier where you have to kill everything to be able to proceed.Not only that, after finishing the game you get put in front of 5 or so portals you're supposed to clear, as if the story isn't actually over. I tried the first one untill I realised it's just doing king of the hill over and over and over again. TLDR: Looks pretty, gets extremely repetitive. "

Everone has wanted a game that you are a kick butt mage and but this aint it, firing your spells that are very limited in number have auto aim and take any skill or real feeling outa it.

												A unique blend of first-person shooter and spellcasting.  No mana.  No guns.  Just you and your hands unleashing all sorts of cool magic (e.g. fire, ice, necromancy, etc.).There is even a comprehensive crafting system that lets you create your own spells.  If that sounds overwhelming, there's a ""smart inventory"" that streamlines the process and lets you focus on upgrading your spells and abilities with a click of a button.Give the game a try.			"

												After having played the game for an hour, I am quite dissapointed: This game unfortunately looks amateurish, in fact I have not played a game that looks so dated for a long time; note that the screenshots and video had me fooled too. Story and gameplay to this point also feel lackluster. I can therefore not recommend that you make the same mistake I made and buy this game at full price.I bought this game because I have no more FPS left to play, unfortunately it does not feel like a shooter, since you do not have to aim with your magic (apart from area effect spells)...The game this feels most similar too is ""Painkiller"", which I only test played and also did not like.

												This game lets you play a mage with no mana, no long cooldowns, and none of that annoying crap that prevents you from playing a truly spectacular mage in other games. The combat is fun, the crafting is deep and difficult to master, and the story is excellent. Deserves at least an A in my opinion, maybe even an A+. The only downside is it is VERY intensive on anything but a very expensive computer so be careful before you buy.			"

												Overall the game is good and I can overall recommend it. Rating 6/10The graphics are really good. The game is just beautiful to look at. Animation of effects are on point.The controls felt on point. You can actually cancel a cast to block an attack! Very rare these days. The gameplay itself was, although quite repetitive as the game is literally a linear level design with spawning enemy groups you hack your way through, made satisfying and well balanced. They achieved what they were going forThe game has about 10-20 hours of time in it for completing the story line. Depending on how often you die and have to backtrack again and how much of the side stuff you choose to completeThe story felt not really engaging. While there are animated flashback scenes and numerous collectible Journal entries that tell something about the world I never felt it. The protagonist sometimes seemed as undead as his enemies. (Minor spoiler: ""Oh I just lost my wife by brutal murder and some dude came to me with two bracelets that make me a mage. Well, let's go kill everything we encounter""). The first hours of the game felt tremendously slow but it picked up after a while.The game has respawn. Meaning: If you die, you keep all your stuff but the enemy encounter since the last checkpoint are challenging you again. Which is okay in itself but sometimes the checkpoints were nerve-racking far from another. Not even before every bossfight			"

												Meh. It's not bad. It's pretty mediocre. I think people looking to experience powerful magic would find better luck in Dragon's Dogma or Baldur's Gate. The different spells in this game mainly inflict different status effects. There's some smart combos players can use to overcome different bosses, but the linear level design feels pretty tedious. The problem is that there are just better games for what this game tries to deliver. I don't see what's the point on spending time on this one. It's not a good FPS, it's not a good fantasy game, it doesn't have a great progression system, the levels aren't interesting. You can go through it fine and get some killing action if it's on sale, but seriously I'd recommend looking elsewhere.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is so good that it has ruined magic systems in all other games. I don't think I've had this much fun playing a game in a long time. Yes, this game is very fun to play, but it's also quite difficult The combat is very fast-paced and you will probably die a llot if your're not completely focused. Very satisfying so far!, in a Dark Souls II type-of-way.  You will become more powerful as you gain new spell types called Sigils, for which you can upgrade via crafting Spells and upgrading loot you find. Your sigils will also independently level up the more you use them.This is obvious, but the graphics are absolutely spectacular. I can't wait to see what types of envrionments are in store for me. I find myself just taking time out to view the scenery. Look carefully, because there is loot to be found!Is it worth the full price? Yes, absolutely! If you like playing a mage in any RPG, this game is definitely for you. No question about it.			"

This does not mean upgrading to directx11 will fix this, I have directx 11, but that you need a graphics card that comes with directx 11 as it's standard. this game looked good, but for now it was a wasted $24. I am glad it was on sale, since $10 dollars can go a long ways in the steam summer sale.			"

								Ok im going to be honest here. this games looks amazing in the video but as soon as you play it you are going to be disapointed. now dont get me wrong this game has great potential and could be awesome but theres 2 things that need to be fixed in order for it to even be playable. 1: MOTION F**KIN BLUR- it is mandatory and ruins the whole game, allow it to be disabled otherwise theres no one is going to propery enjoy it. 2- sort out this useless graphics, i have a good computer but this game is jittery and glitchy and just super laggy, i could tolerate for a bit but now i just want my money back becuse i cant even watch a cinematic in this it jjust keeps screwing up. if these two things are fixed i will give it the best god damn review out there, it will go from ultra SH*T to as good as the video looks. but yea atm i want a refund			"

												// *have not played this since after it go launched* // (not much more is it anyway?)Rating 4.5/10 in overall enjoymentOkey did my review from the ground up.They only thing its missing is the badass from Magicka...Where completing a Spell you felt like an♥♥♥♥♥to bad... a REAL Badass! (you know)so Yeah that is where I am goingI did enjoy the game somewhat and was cool in the beginning but thats mostly it of coolness (first impresson of this)Pros- Graphic is great most is above average with spell effects that is so awesome!- Some enemy change and new types of enemies.Cons- 1 click to use a spell...- Crafting is the way to make a spell nothing else after ""just press and use""- They redused why less like 70% less chance and twice as less amount of loot drops (like it feels like chests are no fun anymore)- Don't feel like you can use your power to the full extent (like teleporting etc)- It feels like the combat is awfull (more go to cover/run away) in Magicka it felt way better but there you had a sword/staff/gun that helped you out and made it way more fun also way faster movement.- Walks so slow sometimes it just becomes so annoying..

Early Access Review
								So this game is really fun for not being finished. I think that it will be the greatest mage game ever once complete. The gameplay is really smooth, and the spell crafting system is really neat! The graphics looks better than crysis 3 and the game has a lot of potential. This game is going to be more money once it comes out so I recomend buying it in early access. I think its really worth it. Flaws so far are, no voice acting, and not much of a real story to it yet.			"

												I will say this, the game isn't that bad, but it isn't all that good either. I want to recommend it, because I respect what the developers were trying to achieve, but unfortunately, I just don't feel like they did a good job.The trailer and description for the game seems to be about driving home the idea that you are a ""powerful mage"".You aren't.The game follows a very linear, very uninteresting path across several levels. The graphics are decent, but the scenery is meh and the storyline is sub-par at best. I did not feel attached to the characters nor the world. Certain spell effects look pretty cool, but most aren't anything special. Really the only thing the game has to offer is the idea of ""being a powerful mage"". However, the game just doesn't do a good job of delivering that message.Lichdom is a game of RNG, Grinding, and Crafting. You start with a couple of basic spells and basically just run in a straight line firing spells off at the same monsters over and over and over. Occasionally, these orb things pop out and fly into you. These are crafting components used to create more powerful spells. The only real thing to do in this game is keep walking down that straight path and hope you get some cool drops. Then you spend 20 minutes trying to craft a better version of a spell you're already using and repeat the process. It's kind of enjoyable at first, but gets really boring really fast.PROS:1) Spell crafting is kind of fun.2) Certain spell concepts are interesting and fun to use.3) It's a first person RPG game, which enjoyable for me, but is somewhat rare for the genre.4) I like the graphic style.5) I kinda like the voice actors and the dynamic they tried to create between the character and their ""partner"". I also like that that role switches based on whether you choose male or female. It's kinda neat.CONS:1) Not enough enemy variations.2) Uninteresting level design.3) Uninteresting story.4) A lot of spells are useless or unviable.5) Very RNG based. A good drop can destroy the balance of your character, and a lack of any good drops makes you feel worthless and weak.6) The design of the spell types really limits the gameLichdom has 3 types of spells.* AOE* Shield* TargettedYou can only ever perform one ""action"" at once. That means you can't charge up an AoE spell while having some sort of shield spell be active. You're either charging an AoE, firing off a targetted spell, or triggering a shield spell.What's worse, is that AoE abilities take like 6 years to charge up, and hardly ever do enough damage to even be considered. The Shield abilities are only triggered if you block the exact moment an enemy hits you, which is hard to judge and is inconsistent with the animations of enemy attacks. That leaves targetted abilities, the only type of skill you will actually ever use in this game. And wuddya know! A lot of those spells have AoE's!I found that when playing this game, it was so much better to just craft some pseudo Targetted spell that had an AoE component to it, or just focus on a high damaging single target ability. I basically ignored the other two types in all of my playthroughs. This really makes the crafting system of the game feel uninteresting. 2 thirds of the possible drops you can achieve you basically just throw in the trash because you don't need them. It's far too viable to make a character that has one or two powerful targetted abilities that can clear whole groups of monsters at once. It just makes the game feel that much more dull, and it makes getting those kinds of crafting drops unenjoyable.6) ""No Spell Cooldowns or mana costs""The developers seem to have thought that this was something that made mages feel less powerful. They couldn't have been more wrong. By removing cooldowns and mana costs, you're basically telling the players ""Hey, find a spell that works the best and use that and only that.Mana costs and cooldowns allow game designers to make players feel like they are casting something big, something powerful. By taking that away, that sense of power completely dissapears. I don't feel like a powerful mage by throwing 3000 ice balls at the same 5 zombies. I just feel like a derp.Not to mention, cooldowns are an excellent tool that force players to mix and match special combos and strategies that they either wouldn't have thought of, or just wouldn't have bothered with if not for the existence of a cooldown. Sure, I COULD freeze a giant group of enemies and then flame nuke them for a one shot kill, but if I have a different skill that can two shot everything, why wouldn't I just use that twice?That's just one example but there are a lot of situations where certain combos are just not worth it. You could call it a balance issue but I dunno, the whole system just feels boring and wrong. Cooldowns should be a part of this game, and they're not.===So yea, I can't recommend this game. I definitely had some fun with it, and there ARE enjoyable aspects, but I am left with more dissapointment than anything. It's possible the developers can improve on some of these things over time, but we haven't been given any indication that they plan to do so, so I'm not holding out for that.			"

												Charge a mastery spell, release, charge a damage spell, release.  Do this 700 times and you just played lichdom.  It tries to be a shooter, but lacks any rapid fire or quick gameplay that makes them so fun.  All this game has is combat area after combat area, over and over, which I can enjoy in borderlands or God of War, but in this combat is a frustrating chore.			"

												I want to love this game, the premise and idea are fantastic, but there is an overall mediocrity that drags the whole thing down. While I wouldn't call this a bad game by any stretch, I also wouldn't call it a great game. It mostly feels like an FPS with wierd weapon choices. The idea of harnesing and upgrading magics sounds great on paper, but is realy slow to deliver in the game and doesn't offer much of a change to the basic gameplay. More often than not, I would find myself trying out new spells and the mechanics they brought, only to quickly switch back to my highest DPS magic. I kept thnking that I needed to use different spells together to make fights better, but kept finding that pumping everything into one magic and dishing out tons of raw DPS was way simpler and more efficient than trying to utilize any of the various other spells and spell combinations. In the end, I just kept playing it like an other FPS and ran around with my favorite weapon (spell) dodging incoming fire and returning fire from some kind of cover. I'm almost positive this is not how the game was intended to be played, but it seemed to work better than anything else I tried. After a few hours of repitition and finding that the most difficult part of the game is not falling into random holes in the maps, I believe I've had enough of the whole ordeal. Overall, its a decent game, but not worth a full purchase price. If you can get it for free (like I did from an online giveaway) or at a very low price, its worth a shot and will give you a few hours of FPS entertainment.On a seperate but bothersome note, I'm begining to think the game is rather unstable as I have expierienced several crashes in the short time I've been playing. I'm not sure whats causing it, but it seems to get more unstable the longer I play, so maybe a memory leak. Also, the load times are bordering on preposterous and I find myself checking the task manager just to make sure the game hasn't frozen. Couple this with some occasional stuttering on a core i7 system with a GTX970 and I'm pretty sure the game is not well optimized. Still, its pretty fun overall, just not for a full price purchase.

												TLFU: The games normal price of $40 is hilarious. Skip this unless you can find it on a big sale, which for a while now it has been on several sites for only a dollar. So at that price it is worth a look for sure because it manages to be unique enough to have somewhat of a good time with for a little while. I still give this a thumbs down overall though because it has bland linear levels, has extremely repetitive combat, has p-ss poor checkpointing (some of the worst out there) that see's you often re-doing multiple long fight sequences after you die, and boss fights that are just ultra long endurance matches. Not to mention dirt poor optimization that even my rig that plows through any other game I throw at it on max settings at a smooth 60fps can't run this game on 'very high' settings and even gets effect lag still on 'high' settings when a lot of stuff is going on.The developer responded to this review a long time ago and said ""our effects are very demanding"". How about this: when you are play testing this game in beta and you see how mediocre and flawed your own game is overall, which I refuse to believe ANYONE who worked on this game sat down and went ""man this game is so good!"", when your game is in general terms pretty noticeably mediocre, don't have insanely demanding special effects? Either way, as soon as this game released it was accurately viewed by the public as pretty god damn mediocre. Just the same way the devs saw it before release but said fk it lets do this anyway we got deadlines.The effects are gorgeous and that is about the extent to the hype of this game's appeal. Well they would be anyway if I could run them on very high, but since this game is so crappily optimized I have to run it on high settings instead. Everything else is nothing special. The problem is that nothing is very memorable because the levels are painfully linear, bland, non-interactive, and the enemies are pretty standard fair. It also has another staple of many bad games: often very poor checkpointing, some of the worst I've seen in any game, ever. You just did 3 long time consuming fights with enemies spawning in continuously and each fight took a little while, then up the road you die on another fight? Let's warp you waaaay back to before those  3 fights so you have to do all of them over again. FUN!NO! The boss fights are only hard in that they are long endurance tests. Each boss fight consists of a boss with much more hp than he should have, making each boss fight a pure endurance test. They are sometimes around 10 minutes of throwing spells, dodging, ad nauseam. If you get bored or tired of the same old♥♥♥♥♥♥repeating itself over and over in that 10-15 minute fight and you die, you have to do it all over again. Just like this game's crafting system, the boss fights are very poorly conceived.The game's spell crafting system is easily one of the most ill conceived crafting systems I have ever seen. It gives you a few tips then throws you in the deep end without any further explanation. The custom spell crafting mode is a convoluted mess. Which parts should I combine and why? Most people are going to be scratching their heads at this stupidly included mode. Thankfully there is a smart inventory option that lets you upgrade what you have, which is very helpful I give it that, but I'm still not sure how it works. Could I take the parts I'm finding and custom craft a better spell than the smart inventory option could? It explains nothing and leaves you just using the smart inventory system and hope for the best outcome. The god awful spell crafting system should have just been left out in favor of a much better tried and true rpg character progression system, or just not have been so heavily convoluted for no real reason.In terms of difficulty, the game is all over the place. Sometimes I get one-shotted, sometimes I don't. The game constantly slaps you on the hand as if to say ""no, you are playing wrong"". But there is no ""wrong"" just a randomness combined with luck on whether or not you will be repeating entire sections and multiple long fight sequences because of p-ss poor checkpointing.""Lichdom's combat sets a new gold standard"" lol compared to what? Daikatana? Had they even played another game in their lives before making that statement? To this game's credit, it is unique in its own right. But being unique doesn't always translate into a good game. It is actually fun and engaging for a short while but that fun quickly fades. Unfortunately for this game, finding much better fps's exists without much effort.5.9/10. Catch it on sale for no more than $5 if it ever goes that cheap. If not don't worry about it because you aren't missing anything special.			"

												Until half the spells actually do something instead of just looking pretty. Shachs stops being invincible (Might as well be.)And some of the bugs are fixed. I REALLY STRONGLY don't recommend this game.From my experienceNice graphicsCool looking spellsspells not doing any damage whatsoevernot bad storyShachs is pretty much invincible, can't even beat him on explorer (Next to lowest difficulty.)Tip- Just use the fire spells, make your projectile lob (any kind of lob.) (Make sure you upgrade it with other items so you can have more than one augment.)Then make as many augments for that one as possible, while making them have some different affects as well as, making them add to the damage it does.P.S. Phase doesn't work, corruption works but isn't much help against bosses.			"

												I received a code for this game at a PAX East many years ago, while the game was still in Early Access.  I played some hours of it, and decided to come back to it within the past year.My choice of ""Yes"" for recommending the game is based on the price you can get the game.  I feel that for $40, it's a tough sell... but for $10-15 or less, you could get a good amount of enjoyment out of it.The game plays like a first person shooter and a loot-based RPG.  You craft spells, unlocking different elements (fire, ice, lightning, gravity) as you progress.  The game relies heavily on 3's... You can carry spells of 3 different attunements, you have 3 spells for each element, there are 3 types of each spell that can be crafted... and so on.  This system does a good job of giving the player plenty of possibilities, while limiting those possibilities to a manageable threshold.While you can make spells of any type you want, there definitelyt seems to be a trend or balance around taking 1 Damage spell (for dealing direct damage), 1 Control spell (for manipulating enemy movement by freezing or stunning them), and 1 Mastery spell (for applying status effects and MASSIVELY boosting the effectiveness of the next Damage spell to hit the enemy).  This means you will be swapping between spells often, and this 1-2-3 combo will serve you well.The story of the game starts out strong, and becomes mediocre by the end.  The voice acting throughout the game is well done for the player character.  Really, I don't expect you'd be playing this for a deep story... you'd be playing this because you want to explore the gameplay mechanics, to see numbers pop out of enemies as you deal ever-increasing damage to them, and to experiment with the spell system.This game won't be for everybody, but fans of shooters and fans of loot-grinding will have plenty to see here.

												If you like RPGs that involve you as a spellcaster, or like being tactical and challenging events and intense battles this game is for you!I like this game cause this game is by far the best PC game on Steam I can actually play on PC, this game does well with having both Keyboard and Xbox 360 controller set up.Sure this game is old, but i prefer this as a Gem in my collection, because how this game forces you to adapt and learn on the go, while learning what game tactics work and do not work and the game has everything for everyone to try in multiple startegies in combat.The game's immersion is spot on, the music helps the player know when he is in combat and when he/she is safe from combat.The fact you games sets up a simple tactic of survival in combat and learn from your mistakes and the learning is high, but will not force you to be discouraged and then rage quit often, you either learn to do better or just not learn at all.

												To echo what many have said about the game, the combat and spells and crafting systems are incredibly boring and repetitive. However one massive issue about the game is the controls. Your character's movement and movement speed is very finicky and inconsistent and unresponsive, casting a spell takes a long charge time, with slow projectiles, aggravating aiming for AOE effects, or long charge times, all while annoying ranged enemies are pelting you with arrows. And it seems that the best way to ever deal with melee enemies is to just block their attacks with good timing so you release an explosion around you, which does as much damage as a fully charged normal attack.

												To echo what many have said about the game, the combat and spells and crafting systems are incredibly boring and repetitive. However one massive issue about the game is the controls. Your character's movement and movement speed is very finicky and inconsistent and unresponsive, casting a spell takes a long charge time, with slow projectiles, aggravating aiming for AOE effects, or long charge times, all while annoying ranged enemies are pelting you with arrows. And it seems that the best way to ever deal with melee enemies is to just block their attacks with good timing so you release an explosion around you, which does as much damage as a fully charged normal attack. There's literally no reason to use anything else on most enemies.And my other big complaint is the dialogue. You're in this medievil setting and all the other characters speak relatively appropriately for the time, but the main character and the sassy female tracker friend talk like 20-something hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in a cafe, with modern colloquialisms and speech mannerisms and accents.

												Hi :)I would just like to say that this game is one of the most interesting and fun games I have played all year, I know it does get a bit repetitive at times but The mixing of spells and blinking is fun, But I will never ever play it again, its just Way Too Hard for me. As im not really much for that Hardcore kind of games, I dont play games for the challenge I play them for fun so if you are like me I do not recommend you to buy this game. Oh and if you're expecting a First-Person-Shooter but with spells you will be  dissapointed. My point is this game may not be for people like me who play games for the fun of it and not for the challenge.			"

												Very Boring, same set up different surroundings. Everyone says it has potential, but it's all hype and very lackluster. Linear game progression with no side quests. ""Thousands of spells"", you get a handfull of elemental types to choose from with a chance to increase dmg or add dots to spells from complete random ""mob drops"" :slow clap:. I never once was amazed, the game identifies you as a ""dragon"" and the only ones I know of are dead or badass (your nothing but a non badass mage). Save yourself some time, money, and effort, just stick to Skyrim.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, so I bought this early access game for $20, I feel like that was completely wasted. This game is totally not worth $20, I would say $5 is a fair price. Now, the combat in this game is as good as it looks, very fun combat. My huge problem with this game is that there is absolutely no story whatsoever. You spawn in a random cave and just follow a path. I have no idea what my goal is or why I am in this cave, there is nothing to explain it, not even a little diolauge from the character saying, ""How did I get here?"" or something along those lines. I have met another character, but there is no voice, just subtitles, not even a lip movement.This bothers me more than it should. I know it is just the alpha, but you think they would have some voice actors.  This game is very repetitive. A game should not be repetitive, but this game is far worse, so far I have only seen 4 enemies with exception to bosses. Most of the enemies are totally OP! You have like 3 health bars, or shields as they call it, and once you lose them, your dead. There are ranged crossbow guys they take out one health bar in one shot. Once they do, you're basically screwed, because they do not regenerate, you have to find a glowing orb which is more uncommon than it should be. They also mentioned crafting spells, which I thought was a brilliant idea. I wouldn't call it crafting though, more so altering spells. For a game where only magic can be used, you think there would be more than fire and ice. When you ""craft"" spells, all you can do is change how much damage your fireballs do, or reduce the charge time for your ice shots. Now you may be thinking, ""Quit hating, it's just the Alpha!"" and I understand that, but just about every element would need to be changed in order to make this an adiquite game. Please do not buy this yet, wait at least until beta to see if it improves, but this game is not worth the $20 I spent. Overall, it is not yet a sound game and needs many improvements, but it is not the worst game I have ever played.			"

												Meh... It's good but it's not $40.00 good.I will give this game a good rating for it's difficulty and graphics. Especially the visuals. They spent a good amount of time making the scenery look awesome and it really does.On the the cons... While the game sounds cool, the premis of being an all powerful battlemage the game diddn't give me that feeling.The spells are cool and you can esentially non stop cast but the spells you can use during each encounter are limited to three elements and only a few attack spells per. You have to stop and change you're slots and when you do you lose the level progress. I was hoping for a complete toolbelt of spells. I'm the kind of guy that likes keybinding too so it would've been cool to be able to sue some of that.FIghts are redundant. You can draw on a endless supply of power but you will soon find that you cast the same one or two spells over and over and over and again and again...If you're reading this let me ask you a question. Did you play Skyrim? If yes then I will tell you the spellcasting system is similar to the one spell in one hand, one in another. Though Skyrims spell system is not anywhere as indepth as Lichdom I will say Skyrim is still better because even though the spell system is limited the gameplay doesn't feel so redudtant and linear.I will reccomend it but just barely. It should be like a $20.00 or $25.00 game.5.5/10			"

												Pretty, but incredibly dull.Spell crafting is extremely limited and what little you can make, you can only really equip a mere few to carry into battle. Very few of the spells you can make feel fun at all. Story is mediocre, but the dialogue is okay.Combat and general gameplay is where it falls the most though. It's tedious, repetative and just not remotely interesting.It tries to have interesting battle combos and encourages you to do things like ""Freeze your enemies and then blast them with fire for more damage"" but given how little in terms of magic you can equip at once you end up limiting yourself to having only a couple of combos that get repeated again and again.Getting through enemies feels like a chore. The game likes to throw large groups of enemies at you, that take forever to get through in a very unsatisfying manner.On top of this all, the controls themselves feel clunky.Overall, a huge disappointment.

												I have a moderate PC and this runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥..TOTALLY MY FAULT//updated reviewI have revisited this game after updating my pc to  high spec. The graphic is alot smoother however the game play is absolutely repetitive and it gets even more vomitable as I progress.Firstly, the game follows exactly the same pattern throughout. You literally walk from one place to the other, fighting a tribe of enemies, ocasionally a boss and get to a save point before you die. The enemies are badly designed. They are all green so sometimes you can't tell if they are the same and it gets repetitive when you see them again and again. The boss fights are nasty as well. Almost unplayable due to the difficulty.The map is even more repetitive. You have to look around for purple flusks while squeezing through tunnels and so on.  Even the magic crafting system isn't as satisfying as it should be and soon you will realize it is incredibly shallow and dull when  you get into the game.As an arcade game, it lacks tempo and excitement. As an RPG, it lacks pretty much everything. The plot is boring as ♥♥♥♥ and you have to listen to the bird man speaking once in a while, who literally does nothing.10/10  vomit simulator			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage isn't very good. It's shallow and boring. It goes to show that graphics aren't everything.PositivesSpeaking of graphics, this game has some fantastic graphics. That's hard to deny. It uses the Cryengine, so you're in for a treat. This is complimented by its great medieval fantasy artstyle. All the magic effects look great!NegativesBut looks aren't everything. This game is so shallow. There's 3 ways to attack. You play as a mage, but you only have 3 ways to attack as a mage. You're telling me, as a mage, you can only attack in 3 ways. Yes, there's different elements of magic you can use, but they all feel the exact same. The story is shallow. This guy killed your wife for no apparent reason, so you set out to get your revenge. That's about it. The characters are very shallow. There's this girl that helps you along the way, but I never learn her name. I don't know why she is even helping me!SummaryLichdom: Battlemage isnt very good. It's a shallow, boring game that has a lot of glitter sprinkled on it. For $40, this game is an absolute joke. Luckily, I got this game for $1 on Bundle Stars, but that deal has since been ceased. That was honestly worth it, but for anything more than $5, stay away.Should you buy it? If you're super interested in this game like I was, but don't pay full price!TipYou know this game is avaliable for $3 right now? Yes, that's right, and it's actually on the same site I got the game from: Bundle Stars. For $3, you get this game along with 7 other indie games.

												While it is a very good looking game. the problem with Lichdom Battlemage is the Spell craft is overly complicated (while some might like that) it's not very casual frendliy. It's like any other crafting system in other games but on steriods you end up upgrading, mixing, crafting and combining bits and bobs to you can add to you spells which also be mixed and matched. The big problem is the menus on equiping all is this is confusing as you click on something in a menu and have no Idea what you have just changed and how it will effect your proformance of your spells.It reminds me abit of Amored Core from ""FromSoftware"" in a sence that actually combat is sort of striaght forward and simple but the ulimate challenge is puting together a capable build of whatever to get progress through the game.Even when all the above previously mentioned problems are gone and stick smart inventory on. The game just ends up being so boring, just constanty spaming the fire spells, just to quickly elimate them, sometime I freeze them to add variaty. levels are long and linear and you never have any sense you are progressing through the game until you hit boss.Near the end game or 2nd half, in the swamp like level, you feel like you are about to hit a end level boss or something whenever any you come across a quiet wide open area, instead more generic enemies spawn and just fight away again.

								Ok, so there isn't any explanation as to how to build spells, and other aspects of the game. ITs in production for sure. There is no save option in the menu. The concept is cool, though it would be much better if there was dialog voices, and if there was some kind of loot/armor system. The story feels weak, and you are pretty much just attacking things and kiting away. There just really isn't much here. Too bad, the concept would be great. Just bad execution. Great graphics, great idea. Needs to be a flushed out idea. Very much a one trick pony. Its like the developers know to only do one aspect really well. I don't see this working out...

												Now that the game is released I can simply tell you it looks fantastic, and for the first few hours of playing its fun. However, it gets dull very fast when you realize it has about ten mob types, and you cant really craft spells for♥♥♥♥♥♥Why cant you craft spells for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Simply put, everything is RANDOM. That alone makes this game terrible to deal with. There isnt really any defined explanation of crafting, even if you read through the overly complex vernacular  describing what the parts of crafting are and do. Nothing really explains crafting as a whole, nor shows you how its done. So, even if you happen to have the right stuff to make a fantastic spell with a nice patern, you wouldnt know because this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Blink is practically gone. It USED to be good. It was infinite, like the rest of your powers and skills. Then, for some reason they decided to make this game complete crap by destroying the only real defense you have.♥♥♥♥♥♥attacks you from all angles, so shield is completely useless. You cant see when mobs are attacking you from behind or the side, and they spawn frequently so its not like you could see them comming anyway because they just APPEAR. Boss fights are annying, Demons and anything you once had protection from via skill and timing now become fustrating and pointlessly long, drawn out battles of you getting hit by homing wtf ever they shoot. Even if you see something a mile a way comming right at you you cant even dodge it because YOU ♥♥♥♥ING RAN OUT OF YOUR MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING INFINITE POWER OF BULL♥♥♥♥INGSHIT.You are slow as ♥♥♥♥, even when running. And, also on a note, you run faster in the time you use up your blink and farther. 80% of your spells require you to charge or hold a button...and you become slower when you hold a button....you are a slow, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,♥♥♥♥♥♥mage that takes ten minutes to kill a small group of mobs. Why is this ""Battle Mage"" so slow? You have no way to change your run speed....no buffs.....no magic that helps you teleport, and you cant jump because you are white.The ""Homming"" skill misses constantly, and doent lock on to anything unless you fire directly at it. Sure your spells looke fine, but they arent effective at all when you look at other wizards in  just about every other gameLets compare:D&D = Better mages & spellsKingdom Of Amalur = Best damn battle mage everCity of Heroes = Amazing Magic users way more fun and could even heal themselves and others.WoW = Mobile, fast, and WAY better magesSuper Mario = Way better fire mage and shape shifterHairy Potter Games = Way better combat mageWizardry 1 - 10 = Way better magesEye of the Beholder = Better magesMight and Magic 1 - 8 = Way better magesGauntlet (All of them) = Way better combat magesThe list is pretty much unending, to be honest. No game has slow, defensless, clumsy mages that cant even cast a small, basic, starting spell quickly. They simply wouldnt graduate. Lichdom failed in every aspect except visual. Even the sounds are like nails on a chalk board. Every time something dies its screams so loud it hurts your ears. If you fx the volume, you cant hear the spawns and get back attacked, and probably will miss dialogue as well that would be useful.The game also puts ""One way"" paths where you fall down a tiny ledge and cant go back.....right next to a MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING TELEPORTER. Seriously...what the hell is the point of putting one way paths if you can teleport wherever you want with a teleporter?For real this gmae just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off when I got to the ""Oasis"" area. Every group was an annoying fight of shot and run behind a rock. Everything had knock down, freeze, slow and ranged that didnt miss. Each fight took time and patience...but I was loosing my patience when it every god damn time I needed another blink, it wouldnt let me have it because it was recharging. And, of course, you run so slowly that it was pointless to bother fleeing to pick off one at a time. Then the boss battle was what made me quit playing. I just realized I wasnt enjoying the game mechanics enough to want to get a bigger head ache.""Lichdom sets a New Gold Standard"" in being the slowest, most random, gear dependant mage possible...Buy it only if you like pretty colors. The ""Tactical"" combat gets very old VERY fast. You have to use one spell, then another spell, and in the time it takes to use those two spells, you could have easily just spamed a simple destruction spell withthe same result. Both take endless amounts of time, btw. I think I mentioned you being very SLOW in this game. Casting is NO acception.Beauty is all this game has going for it. While I hope other companies progresstake to the grphical advancement of the UT engine in its current form, I really hope they make action games what they used to be....action.			"

												This game is crap. I specialzed on  necromancy. But after a crash in a boss fight it doesn't work any more correctly. So the boss is impossible to defeat for me.Besides bugs like this the game is- repetitive with boring linear levels, which lead from arena to arena.- long, boring boss fights.- poorly explained, especially the crafting system.- seems to give a lot of freedom with the spells, but they are only slight variations.The game is visually nice though.

												For a game that prides itself on a ""badass mage"" with unlimited powers, this sure has a ton of low tier, apprentice level, Elder Scrolls-like weak magic.Actually, not a ton. There's a slow casting fireball with no splash damage, a slow casting fire rain spell with splash damage, a useless shield, and a stream of ice that doesn't do anything but freeze enemies for a very short period of time. If you're going to advertise a game with the promise of awesome magic powers, give us♥♥♥♥♥♥like slamming the sky into the ground and shaking space time in order to absorb enemies into a rift full of knives.Edit: Just though I'd update this and point out something.

												Hands down definitely the worst game in gaming history so far.When I think about it, the only thing I like about this game is the ""idea"" and that is all.No explanations in the game.No tutorials or whatsover.No real good comparison between all the spells.Since the descriptions are so bad, you got to test EVERYTHING out to find out, if the spell you create is actualy worth using it.And worst of all the combat... actualy all the NPCs (especialy bosses) and the amount of them and what they do, it is all designed for fast combat, which is not possible in this game. YOu want to charge your spell? Well, you cant  run. No dodge, no evade, no side stepping (btw you got something that is called blink, but the range is a stupid joke compared to what you realy need).And well the bosses... first you fight and die like 100 times before you can figure out what actgualy makes damage, and then when you find out, you actualy have to constantly damage the boss or the health regenerates, leading to an endless battle. On top of that, rarely you are there alone with the boss who is alreadcy one hitting you and is a titan when it comes to hp.There surely are people who like this sort of games, but do not let it fool you, all 3 Dark Souls makes you less frustrating then this game.

												While the production values are pretty top notch, this game has very mediocre levels, handling, and mechanics.Movement is functional, but clunky.  Evasive dash mechanic is very clunky and is limited in some facets in a way that makes it difficult to understand the limits.  Further, you can very easily dash into pits and not even know that it happened.  While battlefield management is a valid game design element, without being able to jump holes in the floor are not far off from megaman spikes.The spell system, the core and meat of what this game offers to someone looking for a wizarding game suffers a lot from trying to be a loot treadmill.  While the idea of being able to craft your own spells out of components is initially very interesting, the actual variety of spells is extremely limited.  You will get tons of components to craft spells that barely differ from one to the next, and you will have piles of these things that will initially overwhelm and then immediately underwhelm.Combat itself is stilted by the spell system as either constantly switch between elements to take advantage of control spells, that manipulate enemy function and almost all additionally ""store damage"" that is released by damage spells. This would be a cool mechanic if it weren't for that this does very little to add to the game and ultimately just leads to either A) a lot of constantly switching back and forth between two weapons, creating micromanagement that doesn't add to the fun because it is somewhat required or B) Set up a single element to have control as one component and damage as the other.What further complicates this is that the critical damage system (which, awesomely, allows for double crits), demands that you charge your spells to do guarantee critical damage if you want to actually make use of your efforts.  The starter fireball spell does ~80 damage out the gate, crit ~190, and if you crit into a charged pool effect with control, over 600 and doens't require reapplications.This example may sound cool, but that's not an example, that's basically the beginning and end, not doing it this way will feel like your spells are just very colorful cotton balls a lot of the time, or you'll be constantly reapplying control effects for bonus damage, or ignoring them all together just to avoid having to micromanage the issue.  You may say ""well, that doesn't sound so bad, really, it's not that much extra work"", except that if you don't specifically craft a spell for increased control duration, the duration will wear off almost immediately upon casting your spell, assuming you have no delay between the effect being applied and the following damage spell.  Otherwise, the effect can easily wear off before it applies.This rapidly leads to a game feel where instead of having individual powerful and fun spells that you have to juggle spell components in the middle of battle to generate basic effects.  That would be great if it was like Magicka where you're wielding elements and then unleashing them, but all that ""spell crafting"" is done in menus and then just functions as small modifiers on how the weapon functions.Which, again, wouldn't be bad, if the crafting wasn't 90% just stacking bonuses instead of having different spell effects.======== Further Play Review ========The game never changes.  You get new elemental sigils, and more and more things to craft, and the enemy variety alters slightly, but this is, otherwise, a completely linear cooridoor shooter that fails to reward you and will punish you without explaining to you what you've done.Avoid this game unless it's at a deep discount and you otherwise don't believe me.

								It could be worse, it's still terrible.The concept of battlemage is fairly interesting, advertising great flexibility and fun in a hack'n'slash with lots of spells.It unfortunately fail in that regard. The graphic are pretty good, if somber, with a good amount of details. They would have been a lot more enjoyable however with more interaction. The starting level, in a town, showed the color in that, plenty of places to sneak in... with absolutely no easters eggs of any kind.There are a fair amount of enemies in successive arena. The instant rebirth, with a decent penalty, isn't bad per see... but it is awful when the enemies are always exactly the same, in the same place. The game would have been better off with procedures-generated levels, at least for the enemies.The greatest failure of the game however, is the gameplay and control. Lichdom uses a setting more adapted to console, and perhaps gamepad, than computers with keyboards. It show terribly in combat, making using defence, combo, charged nova, and dancing around enemies a gigantic CHORE rather than a fun tactical challenge.It increase a degree with the 3 sigils limits, in each three cases with one targeted spell, one aoe, and one defense sigil... that you have to swap between color during combat to use as combos.A freer configuration allowing to set up multiple style of casting with different colors might have taken longer to configure, but would have been a LOT more fun... correct that, it would HAVE been fun, rather than a boring sitting session once you realize how limited the system is.The synthesis and equipment moments generally kill all remaining interest. It's extremely random since its update, never tell you what you're going to get, force you to swap between journal and menu, taking far too many seconds each time, to make good setups...Agument for instance, for some reason, show the special modifiers bonus when you create a spell... but not the amount destruction/control/mastery associated with them, forcing you to check or make half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥comparaison with the show stats.It get worse when you see how the synthesis menu work, given that every item is put through a single list where it can take a minute, or entire minutes, plural, after enough enemy kills.This was especially disappointing after coming from Transistor, which had a great deal many combos and tactics to assemble. Baring a large-scale overhaul of the Lichdom: Battlemage, I would recommend to avoid this game. Earnestly.			"

								In short, it plays like a really bad fps with slow moving bullets. Maybe it will pick up later, or maybe I am missing something important. But after experimenting with the synthesis for an hour, I don't think so.I have played through the first three hours hoping that there would come a point where I would get something other than a slow ranged fireball/iceball attack. I was disappointed. The contagion ranged attack was even worse. The other spell types set you up for failure with slow casting times and the fact that you die in about four hits if your enemies get near you. There is a lot available in the way of customization as far as spell effects are concerned. Unfortunately the effects are almost entirely negligible.			"

												""Wasted Potential The Game"". I sort of like the game, some aspects of it atleast, but there's just something off about the gameplay. It felt like that in beta and the final game is pretty much the same. Even though I am getting some enjoyment out of the game I don't think I'll recommend it to anyone. The game didn't turn out quite the way I hoped... it just feels oddly sluggish and not like the explosion of badassness it was supposed to be. It's like a cumbersome, unwieldy version of Painkiller; not as fast and not as much fun... sadly. If only the gameplay matched the graphics. Unfortunately the nice visuals are on top of some fairly lacklustre and badly paced gameplay.Edit: After toying around with settings I conclude that the game performs abysmally on NVIDIA hardware (GTX 670 (OC)) [i7-4770K, 16 GB RAM]. Lichdom also has the worst vsync implementation ever... anything even slightly below 60 fps is dropped to a stuttering 30 fps. Not a good combination when the game basically runs like a chained snail in a pit of salt.			"

												This game feels awkward, especially so when it uses abuse against women as a plot device. One time my NPC friend in the game tells me she hates some bad guy because he sold her sister, then 30seconds later the bad guy is threatening my player-character's sister. The plot was supposed to make me think the ""bad guy"" is a truely evil character and want to kill the bad guy, however it just made me cringe and then turn off the game. I'm not some feminist who thinks this is a conspiracy, I am just a normal gamer feeling icky about some bad story writing. I'm only early in the game and might change my opinion later but the spells are a touch awkward to.			"

Secondly, fights aren't interesting, it's slow, numbers appears on your screen and you don't even know why they means ! Also the crafting system is NOT explained, so you have to do things you don't even understand, comparing stats out of nowhere, and equip spell that you don't even know what they do.

								I like the game, just not as is. for now the concept of the game I love.(Random mini glowy thing in an inconcspicuous spot is touchable but when touched: lights up and all of a sudden you are fighting a horde of face eating gladiater zombies in a fight for your life. is one such example of part of the concept of the game I love) I have no idea why it would happen and I hope the information will be there eventually as to why that may have happened. I survived that instance of random fight or die situation, so because of that randomness and lack of understanding It felt like a scary movie where I had to poke everything in the eye with my crappy fire balls or nothing was going to be okay (and thats all I knew). It was fun.  I hope to see more spell effects. For instance the fire manipulation magic could have an interesting concept about ""controlling"" things that are ""set"" on fire *wink wink* thrown in there some how. just as an example, pay no mind to the random idea. Love the game, And I loved super smash bros. for me that is saying something. I can't play the game though because it feels very linear, I don't know what is going on story wise and the spells are slow and feel clunky for as little as they do. Alot of the time i am just running marathons backwards for days without any other reason besides waiting for the damage to rack up high enough to kill the freakin braindead zombie. I am sure you guys are going to murder the game (in a good way) and i will be playing more and more with each update for sure. Love the game, The bosses are hella fun, Need like 2 or so more spell options at any given time besides the ""2"" though or I wont be playing any more. If you want some funding I would't mind donating to this awesome concept of kick♥♥♥♥♥mage takes down evil corrupt government of doom. Someone feel free to message me and I will gift this to you so you may try it, for your sake and the developers sake. Spreading the love, Wooo!			"

								The Good: The Graphics are outstanding, the music fits the mood of the game, and the combat difficulty is nearly Dark Souls level. The Bad: The gameplay is pretty repetetive as of now, spells consist of a single blast, an aoe, a barrier, and a teleport. And this is for all spells, not just your initial Fire and Ice powers. Granted, each spell has different effects and can be uniquely upgraded, but at the end of the day you are still just shooting the same 4 spells. For a game that is designed to make you feel all powerful, it instead makes you feel limited to what you can actually do.This game has amazing potential. Whether it will live up to it is unknown. I have high hopes for this game, which is why I would still recommend it in spite of the combat system. It is still a very enjoyable game and definitely worth the money.			"

												While I enjoyed the game it has a number of issues that mean I can only really recommend picking it up in a sale.Good:-Good characters with great voice acting (seriously, this game has a really good cast)Interesting range of magic types and deep crafting system, the synergies are greatSome very nice looking levels, the Maelstrom being my favourite (a naval battle in a storm flash frozen in place)Bad:-Leveling each sigil requires using each sigil, mostly to get kills but not always, which quickly becomes very grindy and combined with the fact that that spells are set to a sigil when crafted mean that you're punished for trying new combos after the first few levelsSpikes in difficulty, certain enemies are far more dangerous than they look (Big demon with a tentacle halo is an obvious threat, the undead mages that can one shot a third of your life and teleport are distinct from all the other undead)No proper save system, only checkpoints and they're pretty spread out. To make it worse if you die all the enemies respawn which can be very annoying and this is a nitpick but it doesn't make sense given the ingame explanation (you're being resurrected by magical artifacts, what's doing that for the enemies)Meh:-The story is okay but takes a turn for the worse near the end. The last half of the game is a long chase which I found fairly compelling but ends with the penultimate boss in a way I found really disappointing. It wasn't really what happened so much as how, the game builds tension for  and then *poof* done, move on to the last level.I though combat could have been faster paced, charging spells takes a bit too long, character movement is a bit slow, if agile shields (unlimited blink) hadn't been in the game I don't think I would have played more than a couple of hours.

												I tried so hard to like this game.  I always gravitate towards mages whenever a game allows, but there are just so many flaws that love of  magic isn't enough.  If you love hard games, magic, boring stories, AND grinding, pick the game up when it's on sale for no more than 20 dollars.  Now that that's out of the way, let's begin.The voice acting is good, but they didn't really try with the story, or the ending.  The graphics are pretty, depending on how you feel about rather obnoxious film grain.  Spells look pretty spectacular, they got this part right.  There are 8 Sigils in the game (think magic schools), 3 of which can be equipped at one time.  Killing enemies is how you'll get most of your spell components.  The crafting system is undeservedly complex.  The game claims to have thousands of spells, which is nonsense.  Nova spells comprise your shield effects, and have no variation.  Shields themselves come in three varieties.  AOE spells come in two varieties.  The third slot can be a missile (like a fireball), a lob (like a grenade), or a ray-type spell.  And that's it.  Components are found, combined, upgraded, reforged, broken down, and possess a wide array of randomized stats, but there is no ignoring how basic the magic system is in the game, which is shrouded in poor explanations (if any).  The inventory system is terrible, designed to artifically inflate the amount of time spent sifting through your components through horrible organization.  Farming exists through fast-travel to previous areas, but voice-overs will play again and again as though you had never been there before.Synergy spells are special spells you can create for when you have two specific sigils equipped.  As you kill either of the enemies with either sigil you a bar fills and you can cast a special spell.  The most synergies you can have equipped at one time is 3.  Some of these are pretty cool, but the learning curve of figuring out exactly how to make the spell in the first place was unnecessarily obtuse.  The entire game is a monster-corridor.  Environments are just as beautiful as the magic, but the game is almost on rails.  In a game where there are powerful spells but no such thing as a mana bar, they had to compensate by throwing in ever-increasing numbers of cheap enemies.  It's gripping, and fast-paced, but the entire game feels exactly the same.   It's not quite as hard as Dark Souls, but the game lets you know when you need to upgrade your spells or try a new combination of sigils by using your eye-sockets for pleasure.  The problem is it will do so completely without warning through sudden random spikes of difficulty, which will probably break the pacing of an already mundane story by making you go farm.  The only incantations the game makes you utter are long streams of cursing and the mumblings of boredom.			"

												Slow maneuvering, stupid auto-targeting (yes, that's right, you can't aim for yourself on your primary offensive spell!) and unsatisfying impacts make this game feel... flacid.  It also suffers from huge difficulty spikes where it goes from way too easy to way too hard.  The tutorials are a joke, also. There's also a fair amount of glitches.  It basically feels like a worse version of Bioshock where you can only use plasmids, no guns, but everything is slow and wonky.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a fast-paced, spell slinging action combat game. It's very visually appealing, and the story takes you through a decent variety of good-looking environments where you fight waves of enemies with a number of pretty fun spells. The difficulty of the game scales quite well and can be very challenging on the higher difficulties - though if you choose to put the difficulty up, you will want to take advantage of the rather versatile ""custom inventory"" instead of the more streamlined ""smart inventory"".However, the game does have its flaws. It is very linear - while there are some interesting things tucked away in the corners of the map, there is only ever one path forward. The game sort of encourages you to pick one set of elements and stick with it - higher level elements do more damage, so if you switch around a lot you'll eventually find yourself underpowered. It can also feel very repetitive; the format of every level is the same (fight through smaller enemies, fight a miniboss, repeat until boss fight). This is amplified with the optional 'loot machine' fights. They're generally worth it due to the sheer amount of sigils you can obtain, but they are tedious and repetitive. I also feel that they distract from the sense of urgency that the narrative tries to convey - if someone I care about is in mortal danger, I shouldn't be stopping to fight some optional skeletons.There is some interesting worldbuilding and backstory, but you only catch glimpses of it in the game's narrative. Most of it is delivered via collectible - and optional - journal entries. Despite the tags, I do not consider this a role-playing game. There is only one narrative choice in the game, and that is whether you play as the male or female character.I personally enjoyed the game, although I did take a fairly long break around the middle because of how repetitive it was. I had fun with the sigil crafting system and experimenting with different powers, and the higher difficulties provided a nice challenge one I'd gotten the hang of the combat system. It is not, however, something I can see myself playing again anytime soon.TL;DR version -Pros:- Fast paced action- Very pretty, varied environments- Cool spell effects- Difficulty scales well- Decent crafting systemCons:- Very linear.- Repetitive- Game encourages you to stick to one set of elements- Worldbuilding not really presented in the narrative- No significant replay valueIn conclusion, if you like fast-paced action games and a bit of a challenge, give Lichdom a shot. If you're looking for something more tactical or with more role-playing elements, you might want to look somewhere else.			"

												8.5/10I like the game, it's pretty, it has a well thought out lore and the voice actors of the main characters fit really well into the story.My problem with it then comes from the fact that you're running in a straight line shooting magic rays and fireballs at the same 3 enemys over and over and over. Honestly, I think I may have died maybe a total of 20 times and most of that was because I was looking at how detailed the backgrounds were and not watching where I was stepping. There are also some long periods of time where the FPS action fades out (and the music with it) so you're just following a straight trail until you hit the next fight, and if you do manage to find a side trail and explore it, most of the time it just throws more enemies at you.

												This game is a lot of fun for the first few hours - spells feel powerful and are easy to use. After the first few chapters however, feelings about this game got very mixed - not because the missions got tough  (some of them very tough - that just adds more challenge which is good for almost any game), but because magic types took a very long time to unlock and were not as good as expected - some of them feel the same, but with slightly different spin, and that doesn't help to break the monotony. Speaking of monotony - level design is mostly a tunnel. Don't get me wrong - that tunnel has rooms to go to sometimes, but it's a tunnel nonetheless. This lack of exploration wouldn't be a bad thing, but this game is all about crafting spells and if your new spell sucks, you just wasted your crafting matterials... and will probably die to the horde of enemies coming your way. And hordes of enemies is the thing this game loves to throw at you, so prepare your good old FREEZE + FIRE combo and you should be fine. That means your experiments with new spells will be just breathing some fresh air to briefly forget how dull this game can be. In conclusion - I'd buy that for a dollar! (Probably 10-15 dollars would be the fair price, so if you want to try it out - wait for a discount and have fun for a couple of hours!)			"

Lichdom: DisappointmentmageIt took me a while to work out whether or not I recommend this game, that says a lot in and of itself I think. In the end I have to go with a 'Yes' although be aware it's a very qualified 'Yes'. Basically, pick it up on sale, but don't expect too much.+ Diverse set of Elements to choose from (Not just Fire, Ice, Electricity)+ Graphics engine is pretty (Cryengine 3 so it should be)+ Fairly diverse setting(s), with some interesting landmarks+ Compelling upgrade system+ It's reasonably long, although 'drawn out' might be a better description- Gameplay is repetitive- Only a handful of types of enemies reskinned throughout the game- Gameplay is repetitive- World feels utterly dead and empty (little to no interactivity, constant corridor layout)- Gameplay is repetitive- Story is told AT you rather than you really participating in any recognisable way- Gameplay is repetitive- Spell mechanics are poorly explained- Gamep...yeah you get it5.5/10Lichdom is a game frequently tagged as 'RPG' with the tagline 'Play the first game where the Mage is a total badass!'. Bull***t! Whilst certainly you play as a mage, and you are quite powerful, the game plays out a lot more like an FPS a la Call of Duty than anything resembling an RPG. If you're looking for an RPG, stop now and look elswhere. How about being a badass? Well...no. The issue mostly comes down to how the game is balanced, for starters it features a similar enemy scaling system as Skyrim so it doesn't really matter how powerful you get, your enemies (the same 5 throughout the game) always scale with you. Secondly you typically face off against small groups of moderately dangerous enemies...most of whom are also Magic users.Lesson 1: When you make a game where you play as an all powerful mage...don't make everyone in it also a mage.I can't help but feel that masses of less powerful, non magic users would've greatly improved the feeling of empowerment, without making it too easy.I spent ~20hrs playing through the game on normal (Battlemage) difficulty...and got an achievement for it that apparently only 1.1% of people have. Pretty good sign that either your game is too hard (see other reviews/comments) and/or your game isn't interesting enough to be bothered finishing.Lesson 2: When you make a game about being 'badass' don't make it so you die ridiculously easily.In fairness, I didn't find the game particularly challenging on Battlemage Difficulty (I used a Fire Damage, Kinesis Mastery Debuff/Snare, Necromancy Minions/Tanking build), however most of the Boss encounters felt brutally cheap. Everything in the game is set up around damage rather than defense. You don't really have much in the way of defensive abilities, and when you come across elite enemies or bosses, they can often take out 2/3 of your health with a ranged (or teleported) hit you never saw coming.The world feels extremely dead. While some of the graphics are pretty owing to running on Cryengine 3, the models aren't particularly impressive and the level design is poor. Most of the game you're charging through what is more or less a corridor with periodic encounters (enemies just appear in 'arenas') along the way. Run 50m, engage 5-10 enemies, run 50m, engage the same 5-10 enemies...repeat for an hour. The other issue that contributes to the dead world feeling, is that the world is basically non-interactive (there's no physics). For a modern game, this is poor. For a modern game about the elements and being a badass mage...it's really disappointing that you can't set things on fire, or blow stuff up.Lesson 3: Being a Badass mage requires LARGE AMOUNTS OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE (imo anyway)Further to that, there's no interaction between the elements. Combining Ice and Fire has fundamentally the same effects as Fire and Kinesis. The spells have more variation on whether they're Destruction (damage), Mastery (debuff/amp damage), or Control (debuff/snare), than they really do between the elements.Ultimately I recommend Lichdom: Battlemage simply because I think it deserves some exposure for trying to do something new, and there's not enough of that. It's just a shame that the game feels like some great concepts that nobody ever actually sat down and playtested. Playing through the game I kept thinking that it would've been better if they'd done things differently. Lichdom: Battlemage comes across as an incomplete product, the idea is there, but the execution just isn't yet. Nonetheless, if you're intrigued, and it's on sale...give it a shot.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a fast-paced, spell slinging action combat game. It's very visually appealing, and the story takes you through a decent variety of good-looking environments where you fight waves of enemies with a number of pretty fun spells. The difficulty of the game scales quite well and can be very challenging on the higher difficulties - though if you choose to put the difficulty up, you will want to take advantage of the rather versatile ""custom inventory"" instead of the more streamlined ""smart inventory"".However, the game does have its flaws. It is very linear - while there are some interesting things tucked away in the corners of the map, there is only ever one path forward. The game sort of encourages you to pick one set of elements and stick with it - higher level elements do more damage, so if you switch around a lot you'll eventually find yourself underpowered. It can also feel very repetitive; the format of every level is the same (fight through smaller enemies, fight a miniboss, repeat until boss fight). This is amplified with the optional 'loot machine' fights. They're generally worth it due to the sheer amount of sigils you can obtain, but they are tedious and repetitive. I also feel that they distract from the sense of urgency that the narrative tries to convey - if someone I care about is in mortal danger, I shouldn't be stopping to fight some optional skeletons.There is some interesting worldbuilding and backstory, but you only catch glimpses of it in the game's narrative. Most of it is delivered via collectible - and optional - journal entries. Despite the tags, I do not consider this a role-playing game. There is only one narrative choice in the game, and that is whether you play as the male or female character.I personally enjoyed the game, although I did take a fairly long break around the middle because of how repetitive it was. I had fun with the sigil crafting system and experimenting with different powers, and the higher difficulties provided a nice challenge one I'd gotten the hang of the combat system. It is not, however, something I can see myself playing again anytime soon.TL;DR version -Pros:- Fast paced action- Very pretty, varied environments- Cool spell effects- Difficulty scales well- Decent crafting systemCons:- Very linear.- Repetitive- Game encourages you to stick to one set of elements- Worldbuilding not really presented in the narrative- No significant replay valueIn conclusion, if you like fast-paced action games and a bit of a challenge, give Lichdom a shot. If you're looking for something more tactical or with more role-playing elements, you might want to look somewhere else.			"

												----WARNING, WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!----    I expected more. I expected to be a badass mage, flinging cool (and sometimes silly) custom spells around. There are 3 variants of spell modifier for 2 of the 3 spell types, with 8 'Sigils' (magic types), and Destrution, Control, and Mastery effects for each. Sounds good, right? It's not, and that is because Destruction, Control, and Mastery have no effect on the apperance of your spells, Destruction = Damage, Control = Influencing enemies(dmg over time, stuns, etc.), and Mastery = Enemies take increased damage.    The spell modifiers only change how the effect is delivered ( a continous stream, a grenade like effect, homing missles, etc.) Each Sigil type is nice, excluding the over-done and over-used types of Fire and Ice. You have a Aoe spell (think traps), your thrown spells, and Novas (what happens when you use a charged blink). Basically the spells aren't anywere near as customizable as they should be. Also you can only use 1 Sigil type per both hands, no dual-wielding differnt spell types.    Shield's are stupid, there are 3 types of shields. 1-Agile, quick blinks and charged blinks, low damage block, low shield. 2-Tactical, charged blinks, medium damage block, medium shield. 3-Strategic,3 quick blinks (has recharge), high damage block, high shield. My problem with them is that I can't use any of them. Agile is fast enough, but lacts the shield I need, while strategic has enough shield but isn't fast enough. Tactical is just stupid, mainly because I can't dodge last second.   The enemies are annoying, and make things like boss fights ridiculously tedious. Most of my deaths in this game have involved trying to take shortcuts through levels (which are all very linear btw) or being stunlocked by ranged enemies till the boss finally connects with a hit (usually a insta/near insta-kill even on lower difficulties).   I've only been to about 4 locations in the game if you include the tutorial. I could not find a single shortcut through these levels, considering there is no jump button, and 4 ft falls kill you. These levels (excluding the tutorial) are overly long, and very tedious.  If you want a nice to look at game with good magic effects, here it is. I'd rather much prefer something that actually gave me insanely customizable spells, with fun game mechanics.			"

												Clean graphics but a tired story and confusing crafting system. Every few minutes I'd encounter something glowing that I can interact with and it turned out to be a fast travel thing that you can't access until later in the game. Crafting was random as hell and fighting got boring quick. It looks like Skyrim but on a track (can't explore anything - there's a set path), leaving it a hollow shell that is pretty on the outside.			"

												I've only played a few hours of this game and honestly, I'm already bored. the spell 'crafting' seems to be little more than just adding stats and numbers to attacks, not the kind of amazing spell bending that I really expected from a game dedicated to being a wizard. I would understand if this game were something like Skyrim where spells are part of, but not the whole idea, of the game but when all you do is cast the same spells over and over that all really do the same thing it gets a little dry.Apart from the disappointing spells (a pretty big deal for a spell based game) the level design is not great. you are walking between small areas where you will stroll in, a load of enemies appear, you kill them and move on to the next arena.The only upside of this game is that the spells do really feel powerful. Too often do you play games where you hope to be an all-powerful wizarding badass and you end up having no health and with wet spells. In this the spells pack a real punch and you really feel like you are raining fire down on your enemies. (It's just unfortunate that they all blend into one)			"

And after I unlocked Necromancer some of the moments where the game might have been horribly hard before became an interesting challenge of how large I could grow my undead army before I ran out of demons, undead and cultists to reanimate.So just saying this game does have its downs BUT it also has some quite fun and interesting things to try in the process of incinderating your foes.

												This is a fun and exciting game for all those who wanted to be a masterful mage. Spell creation, spells that work in conjuction with eachother, an interesting world with an admittedly cliche story and solid gameplay is what is offered in this game. Yes, the game is linear with extras off the beating path, with the only real openess is the ability to travel back into previous levels and waypoints. The levels are distinct and varied to boot and the game looks quite beautiful. This game is quite fun and if you even have mild interest in the game it will probably will be worth its purchase on sale, though i always hesitate to recommend someone buying a game for over $20.

												I'm glad I only paid 13 dollars for this, and at that it was more expensive than a movie and less entertaining. The developer basically said ""we'll take all the advancements in  modern gaming, like Expansive levels to explore, interactivity with NPCs, complex combat mechanics, a good story, interesting and varied enemies, and we'll be forgiven by our patrons because we used the new Cryengine and the main character is a mage. The game is extermely linear, you walk a bit and enemies pop out and then it happens again, and again, and again. The grapics aren't even up to par for Cryengine 3.  If you have played Doom you have played this game. More advanced engine and guns replaced with spells, but that is essentially all they changed.			"

												SHORT REVIEW:Play as the Dragon, a magnificently powerful Wizard who has unlimited magic power although only knows magics to attack and defend and not the type of wizard who conjures objects and bends time and space, fight through the insanely dramatic storyline which you will most likely forget about 1 hour in as you are taken away by the sheer amazingness of the spells and severeely under informative crafting menu.LONG REVIEW:Magic is seperated in these sub catergories is Sigils containing so far of Fire, Ice, Lightning, Corruption, Necromancy, Phase, Delirium and Kinesis. All come with their own way of attack, defence and support.The magic is spectacular and every hit has a amazing satisfaction along with it, although the game starts off rather limited on spells and the tuturial is rather long but as you play you grow to become more powerful as you upgrade and add effects and a new status to every spell. There are three ways of casting Basic hand shoot, Nova and AOE. the basic one is shooting spells from the casters hand and that can cause magic to be casted as a direct missile, homing missile and or lobbing. Nova is the spell in which is activated via Shield burst or Aimed Blinking. AOE is area of effect and pretty self explanatory as its a spell you shoot from the sky and does a either a burst of magic, lingering effect or trap.Blinking is a basic power in which you teleport a short distance and is very useful when dodging, Another thing is that your character doesn't really die as there are checkpoints in the game rather than saving as when the character runs out of their shield they will be teleported to the checkpoint in which they can retry to the battle.Thats the basic of the game but i really recommend to who evers reading this to play if they like action adventures with a hint of some open world as well as magic games like skyrim or magicka. This game is amazing.			"

												I should start by saying this game isn't terrible.  You can play it for a bit and have fun.  That said...This game really suffers from squandered potential.  The tagline is that you are a wizard and you don't have to deal with mana bars or cooldowns, so now that you have unlimited magic power you can go on a crazy murder spree.In actuality to get to fight the same 5 guys over and over again in a storyline that doesn't make much sense (spoilers below).The story starts with a bad evil dude coming up and messing with your family.  He is a bad evil dude because he likes stabbing people and has a goatee.  You are then visited by a wizard named Roth who raises you from the dead and gives you ""unlimited power"" and the ability to not die ever again.  Having thus removed any dramatic tension from the story, you then go fight a cult and some undead guys who may or may not be fighting each other and it may or may not matter.  Also, all the human antagonists give you long, boring monologues while invincible and then teleport away unless the game arbitrarily decides they're going to stop and fight the guy who is, as a reminder, completely invincible and cannot be killed.Now this would be forgivable if gameplay was actually good, but it gets boring fast.  The game makes a big deal out of its spellcrafting system - but for the most part spells are generally damage, status effect, or weird combo debuff.  Spells are created from randomly dropped items you can mess around with in interesting ways to upgrade them for upgrades that may or may not do anything.  There are some stats on the player screen - destruction, mastery, control - that get affected by these somehow and maybe sorta kinda determine spell effects?  I don't know, the game didn't explain and I couldn't tell you how the formula works.  Some of these drops are rarer but don't seem better.  You can pick 3 of 8 elements and of these three you get a nova (with weird trigger conditions), an aoe, and a single-target missile spell, all of which are upgradable to have different numbers that do...stuff.  It's not a terrible system, it's just repetitive and you never feel you are getting anywhere.  At the beginning of the game you can call down a firestorm.  At the end of the game you can call down a firestorm, but with bigger numbers.  Maybe if you futz around with the numbers you can use a completely separate subsystem and call down a meteor.  Now, many video games have this problem, but for a game about ""Unshackling the mage"", the fact that a wizard in Baldur's Gate can pull off more impressive and interesting feats of magic kinda sucks.Of course, there's a reason you don't get interesting magic like long-range teleportation or invisibility - the game is a linear line where you run through and fight the same 5 guys.  I'm not even talking palette swaps here.  There is a model of a black-clad lady with some kind of acid vial she throws at you.  She has the same 3 lines.  You will hear these same lines at the beginning of the game, the end of the game, and the part of the game where I got bored and quit.  You will meet a teleporting undead guy.  Later in the desert, you will meet the same teleporting undead guy.  He is one of like 3 different skeletons in the game.  Maybe if you are lucky you will meet a wolf.  Maybe you'll even get to the demons in the desert before giving up in boredom.At the end of the day the game had potential, but squandered it on recycling the same old crap with bigger numbers.			"

												I recently bought the game when it was on sale.Below, I'll just shortly sum up what I think about the game:Pro:+ casting spells is fun (feels like a mixture of Bioshock plasmids and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic)+ the game is challenging at times, but never unfair+ spell crafting has the addictive rpg aspect(you always look for a better combination of spells)+ really nice graphics, atmospheric environments and spell effectsContra- the story and gameplay are very linear(essentially you run from one enemy horde to the next and that's it)- well, 1000 spells certainly is a lie!You always carry a max number of 9 spells with you. That is, 3 sigils (e.g. fire, frost, lightning) with 3 spells eachincluding 1 AoE, 1 Projectile and 1 Nova. There are maybe a dozen different spell types, such as missile, ray, trap etc. and by crafting you can add attributes such as reduced cast time, enhanced effect duration etc. - however, there are not1000 different spells in that sense - you could craft 20 different types of rays for instance.So, overall, it's still not a bad game! Combat is fun, although I found that I settled for a specific sigil combination relatively early (fire - deal dmg, ice - freeze enemies, and kinesis - anchor and debuff). Experimenting with different sigils and spells may be interesting, but why change a winning team, right?I'd recommend the game to anyone who is looking for a sort of RPG, battlemage-like FPS and no desire for open-worldand deep-story gameplay!Cheers!

There is some overlap in Sigils initially but you can totally craft away from that. If demolishing baddies with huge crits while blinking across the battlefield with flourish sounds like a good time, all with georgous graphics and fantastic spell effects (that differ between each of the 12 Sigils), then this game should be in your library.

												Lichdom: Battlemage offers a prospect that many other games don't offer: ""What if magic was as easy as normal fighting? No cooldowns, and the limit to your power is how strong of spells you can form"". The problem with this is that, while that premise of the game is delivered upon, most of the rest of the game just isn't anything beyond pretty at best. Honestly, that's about the nicest thing I can say about this game, because it's in Cryengine, it's rather pretty. However, all of that is lost when you have as many other things that are just NOT very good.The largest gripes I have with the game are:- Enemy variety is basically non-existent        There are MAYBE 9 varieties of enemy, and about half of those don't show up till around 1/2 through the game- There are only really 24 spells       You can craft many different spells with different stats, but there are only 24 different effects, and many of those overlap.- Difficulty is very poorly balanced        I literally ACCIDENTALLY killed the 4th boss (there are 5 total) in one shot, without any sort of crit beyond charging my spell. On the flip side, some normal mini-bosses will one-shot you and take multiple apocalypticals (double-crits) to kill.- About as linear as you could possibly imagine        This game offers basically no choice, all the game play takes place in what is effectively hallways. To give an idea, it's about as linear as Bulletstorm or Gears of War 1- The game is about 2X as long as is necessary        I've played it for around 32 hours, and about 14 hours of it felt boring/repetitive/pointlessThat being said, the game is definitely worth around the first 10 hours or so, as experimenting around with synergies and sigils can be quite fun. It just gets boring, as I quickly realized that most of the spells do effectively the same things with different particle effects. Some do actually do completely different things (i.e. Phase & Necromancy), but in the end, it is most effective to just grab a big DPS sigil, like Fire, an then some means to stop enemies in their tracks, and then blast them with mastery (which is a gameplay element that allows for amplified damage) until you are ready to blow them to kingdom come.I can't recommend the game at full price. However, if the game is on sale for ~$10 or less, feel free to buy it, as it is worth that in my opinion.			"

If you don't get what you need from that statement alone then I doubt anything else will convince you to buy the game. I played it. I beat it. I loved it.			"

												While I've only put in an hour or so, this game has failed to grab me.It is extremely linear, and I have been fighting the same enemies for an hour. I feel no reason to combo ice and fire, (ice stores damage until hit with fire; might as well just hit with fire to begin with) and thus I am spamming the same spells over and over.While it is pretty, and the spell crafting is reasonably interesting, it is not interesting or exciting enough to keep me playing.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN AMD PROCESSORI have an Intel processor that is rated higher for performance than the AMD requirement, and yet this game lags so hard that it is unplayable after a time. It reeks of favoritism, but I could be wrong. I just know that I have played other CryEngine games with no problems, but suddenly this one is (no shock that AMD gets a big shoutout in the opening sequence). When first starting the game, i can play for about 30 minutes before the lag is unbearable, and that is being generous. I can bear with the lag for normal mobs, which is easy, but boss fights are impossible. Motion blur is ridiculous EVEN WHEN I HAVE IT TURNED OFF.			"

												i haven't played much of this game yet, but i like the story so far.  the spells are pretty cool, though some i have yet to figure out what the do.  the game seems pretty easy, but then you get a boss which is very challenging. i have fought 2 that both have been very challenging.  some aspects of the game are a bit frustrating, but overall the game is pretty fun.  there is a lot of strategics in comboing up spells to get very high damage.  as you level up you can add more augments to your spells, which i imagine makes can make the spells do pretty crazy things.  the game is overall about a 7/10, but could maybe get better.  the more i play the more stuff i will be able to try out, so hopefully after a while the game will really make me feel like a badass.

												I usually have no hope for games where magic or fantasy elements are molded into a first-person shooter.  This game however manages to pull it off, and it a very satisfying and natural way.  Add to this the amazing production value and the fact that they didn't use CryEngine cookie-cutter assets (everything's very well crafted, AAA level) and you have yourself a solid gaming experience.My only negative is that the voice talent is very good, but the dialog could use some improvement.

												Hot damn, Xaviant have crafted something really beautiful with Battlemage: gorgeous environments and vibrantly repugnant enemies coalesce with a deep and engaging spell crafting system which rewards experimentation and creativity to produce a gauntlet of frenetic action which rarely risks monotony. The combat system itself consists of only a few basic elements, but these can be utilised in quick succession, rewarding quick reflexes and tactical planning and punishing those who assume that spamming the flame spells will achieve victory; it won't, genius. It also demands mentioning that the spells themselves are positively... well... spellbinding (deal with it), wild motes of colour dancing, arcing, bolting and exploding in vivid spectra from the bare hands of your avatar to pierce, bludgeon, restrain and, often, utterly decimate the wonderfully lively monsters and undead you face throughout Battlemage.All this said, the tutorial systems are an eggregious state of poor: shortly after beginning the game, having been just introduced to the four or five most basic combat features of the game, Battlemage simply gave up on tutoring me at all, instead directing me to the in-game journal for a lovely dump of boring text to sift through and educate myself on what are, honestly, the far more interesting aspects of the game, such as crafting and the three key types of spell damage required for combos. Endless Legend suffered from much the same issues with its tutorial (100 hours and I am still having to learn obscure mechanics through experimentation). Fortunately, Battlemage's mechanics are far simpler and easier to experiment with and, thus, thoroughly learn, but it still saddens me that this will likely turn many people off through lack of easy accessibility born from a lack of simple tutorials.Obviously, highly recommended. Additionally, the 1.2 hours currently listed for my playtime for the game are false. It is significantly more than that.			"

												After having played through Lichdom once and having done some stuff in the new game + mode I can say that this game is one the one side really awesome, on the other side however the devs ruined it with bad design decisions and elements that  easily make you hate a game.First off, the graphics are quite good. Strong explosions, epic vistas, lighting effects, cry engine 3 has been used well and the game is one of the best looking out there at the moment, probably te best looking mage-game that exists.Now, the magic. In the game you can use 3 magic types at the same time switching between them by mouse wheel, there are eight magic types overall reaching from mind control to necromancy to fire and ice. All of them feel quite well implemented and they all bring their purpose, however the ""spellcrafting"" sounds cooler than it is. If you think you can mix elements or do your completely own spells youre wrong. You have control spells, mastery spells that increase critical damage you deal and normal damage spells. Those types can be delivered in special shapes: rays, missiles, lobbed projectiles, AoEs, AoE pools. Thats it.There are special spells called synergies that can be used when crafting spells with legendary items, however those require two spell sigils to be equipped (e.g. kinetic and fire calls a meteor). What I missed were some more inspired ways to deliver damage like throwing frost shards, a flamethrower or life-leeching spells. Especially the necromancy sigil is very one-sided as all ways of augments have the same effects.Spells are crafted from items that frop from enemies, making the spellcrafting lichdoms biggest strength and weakness at the same time. Loot is random and you will find tons of junk, this feels cheap and does not motivate.The combat in the game is skill-based(casuals might die once or twice, I for myself did not find it that hard, only died 4 times at the second boss and then never died on a boss again, battlemage difficulty) and feels actually very good, however there are not many types of enemies and you will get bored really fast. There are some ""elite"" mobs with special prefixes, loot rarity increases with every checkpoint you pass without dying but that's it already. 99% of the game you are throwing fireballs on enemies or melt faces. That's where we come to on of the bigger negative points of lichdom: repetitiveness. Some levels fell so large that they never end or you just think ""gosh, I know that this swamp is beautiful and all but I want to keep going"".The story is classic fantasy blabla: bad man kills wife (male player character way), mage gives you cool braces that can do magix, you kill everything that moves -> boss etc. So, can recommned this game? Yes and no. Yes for the time I spent experimenting with all the spells and combos exploding enemies in gory clouds of blood and sucking them into black holes. No for the really repetitive gameplay and the wasted potential because of the linear level design. Overall I had fun even though, it got a bit worse to the end.I'd say it deserves a 7/10 with my emotions reaching from ""what a bad game"" to ""OH MY GOD IS THIS AWESOME""Give these people your money, hope they will learn from their mistakes and if lichdom 2 is a thing I know it's going to be awesome.

												----WARNING, WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!----    I expected more. I expected to be a badass mage, flinging cool (and sometimes silly) custom spells around. There are 3 variants of spell modifier for 2 of the 3 spell types, with 8 'Sigils' (magic types), and Destrution, Control, and Mastery effects for each. Sounds good, right? It's not, and that is because Destruction, Control, and Mastery have no effect on the apperance of your spells, Destruction = Damage, Control = Influencing enemies(dmg over time, stuns, etc.), and Mastery = Enemies take increased damage.    The spell modifiers only change how the effect is delivered ( a continous stream, a grenade like effect, homing missles, etc.) Each Sigil type is nice, excluding the over-done and over-used types of Fire and Ice. You have a Aoe spell (think traps), your thrown spells, and Novas (what happens when you use a charged blink). Basically the spells aren't anywere near as customizable as they should be. Also you can only use 1 Sigil type per both hands, no dual-wielding differnt spell types.    Shield's are stupid, there are 3 types of shields. 1-Agile, quick blinks and charged blinks, low damage block, low shield. 2-Tactical, charged blinks, medium damage block, medium shield. 3-Strategic,3 quick blinks (has recharge), high damage block, high shield. My problem with them is that I can't use any of them. Agile is fast enough, but lacts the shield I need, while strategic has enough shield but isn't fast enough. Tactical is just stupid, mainly because I can't dodge last second.   The enemies are annoying, and make things like boss fights ridiculously tedious. Most of my deaths in this game have involved trying to take shortcuts through levels (which are all very linear btw) or being stunlocked by ranged enemies till the boss finally connects with a hit (usually a insta/near insta-kill even on lower difficulties).   I've only been to about 4 locations in the game if you include the tutorial. I could not find a single shortcut through these levels, considering there is no jump button, and 4 ft falls kill you. These levels (excluding the tutorial) are overly long, and very tedious.  If you want a nice to look at game with good magic effects, here it is. I'd rather much prefer something that actually gave me insanely customizable spells, with fun game mechanics.			"

												In the game you play as a mage with limitless power. They have a super annoying spell crafting system, basically there are 5 types of spells in the gameMissiles, Lobs, Rays, AOE and special spells and all you do in spell crafting is select what base element you want e.g fire and then change the stats on a missile attack or lob attack e,g 20% extra crit damage, other then that there is no real customisation to spells which made it quite boring. The gameplay is super retitive and it seems like its going to be fun for about an hour and then it gets boring and repetitive killing same enemies over and over in these generic 1 way paths you follow for hours and hours. Theres no real exploration in this game even though it may look slightly open world. The graphics in this game are amazing and the scenery was so cool i had to stop and take it in a few times, please note you do need a good computer to play this game!Story line is alright but the constant shadow memmories got annoying quick as did the mission objectives which were either chase after some enemy or go somewhere to kill some enemy. There were only 1 or 2 bugs in the game usually where some enemy got infinite health other wise it ran really smooth and was pretty good. This is definatly one of those games with 0 replayibility and that you just wish would hurry up and end already so you can move on but despite all its problems i still enjoyed my self most of the time. 5/10 for sure very on the fence with this one! ... but them graphics and scenery <3			"

												TLDR: If you usually like to understand games and if you have even the patience that you usually need on PURE RPG games well you will love the ""almost"" infinite crafting possibilities you will find in this game, and this game will be so easy to play that you will ask yourself ""Am I really playing at the hardest difficulty?"". If you don't have those two qualities don't buy this game; you will totally miss the fun and this game will become IMPOSSIBLE to play and you will ask yourself ""Why I'm not able to wounding my enemies?""LV:I was just looking for my girlfriend (if you choose the male)/my sister (if you choose the woman) and I've discovered that I am one of the most powerful mages in the whole planet so I said to myself: ""let's go out there and save the entire world"".Let's be clear: this game is the typical LOVE it or HATE it. What the developers tried to do here is something of unique barely seen in other games but this created a huge mess for the typical ""I want to launch my game and just have fun"" players.First of all crafting is not that clear, you have to read you have to mess a bit with it, you have to try, you have to destroy and craft again and so on. Because if a spell is at Tier 9 it doesn't mean it could do more damage than a spell at Tier 7 due to perks and bonuses. You have to be careful about what to do and again you have to READ what you are crafting.And even the most useless (at the first sight) spell could be DEVASTATING USEFULL. For example my shield is not that strong (only almost 3000hp per pip still at tier 9 tho) but it gives me the bonus of unlimited blink. This is a huge advantage if you usually move a lot to avoid people shooting at you. My delirium spell (at the first it seems useless but I had to take a step backward about it) gives me a bonus of a x2-x11 crit multiplier that means after launching that if I shoot at the target I can instantly kill it (even bosses with 3-5 shoots!). And so on.About this you can use the smart inventory that will automatically update your spells. But remember sometimes smart inventory could give you great ideas, sometime doing things by yourself is BETTER.So yes it is a game that you have to understand and that you have to adapt to your gameplay style because IT DOESN'T adapt to you.So again is not for everyone.Second, the graphic is indeed amazing (well...CryEngine 3 you know...) the sounds are good and even the music it is. The scenarios will leave you with your mouth open. If you have a middle range nVidia card BEWARE because this game was made with AMD support so you could have some trouble and it doesn't depends from your GPU but from the software itself so you may have to tweak it a bit (no problem with my 970 anyway)Third, the story leaves you a bit unsatisfied; yes it engages you at a certain point but it leaves a lot of doors open in the end (probably the developers were thinking about a Lichdom 2 who knows and personally I hope for it). At the end of the game starts the ""New gameb"" mode. You will be able to teleport yourself in every area of the game, plus there will be new portals to explore (and to let you maximize your spells by unlocking tier 10 and above)The gameplay in general is quite linear, go ahead, devastate everything you see, go ahead, find some loot machines to clear,  fight the boss start the next level. Simple and linear, no puzzle and not a lot of exploration.What I think about it?This game has got a lot of potential, but is not for the taste of everyone. As we all well know pretty graphics don't make a game good, gameplay and story does.So again, if you like to craft and experiment a lot go ahead buy this game; or if you are willing to try it because you are curious buy it when it is on sales.If you want a game with a deep intense story and without a 100% guaranteed headache due to crafting DON'T buy this game.OverallGraphic 9/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 7/10Longevity 7/10Controls 7/10			"

												Loved some of the ideas. Loved the combat mechanics and both the offensive and defensive capabilities. Absolutely love the graphics and audio. However, this game fell flat in just about everything else that's important to the game - Objectives are repetitive, difficulty curve is irratic and frustrating, and the storyline is simply unremarkable.

As one of the few real good magic games out there, I really love how challenging it is and how the secret areas really hone your skills.People say that you just use the same spells for the whole game, but you can make higher level spells as you progress.We need more magic action games out there!

								I like the game, just not as is. for now the concept of the game I love.(Random mini glowy thing in an inconcspicuous spot is touchable but when touched: lights up and all of a sudden you are fighting a horde of face eating gladiater zombies in a fight for your life. is one such example of part of the concept of the game I love) I have no idea why it would happen and I hope the information will be there eventually as to why that may have happened. I survived that instance of random fight or die situation, so because of that randomness and lack of understanding It felt like a scary movie where I had to poke everything in the eye with my crappy fire balls or nothing was going to be okay (and thats all I knew). It was fun.  I hope to see more spell effects. For instance the fire manipulation magic could have an interesting concept about ""controlling"" things that are ""set"" on fire *wink wink* thrown in there some how. just as an example, pay no mind to the random idea. Love the game, And I loved super smash bros. for me that is saying something. I can't play the game though because it feels very linear, I don't know what is going on story wise and the spells are slow and feel clunky for as little as they do. Alot of the time i am just running marathons backwards for days without any other reason besides waiting for the damage to rack up high enough to kill the freakin braindead zombie. I am sure you guys are going to murder the game (in a good way) and i will be playing more and more with each update for sure. Love the game, The bosses are hella fun, Need like 2 or so more spell options at any given time besides the ""2"" though or I wont be playing any more. If you want some funding I would't mind donating to this awesome concept of kick♥♥♥♥♥mage takes down evil corrupt government of doom. Someone feel free to message me and I will gift this to you so you may try it, for your sake and the developers sake. Spreading the love, Wooo!			"

								The Good: The Graphics are outstanding, the music fits the mood of the game, and the combat difficulty is nearly Dark Souls level. The Bad: The gameplay is pretty repetetive as of now, spells consist of a single blast, an aoe, a barrier, and a teleport. And this is for all spells, not just your initial Fire and Ice powers. Granted, each spell has different effects and can be uniquely upgraded, but at the end of the day you are still just shooting the same 4 spells. For a game that is designed to make you feel all powerful, it instead makes you feel limited to what you can actually do.This game has amazing potential. Whether it will live up to it is unknown. I have high hopes for this game, which is why I would still recommend it in spite of the combat system. It is still a very enjoyable game and definitely worth the money.			"

								Even during early access, this is a very polished game just oozing with potential. It looks fantastic, feels great, and really drew me into another world full of epic spells and vicious enemies. What really surprised me was how deep, yet elegant the crafting system was for a game where you don't make swords or helmets. Instead, you can tinker with your spells, changing how they behave, until you get an array of tools that fit your exact playstyle. I have no doubt that Lichdom will achieve widespread success and industry accolades.			"

								A great game in concept and has the potential to be mindblowing with the level of customisation on the spells. However, I will say that there is no tutorial for the spell crafting side, other than longwinded descriptions in the journal that really arn't that informative or helpful (or exciting for that matter). With a few video guides (not a lot out there at the moment (look for a guy called F3TTST3R_GAMES on youtube for a 101 on crafting) it becomes much clearer, but I kind of hoped that the crafting mechanic would have some kind of guiding help in there as it is a pretty big system and a core mechanic of the game. If there is a guide built into the game and I have missed it then this is just as bad as it was not obvious on any level and I am the typically experienced gamer.If this is fixed and the system becomes more user friendly (there was a point that I had levelled up 6 times without noticing that I had points to spend because the UI is so cluttered and even then I really wasn't too sure what my invested points did in some cases) then the game will be very unique and extremely good fun. It is a little repetitive, but this should be alleivated with the crafting mechanic, essentially finding new and better ways (read fun) of putting the enemies down once I have a better grasp of it. The story is a little loose and entirely linear, albeit a few caves here and there to nip into to find health. I really do want this game to be great, the concept is unique in a very hard to be unique category which I love. However, I do feel that the linear story line does wreck it a little for me. Overall I would definitely recommend playing Lichdom (although again, where does the lichdom title come from? Other than being dead/resurrected you actually play as a dragon... not a lich, or at least a dracolich if you are?). However, I definitely feel that Lichdom 2 should be much better once the team have a little more experience with this concept.Positives:Unique play stylePretty but laggy all over the show (a PC restart after install fixed most of this)Fun and creativeImprovements that I would like to see:Less linear play - sandbox style RPG world would make this game mindblowingMore intuitive crafting system Less cluttered crafting UI This review does sound negative but it really is a good game with a LOT of potential. How the developers run with that potential is what will make this game great.			"

												16 hours in the game just before second boss that is tough like macadamian nutt and as much as i hate difficult videogames (will never play dark souls, final word on it) I am complettely endorsed and involved with this game. I have always like the magic(ians) part in the whole fairy taily stuff. It is probably what draw me and my imagination towards this and those of you who are like minded or power junkies will find falling in love with this game experience waaay easier.In general the spell crafting is the core joy. There is a learning curve that took me some research onine on forums but once I stumbled up on a straigh forward guide i realise how simple and yet complex and wide ad the same time the spell system is.I can put your fears in rest if you are worried that those folks complaining about lack of spells and choices are strumming that as the game progresses you will gain interesting spells from the clasical fire or ice, to phasing or necromancy etc. What youy make of them is up to. But rest assured that you will feel like someone who has discovered how the magic works and you will sudennly turn into spell afixes and prefixes seeking geek who just wants more of the mastery augments to get that effect right.So have fun. And ignore my typos. Im half blind.			"

								One thing that I can say about this game is that it truly is an impressive game. I love the way the game looks and feels and handles even though it is in early Beta.I was excited about this game when I first heard about it a year ago (Atleast 6 months now) and the first comparison that I was given about it was Skyrim's magic with better graphics. It so far fits my first image of it and I am positive that it will only get better now that it has entered it's beta stage.I may not have played much of it (Because it was in early Alpha and didn't have much aswell as me just not having the time to play it) but every moment that I have spent in this world that was so beautifully crafted just left me in awe of how well the creators did in piecing together the game.I'm not saying that this is the pinacle of gaming or that this is without any faults (Which of course would be strait out lying) but the sheer beauty that this game holds and the interesting gameplay mechanics come together in an odd harmony that just makes you want to play this game more.This is a game that Is worth supporting and I hope that it remains strong until the very end.

								Excellent graphics and voice acting. The controls are smooth and the combat is fluid...which is a very good thing since this is basically a FPS with magic instead of guns. The types of magic (fire, ice, lightning, etc) are pretty cool and each have differing side effects upon enemies, although the list of magic types looks a little small currently...I hope some more kinds get added. The loot you collect in this game is basically spell components which you can mix together to alter the way your spells work...essentially allowing you to craft various effects for different needs and to suit your preferences.   I really am enjoying the game. So far the storyline is interesting...not stellar (just yet at least), but interesting enough. You also find scrolls and such through the levels that add bit of lore reading in your journal.  My only complaint is how narrow and linear the game/maps/levels are. It basically funnels you through the levels with predictable enemy spawn areas. The enemies are not just standing around patrolling...they spawn on you when you reach certain points. I like my fantasy games to have a little more openness and room to explore honestly, but this is unfortunately not the case here.   The boss battles are very challenging and really will put your skills to the test, but also very rewarding once you land that final blow and see all the loot candy fly into you. :)			"

												It's like Wizard Borderlands. Collect color-coded magic bubbles from enemies to make better magic, and use your better magic to out-magic the magic men to get better magic bubbles... But it really lets you down with the ""be a total badass"" part. Getting badassery means you pray for the best magic bubbles, combine them to form a good magic (that you likely soon outlevel), and hoping the spell activates badass mode, thus letting you have the baddassery that you so desperately craved for like, 20 seconds. At least you can instantly kill most enemies with a decent freeze spell and any other projectile.			"

												It's like they made an awesome game and then had a brainstorm on how to remove all the fun from it in few easy steps. First of all game looks awesome, level design is awesome, spell effects are awesome, enemy animations are awesome, everything concerning the looks is great, and that's why this game looks so bloody amazing on screenshots. But damn I had no fun playing it. Maybe it's my fault - I did expect a painkiller/serious sam type game with magic, but I got something else. The mage moves like a crippled turtle, which is extremely annoying. The spell crafting is needlessly complex and the tutorials are just kinda missing, instead they give you a smart inventory and say - just use it, don't go into details. And the most dissapointing thing for me was the way the magic is equipped - it's like they are restricting you from combining different spells. Maybe it's me, but I did not find any way to put for example freez ray on LMB and fireball on RMB - just to make things easier, instead you are forced to switch sigils, which gets annoying fast and just no fun at all. I enjoy the difficulty in the games, but not when it comes from broken controls.See? All the negatives about this game are so minor and so easy to fix, but damn those 3 little things reduce all the fun nearly to zero. Just give a simplier crafting system, faster movement and ability to custom assign spells and voila! The game would be perfect, but now the gameplay is just no fun... at least for me.PS I will gladly change this review into a positive one after the developers will give the ability to custom assign spellsPPS changed the rating to positive after few hours, because i literally felt bad for giving a negative review. anyway I hope that mentioned issues will be fixed one day			"

												Kauft den Mist nicht!ich werde später mehr dazu schreiben.Das ist aktuell nur eine Warnung. Das Spiel ist keine fünf Euro wert.Das Spiel ist grafisch zwar ok, zieht aber die Performance eines I7 mit zwei Grafikkarten im idle runter. Irgendwas stimmt da nicht.Weiterhin ist man ganz und gar an die miserable Story gebunden und hat keine Freiräume für Entdeckungen im Sinne einer Open World Mechanik.Dann kommen da die Zaubersprüche daher zum selber basteln.Das ganze unterliegt einer krassen Einschränkung der Möglichkeiten.Tatsächlich muss man sich auf wenige Zaubersprüche festlegen und immer nach dem selben Schema, single Burst, AoE oder Def. Das macht überhaupt keinen Spaß :/Sorry Leute, macht Euch besser nochmal schlau bevor ihr das wirklich kauft oder zieht erstmal ne Demoversion ;-)			"

												My attachment to the main character (I chose the male instead of the female for my current run) is a bit shallow. Something horrible happens to him to start him on his journey, but he ends up spending most of it casually hunting down his targets with part joking/mostly serious commentary interspersed throughout the game. I feel like this may be the weakest part of the game - if there was a background for his actions and thoughts, I'd feel more connected.With that said, the gameplay itself is fantastic. The magic system is very thorough and a bit daunting to figure out at first. The tutorials help, but it took me a few times to hammer home the concepts behind single target, AE, and nova spells.I love the mechanics in the game. If they make a sequel, my one hope is for more background to the main character.			"

								I think the biggest surprise from this game was that it is actually an ARPG. You've gotta farm enemies for better spell components, the better of which have a notable effect on damage etc. It's fairly difficult, there are a lot of enemies with spell shields and many more that have ranged abilities that do a decent chunk of your health.

								Good game thats lots of fun as well as being beautiful, really enjoying it so far, and definetly worth the priceCons:- Definetly unfinished, the largest pointer being the character animations (ie no facial expressions or mouth movements)- Hard as heck which whilst can be challenging and fun it would be nice to have modes of difficulty because some areas can get frustrating - Whilst theres spell casting tutorials, a tutorial on the crafting system would be nice as it can take a while to figure out, unless thats just me being dumb- interesting tressfx- Performance slowdowns in unusual areas like in the middle of a corridor where there doesnt seem to be any noticeable change in graphics etcBut otherwise its a good game and the flaws are minor and forgiveable due to it being in beta :)			"

								One thing that I can say about this game is that it truly is an impressive game. I love the way the game looks and feels and handles even though it is in early Beta.I was excited about this game when I first heard about it a year ago (Atleast 6 months now) and the first comparison that I was given about it was Skyrim's magic with better graphics. It so far fits my first image of it and I am positive that it will only get better now that it has entered it's beta stage.I may not have played much of it (Because it was in early Alpha and didn't have much aswell as me just not having the time to play it) but every moment that I have spent in this world that was so beautifully crafted just left me in awe of how well the creators did in piecing together the game.I'm not saying that this is the pinacle of gaming or that this is without any faults (Which of course would be strait out lying) but the sheer beauty that this game holds and the interesting gameplay mechanics come together in an odd harmony that just makes you want to play this game more.This is a game that Is worth supporting and I hope that it remains strong until the very end.

								I have played about 2 hours worth of this game so far. There are a few things that i must bring up considering its still in beta. During the ""Echoes"" there is a small glitch in the graphics were a huge tranparent blue beam erupts and consumes the man in the robe and cowl. Small, but fixable. The MAJOR glitch I found was when i was in the catacombs, I was battling on the third undead Obilisk when I backed up and fell. It seemed that it was not mormal for i did not die and respawn but simply sat there dwiddling my thumbs. This could pose a great threat to the player later on in the game. Other than that so far its all I could possibly ask for in an RPG.			"

												Was enthusiastic about the idea, but they just don't deliver. The mage doesn't feel like a badass - you're even weaker than usual (shield only regenerates partially) and the spells are neither spectacular, nor really powerful. You have unlimited ""mana"", but that doesn't feel really powerful when you have casting time and damage limiting you.5 fireballs to kill a skeleton, and two shots from an archer to kill you? The game claims that you don't have to ""run away anymore"".. sorry to break it to you but it's just PR.On the plus side, the game looks great..			"

												I don't know which game Paste Magazine found to be ""New Gold Standard"" for combat, but it wasn't this one.Its an interesting change that i've not seen done before, but on the whole I felt that it just didn't work, and the most efficient way to dispatch the (ludicrously tanky) enemies was to spam the basic boring attack - that is unless I missed some dramatic meta combo that would have made the game a breeze, but that seems unlikely.The game does look fairly nice, but that can be a two-edged sword at times as the pretty effects clutter up the screen and make it hard to see exactly what is going on.Overall though the biggest crime was thatthe game was such a chore to play. Grinding out random loot (that scales worse than the opponents hp) from the enemies significant health pools was pretty much a necesity to get half-decent spells. And takes forever.			"

												7.5/10 Because...Phase Rift + Ice Pools + Corruption Hive = HMOG!  O_O'The short of it:This game is well worth the purchase when it's on sale for 50-75% off (or better). The spell combinations (and their resulting effects) and crafting system are great once you get the hang of it. The FPS-esque style a lot of fun for a while despite some quirks and annoying features. !!! Highly recommended before or after purchase:Watch a few gameplay videos. Read up on spell mechanics, what each attunement does, combined effects, and how to optimize your build for control, defense, and damage.PROS+ nice variety of spell patterns and combinations+ unique spell 'crafting' system (once you get the hang of what each component does)+ satisfying when in the mood for destruction (pun coincidental)+ great visual effects in combat with certain spell combinations+ nice graphics in general and some fascinating environmentsCONS- sorely inadequate intro to spells and crafting- very repetitive enemies and same style of combat throughout- linear gameplay, story, and level design- lots of farming required to get decent spell patterns- irritating save points and stage restart-on-death- ""Smart"" inventory system is anything but- terrible voice acting			"

												Hell.The graphical outlooks is mediocre at best.Player movement in itself is quite clunky.The levels are straightforward boring and unimaginative. The lack of even simple puzzles frustrates in itself. Even the collectibles are not hidden to begin with.The story started well, but...There are tutorials for almost everything except the spellcrafting system, which should be explained. Also it's too complex to get a clear understanding of.The combat isn't really hard to begin with. It's an illusion and one can just spam bolts and AoE's here and there and progress anyways. Also infinite warping shield makes this babby's first combat experience.This could've been an epic power fantasy game, yet it manages to be both PLAIN BORING, FRUSTRATINGLY COMPLEX at the same time. Too bad.I really hope that in the future such things are looked at and given proper thought.			"

												The first time i played this game, i was unable to appreciate it. I was looking for an elder scrolls type of gameplay. With this in mind i played around 2 hours and uninstall it.But few days ago, one year after i buy it, i decided to reinstall it cause i wanted to play a good and hard mage game. So i tested it again and.. the things i didn't like the first time maked me like it this time.There are ""only"" two type of objects : shapes and augments. They can be improved and allow you t o craft spells. You don't need to search in dead body, they come on you.The crafting system is complete and you can make your own spells for what you want to do.The sigil system allow you to have 9 spells and easily switch them. Indeed, you can have 1 spell of each type (tageted, AOL, nova) of 3 differents elements (sigils). There are eight different sigils, each one with his own capacity and gameplay.This game is for you if you want hard boss fight like in dark souls. if you want it, wait a little, it is often on sales under 3 €.If you choose to try it two tips : keep moving and always have a good shield			"

												If you like spellcasting in first person, this game have it. Its quite linear from what I have seen, I will soon continue my journey through this game. In Early access it was quite buggy and took nearly 10 minutes to start, thus my little time in it. But once in the game it ran smoothly and I quite liked the story.I would compare the spellcasting a bit to Skyrim, except you have more possibilities in Lichdom. I'd give it a 7.5/10 from what I have seen so far.			"

And also if your PC says you have Direct X 11 that doesn't mean that you actually have it, it simply means you are capable of having it in some cases. Do some research on the subject before parting with £30 because all I got for it was a black screen and some random sounds...			"

												I would describe this game as a shootery approach to magic combat. Think the magic aspect from Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, but faster paced and with a deeper spell system. It offers blocking and dodging mechanics, much like hack-and-slash games like Ninja Gaiden or Darksiders, but with spells instead of swords.While the alpha is little more than a demonstration of the combat system, it is still great fun.I was very impressed with the spell system and its visual representation within the game. However, there are not a lot of different enemy types. Those that are there do not require special tactics or combos of spells. This allows to focus on a single category of magic and makes the others a bit redundant. Hopefully, this will change in the course of development.The alpha also demonstrates the potential story and atmosphere in the game. At certain points, you'll see short scenes of other characters interacting, illuminating the background as well as backing aspects of the combat system with game lore. I would describe those as the magical equivalent of audio logs in other games (System Shock 2, etc). This is currently implemented very rough, with text overlays instead of speech.I'd recommend consulting some of the numerous first impressions videos out there before making a buying decision. What you see in those videos is pretty much what you'll get at the moment. Overall, the game shows great potential, is visually pleasing and the combat is great fun for a few hours. In its current state, however, the asking price is justified only if you really like magic combat in games or are convinced that the final game will fulfill the potential that this alpha shows.			"

Yes, you can combine spells and such. However, you are killed in onw to two hits. It feels like it takes AGES to get through a basic area. The story is so damn boring I feel like it belongs on the Lifetime network. 4/10.   If you're going to talk this game up so much, at least make some of it true.			"

												This is a very enjoyable game which is worth picking up, provided you know what to expect.Do not expect non-linearity, particularly varied enemies, or a deep plot.Do expect a wonderfully engaging crafting system, beautiful scenery and competent voice acting, and unbelievably satisfying spell-slinging.The new 'smart inventory' system works beautifully to get you into the game (as long as you poke your head into the journal to look up a few concepts now and then) enough to begin crafting your own spells. I typically don't like crafting-focused games too much - I generally want to be able to pick stuff up and hit a ""optimise"" button to equip the best stuff. This handles that nicely - if you craft a spell, the smart inventory will then provide an upgrade button when appropriate, making inventory management simple. If even that level of crafting puts you off, you can treat the default spells as abilities to be mixed, matched, and upgraded, never diving into the deep spell crafting system underneath. With this approach you'd end up using, say, fire for damage, ice for crowd control, and kinesis to apply mastery (play the game to find out that *that* means).The combat is not hugely varied, but is consistently challenging and scales well - smacking down demons in the later stages which were Big Bosses earlier on is immensely gratifying. The minions only have a few flavours and types - melee, ranged, spellcasters, flying, and tanks. Even on lower difficulties this is sufficient to provide a consistent challenge, although it is a little repetitive and it's rare that the environment provides any interesting tactical options beyond ducking behind cover. If you can get this at a discount ($10 or so) it's entirely worth it.			"

												No freeroam. Very linear, has a story. Which is written in a poor manor for giving feel to the game. Feels like a B rate movie with you as a C rate character. Monsters are simular and easily herass you. The magic system does not let you choose how to upgrade your spells until maybe late late game if then even. Take quite a lot of gameplay to understand crafting system that seemingly randomizes the stats you get on them. There is no way of choosing what you spell will be other than I want this to be projectile, Lob, aoe, missle, or other...To add there is no farm. Getting peices that you ""actually"" want is random. Choice in this game is very little other than choosing to click a save point or go past stuff. Did I mention the AI are very herassing. Good luck out running the enemy non stop 1v5+ while arrows home into you with 75% accruacy. Unlimited dashing is almost a need, but what if you wanted to be necro only etc. Nope you will get the sigils in order they are given to you or wait you can chose between the first one Fire or Fire! that right can't even decline it. You get to choose one and are stuck with it and the rest in order game gives them. No shop. Just half aced story. Pick up a scroll woohoo it says I've been searching for BS forever and will do **** on my own now...not literally but this is detail that makes the scrolls you try and find almost not worth picking up. This game you might as well run through and beat everything on easy and enjoy whatever random kablam you can get because there is no system that lets you craft truely how you want. Welp I'm ranting now after playing it for some good 15+ hours about 3 days gotten decently far for starter area and game seems to drag you on fighting checkpoint after another with no real reward other than a howdy 2 npcs that continue throughout the entire games first every chapter now? I was hoping to run around and kill stuff whereever I wanted. Unfortunalty this game has one path and it is very straight forward. Kill stuff, maybe get an item homing into you, continue forward, story/boss/monologue, hey a script or/and bottle/treasure chest thingys did you get a rare from that chest! :D NO!!! >:< It's random in fact you got teir 1 crap from a chest when your at least chapter 3 in game as well as the past 3 chest you opened. The scrolls with ""npc written textual flavor"" might as well be chinese as well the npc monologues. They have no proknown flavor to any wording or anything that sounds remotely exciting. Welp GL! I hope you don't waste your time with this game as much as I have felt like I wasted writing this. Not even worth more than $5 on a sale and I got it for $10 during X-mas.

The three spell thing that everyone else is complaining about isn't really a huge problem, I kind of like it kept to attack spells only rather than enchantments and stuff, but like I said, the selling point of the game is to feel like a badass and be able to obliterate everything in your sight however you want, but I feel like that charaacter could be much stronger and at least be able to jump.

												It's like Wizard Borderlands. Collect color-coded magic bubbles from enemies to make better magic, and use your better magic to out-magic the magic men to get better magic bubbles... But it really lets you down with the ""be a total badass"" part. Getting badassery means you pray for the best magic bubbles, combine them to form a good magic (that you likely soon outlevel), and hoping the spell activates badass mode, thus letting you have the baddassery that you so desperately craved for like, 20 seconds. At least you can instantly kill most enemies with a decent freeze spell and any other projectile.			"

												Awesome game. Certainly worth it in steam sales but the game get a little repetetive after a while. The lootings system is a little simular with the borderlands system only it uses spells instead of guns ofcourse. Crafting can be a little confusing at first but if you watch some tutorials it is actualy pretty easy.It would have been cool if they added a 2 player co op feature.7/10			"

												I can definitely recommend Lichdom: Battlemage. But why and for who is that the case?So as I am not very far into the games story I cannot say a lot about that. Also the story was talked about in other reviews so i will skip this part.For the gameplay I can say it is quite fun to play. You have dozens of different kinds of spells to play around with and you can craft you own set of spells for your vengeful crusade. The crafting system is rather simple altough you sometimes have to scroll through loads of spell materials. Let's look at the details of this crafting system. You have 8 different sigils. The sigils are influencing how your spell will behave the most. You have classics as e.g. Fire, Ice or Lightning sigils but also something like Kinetic or Necromancy. After choosing one of these sigils you have to choose the type of spell you want to create. There you can either take a targeted spell, an aoe or a nova spell (wich can be activated by using your shield at the right moment to kind of ""counter"" enemy attacks with a special effect). While targeted spells can either be lobbed, missiles or rays, aoes can be traps, direct aoe or pools. As far as i know the nova spells have no further variation.So like this for each of the 8 sigils we have 3 variations for targeted and aoe spells and 1 for nova what adds up to 7 variations. Each of the varations including nova can be further modified by an attunement, meaning either destructive, control or mastery. While destructive spells do direct dmg control spells do less dmg but stun, slow, knockback or do other cc stuff. Mastery spells sometimes do cc the enemy but the most important about that attunement is they store dmg on the enemy that can be discharged by critically hitting with a destuctive spell (what basically means charging a targeted or aoe spell because then the always critically hit). So every one of those 7 variations can be changed by 3 attunements. So every sigil has 21 possible kinds of spelltypes. Also there are many kinds of stats that can change the spell like improved charging speed or higher critical dmg.What do I want to say with that? If you are a fan of fine tuning and like numbers and percentages and the possibility to craft your own set of combinations that synergizes well, then this game might be fun for you. Also if you enjoy some kind of repetition (or grinding mechanics) you might like this game.If you hate repetition whatsoever and don't like to tune your stuff to the max this game might be not fun for you. Although there was a simple version of the crafting system implemented with the smart inventory that does everything for you, in the end it only upgrades spells you already have and does not give you other variations. But when it comes to upgrading your spell materials (from common to uncommon to rare to epic to legendary) it is a very helpful feature and saves a lot of time.If you like the mentioned mechanics you should definitely give Lichdom: Battlemage a try. If you are not sure but like the idea just wait for a sale and then slay some undead!			"

												I really wanted to love this game, but it needs a lot of tuning.First off there are almost no enemies, then you finally get to the first boss and its impossibly difficult. The lack of interesting fight mechanics are 'overcome' by increasing the hit points of MOBs. This forces you into a crafting system that is both obtuse and unexplained. This is partially overcome by a 'smart' screen, but even then it never explains what is actually happening and why one choice is better than another.I feel like this could be an amazing game, but it was rushed out instead of going through a good final round of tuning.

												An intense FPSesque combat game with a fantasy setting. Has more similarity to such ancient Doom era (and engine) games Heretic and Hexen, and with the Diablo series than it does with an RPG. Level design is very aesthetically pleasing, but linear with a few explorative branches for loot and or extra challenges. The voice actors are great and plotline is good, but not great and does feel as though it ends abruptly in such a way to lead into a sequel to wrap things up. The combat and spell crafting are what makes the game rather enjoyable and worth experiencing.Great for someone looking for intense magical combat rather than a deeply immersive role-playing experience.  The combat is straightforward with no resource management (no ammo/mana  other than a recharging shield) and relies blocking and teleporting for defense and for offense switching between three Sigils (like elements) each with a single target, a targeted area of effect, and a self radiating nova (from a good block or charged teleport). The basic projectile attack can be crafted with three different shapes, one for the basic shot that has a small amount of auto-aim, one for a lobbed bomb that explodes into smaller bursts for a semi-AoE, and a shorter ranged spraying ray. Similarly the Area power can be crafted into three shapes, a basic AoE, a radiating pool that hits anything that passes into it, and an exploding trap. Each spell is crafted with Augments onto the Shapes that dictate not only bonuses, but also the spell's attunement to either Damage, Control, or Mastery. Damage is self explanatory, and Control is pretty standard hold/paralyze effect, but Mastery is a bit more complex working often as a debuff, but always as a way to build up extra potential critical damage. Hit a target with a control attuned spell to lock it down, then a mastery spell to increase the critical damage, and finally a charged damage spell for 100% critical chance and watch the fireworks. The basic elemental Sigils (Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Kinetic) each influence the shape of the spell in subtle ways to give many options for building together various combos of spells that work well together, and it can be fun (though sometimes a bit daunting) to sort out which of the many permutations work best for you. The more advanced Sigils (Corruption, Delirium, Necromancy, and Phase) start behaving a bit more radically different in how they work. Even your character's shield (this games equivalent for hit points) is craftable with various shapes to help tailor your combat tactics ranging from fewer teleport blinks but more hit points for the tank playstyle to less hit points and unlimited blinks for more active and mobile dodger playstyle.  The crafting loot is one of the places where the game takes after the likes of Diablo, with the loot drops from mobs being these building blocks of Shapes and Augments used to craft spells, with the level of the loot as well as its colored rarity dictating how powerful of a spell you can end up crafting with it. Another is the bad guys can spawn with the occasional affix that grants it some perks like knockdown or faster attacks, radiating damage, or even making fellows invulnerable.			"

												Lichdom Battlemage creates a solid world and gives off a truly immersive experience. Since the pre-release, the game has had many noticeable changes from actual scenes during cutscenes and completely re-hauled assets. The spells feel much more unique and even interactions with the environment can be felt all over. If I had a fire explosive near vegetation, not only would the vegetation react and blow outwards, but it would light on fire temporarily as well. A fireball thrown in water has such a satisfying reaction and everything helps create this world that feels truly alive now. The combat feels solid, though later fights may rely on certain combos rather than having fun playing a certain way, but it's still very satisfying to play through. One thing to note is the game is very graphically intensive, so be sure your rig can handle it if you want 60 fps.			"

Early Access Review
								[EDITED to represent current game state]My inital issues were lack of enemies to fight (only 3 or maybe it was 4 models to kill).  Lack of depth of gameplay.  And a very linear game with no adventure aspect.As I played more of the game I found that there were still only 3 or 4 models but having built games before I know adding new enemies is very easy.The depth of gameplay I am laying on only having played one level.  I feel that the two levels that I have played are functioning very similar to the opening to Skyrim, where the player is slowly walked through a the mechanics of the game.  I will have to wait until more of the game is avaliable to know.  Again the linear aspect I am going to put on the lack of levels to play.  But this again is something very easy to fix once you have the artwork done for the levels.I give the game a 5/10, but it's still pre-alpha and a lot better than other games I've played in the past.

												The fast-paced combat is quite interesting, and getting undead to help makes getting through the throngs of monsters easier.  I still cannot win the last battle no matter how hard I try (I assume its the devil himself? - although the update where I can change from ""Battlemage"" to ""Novice"" may do it), and I am a little confused why all the important evil-doers are seemingly servants to the devil or somesuch.  Getting the spell creation down to a science is not as easy as it looks, and this could be why I cannot win the final battle.  This game gives you a good adrenaline rush, and figuring out why each place gets more and more evil makes this story memorable.			"

												I've only played a few hours of this game and honestly, I'm already bored. the spell 'crafting' seems to be little more than just adding stats and numbers to attacks, not the kind of amazing spell bending that I really expected from a game dedicated to being a wizard. I would understand if this game were something like Skyrim where spells are part of, but not the whole idea, of the game but when all you do is cast the same spells over and over that all really do the same thing it gets a little dry.Apart from the disappointing spells (a pretty big deal for a spell based game) the level design is not great. you are walking between small areas where you will stroll in, a load of enemies appear, you kill them and move on to the next arena.The only upside of this game is that the spells do really feel powerful. Too often do you play games where you hope to be an all-powerful wizarding badass and you end up having no health and with wet spells. In this the spells pack a real punch and you really feel like you are raining fire down on your enemies. (It's just unfortunate that they all blend into one)			"

												When I saw the trailer, I wasn't very impressed, to be honest. The game looked too frenetic to me. If the trailer was the only soruce of information, I would not buy the game. Luckily, it wasn't.Lichdom: Battlemage is a fantasy action game. You are a mage who is not limited with the amount of mana. A powerful mage who can destroy thousand of enemies, yet can't jump nor swim. You do not have a sword either, so casting spells is the only way you can fight enemies.There are 8 sigils in the game, each with three spells- Nova, a spell activated when you defend yourself, Targeted spell, which is a standart one and AOE- Area of Effect spell. Each spell can be atunned to destruction, control and mastery. The effects of these attunements vary from sigil to sigil, but in general it's reccommended to combine them in order to hurt your enemies more.The powers of sigils can be combined, which is the main fun of the game in my opinion. For example, I casted a time bubble on an enemy, which absorbs damage from other spells. Then I casted a spell which sends bugs to the enemy, eating them alive from within. Finally, I used a teleport spell. The enemy was teared apart with it. The bugs then went to other enemies, hurting and teleporting them through the battlefield.You can also craft your own spells from resources you'll find on the way, upgrade the spells and even the resources and craft synergies. Synergies are spells which combines power of two sigils. They can summon powerfull creatures or deal huge damage to enemies.In general, this game is very good. Yes, it can get sometimes a bit repetetive and the levels are basically corridors with few other ways to go. I think the story can't stand on it's own, it serves more like a motivation to go further, killing enemies down the road. But this is a debut of Xavian, and as such is really good. I reccommend this game.			"

												I should start by saying this game isn't terrible.  You can play it for a bit and have fun.  That said...This game really suffers from squandered potential.  The tagline is that you are a wizard and you don't have to deal with mana bars or cooldowns, so now that you have unlimited magic power you can go on a crazy murder spree.In actuality to get to fight the same 5 guys over and over again in a storyline that doesn't make much sense (spoilers below).The story starts with a bad evil dude coming up and messing with your family.  He is a bad evil dude because he likes stabbing people and has a goatee.  You are then visited by a wizard named Roth who raises you from the dead and gives you ""unlimited power"" and the ability to not die ever again.  Having thus removed any dramatic tension from the story, you then go fight a cult and some undead guys who may or may not be fighting each other and it may or may not matter.  Also, all the human antagonists give you long, boring monologues while invincible and then teleport away unless the game arbitrarily decides they're going to stop and fight the guy who is, as a reminder, completely invincible and cannot be killed.Now this would be forgivable if gameplay was actually good, but it gets boring fast.  The game makes a big deal out of its spellcrafting system - but for the most part spells are generally damage, status effect, or weird combo debuff.  Spells are created from randomly dropped items you can mess around with in interesting ways to upgrade them for upgrades that may or may not do anything.  There are some stats on the player screen - destruction, mastery, control - that get affected by these somehow and maybe sorta kinda determine spell effects?  I don't know, the game didn't explain and I couldn't tell you how the formula works.  Some of these drops are rarer but don't seem better.  You can pick 3 of 8 elements and of these three you get a nova (with weird trigger conditions), an aoe, and a single-target missile spell, all of which are upgradable to have different numbers that do...stuff.  It's not a terrible system, it's just repetitive and you never feel you are getting anywhere.  At the beginning of the game you can call down a firestorm.  At the end of the game you can call down a firestorm, but with bigger numbers.  Maybe if you futz around with the numbers you can use a completely separate subsystem and call down a meteor.  Now, many video games have this problem, but for a game about ""Unshackling the mage"", the fact that a wizard in Baldur's Gate can pull off more impressive and interesting feats of magic kinda sucks.Of course, there's a reason you don't get interesting magic like long-range teleportation or invisibility - the game is a linear line where you run through and fight the same 5 guys.  I'm not even talking palette swaps here.  There is a model of a black-clad lady with some kind of acid vial she throws at you.  She has the same 3 lines.  You will hear these same lines at the beginning of the game, the end of the game, and the part of the game where I got bored and quit.  You will meet a teleporting undead guy.  Later in the desert, you will meet the same teleporting undead guy.  He is one of like 3 different skeletons in the game.  Maybe if you are lucky you will meet a wolf.  Maybe you'll even get to the demons in the desert before giving up in boredom.At the end of the day the game had potential, but squandered it on recycling the same old crap with bigger numbers.			"

												Lets get this TL;DR out of the way for those that don't have the time to read my wall of text bellow:GOOD:+ Nice graphics and effects. + OK voice acting. + Smart craft. + Loot rarity system.BAD:- Did not feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage at all, not even once. - Combat is a grind that gets old very quick.- Crafting system is a pain.- NG+ is boring and feels pointless.- Boss fights to easy.- Levels are way to long.- Did I mention combat is a grind fest?RECOMMENDATION:Want to feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage? Go play Dragons Dogma on ps3 or xbox 360.REVIEW:First time I saw the trailer for this game I thought that this will be a nice game where I will feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage plowing through enemies ala Serious Sam. As you can see by the big red thumb down I was disappointed... So very dissappointed.Lets start with the positive. The environments are absolutely beautiful and apart from the levels being way to long each level has it's own unique environment. Nice models for enemies and effects are good. Also the smart craft menu is awesome. The loot rarity system is also niceThere are some really nice ideas in this game, to bad they are so poorly executed.The biggest flaw of the game is the fact that they promised the feeling of being a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage and it's not delivered. Maybe I had some high expectations but if you tell me that this game made you feel like a almighty bad♥♥♥♥♥mage and nothing could stand in your way, then you have not played a lot of games as a mage. I feel more powerful rolling a wizard in Diablo 3 then I did playing Lichdom: Battlemage. The game promised me no cooldowns but instead I have to ""load"" every spell for two seconds for it to have any effect at all on the enemies, I'd rather have the cooldowns.Add to that, the ridiculous amount of overkills you have to achieve to get any sigil to maximum level. The leveling system for the sigils (fire, ice, lightning etc.) doesn't help the feeling of NOT being a bad♥♥♥♥♥with the stupid and utterly pointless rule that you can't level more then three at a time and when you want to change to another sigil, you will reset the level of the sigil you remove. If I'm suppose to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥mage, why can't I keep the level on my sigils? Some say that what you get for leveling a sigil is a very small bonus and not really worth it which only makes the system even more pointless!Now I played this game as I do any game, at the hardest difficulty setting which probably didn't help the feeling of grinding as if this was an Asian MMO. The thing is that, when I completed the game and moved on to NG+ I lowered the difficulty to get away from some of the grind but the amount of HP the enemies had didn't seem to be affected at all, I still felt like every fight was like trying to push down a brick wall by blowing on it.The ridiculous crafting system is also a problem. The actual crafting system isn't that hard to understand, the problem is when you choose materials for the spells. The attribute lists on the materials are often to long and I always felt unsure if the spell I crafted was better or worse then the ones I already have. Especially since the game never really told me what all of the attributes are. Instead I used the smart crafting system. It just tells you that ou can craft a more powerful spel and then you do!As I mentioned before the difficulty scale is a bit off and I often had more problems with normal mobs than with the boss fights. Although the boss fights where cool they where never really hard and it was often more of a challenge getting to the boss fight then getting through it.The story is not the worst I ever saw, it's OK. It's the ""bad-guy-wronged-me-and-I-want-revenge"" type of story.If you're still with me and you want to feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥wizard then go play something else, like Dragon's Dogma. There you have some spells that actually makes you feel almighty.			"

												I picked this game up during the Black Friday Sale in 2014 for $10. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The game is well polished and looked very clean. I found the enviornments and ambience to be fairly well done and enjoyable. The voice acting, characters, and scrolling combat text all reminded me heavily of Bioshock Infinite (might even be the same actors). The loot progression system steals from Wow/Diablo, right now to the color rarety. It can be a little overwhelming, but they have a smart system which will do auto upgrades for you, however, it isn't perfect. For the number cruncher and experimenter, I think you will really enjoy the spell crafting system. There are small guantlet type encounters where they will reward you with 10-20 spell crafting items all at once. This was something to look forward too every level, and I found it kept me engaged. The gameplay itself is fun, and you feel like a badass mage, however the crafting system encourages one spell progression, so it can get a little repetitive constantly spamming the same three or four spells. The boss encounters were somewhat lame and fairly easy with the same dodge and shoot mechanics over and over, but I still liked the game.Overall I would give the game a 7/10 and I think there is a solid foundation here for some really good sequels if they do them right. Definitely worth buying if it is on sale.			"

												Kauft den Mist nicht!ich werde später mehr dazu schreiben.Das ist aktuell nur eine Warnung. Das Spiel ist keine fünf Euro wert.Das Spiel ist grafisch zwar ok, zieht aber die Performance eines I7 mit zwei Grafikkarten im idle runter. Irgendwas stimmt da nicht.Weiterhin ist man ganz und gar an die miserable Story gebunden und hat keine Freiräume für Entdeckungen im Sinne einer Open World Mechanik.Dann kommen da die Zaubersprüche daher zum selber basteln.Das ganze unterliegt einer krassen Einschränkung der Möglichkeiten.Tatsächlich muss man sich auf wenige Zaubersprüche festlegen und immer nach dem selben Schema, single Burst, AoE oder Def. Das macht überhaupt keinen Spaß :/Sorry Leute, macht Euch besser nochmal schlau bevor ihr das wirklich kauft oder zieht erstmal ne Demoversion ;-)			"

												A bit linear but very nice game, fun and bit of challenge. Crafting system is a bit confusing at first and require to read it up a bit to understand things that aren't explained at all ingame ... Ennemies are pretty much the same all the time with their level increased but tbh, i don't care, bosses are interesting.			"

												Looks nice, fun concept at first, but once you find out the ""tons and tons"" of spells just means slightly modified versions of the same thing that half the time aren't any more useful than just pure damage and that theres really not much to the spells, you'll get bored of that pretty quickly. Story is alright, oddly reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite at some points, but overall the game gets pretty repetitive once youve tested out the surprisingly limited spells that are useful.			"

												I just wasted money on this. Honestly. This game's concept SOUNDS amazing. However, it fails at trying to achieve what it promised. Yes, you are a mage. Yes, you can shoot fire. Yes, you can combine spells and such. However, you are killed in onw to two hits. It feels like it takes AGES to get through a basic area. The story is so damn boring I feel like it belongs on the Lifetime network. 4/10.   If you're going to talk this game up so much, at least make some of it true.			"

												Just a little review after 10 hours of playing. Great game, with unique crafting. You have many choice to make yourself to badass killer mage. Had some issues with some areas where you really need to use block, couse there are many open areas. For start its really good combination to use Ice are spells, that freezes enemies long enough to cast a fire area spell to kill them.			"

												To be honest, this game was amazing.From reading the other reviews, what I can figure out is that how you play the game and what magic you use in the game really changes the experience you will have. I have heard someone complaining about kiting the first boss and taking 15 minutes to kill it in one go, yet when I encountered that same boss it took me two minutes (using lightning missiles with an agility shield). This game has a great many playstyle options to choose from, and it may take a little bit trying to figure out which style matches you. But once you find that style... my god. This game will make you feel like a god.For me, my chosen theme was high-damage lightning bolts with an agility shield, allowing me to quickly dodge about the battlefield. A particularly awesome moment for me was during the third boss fight (no spoilers), where the deafening cracking sounds and the blinding flashes of white light literally disintergrated groups of enemies into satisfying puffs of black smote were so awe-inspiring, because I knew that it was me that was causing such chaotic destruction.The story too was awesome. The developers put quite a lot of personality into the two main characters and, indeed, many of the villians you will encounter. I also appreciate the uniqueness of the whole situation. Instead of the usual cliché that a medieval fantasy would spin, this game seems to add a whole dose of reality to the world that your characters live in. The world seems very tactile, very real, despite being a set of linear pathways. Plus, the environments are absolutely stunning to look at.As to the things I didn't like about this game? Well...- Sometimes the dialog would bug out and mute, and characters would bug out, if I reached a destination too fast.- I had an awesome legendary spell component, and I decided to upgrade it once more to make it even more powerful, and the random number generator spat out an item that I couldn't actually use, thus destroying the awesomeness that was. (This only happened once, but it was still annoying)- While fighting 20 enemies at once can get pretty hectic, especially if you have archers, wizards and giant demon monsters who can all kill you rather fast... Fighting even more enemies would be even more awesome :D9.5/10 - Will play through again. Willing to pay for a sequel.(-0.5 for my negatives at the end there)			"

												really straight mage first person shooter p0rn... no jumping, no crouching, no cover, dodge like a maniac (awesome dodge !!!) and unleash hell, you are a damn dps glasscannon... it's not about story (revenge), level up (a little bit, yeah, 1% more dmg at fire spells, hurray!), exploring (uhh a corner, whats there ? haha nothing...) or anything else what you maybe think it should be. just fighting and experimental crafting of spells to bring more pain. simple but really gooood. if you like games like the last rott (speed p0rn) or sw (katana p0rn), with the touch of an action rpg like diablo (collectors p0rn), this is your next game and tough enough to keep you raged and entertained...

												Even though I hit 'yes' for my ultimate review, I really only do that because it's a unique game that I want to see more of from game developers... But, it still has it's flaws that make this less than ideal. There's some top quality voice acting, I was surprised to hear the voices that I did, and they all do pretty well with their lines. The setting is also pretty awesome and well-detailed, with a lot of love put into the different levels you come across, the fine details and whatnot. It's also cool to see some programmers embracing a concept that doesn't really seem to shine through, the badass mage that is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Kind of like a cross between Gandalf and Bruce Lee, something you don't understand until it's lit you on fire WITH THEIR MIND. However, there's a lot that gets in the way and really makes this game more of a trudge for me. The first part is that the game mechanics are really clunky, enough that it's more of a fight to keep control of your character than it is working your tactics against enemies. The combat is on a fast-pace first-person shooter level, but the spells don't really back that up. Frequently I'm working to dodge or backpedal in order to keep the foe at a distance while I'm charging a spell that's worth a damn, or I'm trying to set up an area of attack spell but it triggers too late for it to really do anything. I've tried tinkering with the crafting system to see what I can get from it, thinking that it might be that I'm just using the wrong tools for the job... but nothing seems to really matter. There's such a huge variety of different components, each with subtle differences, that it just blurs together. I really found myself thinking that a system borrowed from Borderlands would be much better, where you can choose between various elements, and you get different abilities as you level up. In all, I could tell the power was there, I just had to really DIG to get to it.The setting itself also could use help, there is the beginnings of a good story, but it feels like you're just a ghost moving through it all. Story elements are told through a sort of flashback ability, but you really only interact with one or two characters at a time, and they're forgettable enough that I honestly can't remember names of anyone. There's mention of a conflict raging in the world already, but you never seem to take part in it directly. The graphics also show you things that get me to investigate, and I'm definitely intreagued, but it is just for show... You can look with your eyes, but that's about it, and eventually you find yourself not even bothering to explore the world at all. In all, I really want to keep going with the game, there's the amazing potential there to make a really high-caliber game that could really bring some innovation to the FPS and Fantasy genre... but there's either too much complexity that it becomes difficult to grasp, or it's so bland that there's no point to it at all.If you're a developer, seriously, this can really be a new type of FPS that could help bring life to the genre... just polish this stuff out more. If you're a gamer, pick it up if you've got funds you don't care what you burn on, or if it's on sale...			"

												----WARNING, WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!----    I expected more. I expected to be a badass mage, flinging cool (and sometimes silly) custom spells around. There are 3 variants of spell modifier for 2 of the 3 spell types, with 8 'Sigils' (magic types), and Destrution, Control, and Mastery effects for each. Sounds good, right? It's not, and that is because Destruction, Control, and Mastery have no effect on the apperance of your spells, Destruction = Damage, Control = Influencing enemies(dmg over time, stuns, etc.), and Mastery = Enemies take increased damage.    The spell modifiers only change how the effect is delivered ( a continous stream, a grenade like effect, homing missles, etc.) Each Sigil type is nice, excluding the over-done and over-used types of Fire and Ice. You have a Aoe spell (think traps), your thrown spells, and Novas (what happens when you use a charged blink). Basically the spells aren't anywere near as customizable as they should be. Also you can only use 1 Sigil type per both hands, no dual-wielding differnt spell types.    Shield's are stupid, there are 3 types of shields. 1-Agile, quick blinks and charged blinks, low damage block, low shield. 2-Tactical, charged blinks, medium damage block, medium shield. 3-Strategic,3 quick blinks (has recharge), high damage block, high shield. My problem with them is that I can't use any of them. Agile is fast enough, but lacts the shield I need, while strategic has enough shield but isn't fast enough. Tactical is just stupid, mainly because I can't dodge last second.   The enemies are annoying, and make things like boss fights ridiculously tedious. Most of my deaths in this game have involved trying to take shortcuts through levels (which are all very linear btw) or being stunlocked by ranged enemies till the boss finally connects with a hit (usually a insta/near insta-kill even on lower difficulties).   I've only been to about 4 locations in the game if you include the tutorial. I could not find a single shortcut through these levels, considering there is no jump button, and 4 ft falls kill you. These levels (excluding the tutorial) are overly long, and very tedious.  If you want a nice to look at game with good magic effects, here it is. I'd rather much prefer something that actually gave me insanely customizable spells, with fun game mechanics.			"

Needed spells that cast fast but do low damage? (not rays) or a panic spell that casts fast but has a recharge.-*shields UI a bit confusing-*no jumping (not really helpfull but it feels wierd without it)-no indication of health on enemies (Huge problem in my opinion)-mixing different elements could have pushed the crafting to an even more amazing level (would have been diffcult to program though)-*holding f to interact with things instead of pressing it drives me nuts-Biggest con here: LINEAR GAMEPLAYIn conclution, the Linear gameplay is what makes this game ""almost"" not worth the $40. Because of the lack of re-playability, this game is a one and done. Of course other games like Bioshock Infinite had that, but there's a reason I waited till it was on sale to play it. So If you see this game on sale for maybe <$30, deffinately get it. It will suck you in for a good amount of time, but after your finished it goes stright to the recycling bin. Open world would have made this game one of the best games of the year for me, but linear-ness breaks games. And I understand that it's hard to develop open world games, but ""I CAN DREAM HARROLD!"". Still a STRONG recommend ;) maybe I wouldnt mind a second one. "

												Lichdom: Battlemage offers a prospect that many other games don't offer: ""What if magic was as easy as normal fighting? No cooldowns, and the limit to your power is how strong of spells you can form"". The problem with this is that, while that premise of the game is delivered upon, most of the rest of the game just isn't anything beyond pretty at best. Honestly, that's about the nicest thing I can say about this game, because it's in Cryengine, it's rather pretty. However, all of that is lost when you have as many other things that are just NOT very good.The largest gripes I have with the game are:- Enemy variety is basically non-existent        There are MAYBE 9 varieties of enemy, and about half of those don't show up till around 1/2 through the game- There are only really 24 spells       You can craft many different spells with different stats, but there are only 24 different effects, and many of those overlap.- Difficulty is very poorly balanced        I literally ACCIDENTALLY killed the 4th boss (there are 5 total) in one shot, without any sort of crit beyond charging my spell. On the flip side, some normal mini-bosses will one-shot you and take multiple apocalypticals (double-crits) to kill.- About as linear as you could possibly imagine        This game offers basically no choice, all the game play takes place in what is effectively hallways. To give an idea, it's about as linear as Bulletstorm or Gears of War 1- The game is about 2X as long as is necessary        I've played it for around 32 hours, and about 14 hours of it felt boring/repetitive/pointlessThat being said, the game is definitely worth around the first 10 hours or so, as experimenting around with synergies and sigils can be quite fun. It just gets boring, as I quickly realized that most of the spells do effectively the same things with different particle effects. Some do actually do completely different things (i.e. Phase & Necromancy), but in the end, it is most effective to just grab a big DPS sigil, like Fire, an then some means to stop enemies in their tracks, and then blast them with mastery (which is a gameplay element that allows for amplified damage) until you are ready to blow them to kingdom come.I can't recommend the game at full price. However, if the game is on sale for ~$10 or less, feel free to buy it, as it is worth that in my opinion.			"

Lichdom: Battlemage.It's part RPG that has a story that really starts to ramp up and get exciting towards the end. But really, this game is more about blinking around, timing blocks perfectly, and chaining powerful spell combos together than it is about story or interacting with townsfolk or anything, as there's essentially no friendly-npc interactions that you can perform. It's more Hexen or Dark Souls than Icewind Dale or Skyrim.The visuals were good in this game. Taking the time to look around you the world looks nice, there's very little that makes you wonder 'why would they put that there' or 'that object is clipping' or 'wow, repeating textures!' Just for comparison, I think this game had fewer art assets than Wolfenstein: The New Order, but actually used them better. There were a few places (giant frozen whirlpool, for example) where I was really impressed, it was fun to traverse some of these unique areas and landscapes fighting powerful creatures. The backdrops you fought in really provided a lot to the feel and mood for the game in a positive way.The audio was adequate. The spell sounds were fun and of a decent quality. Meanwhile certain things that you would think would have a sound, like a swarm of bats blasting thru a tunnel into your face, do not have any sound yet. And eventually you'll encounter these female cultists.. I swear they say like 3 things -- constantly. The music added to the drama and tension, but didn't blow me away.The gameplay was fluid and was pretty bug free. Overall when it comes to controlling your character, looking around and casting spells it's very intuitive and easy. There's some weird behavior with blinking on ledges or while falling, but I never got stuck on objects or anything that cause me to need to restart the game, and that's happened to me in many high budget, otherwise good quality, games recently. I consider this one of the games strongest points.The user interface needs work. There's quite a bit going on when it comes to crafting and spell types and how spells act with different stats and it's not all clear how to use the UI or what everything does. The way spells interact is slightly complex, not overly so, but enough where it's not immediatly intuitive how it all works. They've improved the UI as time has gone by. While it's much better than it used to be, the current UI could still very easily be a negative experience for players who are easily frustrated with this sort of thing.If you decide to play it; The game will start easy enough, monsters go down in a hit or two, you don't take a ton of damage from anything yet, and monsters are spread out in few numbers with limited range capabilities. Then once you know the controls and start a to level a bit it starts to ramp up. Unless you're keeping a keen eye out for how to maximize your shields with the loot you're getting (I sure didn't) you'll get to a point where you must search your inventory for a way to improve your character, because the monsters have scaled while you have not. It was pretty fun to see how long I could push without doing any upgrades, and then doing massive upgrades once I could not proceed. This happens not too often where you feel you need to constantly spend time crafting stuff, but just enough to get you to try something slightly different every once in a while.This game has a fun challenge aspect to it, and I think that's where this game shines. This game does the best when it's consistently threatening to beat you if you make a mistake, so players who enjoy challenges and overcoming them I think are the people who should really be giving this one a look. Are you finding it too easy? Up the difficulty level, or experiment with one of your weaker sigils. There are resurrection points right before many of the hardest challenges. This makes facing challenges and trying new strategies easy and fun even when you lose -- most of the time. Occasionally they'll have the resurrection point a couple encounters back from the big challenge. It's sort of a kick in the teeth when that happens. It's not very exciting to have to fight mundane monsters to try and get another chance at the boss you just lost to.Took me about 10 hours to get thru the normal campaign on battlemage mode. That being said, I still don't have most of the spells, and I've only used half of the sigils really. I'm still really excited to keep going on with some of the new game plus content.One way were this game could improve is allow the player to play back thru the camplaign in new game plus with gryphon and all the little cutseen memories still in it. Currently the only way to make that happen is to start a new game, as far as I know. It was fun and I'd like to do it again with all the features of the first play thru, but I still want to continue developing the sigils and abilities on my first character. That being said, this is probably a less pressing issue than the UI.TL;DRThe story starts out okay, then gets more interesting as things get tense toward the end of the story. I would mostly recommend this game for gamers who like a challenge, and enjoy exploring the limits of what you can and can not do when you're given a challenge, and then a large set of tools to complete that challenge different ways depending on how you want to play (keep in mind all of the different ways do involve you destroying your enemies in a badass way.)I'd give it a 7/10. Fix the UI and find a way to explain the spell interactions like mastery in a more clear way and I think I could bump it to an 7.5.			"

												I don't know which game Paste Magazine found to be ""New Gold Standard"" for combat, but it wasn't this one.Its an interesting change that i've not seen done before, but on the whole I felt that it just didn't work, and the most efficient way to dispatch the (ludicrously tanky) enemies was to spam the basic boring attack - that is unless I missed some dramatic meta combo that would have made the game a breeze, but that seems unlikely.The game does look fairly nice, but that can be a two-edged sword at times as the pretty effects clutter up the screen and make it hard to see exactly what is going on.Overall though the biggest crime was thatthe game was such a chore to play. Grinding out random loot (that scales worse than the opponents hp) from the enemies significant health pools was pretty much a necesity to get half-decent spells. And takes forever.			"

												7.5/10 Because...Phase Rift + Ice Pools + Corruption Hive = HMOG!  O_O'The short of it:This game is well worth the purchase when it's on sale for 50-75% off (or better). The spell combinations (and their resulting effects) and crafting system are great once you get the hang of it. The FPS-esque style a lot of fun for a while despite some quirks and annoying features. !!! Highly recommended before or after purchase:Watch a few gameplay videos. Read up on spell mechanics, what each attunement does, combined effects, and how to optimize your build for control, defense, and damage.PROS+ nice variety of spell patterns and combinations+ unique spell 'crafting' system (once you get the hang of what each component does)+ satisfying when in the mood for destruction (pun coincidental)+ great visual effects in combat with certain spell combinations+ nice graphics in general and some fascinating environmentsCONS- sorely inadequate intro to spells and crafting- very repetitive enemies and same style of combat throughout- linear gameplay, story, and level design- lots of farming required to get decent spell patterns- irritating save points and stage restart-on-death- ""Smart"" inventory system is anything but- terrible voice acting			"

												I've only played a few hours of this game and honestly, I'm already bored. the spell 'crafting' seems to be little more than just adding stats and numbers to attacks, not the kind of amazing spell bending that I really expected from a game dedicated to being a wizard. I would understand if this game were something like Skyrim where spells are part of, but not the whole idea, of the game but when all you do is cast the same spells over and over that all really do the same thing it gets a little dry.Apart from the disappointing spells (a pretty big deal for a spell based game) the level design is not great. you are walking between small areas where you will stroll in, a load of enemies appear, you kill them and move on to the next arena.The only upside of this game is that the spells do really feel powerful. Too often do you play games where you hope to be an all-powerful wizarding badass and you end up having no health and with wet spells. In this the spells pack a real punch and you really feel like you are raining fire down on your enemies. (It's just unfortunate that they all blend into one)			"

My personal experience so far:10 hours in and I've only just reached the 4th area (there are 4 more after this). The encounters become more difficult, enemies become tougher (not necessarily smarter, although they do seem to understand cover mechanics, or more diverse, just more health/damage/extra abilities).The crafting system is engaging and combined with the tougher encounters, demons and bosses I face, the game really keeps me coming back. I just keep wanting to move to the next 'checkpoint' and gather a few more crafting materials for that one upgrade.The graphics really don't disappoint, the different areas are diverse and detailed, and this adds to the fun.The good:- Visuals are great! Not just the spell effects, but the scenery as well.- Gameplay is engaging; the crafting of spells and your loadout seriously alter how you play your mage.- The game runs really smooth (R9 290 ran this at 60FPS on maximum settings, but more on this below).- The story isn't half bad either- There is an interesting loot system (the further you get without dying, the better the drop rate).- There is NG+ for those who can't get enough.- Great tutorials - after the tutorial part of the game, these can be revisited from the menu.- The voice acting is great, and quite funny :PThe bad or actually, mediocre.- I have a bit of an issue with falling through a crack/hole in the floor while blinking around, which causes insta-death.- RNG ... I hate RNG when it comes to loot. It really isn't too bad here, lots of loot, but still...- It can get a bit repetitive once you've found your favorite spell combinations.About the craftingSo, we have 8 different types: fire, ice, kinesis, lightning, corruption, necromancy, delirium and phase.There are 3 different types of casting: AoE, targeted, and 'nova'.I think there are 3 variants to each of the types, for example: targeted has a trap, lob and missile, AoE has a pool, trap and rain. I don't really know about the nova though...And each cast type can be altered in 3 ways: mastery, control and destruction.Considering all these options, if we do a little math, we get a total of:8 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 216 different spells + a bunch of 'unique' spells, that combine 2 types and cause a unique effect, like a fire+ice tornado.Of these roughly 230/235 different spells, you can equip only 9 at a time...Next to that there's also a very important gameplay component, your shield. This one too can be crafted. You have 3 different shield types, each with it's own strength and weakness. This one will mostly guide your gameplay, whereas the others will be build around how you want to play. A certain type of shield is best for keeping distance, while another type is more build around getting up close and personal.About the graphics:So, I was running this game at a very stable 60FPS on highest settings on my FX-8150 (OC'd to 4GHz), R9 290 (Asus OC edition) and 8GB DD3. I did not experience a single frame drop, except during certain in-game cutscenes. These dropped the framerate to 50. As soon as they were over, even during fights, the game would hold up a perfect 60FPS.A second however: my midi-tower heats up a lot. The game is optimized for AMD, and I had this before with running Sniper Elite 3 on max settings as well. The GPU runs it perfectly stable, but very hot. After about an hour, the GPU would be about 80 degrees Celsius, after 2 hours it was 84 degrees, which made me decide to lower the settings a nodge, to preset High. This did not really impact visuals (I didn't notice any change, really), but it allowed my GPU to relax a little for some reason and the temperature started dropping immediately. Now, I haven't thoroughly tested this yet, because I entered a new area shortly after changing the settings, but in the new area, the temperature stabilized at 69 degrees. That's a 15 degrees drop, but considering it's in a new area, I can't say what exactly caused this...Recommendation?Considering all of the above, I would say this game is definitely worth 15-20 bucks. For a single playthrough, I'm expecting the average player to take between 15 and 20 hours.If you're sure you'd like to try all spells and have fun with NG+ and the extra challenge modes, the game is good for at least 25 to 35 hours of fun - I'm estimating.About my opinion:Be sure to check out my profile and see what kind of games I like, in order to be able to interprete my review better. This game is probably not for everyone.			"

												Got this game during its early development and continued to revisit periodically.  I have a craving for a game with true freedom of spell creation and with a ""total badass"" mage.  Something that's challenging, but you can move through a horde and leave bodies strewn across the battlefield.  That's not this game.The spell crafting system is essentially a weapon crafting system.  Here's the base spell, increase its special effect or damage.  Combining spells?  Nono, your mage isn't smart enough for that.  You can't even equip two different elements for each type of attack, such as ice on main and fire on aoe.  As for gameplay, it sucks.  Yes, it is graphically beautiful and clearly alot of effort went in to every detail, but not so much on variety.  Once you're in a level, which can span an hour or two easily, everything looks the same.  Each cave you passed looks just like the one before.  That ice mountain before you, exactly the same as the last three.  Enemies are all the same as well.  There's skeletons, humans, ghost thingies, etc, but they're all really the same.  The only real strategy for this badass of a mage is to kite and shoot.  Shoot what?  That's up to you.  Ice and you'll live longer, fire they'll die faster.  Add in some necro and things will get distracted, but the pets don't really do much damage.  Fire/Necro's my perferred path, and I'm not sure my undead ever actually killed anything.When I bought it, I paid $20, and it's probably worth that much.  With the new price tag at 40, wait for a sale.			"

												I really tried to enjoy this game, but I can barely bring myself to play it or even justify owning it, though I got it for 70% off. The spells feel weak, the customization is lackluster, and all the enemies feel the same. The one thing I did like about this game was the difficulty level, but even that was spoiled. Some of the enemies are pretty difficult and the low damage of spells combined with spread out save points make some fights completely infuriating.			"

												This the worst game i have ever spent money on. The game description boasts that the mage is better than everyone else but you are incredibly under powered for most of the game. The game allows you to craft new spells thousands of them but give no description of the terminology of spells and a lot of the spells don't even do damage. Really I've been spamming fireballs at skeletons without doing any damage, not even burning. The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics look good.			"

												Good concept, but game. Starts out pretty fun, but a few hours in you are using the same spells over and over and over with no variety. I was fine with the tedium unless I hit a monster that was immune to all three of my spells. My only option was to die and start back over and grab some different magic... of course I don't even know which he isn't immune to. Then you have the monsters that can randomly kill you instantly in one shot. The game balancing is pretty terrible and just makes the game unfun. Overall, I just can't recommend it. I always beat the games I buy... but this one, I am just not going to bother.			"

												Lichdom is a pretty boring game, that makes you feel like you're throwing ice cubes and flaming potatoes at enemies with axes. It boasts very damage-spongey enemies and it doesn't feel at all like you're the powerful mage you're made out to be. You have slightly creative control over what kind of spells you can create: you can pick three ""elements"" to equip, which essentially function as your guns in any other FPS. Each ""gun"" has a normal fire mode - which can be set to a ray, cluster-grenade or bolt, an alt fire mode - which is an AOE grenade, trip-mine or lasting effect like a gas grenade, and a shield - which when timed correctly causes splash damage in front of you. It's a neat idea, and quickly switching between the three elements you chose can help stack damage or cause interesting effects. Unfortunately, even the weakest enemies really soak up tons of damage and you mostly find yourself repeating the same cycle of attacks over and over, once you've found a few spells that feel the least flimsy.You walk a linear route and every 50 meters you enter another arena where you instantly become locked-in with force fields and enemies spawn out of thin air until the arena is considered completed. There's no way to tell how much damage you've done, which enemy is almost dead, or how many enemies you have left until that little section is complete. Then the force fields disappear and you can continue walking down the linear path for 50 meters until the next set of force fields pop up and enemies start spawing in front of your face again. Out of boredom I eventually snapped up a trainer, and even with unlimited health, quickly leveling spells and instantly powered-up charges (hold the mouse button down for a second and your spell becomes ""more powerful""), you STILL feel weak and even the weakest enemies take 5 to ten spells to die. A properly crafted fireball with all your best ""epic"" runes won't even make a little wobbly skelleton flinch. I'd really rather take a pistol and pop a hole in it's skull than muck around with flamboyant attempts to trap, freeze and then roast every reanimated skelleton that teleports in front of me every few seconds. There's some very lazy game design going on here and I'd steer clear of it. Lichdom is a pretty but poor execution of a good idea.If you DO enjoy this game, even remotely, you'll probably have a lot more fun in God Mode. It's similar in that it has arenas to progress through, but it doesn't pretend to have a boring story and it doesn't dress up regular gun-play as something it's not. God Mode is focused on arena combat with guns, where aiming for a head-shot actually makes a difference. And the most fun thing about it? You can play it with friends. Lichdom's only claim to fame is the focus on magic, but if you play it for a few minutes, you'll poke right through that and realize you feel more like a guy weilding very unhandy, weak, flaming-potato slingshots than a wizard.

												TLDR: If you usually like to understand games and if you have even the patience that you usually need on PURE RPG games well you will love the ""almost"" infinite crafting possibilities you will find in this game, and this game will be so easy to play that you will ask yourself ""Am I really playing at the hardest difficulty?"". If you don't have those two qualities don't buy this game; you will totally miss the fun and this game will become IMPOSSIBLE to play and you will ask yourself ""Why I'm not able to wounding my enemies?""LV:I was just looking for my girlfriend (if you choose the male)/my sister (if you choose the woman) and I've discovered that I am one of the most powerful mages in the whole planet so I said to myself: ""let's go out there and save the entire world"".Let's be clear: this game is the typical LOVE it or HATE it. What the developers tried to do here is something of unique barely seen in other games but this created a huge mess for the typical ""I want to launch my game and just have fun"" players.First of all crafting is not that clear, you have to read you have to mess a bit with it, you have to try, you have to destroy and craft again and so on. Because if a spell is at Tier 9 it doesn't mean it could do more damage than a spell at Tier 7 due to perks and bonuses. You have to be careful about what to do and again you have to READ what you are crafting.And even the most useless (at the first sight) spell could be DEVASTATING USEFULL. For example my shield is not that strong (only almost 3000hp per pip still at tier 9 tho) but it gives me the bonus of unlimited blink. This is a huge advantage if you usually move a lot to avoid people shooting at you. My delirium spell (at the first it seems useless but I had to take a step backward about it) gives me a bonus of a x2-x11 crit multiplier that means after launching that if I shoot at the target I can instantly kill it (even bosses with 3-5 shoots!). And so on.About this you can use the smart inventory that will automatically update your spells. But remember sometimes smart inventory could give you great ideas, sometime doing things by yourself is BETTER.So yes it is a game that you have to understand and that you have to adapt to your gameplay style because IT DOESN'T adapt to you.So again is not for everyone.Second, the graphic is indeed amazing (well...CryEngine 3 you know...) the sounds are good and even the music it is. The scenarios will leave you with your mouth open. If you have a middle range nVidia card BEWARE because this game was made with AMD support so you could have some trouble and it doesn't depends from your GPU but from the software itself so you may have to tweak it a bit (no problem with my 970 anyway)Third, the story leaves you a bit unsatisfied; yes it engages you at a certain point but it leaves a lot of doors open in the end (probably the developers were thinking about a Lichdom 2 who knows and personally I hope for it). At the end of the game starts the ""New gameb"" mode. You will be able to teleport yourself in every area of the game, plus there will be new portals to explore (and to let you maximize your spells by unlocking tier 10 and above)The gameplay in general is quite linear, go ahead, devastate everything you see, go ahead, find some loot machines to clear,  fight the boss start the next level. Simple and linear, no puzzle and not a lot of exploration.What I think about it?This game has got a lot of potential, but is not for the taste of everyone. As we all well know pretty graphics don't make a game good, gameplay and story does.So again, if you like to craft and experiment a lot go ahead buy this game; or if you are willing to try it because you are curious buy it when it is on sales.If you want a game with a deep intense story and without a 100% guaranteed headache due to crafting DON'T buy this game.OverallGraphic 9/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 7/10Longevity 7/10Controls 7/10			"

												A lost title that tried a grab at a fps spellcaster. Unique in its platform a medium style story that takes the player through many beautiful landscapes. I'll be honest the story really dident grab me and the functions of the game can be seen as overly diffucult or complicated. To make it worse they tried to use a diablo 2 style item drop/spawn system mixed with a stair based crafting system that cost the game its chance to enter legand status.But if you can get into the game you will find somthing many players struggle to explain. How it just clicks with ya and what seems like 2 minutes of play turn out to be 3 hours gone (poof) hehe As a spellcaster the possibilitys of the game offer great replayability. Along with game + modes to let you return to the land as a champion and adjust the challenge you face to need.All in all this title is worth asking as long as you understand this is not a hack and slash but a think and cast.

												It is incredibly boring.  While some of the spell crafting can be cool, the game lacks in combat entertainment.  Such as the demon boss in the lodge.  Dodge, hit with spell, hit with spell, dodge, run, hit with spell, hit with spell until down 25%.  Then you have adds to fight, dodge, kill, dodge kill, then back to demon.  Dodge, dodge, spell, spell...until the next 25% until more adds.  This is your combat.  Also, this demon has what seems like 2 billion hitpoints.  Not very entertaining.  I was half way through and decided 'f this' and hit Alt-F4.  Now going to uninstall.  Complete waste of time.			"

												Im not sure how to rate this game...Lets start with that I LOVE the concept, but they did a poor job portraing it.I like the power abilities and the no mana pool or recharge, but often found myself wishing I had a melee weapon.The story is strong and provoking if a little cliche, but is often forgotten and pushed aside.It says full contoller support, but that is an out right lie.Price. Just too high with too few sales.With all that said, if you have a lot of patience and prefer to use the keyboard and mouse rather than a controller I would recomend this game. If you are not said person above, dont waste the money like I did.UPDATE:After playing some more of this game I realized that somehow I over looked the horrible user controls and the mind boggeling inababilty to figure out how to chage spell types. I dont mean changing ice to fire, I mean ice ray to ice bolt or fire bolt to fire ray; it never really explains how to do that and completely missuses the surplus of hotkeys the keyboard has, also it has redundent controller use as well. Ex: the D-pad swaps spells (fire, ice, telekineses), but so does the A, B, and Y buttons (I only have xbox controllers) which is a complete waste of space. I highly DO NOT recomend this game for ANY type of player... well unless your rich, dont care, or extremely talented and determined to find ways around its cornea bleeding controlls, then best of luck you crazy gamer			"

												I like the concept but I can't really recommend this game - or at least not at full price. It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.The story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved <InsertRelativeNameHere>. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.Level design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.The combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're ""doing it wrong"" - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.Generally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying ""mastery"" (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.Compounding this is that there is a lot of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random ""affixes"", similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.The other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.Overall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did.			"

												Fun concept, dull battles. The game has a good story but every battle turns devolves into wiping out wave after wave of monsters. After the first wave the rest of them teleport out of no where, often times behind the player. The spell crafting system leaves little room for fun.			"

												concept of the game is nice. i would enjoy a more complicated crafting system, where you can more finetune the properties of a spell.now the BUT:the game feels slow, just extremely slow. and the biggest reason is the warmup of spells. i would rather have a cooldown than a warmup. even normal spells need a warmup animation which just kills the action feeling. im sometimes feeling a bit lost because of the delay between clicking and actually sending the spell. also the AOE could be done better with a cooldown instead of a warmup. when i need the AOE i need it now, not in 5 seconds. it takes the fun out of the game. i wanna wreak havok and not wait for the spell to be ready. maybe a bar that has to be filled by casting normal spells could be used additionally. you either fill the bar with spells or you have to use the warmup thingy to completely fill it. just adds the action back into the game. im still recommending it, because if you need a game where you can just play for half an hour without any greater story or mechanism you have to remember, this is your game.could be much more fun though if it were a bit like serious sam			"

												The game is better as of 2016 then when the majority of these reviews were posted. I've been enjoying myself thus far. However, it is NOT worth 40$ in terms of pure enjoyment. It is long and has lots of (albiet repetative) content. Yet it falls a bit short of what it promises overall mainly in regards to the different types of spells you can craft. Aside from changing attack values and debuff values, there are essentially basic projectile spells, lob projectile spells, rays, traps, AOE, damage over time spells, shield spells, and very basic necromancy. While you can combine any of these, it still only leaves you with so much. Still, it is a fun game with enough in it to stay engaging for a while. I recommend it to play; but not to buy at $40.			"

												The game is a hack n' slash with mages... HELL YEAH!First of all I want to inform you that I did not read about the game before the releash so I have no idea about the hype if any, or the expectations. I really enjoied the game play! the controls are easy, the story is nothing fancy but ok. I enjoied blowing stuff up and the combos of spells. I 've read some comments that say, you basically spam left click and win, however in the hardest difficulty I personally did not find that ideal and preffered to do combos to deal extra damage and enjoy more gameplay mechanics.The only negative comment I can think of is that the system where you create spells is basically useless. Thankfully there is an automatic upgrade to your spells. I tried creating my own variations but it needs a hell of a lot time to do so and the result is not that big of a deal. Anyway, I recommend the game from $ 15 or less and if you like sorceries and hack n' slash!Also I recommend reading the negative comments on any game before buying because you might find something that is a deal breaker for you.

												Was enthusiastic about the idea, but they just don't deliver. The mage doesn't feel like a badass - you're even weaker than usual (shield only regenerates partially) and the spells are neither spectacular, nor really powerful. You have unlimited ""mana"", but that doesn't feel really powerful when you have casting time and damage limiting you.5 fireballs to kill a skeleton, and two shots from an archer to kill you? The game claims that you don't have to ""run away anymore"".. sorry to break it to you but it's just PR.On the plus side, the game looks great..			"

												The crafting system in Lichdom is very similar to how Path of Exile handles abilites. All abilities are modifiable, and you can change the default fireball you get in the beginning of the game into a lob, a beam, a debuff, an accellerant, all kinds of things, and that goes for every single ability you get in every tree. The defensive options are awesome as well, you can go as a tank mage who relies on his health reserves, or you can go as a super agile mage that relies entirely on blink/dodge. You can also customize that as well, because the game treats your defence as an ability. I'm only 5 hours in, but I'm starting to understand the crafting system. I'd advise watching a quick guide or reading up on the wiki for 5 or 10 minutes to get an idea of how things work, but this game is definitely worth it if it's on sale. Still not sure  if I would pay full price, as I'm not sure how much time I'm going to sink into this game. Anyway, the reviews on this game are harsh, and I've been having a lot of fun with it.			"

However, there are simply too many other problems - the level design is unforgivably boring, the enemy design is generic, the bosses are incredibly grindy, the story is unengaging, the interface is convoluted as hell. It secretly doesn't especially matter what spells you're using, because all you ever do in this game is kite enemies. I tried my best to like this, it just ain't happening.			"

												8.5/10I like the game, it's pretty, it has a well thought out lore and the voice actors of the main characters fit really well into the story.My problem with it then comes from the fact that you're running in a straight line shooting magic rays and fireballs at the same 3 enemys over and over and over. Honestly, I think I may have died maybe a total of 20 times and most of that was because I was looking at how detailed the backgrounds were and not watching where I was stepping. There are also some long periods of time where the FPS action fades out (and the music with it) so you're just following a straight trail until you hit the next fight, and if you do manage to find a side trail and explore it, most of the time it just throws more enemies at you.

												I tried so hard to like this game.  I always gravitate towards mages whenever a game allows, but there are just so many flaws that love of  magic isn't enough.  If you love hard games, magic, boring stories, AND grinding, pick the game up when it's on sale for no more than 20 dollars.  Now that that's out of the way, let's begin.The voice acting is good, but they didn't really try with the story, or the ending.  The graphics are pretty, depending on how you feel about rather obnoxious film grain.  Spells look pretty spectacular, they got this part right.  There are 8 Sigils in the game (think magic schools), 3 of which can be equipped at one time.  Killing enemies is how you'll get most of your spell components.  The crafting system is undeservedly complex.  The game claims to have thousands of spells, which is nonsense.  Nova spells comprise your shield effects, and have no variation.  Shields themselves come in three varieties.  AOE spells come in two varieties.  The third slot can be a missile (like a fireball), a lob (like a grenade), or a ray-type spell.  And that's it.  Components are found, combined, upgraded, reforged, broken down, and possess a wide array of randomized stats, but there is no ignoring how basic the magic system is in the game, which is shrouded in poor explanations (if any).  The inventory system is terrible, designed to artifically inflate the amount of time spent sifting through your components through horrible organization.  Farming exists through fast-travel to previous areas, but voice-overs will play again and again as though you had never been there before.Synergy spells are special spells you can create for when you have two specific sigils equipped.  As you kill either of the enemies with either sigil you a bar fills and you can cast a special spell.  The most synergies you can have equipped at one time is 3.  Some of these are pretty cool, but the learning curve of figuring out exactly how to make the spell in the first place was unnecessarily obtuse.  The entire game is a monster-corridor.  Environments are just as beautiful as the magic, but the game is almost on rails.  In a game where there are powerful spells but no such thing as a mana bar, they had to compensate by throwing in ever-increasing numbers of cheap enemies.  It's gripping, and fast-paced, but the entire game feels exactly the same.   It's not quite as hard as Dark Souls, but the game lets you know when you need to upgrade your spells or try a new combination of sigils by using your eye-sockets for pleasure.  The problem is it will do so completely without warning through sudden random spikes of difficulty, which will probably break the pacing of an already mundane story by making you go farm.  The only incantations the game makes you utter are long streams of cursing and the mumblings of boredom.			"

Lichdom: DisappointmentmageIt took me a while to work out whether or not I recommend this game, that says a lot in and of itself I think. In the end I have to go with a 'Yes' although be aware it's a very qualified 'Yes'. Basically, pick it up on sale, but don't expect too much.+ Diverse set of Elements to choose from (Not just Fire, Ice, Electricity)+ Graphics engine is pretty (Cryengine 3 so it should be)+ Fairly diverse setting(s), with some interesting landmarks+ Compelling upgrade system+ It's reasonably long, although 'drawn out' might be a better description- Gameplay is repetitive- Only a handful of types of enemies reskinned throughout the game- Gameplay is repetitive- World feels utterly dead and empty (little to no interactivity, constant corridor layout)- Gameplay is repetitive- Story is told AT you rather than you really participating in any recognisable way- Gameplay is repetitive- Spell mechanics are poorly explained- Gamep...yeah you get it5.5/10Lichdom is a game frequently tagged as 'RPG' with the tagline 'Play the first game where the Mage is a total badass!'. Bull***t! Whilst certainly you play as a mage, and you are quite powerful, the game plays out a lot more like an FPS a la Call of Duty than anything resembling an RPG. If you're looking for an RPG, stop now and look elswhere. How about being a badass? Well...no. The issue mostly comes down to how the game is balanced, for starters it features a similar enemy scaling system as Skyrim so it doesn't really matter how powerful you get, your enemies (the same 5 throughout the game) always scale with you. Secondly you typically face off against small groups of moderately dangerous enemies...most of whom are also Magic users.Lesson 1: When you make a game where you play as an all powerful mage...don't make everyone in it also a mage.I can't help but feel that masses of less powerful, non magic users would've greatly improved the feeling of empowerment, without making it too easy.I spent ~20hrs playing through the game on normal (Battlemage) difficulty...and got an achievement for it that apparently only 1.1% of people have. Pretty good sign that either your game is too hard (see other reviews/comments) and/or your game isn't interesting enough to be bothered finishing.Lesson 2: When you make a game about being 'badass' don't make it so you die ridiculously easily.In fairness, I didn't find the game particularly challenging on Battlemage Difficulty (I used a Fire Damage, Kinesis Mastery Debuff/Snare, Necromancy Minions/Tanking build), however most of the Boss encounters felt brutally cheap. Everything in the game is set up around damage rather than defense. You don't really have much in the way of defensive abilities, and when you come across elite enemies or bosses, they can often take out 2/3 of your health with a ranged (or teleported) hit you never saw coming.The world feels extremely dead. While some of the graphics are pretty owing to running on Cryengine 3, the models aren't particularly impressive and the level design is poor. Most of the game you're charging through what is more or less a corridor with periodic encounters (enemies just appear in 'arenas') along the way. Run 50m, engage 5-10 enemies, run 50m, engage the same 5-10 enemies...repeat for an hour. The other issue that contributes to the dead world feeling, is that the world is basically non-interactive (there's no physics). For a modern game, this is poor. For a modern game about the elements and being a badass mage...it's really disappointing that you can't set things on fire, or blow stuff up.Lesson 3: Being a Badass mage requires LARGE AMOUNTS OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE (imo anyway)Further to that, there's no interaction between the elements. Combining Ice and Fire has fundamentally the same effects as Fire and Kinesis. The spells have more variation on whether they're Destruction (damage), Mastery (debuff/amp damage), or Control (debuff/snare), than they really do between the elements.Ultimately I recommend Lichdom: Battlemage simply because I think it deserves some exposure for trying to do something new, and there's not enough of that. It's just a shame that the game feels like some great concepts that nobody ever actually sat down and playtested. Playing through the game I kept thinking that it would've been better if they'd done things differently. Lichdom: Battlemage comes across as an incomplete product, the idea is there, but the execution just isn't yet. Nonetheless, if you're intrigued, and it's on sale...give it a shot.			"

												Even though I hit 'yes' for my ultimate review, I really only do that because it's a unique game that I want to see more of from game developers... But, it still has it's flaws that make this less than ideal. There's some top quality voice acting, I was surprised to hear the voices that I did, and they all do pretty well with their lines. The setting is also pretty awesome and well-detailed, with a lot of love put into the different levels you come across, the fine details and whatnot. It's also cool to see some programmers embracing a concept that doesn't really seem to shine through, the badass mage that is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Kind of like a cross between Gandalf and Bruce Lee, something you don't understand until it's lit you on fire WITH THEIR MIND. However, there's a lot that gets in the way and really makes this game more of a trudge for me. The first part is that the game mechanics are really clunky, enough that it's more of a fight to keep control of your character than it is working your tactics against enemies. The combat is on a fast-pace first-person shooter level, but the spells don't really back that up. Frequently I'm working to dodge or backpedal in order to keep the foe at a distance while I'm charging a spell that's worth a damn, or I'm trying to set up an area of attack spell but it triggers too late for it to really do anything. I've tried tinkering with the crafting system to see what I can get from it, thinking that it might be that I'm just using the wrong tools for the job... but nothing seems to really matter. There's such a huge variety of different components, each with subtle differences, that it just blurs together. I really found myself thinking that a system borrowed from Borderlands would be much better, where you can choose between various elements, and you get different abilities as you level up. In all, I could tell the power was there, I just had to really DIG to get to it.The setting itself also could use help, there is the beginnings of a good story, but it feels like you're just a ghost moving through it all. Story elements are told through a sort of flashback ability, but you really only interact with one or two characters at a time, and they're forgettable enough that I honestly can't remember names of anyone. There's mention of a conflict raging in the world already, but you never seem to take part in it directly. The graphics also show you things that get me to investigate, and I'm definitely intreagued, but it is just for show... You can look with your eyes, but that's about it, and eventually you find yourself not even bothering to explore the world at all. In all, I really want to keep going with the game, there's the amazing potential there to make a really high-caliber game that could really bring some innovation to the FPS and Fantasy genre... but there's either too much complexity that it becomes difficult to grasp, or it's so bland that there's no point to it at all.If you're a developer, seriously, this can really be a new type of FPS that could help bring life to the genre... just polish this stuff out more. If you're a gamer, pick it up if you've got funds you don't care what you burn on, or if it's on sale...			"

												It looks cool and has unique crafting mechanics, but heres its biggest issue...So the devloper said the idea behind the game was that mages in other games were underpowered to balance things out and he wanted to make a game where you are a mage who wields great power to destroy his foes.But the game is not like that at all.Its pretty much a bullet hell game where you dodge every ones physical and ranged attacks while you shoot back spells.The bosses are boring walk away, cast, walk away, cast fests that are more difficult than they are even fun.The effects look nice and spells feel solid but the combat is not just reppettive but completely underwelming.I dont even reccomending getting it on sale, for you wont play it long anyways.

												I'll be brief:Pros:-Very complex spell crafting system with lots of possibilities-Beautiful graphics and special effects-The default difficulty (now known as 'Battlemage') is just right - very challenging, but not impossibleCons:-The levels sometimes are needlessly long and repetitive-The combat is repetitive unless you swap sigils on purpose-The story is not expressed enough-The tutorials only explain the magic systems themselves, not in conjunction with each otherAll in all, a very solid game which I'd recommend to play through if you're tired of 'standard' fantasy with mana, cooldowns and elves.

												Hot damn, Xaviant have crafted something really beautiful with Battlemage: gorgeous environments and vibrantly repugnant enemies coalesce with a deep and engaging spell crafting system which rewards experimentation and creativity to produce a gauntlet of frenetic action which rarely risks monotony. The combat system itself consists of only a few basic elements, but these can be utilised in quick succession, rewarding quick reflexes and tactical planning and punishing those who assume that spamming the flame spells will achieve victory; it won't, genius. It also demands mentioning that the spells themselves are positively... well... spellbinding (deal with it), wild motes of colour dancing, arcing, bolting and exploding in vivid spectra from the bare hands of your avatar to pierce, bludgeon, restrain and, often, utterly decimate the wonderfully lively monsters and undead you face throughout Battlemage.All this said, the tutorial systems are an eggregious state of poor: shortly after beginning the game, having been just introduced to the four or five most basic combat features of the game, Battlemage simply gave up on tutoring me at all, instead directing me to the in-game journal for a lovely dump of boring text to sift through and educate myself on what are, honestly, the far more interesting aspects of the game, such as crafting and the three key types of spell damage required for combos. Endless Legend suffered from much the same issues with its tutorial (100 hours and I am still having to learn obscure mechanics through experimentation). Fortunately, Battlemage's mechanics are far simpler and easier to experiment with and, thus, thoroughly learn, but it still saddens me that this will likely turn many people off through lack of easy accessibility born from a lack of simple tutorials.Obviously, highly recommended. Additionally, the 1.2 hours currently listed for my playtime for the game are false. It is significantly more than that.			"

												While I've only put in an hour or so, this game has failed to grab me.It is extremely linear, and I have been fighting the same enemies for an hour. I feel no reason to combo ice and fire, (ice stores damage until hit with fire; might as well just hit with fire to begin with) and thus I am spamming the same spells over and over.While it is pretty, and the spell crafting is reasonably interesting, it is not interesting or exciting enough to keep me playing.

												----WARNING, WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!----    I expected more. I expected to be a badass mage, flinging cool (and sometimes silly) custom spells around. There are 3 variants of spell modifier for 2 of the 3 spell types, with 8 'Sigils' (magic types), and Destrution, Control, and Mastery effects for each. Sounds good, right? It's not, and that is because Destruction, Control, and Mastery have no effect on the apperance of your spells, Destruction = Damage, Control = Influencing enemies(dmg over time, stuns, etc.), and Mastery = Enemies take increased damage.    The spell modifiers only change how the effect is delivered ( a continous stream, a grenade like effect, homing missles, etc.) Each Sigil type is nice, excluding the over-done and over-used types of Fire and Ice. You have a Aoe spell (think traps), your thrown spells, and Novas (what happens when you use a charged blink). Basically the spells aren't anywere near as customizable as they should be. Also you can only use 1 Sigil type per both hands, no dual-wielding differnt spell types.    Shield's are stupid, there are 3 types of shields. 1-Agile, quick blinks and charged blinks, low damage block, low shield. 2-Tactical, charged blinks, medium damage block, medium shield. 3-Strategic,3 quick blinks (has recharge), high damage block, high shield. My problem with them is that I can't use any of them. Agile is fast enough, but lacts the shield I need, while strategic has enough shield but isn't fast enough. Tactical is just stupid, mainly because I can't dodge last second.   The enemies are annoying, and make things like boss fights ridiculously tedious. Most of my deaths in this game have involved trying to take shortcuts through levels (which are all very linear btw) or being stunlocked by ranged enemies till the boss finally connects with a hit (usually a insta/near insta-kill even on lower difficulties).   I've only been to about 4 locations in the game if you include the tutorial. I could not find a single shortcut through these levels, considering there is no jump button, and 4 ft falls kill you. These levels (excluding the tutorial) are overly long, and very tedious.  If you want a nice to look at game with good magic effects, here it is. I'd rather much prefer something that actually gave me insanely customizable spells, with fun game mechanics.			"

												concept of the game is nice. i would enjoy a more complicated crafting system, where you can more finetune the properties of a spell.now the BUT:the game feels slow, just extremely slow. and the biggest reason is the warmup of spells. i would rather have a cooldown than a warmup. even normal spells need a warmup animation which just kills the action feeling. im sometimes feeling a bit lost because of the delay between clicking and actually sending the spell. also the AOE could be done better with a cooldown instead of a warmup. when i need the AOE i need it now, not in 5 seconds. it takes the fun out of the game. i wanna wreak havok and not wait for the spell to be ready. maybe a bar that has to be filled by casting normal spells could be used additionally. you either fill the bar with spells or you have to use the warmup thingy to completely fill it. just adds the action back into the game. im still recommending it, because if you need a game where you can just play for half an hour without any greater story or mechanism you have to remember, this is your game.could be much more fun though if it were a bit like serious sam			"

												The crafting system in Lichdom is very similar to how Path of Exile handles abilites. All abilities are modifiable, and you can change the default fireball you get in the beginning of the game into a lob, a beam, a debuff, an accellerant, all kinds of things, and that goes for every single ability you get in every tree. The defensive options are awesome as well, you can go as a tank mage who relies on his health reserves, or you can go as a super agile mage that relies entirely on blink/dodge. You can also customize that as well, because the game treats your defence as an ability. I'm only 5 hours in, but I'm starting to understand the crafting system. I'd advise watching a quick guide or reading up on the wiki for 5 or 10 minutes to get an idea of how things work, but this game is definitely worth it if it's on sale. Still not sure  if I would pay full price, as I'm not sure how much time I'm going to sink into this game. Anyway, the reviews on this game are harsh, and I've been having a lot of fun with it.			"

												I definitely do not recommend this product due to serious gameplay a leveldesign issues. Lichdom: Battlemage is a game that reached it´s full potencial during the first hour of gameplay. What comes next is dull, repetetive, unoriginal and unbalanced quasi FPS.Let´s start with the good stuff in this game. What I truly appreciate on L:B is it´s audiovisual representation. Game runs on CryEngine 3, which is a guarantee of top-notch graphics and solid optimalization. Developers did a really good job with visual design of various enviroment. You will definitely find yourself in awe ilooking at certain scenery.  What suprised me the most is voice-acting. For such a dull game with boring story it has nearly perfect, squaeky-clean voice-acting. Thumbs up on that one. Many games should take an example from this specific aspect of B:A.Story in the game is unbelievably stupid. I usually set my standards for videogame stories low, but writing of B:A is even worse, that I could imagine. For some short instances I was interested in certain events and characters, but overally it is a very weak story, which purely stands as an background for killing enemies.B:A puts you in the body of a mage. The game try to sell the idea of being of badass mage, but it falls short. Yes, magic effects are nice, effective and destructive. They will leave you amazed, but the spell (no pun intended) quickly wears off and few hours in the game you find yourself in slow-paced, repetetive FPS with the same enemies all over again. Certain parts of the game are suprisingly challenging and you will die certain amount of times, but you can easily master game mechanics by upgrading the right spells. There are many spells, but all of them are cast pretty much the same way. You shoot colored orbs from your hands. I understand why you shoot fireball, but I can´t comprehend why is spell like lightining cast as orb. Lighting? Orb? And there many more questionable gameplay choices. B:A contain spellcrafting system, but don´t expect any deep crafting elements. Crafting is basically slow upgrading of your skills. You don´t create new spells or effects (not counting synergies), it´s just a marketing trick, that didn´t transfer into gameplay.Level desing is really lazy, boring and linear. I don´t have anything against linear games, I enjoy them, but leveldesign of B:A can be pretty much summed up by word ""tunnel"". Every level is linear, unteresting tunnel, that doesn´t ever try to hide it´s linearity. In general, the enviroment feels very empty and besides a handful of sceneries, it doesn´t provide any memorable moments.Due to these flaws I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone, definitely not for it´s full price. Not even 75% discount. If you want to try this game for some reasons (e.g. you love fantasy and spells), than grab it from some bundle or really big sale. Otherwise, don´t waste your time and money on this game.4/10 +graphics+voice acting+some nice spells (Necromancy)-repetetive-lazy leveldesign-story-repetetive-repetetive-repe...			"

												Disclaimer: I didn't finish it. I couldn't be bothered to see it through all the way but I was very much near the end.Spellcrafting: 9/10 - Very fun and easily the most interesting aspect of the game, along with synergies due to the large variety of spell types availableVisuals: 8/10 - Very well animated spell effects. Regardless of the sigils, casting them is very pleasant to the eye. The colours give each sigil a distinct look and  feel. There are a fair few graphical glitches, especially on any character that wears robes. but forgivable. All in all a nice visual styleCombat: 7/10 - It's good once you get used to switching between your sigils and comboing them, but that takes a while until you understand the basic concepts of the game. Unfortunately once you do understand it and find some decent spell combos, the game becomes very repetitive. Waves of enemies, in different but pointless locations over and over and over.Level design: 2/10 - One of my biggest quips with the game. It feels like the levels were made by the creators of Serious Sam. Such a disjointed mess of different locales... Each of them is unique which is good for variety but with the waves of enemies it genuinely feels like a Serious Sam that takes itself too seriously. There's ""fast travel"" which is not really fast travel, but travel. There is no other way to travel for this to be the fast one. There's no map of the country, and the locatuions exist in separate instances. .The world they have built does not feel alive, at all. It feels like a big sandbox excuse to kill things. Which bring us to the biggest issue:Story: 1/10 - Honestly, I have never before been so bored out of my mind with a ""fantasy"" story. It's unfortunate because it's not lacking due to laziness, you can see they've put real effort into making many collectable pieces of lore in the form of letters and journals. But because each locale is so disjointed from the rest, it never manages to make you care about the world or ANY of its inhabitants. And since there are literally zero regular humans other than enemies (cultists) and monsters, the world feels like nothing but a sandbox. The protagonist is ""generic revenge seeker"" number 1000, and has no personality other than that. We're not given any reason to care for him/her except ""they killed his/her family"". Nothing about their hopes and dreams before this, nothing about whther they are a good or bad person. Even when something happens that would make any human grieve, he just takes it in stride. And the villains, are just stereotypical ""powerhungry"" villainous figures. No real motivation or character behind them. This story would impress a 10 year old child, if that. Overall: 5.4/10 just the average of the above, which is fitting for an average game. If they had taken the combat and spellcrafting and used all of that in an open-world environment with regular NPCs and ""quest""-style objectives it could have been amazing. As it is it was just average. A good bit of fun, which is why I recommend it, but only to those who are prepared to put up with a truly atrocious story and a bit of a time investment to understand the crafting system for a bit of fun.

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a solid game. A first person spell-'em-up with a crafting system that allows you to customize your spells (example: having your attack spell be a bolt, ray, or a lob style attack). The story and game path are linear, but considering the story it is telling, keeping the player focused is probably a good thing.The combat can get repetitive, but if you switch between the different elements you can wield, it can make the game a little more interesting, but it might be a good idea to play this game in sessions, rather than trying to blast through it all in one go.

												The plot is there, just as the eula and terms of service are always there, but then again nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ just get the thing going!So yeah, you’re an all-powerful mage collecting and upgrading spells. You don’t lvl up, but spells get tougher the more you use them. Oh, and there’s this pretty chick who pops in every here and there. She fancies me, just as I fancy her, but of course these characters are too childish to admit it and get laid. Or probably because of mature content, because, obviously, eviscerating and burning alive people is not mature content. Or maybe still, because of narrative development of said characters – which we all know is BS. Anyways, it doesn’t matter at all, because we’re not here to ♥♥♥♥, but to kick♥♥♥♥♥ Oh, she eventually reports something or other, I couldn’t tell, because I’m too focused ignoring her BS and trying to figure how to better my spells. But basically, she tells there’s more enemies ahead – no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock!! - and has a bird whose bioluminescent crap indicates the way. You just press ‘v’ and it indicates the path you’re NOT to take, because the branching path leads to more loot! And so, yeah, you keep collecting this glowing orbs, which supposedly are the essence of the dead, but are really just magical thingies you use to ‘craft’ [aka create] more powerful spells. Thankfully, there are many vids [trying] to explain the complex craft system, and also there’s this automatic-craft-aid-system which got me going, because, honestly, I was lost AF. But then I got the hang of it fairly quick and now am hooked in this mage carnage. The graphs are superb and game is great. Good purchase mf, peace out!			"

												When I saw the trailer, I wasn't very impressed, to be honest. The game looked too frenetic to me. If the trailer was the only soruce of information, I would not buy the game. Luckily, it wasn't.Lichdom: Battlemage is a fantasy action game. You are a mage who is not limited with the amount of mana. A powerful mage who can destroy thousand of enemies, yet can't jump nor swim. You do not have a sword either, so casting spells is the only way you can fight enemies.There are 8 sigils in the game, each with three spells- Nova, a spell activated when you defend yourself, Targeted spell, which is a standart one and AOE- Area of Effect spell. Each spell can be atunned to destruction, control and mastery. The effects of these attunements vary from sigil to sigil, but in general it's reccommended to combine them in order to hurt your enemies more.The powers of sigils can be combined, which is the main fun of the game in my opinion. For example, I casted a time bubble on an enemy, which absorbs damage from other spells. Then I casted a spell which sends bugs to the enemy, eating them alive from within. Finally, I used a teleport spell. The enemy was teared apart with it. The bugs then went to other enemies, hurting and teleporting them through the battlefield.You can also craft your own spells from resources you'll find on the way, upgrade the spells and even the resources and craft synergies. Synergies are spells which combines power of two sigils. They can summon powerfull creatures or deal huge damage to enemies.In general, this game is very good. Yes, it can get sometimes a bit repetetive and the levels are basically corridors with few other ways to go. I think the story can't stand on it's own, it serves more like a motivation to go further, killing enemies down the road. But this is a debut of Xavian, and as such is really good. I reccommend this game.			"

Because if not, you could hit a stone wall by focusing too much on one play style"".Let me explain that a little bit, the game has spell crafting, and it's just like you collect weapon parts, and slap them together to make a new weapon, but you need the right kind of parts for your specific weapon you enjoy.It's all down to random luck to whether the legendary you gave up hundreds of other I'm gonna call them ""Runes"" for, and that Legendary does wank all for your current play style.

												Lichdom is a game developed on cryengine 3.It has a good presentation, UI, options, voice acting (uninspired story/writing though) and great graphics. The gameplay is fluid and a bit carefree as you dont have a Mana to worry about. The spells are satisfying and the combinations a bit too complex. Complexity comes in terms of stats and 3 types of spells, these dont change the spells visuals too much. Some things are not explained at all requiring alot of trying and reading. The bosses are hard, too hard, require some exact combinations, or as I was lucky to get, a bug where second boss stays stuck in a wall. Perfect! honestly, because the bosses spell spam and the awkward Movement controls make this the worst part of the game. If you enjoy playing as a mage, it is a game worth checking out, though sometimes I felt like it was a Crysis mod where the spells mechanics were just fitted in.After completing the game I can say that pratice or new equipment makes the rest of the bosses much easier. Only some parts with way back respawns are frustrating.			"

												19 or so hours of the same combo spells to kill enemies quickly, progress through story.  The enirvonments and enemies felt repeated after the first five hours or so. Some boss fights were tough but it seemed the more powerful I became the easier the boss battles were. You would think they would scale those battles accordingly. I couldn't even finish the game because I felt that I saw it all. I had no reason to see it through until the end. The only reason I kept playing long after I grew tired of killing the same enemies over and over again was the crafting system. It doesn't take to long to understand the complexity of different combinations and receiving a more powerful spell through your own upgrades is extremely rewarding. This game failed on it's attempt to put forth an intriguing story and the bland enivronments/enemies almost is enough to deter you from playing the game after awhile. The crafting system is its saving grace though. Play it and you'll feel like the most powerful mage in the Universe.			"

												There are moments when You really need neutral button for this reviews - and that's one of them.Is it a bad game? No.Is it worth your money? Probably not.Is it worth your time? I don't know.This game have some amazing, really amazing upsides+graphics are top notch for the moment of realese and still can be impresive+performance (aside from final battle that was lagy as heck)+overall stylistics and atmosphere+the story wasn't super original, but it was pinch or two away from beeing great motivator to play forward...Buuuut, there are downs, sooo many downsides of this product.-you can't jump in this game. You are a dragon, but you can't jump. I have no problem with this, but on every map, on every step you just feel need... no - urge, you feel urge to taste a little freedom. There is none.-did I just say freedom? There is one path, one way, one route. Heck - if you can go left or right, it means eather you found short road to bonus or it's a branch and you'll end up in same outcome in about 30-45 seconds.-and back to beeing dragon - you can die soooo easy, when falling in wrong place. You see stairs? Don't take shortcut - falling from 3 stairs will kill you... sometimes. Sometimes not. There are places where developers clearly didn't think about players going faster, but in other places you are expected to jump from considerd hights. I can'r forget dieing after falling from dune on desert map. It was like 1 meter or maybe 1,5m. on soft, mellow sand. And what happens? Dragon dies! Dragon! From a 1,5 fall on sand! Yh.-spell crafting seems like a great idea, but it's ultimately shallow, useless and overdone (even if there are not that many options in first place)-different types of magic are in the end not that different, only more or less effective.-gameplay is really repetitive and after first boss encounter you've seen all except different map themesSo to say it blunt - if You have nothing against dumbed down version of Serious Sam, with less humor, and magic instead of gun flavour - you will enjoy this game. If not - you will be put to sleep.PS: There is also a matter of some confusion that I like to adress, but I want to note, that it have nothing to do with my final judgment ;).When the game was first presented, Skyrim was kinda big thing. Many people mistakenly belived it's an open world, sandbox RPG/shooter/mage symulator. I don't know why, but when I first heard about it - people who showed me trailers described Lichdom excatly that. A ""skyrymish mage symulator""... and they wasn't only one, because I heard it here and there, now and then for a long, long time. Sure it was debunked pretty fast, but for a short moment, we belived we have something really unique on our hands.And to finish with it - I made gameplay series out of it, really borring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, so you my kind readers, don't have to play it for yourselves. Please take into consideration, that I'm no pro, I really suck on shooters and it's in Polish language. But heck - check it out for visuals, they are really awesome!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtDTx_Aqkji-Wp15odnW440KCSDOil0M "

												Not bad but not great, the game gives you intersing mixtures of spells so there are a number of ways to mix up the combat to make things interesting but after a while that loses its charm, I feel like the game needed to expand on how the spells interact with the enimies and surroundings not just this deals damage and this deals more damage.

												I'd hoped for a game that would live up to Might and Magic: Dark Messiah.... And I did not get it. Now I am a sad, hollow caricature of my previous hopeful self. This game killed my inner child. With a whiffle bat. Pros: Graphics and music are good, spell animations are neat, bosses are big and tough but easy once you figure out the fight. I liked the intro menu. The pre-rendered movies in the Steam store are great!Cons: Story got dull and I never cared about the characters. Since you only have three types of spells equiped, there's not a lot of variety. I found myself casting Necro, ice, fire.... in that order. On every enemy... for hours. Did I mention it's mostly the same enemies? Or slight varietions with the same boring attack patterns. AI? What AI?I kept waiting to feel like a total badass battlemage. Since it's single player, some ""ungodly awesome, eeeeeeevvvverything dies as you laugh manically"" spells would be awesome and would have made me feel like a total badass. Instead I felt like I was mixing concrete. Step 1, step 2, step 3, repeat. This sadly, is a C class game for an A class price. Skip it.			"

												Lichdom: Battlemage is a unqiue game that although is very same-y and repetitive, I'd highly recomend it to play in short burst between 1 and 2 hours. In my opinion, don't get this game full price but rather for $30 or less.The combat is everything in this game, and it's such a euphoric experience to deal out pain in a wide area of effect. However, the enemies won't be phased by your measly firebolt to their face, but rather you'll need to strategize and configure your spells to control the battlefield and increase your damage for maximum effect.The crafting system of the game is intricate but lacks depth; that is, although one has many options to craft new spells in any combination of components he or she has gathered, any given combination is going to produce a set effect with different numbers.All things considered though, even though the combat is fun, I can not help but to feel as if the world is fairly empty. The environments in which you explore the game are huge and expansive, but the developers, I feel, could have put in more secret areas branching from the fairly linear path one is supposed to follow.

												The first time i played this game, i was unable to appreciate it. I was looking for an elder scrolls type of gameplay. With this in mind i played around 2 hours and uninstall it.But few days ago, one year after i buy it, i decided to reinstall it cause i wanted to play a good and hard mage game. So i tested it again and.. the things i didn't like the first time maked me like it this time.There are ""only"" two type of objects : shapes and augments. They can be improved and allow you t o craft spells. You don't need to search in dead body, they come on you.The crafting system is complete and you can make your own spells for what you want to do.The sigil system allow you to have 9 spells and easily switch them. Indeed, you can have 1 spell of each type (tageted, AOL, nova) of 3 differents elements (sigils). There are eight different sigils, each one with his own capacity and gameplay.This game is for you if you want hard boss fight like in dark souls. if you want it, wait a little, it is often on sales under 3 €.If you choose to try it two tips : keep moving and always have a good shield			"

												Hell.The graphical outlooks is mediocre at best.Player movement in itself is quite clunky.The levels are straightforward boring and unimaginative. The lack of even simple puzzles frustrates in itself. Even the collectibles are not hidden to begin with.The story started well, but...There are tutorials for almost everything except the spellcrafting system, which should be explained. Also it's too complex to get a clear understanding of.The combat isn't really hard to begin with. It's an illusion and one can just spam bolts and AoE's here and there and progress anyways. Also infinite warping shield makes this babby's first combat experience.This could've been an epic power fantasy game, yet it manages to be both PLAIN BORING, FRUSTRATINGLY COMPLEX at the same time. Too bad.I really hope that in the future such things are looked at and given proper thought.			"

												The game could have been something cool. It has nice visuals, good sounds effect, good voice acting and most importantly an interesting core idea (the battlemage who can craft his own spells). However it becomes repetitive very fast. The actual gameplay is simply too barebone and uninteresting, and so are the enemies. The story is also very generic and not tackled enough during the campaign to keep the player interested. Honestly i didn't find the strength to finish it. I wasn't engaged at all.			"

												Not much of a variety of magic, you get about 5 different spells and the only customization is whether its a projectile or a beam, etc.... Combat is rather boringNot much map freedom, follow this path while we explain the stroy-type of game			"

												I tried to like this, I really did.  The game looks pretty good and the concept is good, but it's just not very fun.  The spell crafting system is nice and provides some customization to better suit your play style.  The story is weak, which would be fine if the combat system was the main focus and was good.  It's not.  I think hands down the most glaring flaw is that both you and the enemies are all just damage sponges.  Combat feels slow and a bit clunky.  You just chuck spell after spell at the enemy who ignores the fact you are pelting them and hit you back.  There is no AI to be found here.  You glitch all the time when you take damage, resulting in you raising your hands in front of your face and waving around for a few seconds rather than casting.  I can understand if they want enemy attacks to interrupt you, but they do not convey this well by not properly programming the model animations aka your flailing arms.  There are not many monsters that appear per spawn, as they seem to be relying on it taking a LONG time to kill them, rather than making the spawns contain more enemies and be placed more interestingly.  YOU CAN'T JUMP!  I really hate this.  You will see easy ways to progress, but cannot hop a few inches or climb the smallest rocks.  This tears me out of emersion a LOT.  It turns your adventure to a very ""on rails"" experience.  There are huge swaths of empty land scape.  You really get a feeling of isolation, even when running through places like a city.  Is this game supposed to be in a post-apocalyptic setting?  I can’t see anything on the store page or in the story to indicate this, but that’s the feeling they convey.  A final note is that this game crashes pretty frequently.  It just freezes and sits there staring at you until you end the process.  I have played countless games both indie and AAA that can go from beginning to end without a lockup and crash.  This game I can I think at longest went 45 minutes before an issue would arise.Overall, I cannot recommend this game.  Not even steeply discounted or in a bundle.  This may “press the right buttons” for some people, but not for me.  I have seen other games do essentially everything this game does better.			"
