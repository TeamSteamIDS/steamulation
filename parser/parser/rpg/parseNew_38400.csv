												How to start to describe one of the greatest games ever made? Well.. that's probably one of the reasons why I never did a review.Fallout has been, still is and probably will always be my favourite game (series) of all time. Ever since I first laid eyes on the game, somewhere back in 1997, I wish I could live in that same apocalyptic world. The perfect blend of a post-nuclear environment and 50's style, makes it unique and is the reason why I would pick this game over other great games like Baldurs Gate or Planescape Torment. Like many RPG's, you start of creating your character. Besides sex, there are no cosmetic changes. You do get to alter your skill points and perks. Depending how you create your character, you might get a whole different adventure, each time. Play as a female? You might get some unique conversations. Low intelligence? You can't even speak properly. The gameplay is real-time but turn-based in combat. You can do actions, based on your Action Points (AP) and so do your enemies. You can even aim on one of your enemies' parts; cripple his leg, shoot his head or bust his groin... it's all up to you. Your opponents often die in gruesome ways and there are tons of different weapons (melee, guns, heavy weapons, unarmed, energy), different armors for you to wear, tons of items and lots of (side) quests, so you won't get bored quickly.The writing in the game is exceptional. Most of the dialogue are interesting and often combined with a lot of (dark) humor. In my opinion, the humor is one of the best aspects of what describes Fallout, something Bethesda never got right (in Fallout 3). Only important NPC's have dialogue, which are often voiced by (former) celebrities like Dwight Schulz & Richard Dean Anderson. The narration is done by Ron Perlman, who rightfully became a Fallout Icon, over the years.The music, produced by Mark Morgan, is also excellent. It's without a doubt, one of the best soundtracks of any game. The experimental music creates the apocalyptic atmosphere, perfectly.  I highly recommend Fallout to every RPG lover out there. I could write a lot more about why I like Fallout but it all comes down to this: It's simply one of those games you have to play before you die.			"

												Let me begin by noting that I was introduced to the Fallout series with Fallout 3, back in around 2009. I put hundreds of hours into the game between Xbox 360 and PC, and I found the world to be incredibly interesting and atmospheric. The RPG mechanics and depth were like something I had never before seen, being a teenager and my life having been more saturated with more casualized games such as Call of Duty.Up until I finished Fallout, Fallout 3 was my all-time favorite.But now that I've experienced Fallout, it's as if my standards have risen tenfold. It may seem weird given that the game is seventeen years old as of writing this review, but I can elaborate. This game has managed to deliver an experience like no other game I have ever played with simple isometric graphics, and most importantly, a surprisingly complex and mature narrative. The music, sounds, and intriguing -- but again, simple -- visuals create an ambient feeling of loneliness  throughout the wasteland. The soundtrack is hauntingly fitting, for example in Necropolis, a city of ghouls. The sound creepy churchbells amid a fine chord of a low key sends shivers down my spine.Adult themes similar to the philosophy of the Ubermensch, and existentialism are very prevalent as well.I love this game, and it has shown me the real potential of video games. Books present you with narrative. Films, with narrative, visualization, and sound. Video games, with narrative, visualization, sound, and interaction.10/10			"

												Where to start with this game...'It's a classic' would be a good place to start, I guess. I have no problems say that from the outset. It's only taken me 15 years to get around to play original Fallout, but I can see without a shadow of a doubt why it's so highly regarded. Before you play this game make sure to download the Fallout Fixt mod, which is a very comprehensive community mod which fixes a lot of the bugs, and more importantly the resolution for modern monitors. Without this patch you'll more than likely experience a horrible rainbow pixalation effect during videos and gameplay. Anyway...Fallout is a turn-based RPG series which offers you various ways to tackle the game. Do you want to be a stealthy person, creeping around, pick pocketing your way to glory? Sure, why not! Do you want to be a smooth talking kinda guy who can talk his way in and out of trouble? Go on, be that guy! What about a bookworm who can use his brain to solve puzzles. Yup! And of course you can be a mix of all three, as well as a gun totting maniac! YEE-HAW!For my playthrough I used one of the pre-set characers (Albert) who was a Lawyer in a previous life and was set up with high charisma and speech skills. This opened up different dialogue trees throughout the game, which was nice. Anyway, I enjoyed this game - I enjoyed it a lot. The characters are great, the voice acting (while limited) was pretty nice (though it did give away who the 'important' characters were) and the story itself was pretty deep. The game starts, as always, with you the 'Vault Dweller' leaving your vault for the first time to explore the wastelands. You're tasked with bringing back a water chip to save your vault before everyone dies of thirst! There's a time limit to this, which (for me) cast a sense of urgency. Normally in Fallout games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas) I'm guilty of just going 'WHEEEEE' and exploring everywhere and not really caring what I'm doing. Yet in Fallout there's no time to explore, you've got to save lives!... if you want to. You see you don't NEED to save their lives, if you don't want to. In fact, you don't HAVE to do much in Fallout if you don't want to. It's not a narrow pathed experience, you can pretty much choose how you deal with the events in the game (and the end game cutscene will reflect on this at the end). A lot of games claim to be an open experience, and the actions you take reflecting on the game world, yet here's a game from 1997 which actually does that. I'm not sure it even heralds that fact that it does this. It just gets on with being a pretty damn good game. This brings me on to another aspect of the game - the many different branches of the game. People react to you differently depending on what you're wearing, what you're wielding, and what you're intelligence or charisma is. I find that amaizng now (in 2014), so I can only imagine how mindblowing it was back in 1997 when the game was released. The 'simple' graphics by today's standards shouldn't distract you from what is a very complex game. There's a lot going on under the hood of this game and at times perhaps too much.My eyes were really opened up to this towards the end of the game when I was struggling with killing a certain mob. I had went about it 'head on' and was killed a number of times. Yet, after a night's sleep I came back with a different approach, a more sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s approach and it was so much easier, and strangely satisfying. I had killed the guy and he had never even seen me.OK, sure the wastelands were plunged into another 100 years of nuclear fallout in the process, but hey... I KILLED THE GUY!However, even with the Fallout Fixt mod, the game can be prone to crash now and again. I'm not sure if it's the game's memory file getting too big or a conflict with Steam Overlay (wouldn't be a first), but towards the end of the game (and a lot of different quest outcomes) it started to become slightly unstable. So save REGULARLY!Which brings me on to another thing. This is an 'old school' game. It will not autosave for you, you must take control of your own save files. If you die you won't be taken back to the next/recent checkpoint... you'll have to load up from the last point you saved. This was the only thing I didn't like, but in the end I learned to live with it and it made me realise how pampered I had become as a gamer. I didn't have autosaves and 10 minute interval checkpoints when I was a kid and I still played games all the time back then. Yet, here I am as a grown man crying about dying and having to go back 20 minutes in the game because I had forgot to save... a lesson in life this game has given me.Also, this game is tough. REALLY tough. Depending on how you build your character, or which character you choose. You will die a lot.A lot.So in closing...If you're looking for an old school RPG experience than I'd recommend giving Fallout a try. I appreciate at time of writing they're no longer available on the Steam Store, or GOG, but hopefully they return one day, as they deserve to be played.			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being dipped into a vat of goo by a super mutant, sliced and diced by Deathclaws, turned inside out by radiation, and the good old fashioned bullet to the head. Fun!*strolls around post-apocalyptic Southern California while listening to completely unfitting 1950's music.*(Ok, the game is fantastic if that didn't tell you enough. It's shorter than its sequels, but this one is very much worth playing. And if you seriously don't like it, don't get mad at me if the Super Mutants come and burn your house down! :P)			"

												This game is SPECIAL the amount of things to do in the giant wasteland is amazing. From clearing out raider camps to going on caravan runs just to name a few. I have never encountered a bug in all my time of playing. The story is quite long which is nice.And last but not least the RPG elements in this game are awesome for it's time. You can create your character how ever you want from age to gender to how strong you are or how smart you are. This allows for many different character builds. Overall I give this game a 10/10!			"

												Once upon a time. There was a guy who played Fallout 3 and New Vegas.He liked the games. And thought ""Hey, I want to play the first two"" So, he went onto Steam, and the lord Gaben blessed him with a sale.Immediatly, he bought the first, and downloaded it with all due haste. He excitedly loaded it up. Watched the classic Interplay intro, and clicked 'new game' as fast as his mouse would allow him.He made his character, watched the intro. And soon, he was on his way. To Vault 15.Unfortunately, five minutes after stepping into a new world, he was ambushed, he tried valliantly to shoot his attackers. But all his shots missed! Which lead to his unfortunate demise. So he rebooted, and died again. And again, And again.This guy is me.10/10			"

												First of all, I'd like to note that this review is made by someone who has recently picked this game up - no nostalgia, only objectivity.The good:- Works well, zero crashes so far, one very minor bug (Shady Sands citizen was panicking over Tandi when she wasn't even gone yet). Zero compatibility issues - they have seriously taken GOOD care of the game when they made it available on Steam (I believe it's even running on some MS-DOS emulator but you don't notice a thing about that. Also it comes with some sort of resolution patch). Also, the game is very alt-tab friendly, you can alt-tab at any time without issues.- Very good story so far (10 hours in, so can't say everything about it, but so far it's been really good). This game is all about the dialogue. There's an amazing amount of text in this game - and many characters even have spoken dialogue and animations when you're talking to them. I'd go as far as saying the story is on pretty much the same level as 3 and NV so far, in my opinion - with better character building than NV, but more of an RPG touch than FO3 (but I know opinions differ greatly on this part, so take it with a grain of salt, and feel free to disagree).- This game has aged very well. I don't exactly know how to explain it, but I actually guess the closest analogy would be the old Pokémon games, gameplay-wise. Top-down view, grid based, turn-based combat. 2D games like this never really get old. You can try to make them look better but it'll just end up looking weird. - Price. This game is dirt cheap, I got it for about €1,50 during the summer sale.Neutral:- It's a hard game. It definitely is less forgiving than Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas. Don't be surprised to find a surprisingly large group of surprisingly strong raiders in your path at an early level. And even if you've played FO3 and FONV, you will more likely than not screw up your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. which means you'll have to start over and make a new character early on. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and stats and perks are all rather complicated. I actually like it, though, despite having to start over because I have 1 strength and can't use my guns properly. The bad:-Resolution. It's locked to 4:3, and although the Steam version seemed to have some sort of Resolution patch and you can set it to your native resolution which lets you alt-tab quicker, you'll still have to either deal with pillarboxing or stretching. The textures also aren't of amazing resolutions, but that doesn't bother me much personally. The art style is amazing.- Might be hard to get hooked. Older games aren't for everyone and I understand that. I definitely love it though - and I only bought it during this summer sale. Never played it before. Hell, I was 3 years old when this game was released...Verdict:I personally think this game is easily worth the price they ask for it during a sale. It's old, but they took good care of it when they made it available on Steam. Give it a try!Edit - 18-1-2016I actually did end up playing this game a lot. However, I played it on my phone, in an emulator, so it still shows only 10.0 hours on Steam			"

												This is it. The Post-Apocalyptic RPG game that began a revolution and changed everything about the genre.PROS:- Well written story that will keep you interested until the end.- Charismatic and very well developed characters.- Karma and choice system (every positive and negative choice you made will count for the rest of the adventure).- Complex and complete interactive system and turn-based combat system.- The precise aiming system allows you to play strategically in battles (disable an enemy specific limb, blind it, stunt it, etc).- The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system gives the game an amazing way to improve the main protagonist skills/perks.- High quality 2D graphics with exceptional animations (for its time) that gives the characters/enemies great personality and a unique style.- Music that gets you into a decadent atmosfere on a wasted and post-apocalyptic Earth.- Excellent voice acting (many of those actors are highly recognized stars from the cinema and TV)- Innovative buying/selling and trading system.- Very accurate Point-and-click controls for pointing enemies, weapons, items, lockers, treasure chest, etc.CONS:- A pair of minor graphical glitches due to its age.If you love turn-based RPGs, you like the atmosphere from the Mad Max movies and you don't care to travel in time to the 90's (technologically speaking). this game will assure you hours of fun and satisfaction.My Score: 9/10Note: Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												The original Fallout is hardly as accessible as its modern, 21st century sequels, however it is just as brilliant, if not more so, than the both of them put together. With fewer sidequests and a shorter main story, it isn't nearly as long as Bethesda's contributions to the series, however it more than makes up for that thanks to its incredible atmosphere and high levels of replayability.Now that I've gotten the necessary comparisons out of the way, I'd like to refrain from mentioning Fallout 3 and New Vegas from this point onwards. Yes, New Vegas ties into this game's story quite a fair bit more (considering 3 is something of an offshoot), however what it comes down to is those are two ultimately different games. What you're getting here is a turn-based strategy RPG that is dowright fantastic.I'll freely admit that the game didn't have me very intrigued when I first booted it up. The graphics were plain, the controls and interface decidedly confusing, and the mechanics unclear. However, after sticking through the game's beginning and unlocking both the world's and the story's fullest potentials, the brilliance of the experience washed over me; this is a game that is entirely dynamic. Every single action your player character takes has an effect in a far more dramatic way than most games, and a whole ton of things can vastly change based on how you respond to the challenges presented to you. I am entirely certain that after my first playthrough last week, I haven't even begun to experience the full depth of what this game has to offer.The battles in the game are initially unexciting, yet quickly become more unique. The ""Action Points"" system, while not entirely original, is still creative enough that so many years later it remains capable of keeping my attention and excitement at a high, something very rare of older RPGs (which are often plagued by interface and gameplay issues that could only be resolved later on with more powerful hardware and higher resolutions). My one gripe is the randomness of the critical hits found later on in the game; some seem to inflict so much damage to the player character that it is impossible not to be killed by them, even when at the level cap and using full power armor. This element of randomness is not appreciated given that it can instantly end the life of even the most well-prepared vault dweller. I also highly recommend you refrain from picking up the ""Bloody Mess"" perk, as it makes the gory death animations all the more satisfying when they do crop up.And make no mistake, they will crop up over the course of your playthrough, and when they do it is both grim, satisfying, and oddly hilarious. Watching a supermutant clutch at his stomach while guts spew out of them may at first leave you with a grimace on your face, and yet there's someting oddly humorous about the timing of the worm crawling out of his head when he's already been laying on the ground dead for a couple of seconds.Ultimately, it's the little details that make Fallout such an incredible game, especially given how they're able to factor into the overall experience. If you're willing to overlook an initially obtusely difficult set of game mechanics and UI elements, as well as some lacklustre graphics and annoying grammatical errors, what you'll unearth in the original Fallout is a dynamic RPG classic that is entirely deserving of its reputation as one of the greatest Western RPGs to have emerged from the lates 90s.

												When I played Fallout 3 and Fallout NV, I instantly became a fan of the fallout series. I've never played the first Fallout though. I struggled getting use to the top-down point-and-click way of playing Fallout, but I learned quickly. I learned how the game works, and I am having a BLAST! Good gameplay, fun to loot, this is a great RPG. If you love Fallout 3 and NV, then I highly recommend this game.			"

												An amazing game that laid the groundwork for an outstanding series. The first is still enjoyable today and you can see that not much has changed since 1997. Perks, SPECIAL, Pip-boy, manual targeting, character creation, leveling. It's all here. The only thing you won't find is real time combat because the game forces you into a turn-based system. That will take some time to get used to if you're a FPS player.The real shame is that most of the younger fans won't even give the first two games a go because of the graphics. The same can be said of the older players who refuse to accept the new games. I'm somewhere in the middle. I started out with Fallout 1 & 2, but I didn't become a hardcore fan until Fallout 3 and New Vegas. They all have their pros and cons, but the atmosphere and gameplay have remained mostly the same.There is a community of fans still developing bug fixes and resolution patches for this game. If you are a true fan then you owe it to yourself to play this. Might as well do it now while it still works on modern computers.			"

												Fallout 1, the Holy Grail, the Michael Jackson, the ♥♥♥♥ing Switzerland of video games.My grandma told me to pick a gift, anything really, for my 10th birthday and by some cosmically fortuitous chain of events and decisions, I found Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game in the video game aisle to be the most to my liking. Of course I had no idea what a 'role playing game' was nor had anyone in my family ever wondered what PEGI 16 meant. Needless to say, with that purchase, grandma had probably affected my life the most since she decided to give birth to my father.Fallout is packed with (dark) humour, social commentary and pop-culture references. Honestly, I wouldn't get half the American idioms or jokes I do today... Playing it at a time the internet wasn't as ubiquitous, I completed dozens of playthroughs to explore all the endings, quests, dialogue options, nooks and crannies, lockboxes and special encounters. The fact I didn't get bored is an endorsement in itself. I still remember how eerie it felt arriving at the Brotherhood, figuring out The Glow or encountering a patrol of super mutants for the first time. I was quite immersed and instead of thinking 'I'll just reload a save', got genuinely scared of what would happen if the mutant with the minigun opened fire. (I'd be criticalled for 583 damage, having my head and arms torn off) The sense of free exploration and consequences of your actions you get when strolling too far west from the starting area and getting killed by super scary monsters is something most of today's RPGs are missing with their linear film-like narratives, tutorial quests and whatnot. Save game management is quite important, it may easily happen you'll lose a couple of hours of gameplay or that an earlier decision has narrowed your choices significantly or that you've managed to paint yourself into a corner bug-wise.The soundtrack is great, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system is great. Everything about it is great.I know this was 90% nostalgia, but I don't care.			"

												     The original Fallout is a turn based RPG.  You create, control, and level up a single character, but you can also recruit others to your cause.  Unfortunately, followers can only have their weapons upgraded in the vanilla version of the game; however, with Fallout Fixit, they can level up and have the armor upgraded like in Fallout 2.     The game is short by RPG standards -only about 20 hours- but a low price should offset such concerns.  Furthermore, the time that you do spend in game is what I refer to as quality game play time;  in other words, there are no boring and repetive quests or other filler content that increases game time without really adding to the game.  Your time spent in Fallout 1 will be filled with lighting raiders on fire, taking headshots on super mutants, performing unique side quests, and collecting all manner of new and destructive weapons.     Unfortunately, Fallout 1 is not without it's flaws.  For one, the grapics are quite dated.  If beautiful graphics are a requirement for you, then you might want to skip this one.  Second, the inventory interface is rather clunky.  Such an interface would probably be considered unacceptable by modern standards, but it's not bad enough that it should destroy your ability to enjoy the game.  Finally, there are other small concerns (such as the inability to move followers that get in your way).  However, these are mostly fixed by the Fallout Fixit patch.  In fact, I highly recommend this patch (see the Steam Forums or do a Google search).  It restores some cut content, makes followers more useful/powerfull, includes the high resolution patch, and much more.     The game may be showing its age when it comes to graphics and a clunky interface, but RPG lovers willing to look past these flaws will find a diamond in the rough.  The RPG mechanics are quite satisfying and the world and atmosphere are so captivating, that even after 15 years and 4 other Fallout games, fans still can't get enough.			"

												One of the first real modern cRPGs and part of the late 90s cRPG revival which is now in old school territory. This single character classless turn-based isometric RPG is still considered a high-water mark of the genre. The quests can be completed multiple ways using multiple character types. The game is loaded with skill checks.  Combat, speech, and stealth paths are all viable and supported heavily right through to the end game. Replays are a must in order to witness this amount of depth.  The writing and voice acting is top notch and the dark/humorous post nuclear setting in an alternate retro-future timeline as imagined by 1950s America is something SPECIAL.  Perhaps the most controversial element is the time limit but I'd argue it adds a good sense of urgency lacking in nearly every other RPG. Truth is it's very generous and can be extended.  For those of us who played the game many times, it's actually moot since the game can be completed in 30 minutes if you know what you are doing.			"

												It's year 2017 and I completed ""Fallout"" for the first time. A post-apocalyptic turn based RPG. You need to help your nuclear vault community by finding a water purifying chip, otherwise they are doomed. Find your way in a desert world full of mystery, monsters and fighting factions. The game is really enjoyable if you like classic RPGs and don't mind older graphics.PROS:- Graphics is oldish today, but it sets the mood really well and is quite nice.- Atmospheric music.- Non linear plot with multiple ways to achieve goals and multiple outcomes.- Good story.- Character development impacts your fighting strategies and dialogue options.- Multiple factions to join, work with and fight.- Multiple weapons.MEH:- Some companions may join you and help you, but you can barely manage them and they may be a nuissance.- Interface is oldish and may be a little annoying at times (but only a little). By the way: you can enter numbers from keyboard when you trade with someone, you don't need to set the price with mouse (which is slow).- There is a huge random factor in combat, so you need to save often. Because even if odds are in your favor you may lose.CONS:- None :)Conclusion: I highly recommend this classic RPG with satisfying story and immersive post-apocalyptic mood.GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 8/10AUDIO 8/10STORY 10/10			"

 Please consider that I am slightly biased, as I just finished the game, five minutes ago. Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing game is amazing. No Fallout game has gotten as much of an emotional responce as the original.The locations are great, every location has it's own charm.Some characters are really memorable and cool, such as Harold, in Old Town.The turn-based combat system allows for actual strategy, though sometimes that goes out the window with Criticals.The fact that this game is so unforgiving makes struggling through that more rewarding,Call me a monster, but shooting your raider-attackers as they flee for their lives is strangely satisfying.I'm, personally, HEAVILY against time-limits. I'm in the game to see the sights, do the quests, and go at my own pace. (The game lets you do that once you've collected the water chip.) For the Fallout fans... The only negative thing I can say about this game, is comparing it to Fallout 4 really shows what's happened to the series. Depressing.Super Mutants aren't one-note brutes! They're organized, powerful, sometimes intelligent! The Brotherhood of Steel does their DAMN JOBPower Armour is *very* rare but it's very, very effective. With it, pistols, SMGs, even Miniguns have 0 effect on the wearer.No quest markers, not a bad thing, just a heads-up. Gods, I love this game.  "

												Fallout 2 is the better game. The mixture of a big world, plenty of unique NPCs, many side quests, complex dialogue trees, and a nice amount of adult-themed humor and social critique are still unsurpassed.However, Fallout 1 just oozes that dark, gritty atmosphere. The future happens to be a grim place. The awesome  atmospheric soundtrack, the memorable characters you meet (often with a well-aimed critical shot to the crotch), and the broken towns and nuclear wastelands you visit during your journey through southern California all contribute to that special post-apocalyptic ""feel"" in ways that Fallout 2 can't quite copy, and Fallout 3 is totally unable to achieve. This CRPG from 1997 was made for PC gamers who prefer good dialogues, adult themes, an immersive experience, and a deep role-playing system.			"

												Fallout 1 is an interesting game that shows the world that it's age doesn't matter. My first fallout game that i played was fallout 4 so it was quite a journey changing from a fps to turn based strategy. I'll be simple and write pros and cons of this game, if you don't want to waste your time reading through that...i reccomend it 9/10Pros:-Story is well written and completing quests really feels like a reward-Characters are very well done and you can hear an interesting story as well :)-Post apocaliptic California feels like a real post apocaliptic place, the vibe of this destroyed world is really well done-Weapons and thier sounds are awesome( it's about to get messy! )-Music, music, music what else could I say, it's a masterpiece and no other fallout by now couldn't beat this thing, it's amazing-Quests are really fun sometimes( like exploring the glow)Cons:-I'm a wrong kid born in a wrong time, therefor i don't really like the battle mechanic of this game but it keeps this game original-Quests tend break and that causes glitches and bugs, and some NPCs send you to a quest that you can't complete-I won't lie the game is pretty hard, even on normal difficulty Final verdict: Altough old this game is still fun for any rpg fan or even better a fallout fan, fun quests, great world and cool weapons what's not to like :)			"

												I HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone who is a lover of roleplaying games, games where you can truly put yourself in someone elses shoes, break away from reality for a couple of hours as you immerse yourself in a world where your choices actually inpact nearly every situation. Trust me when I say this, this game may be old but its honestly better then most RPGs out today, the things you discover while out exploring the world will truly leave you with your mouth hanging open! Once you start playing you wont want to stop, you'll wana keep playing unril your sure you've explored every nook and cranny, talked to every NPC, and blew the face off of every enemy you encounter!

												Believe it or not I made it all the way to 2016 without playing a Fallout game but boy am I glad I decided to start at the beginning. Nearly 20 years after its initial release and this game still holds up. Like a fine wine or some scrumptious cheese it has indeed aged quite nicely. Although, I understand that this game may not be to everyones taste - much like that of the aformentioned wine and cheese. The dated graphics (and no, mods can't fix that) as well as the turn based combat may be an instant turn off for some people but I urge you not to judge this game at face value. This game is genuinly engrossing if you just take the time to sit down and immerse yourself in this masterfully crafted world. Your time will not be wasted. You can be what you want right from the start of the game you have the option of creating a completely customised character, which I strongly recommend. Even before the game has begun the entirely open ended adventure is presented to you. You have full command over the person YOU want to be. Do you want to be an honest man of the people? Skilled with a number of weapons, but only willing to draw on those who deserve it. A vicious psychopath? One who detests guns and craves blood with his bare hands. A free peace loving care free individual? Whom always uses their medicinal substances with the utmost responsibility of course. You can even play as a mentally damaged individual, struggling through day to day life and conversation in the wasteland if you so choose. Your adventure is unique.Another thing, the writing in this game is superb, and at times, downright hilarious. Just be prepared to do a lot of reading. In essence this game is a text based adventure with an isometric skin on the top. Which brings me to the animations, which are oozing with detail. Holstering weapons, enemy attacks and death animations in particular which always seem bring a smile to my face - although probably for the wrong reasons. Not to fear, it isn't just silent reading with some fancy moving pictures thrown in to keep you entertained. The audio is a real treat. Each settlement you encounter throughout your journey across the wasteland plays host to a unique soundtrack that does wonders for world building. On top of this, some key NPCs have completely voiced dialouge. In a game of this age a cringe fest of audio is to be expected yet you are pleastly surprised when you are treated to an atmospheric soundtrack and wide variety of  excellent voice acting. Seriously, wandering into a new settlement for the first time and being blown away by the diversity in the voiced dialouge is quite entertaining. I could go on about the writing of the questlines and dialouge or numerous amusing allusions to various pop culture icons...But I won't. Becuase this truely open ended experience is just that. An experience. To go on any longer threatens to ruin the magic of the unknown and adventure that is Fallout.			"

												The Fallout world is my favourite fictional world, period. The lore is deep and intelligent, and packed full of interesting characters, concepts, and secrets for the player to learn about and discover. The debut Fallout game itself is a classic RPG by an measure, and one of the best RPGs of the 90s. While not as accessible as the most recent games in the series, Fallout doesn't lack charm and depth, and for those with the patience to tackle a game that's part classic RPG, part adventure game, it holds a wealth of wonderful fiction to discover. However, As much as it was a great achievement in terms of storytelling and world-building, it is a product of its time and thus suffers from some of the problems that plagued both the aforementioned genres in the 90s: clunky UI, an isometric camera that often impedes movement and blocks items and people, combat that relies utterly on chance with little skill involved, unforgiving difficulty for beginner characters, and - worst of all IMO - illogical solutions to problems that can leave unwitting players frustrated. You didn't think to use a radio on that one particular computer? Too bad, buddy, you're stuckFallout 2 is bigger, streamlines some of the technical issues and irons out some unintuitive features, but I think that this is the superior game when it comes to plot, tone, and narrative. The fantastic voice acting from some great performers coupled with the driving storyline really draws you in and makes you feel like there is something real at stake. The narrative and the world really are the game's strongest features. Complaints aside, I do recommend that any fan of the Fallout series commit some time to discovering this game, and delving deeper into the world of Fallout.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Fallout is a isometric, free roam, turn based (combat only), role playing game. I found to be a great game, although yes it is dated and hasn't aged well in graphical terms. The content and story I found great and enjoyed every minute.Considering its release date of 1997, it still is overall a brilliant game, anyway let me explain myself.The Game PlayBefore you start on your journey you are able to create a character. With various options and choices related to a point based skill system, that is also commonly used in the later fallout games.After character creation you are put in the shoes of a dweller of vault 13, sent out into the desolate wastelands save the vault.DifficultyThe difficulty of the game is, let's say unforgiving if you are unprepared. I must admit I died quite a few times walking into places I didn't belong or starting fights with bigger stronger characters.Hopefully you will find your demises just as funny as I found mine. (Save regularly)In the options you can set the difficulty of the games combat system in your favour. I left this at a default state to enjoy the game as it was intended.Controls & InterfaceI cannot say I am a fan of the control system but for the age of the game I can see why the controls were done in this way. Although once you get the hang of them it become straight forward.First of all they are a little hard to get use to as there is no definitive tutorial and is based on a left click and right click system with a hold function, the keyboard is not necessarily required.The inventory system is simple and works well, although for future games I hope to see much more functionality. It uses a drag and drop system with hold click as well.AchievementsThis game has no steam achievements. Which I think increased my enjoyment of the game.StoryThe plot of the story I found to be great as it gets you stuck in straight away. By giving you a lengthy time limited quest to save the people of your vault right away gives you a sense of urgency. I found the main quests and side quests fun which kept me coming back for more. The ending I found was very fitting and I hope anyone who plays through the game enjoys it as much as me.Combat System The combat is turn based, with each turn you have action points (AP) relating to how much agility you have including traits that can give you extra AP's for a turn. What you do in combat is up to you although everything will have a cost of AP you could if you fancy shoot your own allies or miss the enemy and accidently vaporise your ally.Skills & TraitsEvery time you level up you get to put points into certain skills and every three levels you can choose a trait, not counting the two you can choose on character creation.I chose traits and skills on how I wanted to build my character some of them you will find useful and some you won't. Try saving before hand to test ones out. So you're not stuck with something you don't find useful.Sounds  & EffectsDue to the age of the game the sounds are still pretty decent and fitting for the wasteland environment.GraphicsThe graphics although dated for game that came out in 1997 are still pretty good, although trying to find items on the floor can be a little challenging.Cut ScenesThe cut scenes, death scenes and endings are great, although dated now I still enjoyed them.Humour & TriviaI liked the games humour and spent a good few hours on the fandom wiki. I liked that Dogmeat is a reference to Madmax 2 which was completely unexpected.Woof!Game UtilitiesBe careful the game does not offer a auto save function so any vault dweller must be extra careful before taking important actions. Whether it is stealing from or killing an innocent civilian or starting a fight with a super mutant.You may end up quite dead.MultiplayerThis game is single player only and does not contain any multiplayer. Although you can hire non player characters (NPC's) as mercenaries to follow you around on missions. Which is highly useful so long as you don't accidentally shoot them instead of your enemies. Bugs - ImportantUnfortunately fallout has a tendency to crash at random times which I presume is based on the fact it was not meant to run on newer versions of windows.So vault dwellers I recommend you save regularly.Also be wary of tabbing out, many have reported not being able to get back into the game although the game seems minimised. This not necessarily true hover down in the left hand corner above the task bar and you will find an invisible box click it and should maximise fallout.ConclusionOverall I found this game very fun to play, par the minor crashes and issues with tabbing out. This game may be dated by modern game standards.I personally think this is a fantastic game and hopefully never forgotten, if you ever have the chance to play and you have played any of the fallout games I strongly recommend you play this one.Hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												The Fallout Series has always been a favorite of mine. When I first played Fallout 1, I sucked so much at it. (Although this can be traced back to the fact that I actually didn't play very many turn based games) At times I would stop playing due to its difficulty, but after a while you get the hang of it. My suggestion would be if you like old school turn based RPG's that can be a challenge, definitely buy this game. The story is fantastic and the gameplay is fun yet challenging. The only complaints would be the few bugs here and there as well as the ending. There's nothing wrong with the ending itself, its just that after you beat the game you cannot continue with your save. Kinda sucks, but other than that the game is flawless. It will always be one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												Legendary role-playing game with very sophisticated turn-based battle system and supreme universe of dark age after nuclear war.And, finally, it is working properly on Steam, with convenient High Res fix, which was really needed!I remember buying the game 2 years back, and it was without that fix back then. So it was lost for many players, until some wizardry wind (probably from GOG galaxy), turned this game alive once more. Now it is more stable and reliable on Windows 7 and upper, than Fallout 3.Another fix I've noticed from my previous experience - they cut all kids from the game, so you can't kill them and become child killer now. Good thing, even if it is a restriction for somebody role-playing a maniac. There are too many of them around us already.What else can I say? The game is a must-have for any real fan of true role-playing games and tough turn-based fights. It is much better than all three new Shadowrun games, in scenario, in combats, and overall complexity.Multiplicity of choices on every step, and various consequences for every step you'll made. Very clever opponents, even overpowered for modern casual players. And that unforgettable feeling of frontier, with that leather armor from old Mad Max on your shoulders.An essence of western role-playing games. 10/10 mark, as goes with all golden bars of gaming in my collection.

												Great things often have small beginnings, the saying goes. In terms of scale and playtime, the original Fallout is very small compared to all the sequels that followed it. But greatness can be measured in different ways: a large scale is worthless when packed with lifeless characters and repetitive quests; playtime means nothing when the story is stretched thin. What made Fallout great was that it defined itself first and foremost as A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, and it didn't try to be anything more than that. Instead it excelled as a pure cRPG, one of the greatest in the most prolific decade of the genre.I say all this as a player wearing no nostalgia goggles. By the time Fallout reached my country in the 90s it's likely that Fallout 2 was out already. As a teenager, my English was very rudimentary at the time and when I tried it for the first time I was put off by its difficulty and complexity. Besides, I was too busy trying to beat Half-Life (what a time to be alive!) and wasting time on Counter-Strike. So I only played both Fallout and Fallout 2 properly much later, and I experienced the same frustration with the UI and the mechanics that any contemporary player will experience. And I still maintain that it is one of the greatest RPGs ever made.What makes a great RPG? Above all the possibility of multiple solutions to solve a quest or puzzle. There are many other factors, obviously: a well-written story with lifelike NPCs; choices and consequences with a pervasive sense of reactivity; a mechanically rich roleplaying system; a fair yet challenging combat gameplay, and so on. Fallout has all of these things and more, but if you strip the RPG genre down to its bare essentials, it all comes down to the fact that some players will try one solution and some other solutions, and the game should be able to accommodate all of them in a way that is seamless and fair in its outcomes. And that's where Fallout excels at.Coupled with this is perhaps one of the most interesting fictional universes ever created. The worldbuilding of the Fallout universe is nearly mythical in its grand scale and minute details. You couldn't call it realistic, since it's supposed to be slightly silly with its 1950s pulp science fiction style, but even within these limitations the developers aspired to create a world that is lifelike in its mock-realism, from the NPC interactions to the specious scientific language, and everything else in the game as a whole.The aesthetic of the Fallout universe is also of note. It's the Divergence[fallout.wikia.com] that allows such an odd combination of elements to merge into a coherent whole: the 1950s aesthetic, Googie architecture, space age atmosphere, Populuxe culture, Raygun Gothic style, Jazz music, Cold War atomic hysteria... Or simply Atompunk, as some critics named it, one of the many subgenres of Cyberpunk. And Fallout is its one and only representative, since it is almost impossible to replicate.Fallout 2 is often touted as the superior of the original games, being bigger and somewhat improved in mechanics, more complex and adult, and full of whacky moments and peculiar details. But Fallout remains purer, more substantial and mysterious, a fictional universe rife with possibilities that its creators themselves didn't understand in its entirety. And it's precisely this kind of fictional universe that transcends and expands the role and scope of art and storytelling, bordering on myth; becoming an ongoing collaboration that spans across years, decades, encompassing the minds of several artists, writers, visionaries, instead of remaining trapped in the bounds of a single mastermind. Fallout is one such fictional universe, having undergone perhaps the most drastic mutations over the years and still remaining a great series, however marred by inconsistencies and streamlining.This is not a game most players will love. It's now twenty years old and it shows: it's very dated, it requires some tweaking and plenty of getting used to its UI and mechanics. Most players will be put off by its difficulty and struggle to build a character that can survive the wasteland. Most will not see the multitude of possible solutions and approaches and stick to the violent paths that often have the poorest outcomes. Most will not see the forest for the trees and will fail to understand how rich in possibilities the Fallout universe was from the start. But those of us who do, those of us who persevere and explore it carefully... we are the happy few. We have witnessed the monstrous birth of one of the most popular series in the games industry, and we understand what it could and should have been from the start.			"

												An amazing isometric RPG with a post-apocalyptic theme, Fallout has become one of my go-to games when in need of a serious RPG nostalgia trip. The series is my favourite series of all time, for good reasons.Pro's:+ Amazing depth, with interesting skills and perks, making for awesome character development.+ Fantastic story with multiple endings, and long/short ways to achieve those endings.+ Engrossing world with interesting characters, quests and background stories to really set the mood of the wasteland.+ Steam edition includes some nice UI touches with the widescreen mod built-in.+ Combinations of points 1 & 2 make for exceptional replayability with different characters each time.Con's:- Unforgiving (Not really a con to me as I enjoy the challenge) Daunting for new RPG players unfamiliar with the genre.- Still some minor bugs present throughout the years.- Some redundant perks that can seem good at first pick and then become useless.

												War. War never changes.The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower.But war never changes.In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth.In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground Vaults. Your family was part of that group that entered Vault Thirteen. Imprisoned safely behind the large Vault door, under a mountain of stone, a generation has lived without knowledge of the outside world.Life in the Vault is about to change.			"

												Really amazing game. I have always enjoyed the fallout series. In my opinion 1 is the best game in the series while 2 is the second best, though i have not played any 2 on steam yet i have on my old computer with the fallout collection disc. Anybody who is willing to put some effort into it because there is somewhat of a learning curve should buy this game. For my builds i usually use the gifted and bloody mess perk's, Then max out int agi and per. that build along with tagged skills in Small guns for earlier parts of the game, energy weapons for later on, and speech to exploit some really useful stuff should get you through the game with flying colors if you know what you are doing. Over all i give it 10/10 its one of the best games of all time.			"

												""War. War never changes."" - Fallout NarratorFallout 3 was most likely your first introduction to the Fallout series, I know it was for me. That game came out in 2008 though. So, because of that you might not want to go back and play a game from 1997, a game, that is very different from the one that came out in 2008. I get it.I still urge you to pick this old gem up and give it a try. Yeah, it might be a bit dated and tough to go back to the archaic 90s gameplay of the past, but it's still an amazing game that can offer you a fantastic narrative experience, and great insight on the origins of this franchise from it's original developer Interplay Entertainment.If you are a true fan of this series, you owe it to yourself to go back and experience the story of the original game.9/10: ""A cult classic video game that started one of the best RPG franchises in gaming.""

												Very few games do what Fallout 1 does.Very few games let you play the entire campaign without firing a single shot or killing a single creature. Fallout 1 doesVery few games manage to tell a meaningful dark story while also making you laugh at jokes and references. Fallout 1 does.Very few games capture the table top rpg experience without losing much during the transition to video game. Fallout 1 does.Very few games provide a level of replayability that the experience is still exciting years later. Fallout 1 does.Fallout 1 gets so many things right it quickly becomes clear why it overshadowed the very material it was based upon. It has so many short comings and problems and graphically it doesn't stand the test of time as well as other games but to the individual who is willing to take the time to learn the systems and get involved in the world the game offers up will have the potential to lose many hours and restful sleeps as you always want to go on one more adventure or try something in a different way.The game is a true role playing experience, to enjoy it for what it offers you need to become less of a power gamer and instead focus on rolling with the punches and taking leaps of faith as you forge the story and personality of your character. You need to become the person who enjoys reading text and develop a love for turnbased combat. Fallout 1 isn't for everyone and coming here from fallout 3-current is going to be jarring and difficult for some, and that is alright, but it is worth the money and time to at least give it a chance as the game rewards you with an experience no other game really has matched.The steam version of this game runs fine on modern hardware with little to no setup however installing the fan made community patch 'Fallout Fixit"" will make your experience far less buggy, crash prone, balanced, and clean.I could not recommend fallout enough and it is easily in my top ten games of all time.

												""Get the vault a new water chip? How hard can it be?""*while travelling to Vault 15*You stumbled into a pack of radscorpions""Ok I'll just kill them with this 10MM pistol""4 turns later I'm dead10/1011/07/16I'm going to write an *actual* review now. Fallout is an amazing example of an RPG. It sets up the atmosphere and look of a world scorched by nuclear fire amazingly. The game hits the ""Post apocalyptic desert"" right on the head. There's no plant life, water, anything of that sort. As a first in a series it is a good solid foundation for the next game in the series, Fallout 2. You are able to completely design your character, there's no backstory of your character given to you. (I'm looking at you Fallout 4) All the game says to you is: You live in a Vault. That's it. You can be the second coming of Jesus, or Satan incarnate. Also most dialouge options will follow a forumla and you'll be given 4 or sometimes more choices. These are:Yes, I will do ____No, I will not do ____Say something that pisses the NPC off, failing the quest.Say something that causes the Super Mutants to find your Vault more easily. (Yes I borrowed this from another review but it works so)This game is the second best in the series, bested by only it's sequel Fallout 2. It is truly a 10/10 game.			"

												You know. I've not played much of this game. I mean, 34 hours isn't just something I did on my lunch break. But it's not hundreds of hours like I've put into other games. But honestly, I find that to be a good thing. Fallout left me satisfied. I felt full after eating this meal. I didn't want to go back and have seconds to fill myself up. My one singular adventure was enough for me to be happy. That's something that this game captured that only Fallout 2's been able to capture in the Fallout series for me so far. I've put a lot of hours into the other games. 3, NV, 4. And that's because for as great or terrible as they may be, I'm still left with a grumbling stomach. Really, that's why I recommend this game, because I'm sure that after one playthrough you'll feel full for a while and want to reflect on the meal you've just had, and not go back for seconds the second you finished it like with many other games.

												Summary: Post-apocalyptic isometric turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 20 hrsCards: NoCloud: YesYep. Still good after nearly 20 years. Fallout presents a world that has been devastated by the nuclear apocalypse. Underground containment facilities known as Vaults house the last remnants of humanity and the battle for survival has begun.Fallout uses a hex-grid isometric turn-based combat system. Combat blends seamlessly into its map system, much like games made with the Infinity Engine. It's a fun system, but there's only one problem I have with it - everything takes its turn one at a time. This becomes problematic when there's 20 things on the screen and you spend more time watching the computer make its moves compared to your single move. If there was a way for all NPCs to take their turn at the same time, that'd be a vast improvement. For the most part the game aged well. The steam version includes tweaks to help it run on modern systems, which helps immensely. The chat interface is still rather confining, but you get used to it. There's a lot of freedom in Fallout.  I have an unhealthy obsession with making and optimizing new characters to suit my play style. You can gun down friend and foe alike, devastate entire towns, and still complete the game. Even though there doesn't feel like there's a lot of quests, Fallout actually takes a fair amount of time to get through without speedrunning. But I can sum up why we love the game - Power Armor. After mowing down hordes of raiders while wearing naught but leather, it's satisfying to procure the ultimate badass protection in the land. Oh yessss. And you can reinforce it for good measure!Fallout will likely remain among my favorites for years to come. Being able to create new character concepts and impose new challenges upon myself, I will happily play the game yet again in ten more years. I rate this a 9/10.			"

												Hey folks! thought I would give Fallout a quick little review rundown. Over the last few days, I have done nothing but play this game. It really kept me wanting to get to the end of it and see what had happened to the settlements I had worked with. What works about 'Fallout' is it starts off with a time limit for you to get a water chip so it starts off seeming really restrictive, Not soon after did I realize that went away when you get the water chip and I must have had around 1,000,000 random encounters through the entire game (obviously I'm exaggerating) Iook, I loved this game but I had a ton of issues with crashes and irritation from just how hard the game really was (not a bad thing at all:P) 'Fallout' is a game like no other and is different from other Fallout games for countless reasons. Looking back at it now for a 1997 game, what you see is what you get and what you get is awesome. Another thing that works in the game is the story and dialogue goes so deep it's ridiculous, you can tell how many playstyles the developers expected different people to go through. And high praise needs to go to the scary♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack for the game. Listenening to the Boneyard and Necropolis music in this just made me neither cry of fright. It's done so well. Just be warned. You might not exactly enjoy this game, it's an old game and takes some getting used to but for me well I play old games all the time! Fallout is near perfect and future Fallout games should pay more attention to this one.			"

												Fallout is one of those games that you just never forget. It's world and storyline just sticks with you and becomes part of the basis on which you judge all other games. It is a game that changes all of your preconceptions of how an RPG should play out. What is good? What is evil? Fallout is a game that ask you what is most important, the intention to do good or the end result being good despite the intention. Nothing is simply black and white and nobody's actions are simple.Fallout starts out simple enough, you are a Vault Dweller. Living beneath the earth sheltered from the nuclear devastation above you have never had to worry much about anything until now. Your vault's water chip has failed and there is no spare on hand so the Overseer, the supreme ruler of the vault, nominates you to be the first person ever to leave vault and go forth and procure a new water chip.As you leave the vault and begin to travel the outside wasteland you quickly find that you are not the only survivors in this post-apocalyptic world. Other vaults and just plain resourceful people have managed to build communities and the world is rebuilding, for the most part. As you travel around to these communities and their inhabitants question your sanity as you question them about vault's and water chips you quickly realize that a greater threat looms in the horizon, one that neither you nor your vault can ignore for long.Fallout is an isometric with turn based combat, you can recruit companions along the way but the lack of any direct control over them makes them rather suicidal, or in the case of the ones using burst weapons, makes you rather suicidal. The combat is not particularly brilliant but works well enough that you won't get annoyed with it until many playthroughs in.You advance your character using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system, ""Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck"", and have a multitude of skills to help you along the way. Many of the skills are non-combat related and having high skills or stats can open up new conversation options and previously unseen ways of completing quests and objectives. Most notable is the low intelligence options. While having a low intelligence, and thus very low skills, will close off most of the normal options for you throughout the game it will also create unique dialog and options with nearly every character in the game making it an experience worth a playthrough all on it's own.Fallout's open and extremely non-linear world, it's superb writing and storyline, it's strong and memorable characters and it's unique take on morality makes it one of the best gaming experiences around, worth a play even today.It is a game that challenges your perceptions of grey and your perceptions of RPG's. As you travel through the wasteland you'll find greed, hatred, joy and sadness and you'll get to chose to help or hurt, just not always in the way you expected. You'll see things of pleasure and things of pain and you'll get to choose your own way through every challenge as you brave the wilderness of a post-apocalyptic world.In the end you will find that your ally is truth, your enemy is a desire to do good and your only hope for victory is tragedy...Buy it if you don't already own it. Play it if you do.			"

												This is it. The beginning of the Fallout franchise. And what a beginning it was.Fallout (along with its sequel, Fallout 2, and the spinoff Fallout Tactics to an extent) is an isometric, turn-based cRPG. The main premise of Fallout is surviving in a heavily destroyed post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear warfare. The post-apocalyptic setting of Fallout is influenced greatly by other forefathers of the post-apocalyptic genre in fiction, most notably the Mad Max films and Wasteland, the video game. Interestingly enough, Fallout established itself as an immense influence in the genre not long after the game's release, becoming an iconic flagship of the setting for years to come.The game uses a top-down perspective, and characters can move in six directions, within a hexagonal grid. Combat in the game is based on using this grid-based movement system to move your character around the battlefield, and attack/do other actions using action points. Each character is granted a limited number of action points (AP) per turn, and when their AP runs out, the turn ends, and the enemy party is allowed to act. Fallout's combat system places a large emphasis on planning and forethought, and also on smart and informed character building. Fallout is apparently well-known for its difficulty, and although I disagree with it being a particularly hard game, it may still be difficult for new players to get into because of the depth of the gameplay mechanics, and how relatively badly they're documented within the game itself. While I by no means want to imply that Fallout is cryptic, there are still plenty of things within this game that are tougher for new players to grasp. The game has no real tutorial, and some of the menus are cluster♥♥♥♥s to navigate, resulting in the game taking a while to learn how to play fluently.Albeit the combat of the game is relatively simple, (you can move, open menus/your inventory, attack, and do aimed attacks) the combat system is extremely good, and also incredibly satisfying, especially when it goes your way. Probably one of the best I've ever experienced in a cRPG, in fact. The combat does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it very well, and can even be exploited by players that were careful with their character's build to get great benefits, like being able to get immense criticals by aiming at specific enemy body parts (Rat was critically hit in the eyes for 666 hit points, blinding the unlucky creature. Rat was killed.) or being able to attack more times per turn by stacking AP properly. Fallout encourages powergaming heavily, and greatly rewards players that are experienced in the game.Fallout's combat is not without its flaws, however. There is at times a frustratingly heavy emphasis on RNG, the best example of which being how the player's chance to hit is always capped at 95%, regardless of their skill in the weapon/other factors. This leaves a window for the player to be able to miss, no matter how ridiculous the circumstances. There is also a rather obscure critical failure mechanic, where if your skill in something is too low (or even if it's high enough) you'll ♥♥♥♥ up on that specific action so hard that you'll break what you're trying to do. Sometimes in combat you'll lose a turn or even break your weapon. While this mechanic was probably meant to make the gameplay more dynamic, it only truly results in making it more frustrating for players, and usually leads to players saving exceedingly often to pad themselves against the game's inherent unpredictability.The game is relatively short by RPG standards, usually lasting around 20-30 hours for most (non-completionist) players, but has an enormous amount of content. While a skilled and dedicated player can beat the game in under an hour if they wish to, there is nothing stopping you from tackling on Fallout's great many side-quests and encounters. There is a heavy emphasis in this game on quality over quality, and it shows, as every event in the game is unique and there is pretty much no copy-pasted filler content.All in all, Fallout is an iconic RPG, in great part shaping both the genres of modern post-apocalyptic fiction, and that of role-playing games, and is heavily befitting of being called a true classic. If you consider yourself a fan of role-playing games and haven't played this, you seriously need to. If you consider yourself a fan of Fallout games and haven't played this, you seriously need to get out.The darkness of the afterlife is all that awaits you now. May you find more peace in that world than you found in this one... "

From the very beginning with the hauntingly beautiful intro, to the very end with the greatest tragedy of the fallout universe, I personally see this as having one of the best tones in any video game. The gameplay may not appeal to some, but if you haven't heard of or seen the end of this game yet, play it. It's worth it.			"

												It almost feels blasphemous to say anything bad about a classic like this that people have always held in such high regard but the truth us its A decent enough game but definitely overrated and not just because its mechanics show their age. The visuals suck and the interface is clunky and cumbersome. It can be easy to miss items/NPCs/doors because of how they blend into the background share the same sprite as others or just The isometric view just being awkward . Locations can feel plain and dull. Companions are just an annoyance to trap you in a corner or shoot you in the back. Every settlement is completely anal about you putting your weapon away. Conversation checks are invisible (speech checks etc) so you won't know when you use them. Most skills are next to useless. It always felt like I had more to sell than shopkeepers could ever buy off me. There are some good and comical lines in conversations. Combat is Turn based fun and bloody/gore and critting super mutants in the eyes with a good plasma rifle never got old. V.A.T.S lets you aim for the eyes or private areas. Random encounters are dangerous to fun or funny or WTF lol. You can sometimes play multiples ways doing some quests such guns blazing or use stealth or tricks but these are not always obvious such as wearing robes for disguise or using the radio on force field signals. The setting feels right for what it is. The Voiced NPC's are voiced well. People recommend  you to save alot and this is true. But is this a good thing ? Punishments can be severe and situations do happen like a towns guards will try to kill you and your find out another time it was because something like you didn't put your gun away or killing someone in self defence can cause a town to be hostile/or ban you. Some people will like this but most people are just going to reload. Choices are good when done well. Later Fallout games you take responsibility for your actions still but give you more options for the aftermath. Alot of Fans of later Fallout games will naturally be interested to see what the earlier games are like. While you may love or hate them they are difficult to compare as they are very different. The biggest thing being perhaps an Isometric vs a FPS Style and for me I prefer the FPS style, I find it alot more immersive and fun too. One thing that could be shared is the dialogue. You have the voiced conversations and the choices of what to say be polite or not or funny.(Fallout 4 being the boring exception here) You also have the Extra type NPC's who just stand around saying their one liners just like later games.Another thing shared is the Lore and if nothing else people can may pick up some background info on the Fallout Lore and have a chance in some form to visit alot of the places and NPC's that are mentioned in later games. Many other things feel very different because its like comparing two different games an old isometric game vs a modern FPS RPG with a few hints and references that your in the same world. Overall Fallout 1 Is a good game but it has to be taken from a different approach to the later games.  Personally I would love to see Fallout 1 & 2 in the New vegas engine but most likely won't ever happen sadly.			"

												Being a fan of Fallout since Fallout 3, I've played New Vegas and Fallout 4 and loved them. But I wanted more. I wanted to know the roots, the lore, where it all began.Non serious spoilers ahed I picked up this game along with Fallout 2 and Tactics on sale. When I first played this, I got to Vault 15 and it told me that I had to look somewhere else to find the chip. I was like no way and put the game down for a few months. About a week ago I decided to pick it back up again and I started a new game and played it from start to finish, getting my good ending, completing a whole ton of shi* and quests. This game is fantastic, a classic. Quite the roleplaying game. A good change of pace from the newer fallouts, and it makes me happy. Seriously, give this game a try and play it until you get the hang of it, and don't just put it down because you don't understand it. Play it until you get the water back to the vault and then you aren't as pressured as badly with time and can do whatever the hell you want in the world.-Love Dakota			"

												Owning this game as a big box PC game, I thought i'd buy the game on Steam to see if it still holds up today.Spoiler: It Does.Fallout is a very challenging game, especially if you compare it with later installments of the franchise such as Fallout 3 and 4. Don't let the isometric graphics fool you, this game is no cake-walk.From the beginning to end of the game, I was mindblown by the immense detail implemented into the world of Fallout 1, something 3 and 4 wished they could've acheived, 4 more so. Using past experience with the game, I was able to beat the game in around 10 hours, but if you are new to this game, expect this number to increase massively for you. If you are new and playing without a guide, you have balls of steel. People in the Classic Fallout community have acheived crazy things within Fallout 1 such as getting power armor at level 1, and other such things.Overall, Fallout, from 1997, achieves a more immersive role-playing experience than it's 3D counterparts, with the exception of New Vegas, of course.Also, I recommend getting a mod called ""Fallout Fixt"". It basically irons out all of the creases the original release had, such as bugs, and the time limit to find the damn water chip , which was always a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥10/10 - Amazing, immersive experience.

												After replaying this game after about 4-5 years, I have to say it is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. The Fallout universe is so rich and enticing. A lot of people worry they will dislike this game to today's standards because of it's bird's-eye/perspective view, but the story, dialouge, soundtrack, locations, factions and NPCs all come together so well. It is a game you really should not miss out on. If you love the newer Fallout's you should really come back to where it all started.There is so many different character builds you can make to suit your style. It has a solid combat system and level progression feels nice. You truly feel your character get stronger as you increase your level, improve your stats and get new gear. As you progress through the world of Fallout the way you go about your quests truly effects the world. This also effects the end game, as it shows you how you've effected the world and there is many varying endings.Overall this is a fantastic game, if you love Fallout, RPGs, tactical RPGs, stratergy games (To some extent) and games that are story driven, Fallout has it all! 10/10			"

												All I would say to potential new players of the first two fallouts is start with FO1, spend as long as possible in the first area to familiarise yourself with the controls, read the manual, and have a pen and paper to hand...you'll need them to note down the side quests you can go back to in areas previously visited, as there is no journal as such, and there's simply too much to remember, without flooding your brain.With that in place, sit back, enjoy, and realise how much harder games were back in the day!

												It is a somewhat pointless attempt for me to write a review of the first installment of the Fallout series, because I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I have to admit, that I'm a sort of a fanboy of this game (and for some extent of its sequel Fallout 2). This might be my all time favourite video game. I absolutely fell in love with it back in 1997.I love the 50s inspired retrofuturistic post-apocalyptic RPG setting. I love the character and combat systems. The overall graphics and especially the brutal ultra-violent death animations still please me. I absolutely love Mark Morgan's ambient soundtrack that reminds me of Aphex Twin's album ""Selected Ambient Works Volume II"". The player can approach quests multiple ways depending on the character stats. The consequences of player's actions affect the whole Wasteland. The choices really feel like they matter. This truly feels like playing a RPG.I admit there are some major technical limitations and some frustrating stuff throughout the game (Thanks Ian, for blasting me into a bloody mess with the SMG once AGAIN!), but the Fallout's awesomeness tops all that.If you enjoy this, you'll probably also like Fallout 2 even though I find it inferior to its predecessor for screwing up the setting at some parts. (I can't recommend the other sequels and spinoffs, because I haven't played them.)But yeah, I really recommend this! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!			"

												I am someone who started the Fallout series with Fallout 3 when it came out, I then proceded to buy Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 4 and I love the series, but after beating 4 a couple times I still wanted more so I decided to pick of the Fallout classic collection. I beat Fallout 1 and man was it good, for many reasons.The story starts out with a simple plot but then starts to get exciting later wich I won't spoil, and has some of the most interesting character, some of whom make an apperiance in future tittles, and the one of the best villians in any game to this day. The world was a blast to explore, with interesting places to explore, although not huge like current Fallout games. The character creation was great, and as much as I liked Fallout 4 the leveling system was dumbed down from its predisessors and quite awful, but Fallout 1 has a great leveling system with skills, attributes, perks wich any rpg gamer will love. Also the replay value is high with the ability to join raiders and kill everybody, to the choice to speak your way out of everthing and kill nobody, this game is solid and still lives up to this day. I highly recommend you go purchase this NOW!			"

												Note: Do not attempt to play this if you have played Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas first! Do some research before buying Fallout 1.Where do i begin? You know it is amazing to see how far the Fallout series has gotten. And to think it started out like this. Most Fallout gamers will come to believe it's like the ones you see now.....it isn't. Not even close. Sure it has everything that makes Fallout very well known. But it plays extremely different. The game is two things. Turn based, and RPG. Turn base only happens during combat sequences and the RPG mechanics are completely everywhere. From the ""Character creation"" when you first start it. To the dialouge and choices you make throughout Fallout 1.This game is filled with content and lore that will make your head spin....or to make you rage quit at certain moments. It is best to save often because you will be needing it.....a lot. The skills and SPECIAL sort of works like what you see now. But it handles it a bit differently. My advice, is to do some research on the skills in Fallout 1 and how they work, same goes with SPECIAL. The only negative thing i could say about Fallout 1. Is mainly the Action Point system it's your everything during combat sequences from going into your inventory to choosing between vats mode and what i call ""shootout mode"" (Regular combat).I could've mentioned the story but it's best if you do the research first before buying like i noted in the ""note"" section above. Other than that if you want a blast from the past this game is for you.			"

I strongly reccomend this game to anyone who played the latest Fallout games and enjoyed them, but have not yet tried this one, and to any gamer that simply enjoy amazing RPG games.			"

												be me, playing this game for the first time because i heard it was a great classic. watch opening cutscene, think ""this is pretty good for the late 90's"" actual game pops up.

												This is downright my favorite RPG ever made, but you gotta keep in mind, this game came out in 1997 and all I was doing at that point was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my diapers, I have no nostalgic sentiment for this game and it was in no way colored by idealized childhood memories. When I was younger, my favorite RPGs were KotOR and its sequel, and I sank like 1000 hours in both I'm sure. So I do have nostalgia out the♥♥♥♥♥for those games and I do have idealized memories. I played FO1 for the first time in the 2010s, and the experience is so good it stands up to and even towers over the RPGs I loved as a kid. Nostalgia is a powerful force and if you can beat that, that's a really good sign.The port job here is actually one of the few times I can say the Steam version of an old game is a completely tolerable  version, as Bethesda has come in and spruced up the game with some updates, most importantly adding the ability to use widescreen resolutions. The game runs pretty much fine, and the only real issue I can remember is it may rarely crash, and if you alt tab, the screen will be black but it has this weird thing where you uncover the screen by moving the mouse? I fonud that bringing up the pip boy or skills menu was a quick way to fix that.And the game is excellent, the theming is incredible, the art design is old but holds up amazingly well to the point that the gore in this game will still make you go ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥THO"". It's an amazingly tight experience, the quests are fun and memorable, the characters are fun and memorable with many of them depicted with these talking heads made out of clay or some♥♥♥♥♥♥that look cartoony but still look cool to this day. And the music is some masterpiece level♥♥♥♥♥♥ with this and it's sequel boasting some of the best soundtracks in games ever, and this is before they had the disk space to just borrow 20 songs from the 30s-60s so it features mostly original compositions.I won't spoil anything but I will tell yout hat the lead villain is immediately one of the best in gaming history if not *the* best, the kind that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Andrew Ryan or KotOR 2's easily, but I can't go in to even basic details because spoilers.The game does feature an in-game timer, however this is not something you should be anxious about because your natural pace will probably be more than enough to get you to complete said timer in time, and once you do that you have all the time in the world to explore the world. The only limit from then on is 13 years, but that's a vast amount more than anyone would ever play because even the most slow player would see all the content in the game before that's even close to being over.The controls may be intimidating at first with the classic CRPG interface that we've been distanced from, but trust me, it's not all that hard to learn and most character builds can get through the game fine, Hit, I believe F1, and you can bring up a screen that shows you what everything is and does.I gotta say, from the bottom of my heart, Fallout 1 is an absolute classic gem even by modern day standards. If you're a modern day Fallout fan, a fan of CRPGs, or just a fan of RPGs, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. Seriously, get it.			"

												The very first game of the series that spawned a great franchise. In Fallout, you play as a vault dweller who must save his vault from dying by getting a new water chip. However, you find out that there's more to saving the vault than just a water chip. The game is an isometric turn-based RPG and requires you to use various skills to progress through the game, such as picking locks on doors, bartering with NPC's and taking out various enemies with a wide array of arsenals. This game is nearly perfect, would recommend to anyone that wants to play an older, more challenging RPG games.			"

												I'm not going to bore you with what you already know.  Instead I'll give you my personal evidence that this is a top tier game.  My account says I only played it for 12 minutes, but I can honestly assure you in the least hipsterish way possible, that I probably put in 1000+ hours before many Steam users were born.I have purchased Fallout four times in my life.  The original boxed version when it was new.  Then the regular jewel-case version so I had one to lend to a friend.  Then the double-boxed version when 2 was released and now Steam.  It's simply one of the best games ever made and will likely remain one of the best games ever made, forever.If you ever wanted to know what the New World Order is planning to do with you (most people don't want to know) then check it out.Yeah I wrote this review to finish the stupid Steam sale achievement thingy.. so what?  I know you did it, too.  Don't give me that look.			"

												Fallout is probably one of the most immersive RPG's I've ever played in my entire experience with gaming. For this review I'll divide it into categories of the game and discuss the ""Pros and Cons"". Gameplay Mechanics Fallout's gameplay is entirely dependant on the character that you create. This can vary based on the perks and skills you pick up as you progress through the game. The stats of this game are ""what make you  S.P.E.C.I.A.L "". Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. Strength affects your overall carry weight and melee damage. Perception allows you to have more dialogue options, higher ranged accuracy and the distance in which you encounter random hostilities. Endurance modifies your health, resistance to poison/radiation, healing rate and hit points recieved upon leveling up. Charisma is what affects player interaction between NPC's. This stat will give the player the ability to barter more efficiantly and open up dialogue options. Intelligence allows the player to recieve more skill points upon leveling up, more dialogue options and skills. One thing I should also mention is that characters with very low intelligence are very funny to play as. I reccomend doing so if you want a good laugh. Agility allows the player to have more action points in combat and move faster in game. Lastly, Luck grants players bonuses to accuracy, critical damage chance and the gambling skill of the player. Perks also affect your character to further shape what you ideally want. For example, the perk ""Small Frame"" will give your character enhanced speed and more action points at the cost of strength.Combat in Fallout 1 is turn based. The amount of moves a player has is dependant on action points. Swift characters may have more action points, but could deal little to no damage if that is the only invested skill. Slow, but heavy characters can dish out loads of damage and possibly tank enemies to give companions opportunities of attacking, but can rarely move due to an undeveloped Agility skill. Combat is entirely dependant on what you want (like stated earlier). The various ways it can be shapen into is what gives this game replayability.Various skills such as Barter, Sneak, Lockpick, Doctor, First Aid are the factors that also affect combat. For example, if the player creates a merchant character (someone with high Charisma and Barter) then that player can profit off of NPC's and have access to numerous buffs and expensive items. Characters with high Sneak and Big Guns make great Snipers that pick off enemies and assist companions. Story You play as the Vault Dweller of Vault 13. The Overseer calls you as he needs your assistance in saving the vault. The water purification chip that provides drinking water to the Vault inhabitants is broken. He asks if you can adventure deep into the wasteland to bring back a waterchip and save the Vault. The player is only given 150 days to do so. This is the only information I feel is necessary to give as Fallout 1's story should really be experienced hands on. The only thing I will also mention is that the story will evolve into something more elaborate as you progress. Please, experience it for yourself. It becomes very philosophical. Immersive Factors: Music, Atmosphere, etc. Fallout 1 has an amazing soundtrack. It sets the tone of a dark, morbid post apocalyptic world. It embodies the wasteland that Western America has become. The hatred, emptiness and agony of the people that survived the nuclear destruction is captivated in this soundtrack. Like I said before, experience this for yourself. All I can do is praise it.The setting of this game takes place in the west coast of America. Due to the Great War sand and radiation is all that's left in the world. Throughout the game, you will discover settlements, villages, caves and cults. They're well made artistically and the music compliments them well.The people of Fallout will vary morally. The characters of this game juxtapose nicely as many of them have different interests. You have people seeking to bring justice and law to the wasteland, greedy and power hungry individuals that only care about their self benefit and an elitest group that I do not want to spoil. Overall Rating If you're a fan of RPG's then purchase this game immediately. I can say with utmost certainty that you will enjoy this game. You will be kept immersed and entertained. Let this game also prove that modern graphics aren't what make a game. This was released in 1997 and to this day it still has an incredibly large following.			"

												A raider critically missed me and broke his right leg...Seriously, how can I review this game? It's Fallout 1, yeah it's rough around the edges which Fallout 2 fixes but still. Fallout is a critically claimed success of a game and spiritual successor to Wasteland. I do recommend getting Fallout 2 more then Fallout 1 due to two things! 1. The story plots are not intermingled with each other. Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 have two different stories which means you can play them in a random order. 2. Fallout 2 is more well designed as mentioned, Fallout 1 is a game I will be willing to recommend to those with a few dollars that don't know what to do with it or extreme Fallout fans who played Fallout 3 and 4 but never experienced the classics willing to bear with the awkward rpg controlls!Update: I alt tabbed from Fallout 1 to write this review, forgetting to pause and when I alt tabbed back the Raider killed himself.... How? ♥♥♥♥ed if I know but he is now a gelatinous blood pool on the ground with his limbs just...I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game...			"

												9/10 would barter for again. It's kind of a shame they never made any sequels to this game, but maybe that's for the best. I'm sure that if Fallout became an ongoing series, then by now, it'd be in the hands of a AAA publisher who'd be busy gutting the series one game at a time by replacing the story and dialogue with half-realized trendy gameplay elements, retconning the original game fifty times with every new installment, and leeching off unpaid work by the modding community while simultaneously relying on them to make the games playable to begin with. Yeah, I suppose it could be a lot worse. I can live with the fact that they only ever made one Fallout.			"

												Hello Fellow Wastelanders,This is an incredible game with an incredible storyline! The turn-based game is a classic at this point that has started the legendary Fallout series! The lore of Fallout begins here and continues throughout the whole series so it's most definitely worth playing! Easily one of my favorite games, but don't forget to save or you'll be awfully frustrated! Definitely worth that money, however, if turn based games aren't your cup of tea, you can start the Fallout series from one of the newer series with Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, or Fallout 4. It's definitely worth it, especially if you like playing game series' in order!-Kyle James			"

												Amazing! Better than Fallout 3. Although I did enjoy 3. The Original Fallout’s (1 & 2) have the best storylines by far, and everything in the world makes sense and looks good (as any fan of any original would say). But in Fallout 3, & especially ‘Vegas’ the storylines/people/objects & encounters don’t quite add up to the original Fallout lore, although they look Fallout-ish & say ‘Fallout’ on the tin.Anyway, I played this again recently and it’s amazing how well this game stands the test of time. I’ve bought so many games to try and get that ‘Falloutness’ back, but nothing compares to the original.If you haven’t played the originals but have played Fallout 3 & Vegas. You are MAD denying yourself this experience. "

												A great classic RPG with plenty of charm.I experienced Fallout for the first time after playing the newer installments, and I found the original to be just as impressive in most ways. Fallout tells an interesting story, is housed with a unique environment and compelling characters, and rewards exploration very well. Basically, Fallout excells in the fundamental mechanics of an RPG.If you haven't played through this game from start to finish, you're missing out.			"

												""War... War Never Changes...""War may never change, but this game changed me back in early 1998 when I herd about a game where you could make choices that impact the world around you and do anything you wanted, even shoot up a friendly town.  In the golden age of C-RPGs, Interplay (lead br Brian Fargo, now of InXile) made some of the best RPGs ever to grace any gaming platform and this was one of them.  The Fallout series was progressive for many reason including its gameplay and player choices that impacted the game.  One interesting and frequently overlooked one is that Fallout 2 was the first game where you could marry a person of the same gender... but, lets get back to the game.Closely mirroring many aspects of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, Fallout is set in a desolate post nuclear apocalyptic environmental.  Fallout's dark adult humor, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat system, striking setting, strong narrative, characters and RPG elements are among far to numerous reasons to mention why Fallout was a not just a great and immersive RPG, but an amazing experience for any gamer playing it at the time... and it's still a trip now if you don't mind the dated graphics.  Although, it won't be quite as shocking as it was at the time and it doesn't have as much to do as a modern open world RPG, it's important to keep in mind this was released in 1997.Maybe it's a bit nostalgic to say, but Fallout isn't just a amazing game, it's a piece of gaming history for influencing all the other games in the genre that followed it and all of the people who played it.You can beat the game without ever firing a single shot or dropping a single body... but I highly recommend selecting ""Bloody Mess"" and taking your weapon of choice and creating as much pixelated carnage as possible because, well, the wasteland won't show you any mercy and you might as well have some fun before Ian inevitably shoots you in the back with an SMG on burst and leaves you to enjoy a premature ""Game Over"" screen... **SPOILERS**Truly 10/10... Would get addicted to nuka cola, not return Tandi to her home and instead keep her with me, never give Ian a knife and shoot him myself first with a modified plasma rifle before he can ""accidently"" kill me, beat a super computer at chess, have brain surgery to raise my intelligence and surgeory to make me sexier, steal parts to build power armor from an organization trying to rebuild humanity's technology, have a K9 companion follow me through the wastes, and have a critical failure that unloads my weapon when fighting the final battle at the worst possible time again... and again... and again... and again...P.S.  If you beat the game with ""Bloody Mess"" you treated to an extended (but brief) and totally fitting ending.  Also, look into getting some great mods.  Enjoy!			"

												I Love fallout so i knew i had to go and play the original fallout. I tried to stay open minded since its the first game and probably not the best but overall its a good game. The story is somewhat small but the Side quest keep you going. For some reason my game crash a few times during my whole playthrough so when I finnally beat the ending boss so that annoyed me. I think this game has more of a RPG element then fallout 3 and new vegas, with more choices and way to do stuff. The game does not assist you on quest. You'll have to think of solutions yourself, which had me stuck at times during the game. but still Great game if you want to learn more of the lore			"

												It's a really good game.  At first you won't like it at all.  I reccomend you go to prefrences and turn combat speed to fastest, because if you don't you are going to have a very slow, slow time.  Do not quit playing the game before you play 2 or more this.  Also look up guides before you start this.  I reccomend putting Strength to 6 than when you get the power armor it will add +4 to strength.  Also if you want the combat to go even more faster, try to max out your agilty to get more Action Points.  THIS IS NOTHING LIKE FALLOUT 3 AND NEW VEGAS!  I'm tired of people saying ""It's nothing like Fallout 3 and New Vegas.""  Of course it wasn't! It was made by diffrent developers! Do your research about it before you buy it.			"

												War, war never changes...An amazing game that stands up to the test of time. This is one of the best roleplaying games out there. It came as close as possible to being a pen-and-paper experience - with the ability to craft your own character the way you *want*, without choices being forced on the player. There are a few quirks in the system, and it's certainly not as big as the sequel, but the non-linearity, interesting plot and backstory make up for it. Try this game as soon as possible - you won't be disappointed.			"

												I actually had fun playing this. There was lots of settlements and other places to explore. The story is great, the soundtrack is phenominal for its time. But as you know, every game has a negative aspect to it. One of them is that combat and getting from point a to be is extremely tedious and it's a little tough being patient with it. I get it, there is some strategy to this and some people like that, and some people like me don't. Probably the reason why I don't like it is because I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this game so it's tough getting used to. The second thing is that you don't have the choice to walk away from a fight and the game just forces you to fight even though you don't really want to. But these issues are minor. Another thing that really catches my attention are the hilarious face models. There is a really funny easter egg in the game that when you click on credits in the menu and type ""boom"". It will show the creator of the games head being exploded. Anyhow, I give this game a B. Although this game is a little too similar to Wasteland (A game that the creator worked on as well) I would reccomend playing Fallout 2 more.			"

However controversial it can be at times, it’s more than apparent that Fallout is a game that was made with a lot of love and I can tell you that more than fifteen years on it still shows.Here is one of the most fondly loved titles that developer Black Isle ever put out (the other being Planescape Torment), Fallout is a role playing game set in a post apocalyptic United States seeped in Fifties retro futurism and Cold War Americana.With its rather drab palette of colours, eerie ambient music and simplistic combat, you’d think Fallout to be a false prophet at first glance but that’s before you’ve experienced the writing. Every NPC you chat with and almost every action you take in-game is accompanied by strings of incredibly well written text that develop the game’s setting much further than its meager appearance would might usually allow.This is a one-of-a-kind series that redefines what a mature and well written RPG really is.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												It's... it takes some fortitude to get used to this game. Players today aren't used to the old control schemes of the old days, so a little bit of fiddling around in how to properly control stuff is suggested, as well as reading the manual that comes with the game. There's no tutorial to explain controls or concepts, which is why I'm suggesting that you do your research or you won't know what the hell you're doing.This game actually has a ton of problems, almost feeling like an early access title. I can't quite recall all the things I had trouble with it, but I would definitely call this a buggy experience w/ unbalanced gameplay. However, the game is pretty straightforward once you figure out what the game's rules are and use that to your advantage.Personally, I prefer the sequel to this game because it feels like a cleaner experience, but I still recommend playing this game just to see what it was like back when Fallout was just getting started.

You have to figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself.The story and lore for 1 and 2 is in my opinion is the best in the series and you will be really missing out if you don't ever get to experience it in it's glory and once you finish the game the fact that it is so difficult will give you a sense of accomplishment like none of the later games can.Also it's got a real Mad Max feel to it, like everything is just a little off and it's not just because things got nuked a while back.

												Beyond the nuclear wasteland, after the bombs fell many years ago. This game is one of the classic RPGs before this became a franchise years later. The story is interesting but I'll give a little spoiler alert, you left the underground shelter known as vaults, the known vault as... Vault 13. Your quest for this vault is locating a new Waterchip after the old one broke down. The vault needs it or else everyone will die in Vault 13 due to lack of water. To be simple, this game has time limit. All you have to do is focus on completing the main quest. You have plenty of time by completing side quests to level up, get better gear and such. Your choices will depend on endings for whatever actions you do that is good or bad. I'll recommend this game for it's soundtrack, story, gameplay and other sorts you like. One of the classics you'll enjoy.			"

												Fallout 1This game is a classic cRPG for a reason, And very good one, The game holds up extremely well even today.Fallout 1 makes you a vault dweller, Someone who has to save his/ her Vault. The game starts you out very humbly, A lowly weak character fighting rats to get out of the cave that holds you're Vault, But soon you'll find a town, Some friends, And some weapons. Once you begin to figure out the game, You start to get your hands on more information, and more weapons, This game does a great job at pacing this. One of the biggest reasons you'll end up enjoying the game is because of how rich the world is, Every faction has purpose. You don't feel like the only important character, Infact most places would survive with or without you. It helps a lot in making you feel like a character in a world, Instead of the hero of the wastes that is the only one who can solve problems. The combat in the game is probably the weakest aspect of the game but for what it is, It works fine. The has some fun moments with the luck element. Characters use AP during each turn, To ethier move, shoot, reload, or go into inventory, and at the end of each turn, Your AP refreshes. The system itself is fine, except the maximum combat speed for the game isn't as fast as you'd like when you have 12 people or more in a fight. Usually the game keeps fights to numbers under 10 except for special moments which are fun, just hope you don't have to reload. Also the AI can be frustating to say the least at times. Getting hurt and running away into more trouble, or just being in the way, But for the most part they do their jobs and they do them fine.The Dialogue system will also give you a lot to work with, And A lot to enjoy. The dialogue system in this game is one of the best and most interesting parts of this game, You couldn't get so invovled in the world if you couldn't learn anything about it. Thankfully you have a ton of characters to talk to, learn from,  joke with, or insult in all manner of ways, Just be smart enough. The game's dialogue system is incredibly deep. You can't just say the ""right"" thing to a character, You need to think about their character and argue to what they would want to hear, Telling a evil man he's evil won't do much, But asking him to stop for something might. It makes you feel think, And makes you feel more invovled in the wasteland.Overall Fallout 1 still holds up as one of the best RPGs you can get on a PC, If you are a fan of oldschool games, Fallout, Table top RPGs, or just classic great games, You should have Fallout 1 and 2. This game is worth every cent you could possibly throw at it.			"

Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game like none other. Well, except for its sequels.If you're like me and had only ever played the modern Fallout's; loved those, but are tentative about the classics for their age and intimidating design, you probably should be. That doesn't, however, excuse you from playing the original Fallout, because it's a god-damn masterpiece as far as narrative and roleplaying are concerned; two things you should care about immensely as a Fallout fan. The experience of playing this game while knowing vast swathes of the lore due to Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 (kinda) gave me such a close, but surreal connection to this game; it was as though the lore I knew was being brought to life in a way that shouldn't have been possible, because I'd always viewed Fallout's narrative as just that, lore. It's not though. The legend of the Vault Dweller is real, and it’s tangible.It's been almost 90 years since the Great War; when the world was plunged into nuclear chaos fighting over the last drops of energy on Earth. Your ancestors were lucky enough to escape the apocalypse however, taking shelter in Vault 13, an impenetrable underground fortress designed to house 1,000 people for dozens, possibly hundreds of years following a nuclear holocaust. Now however, in the year 2161, your vault has a problem. The water chip that regulates the vault's water supply has broken down and can't be repaired, and without a new one Vault 13 will have no more water to keep its residents alive. Thus, with a heavy heart, the vault's overseer tasks the player with venturing into the unknown wastes of California to find a replacement, giving you only 150 days until everyone you know dies of thirst.After the introduction you get to create your character, which is when Fallout really starts. I suggest that you take your time and craft the persona you will be roleplaying as wisely, using your limited knowledge of the game world to decide what type of person you want to be, and what strengths you'd prefer to use while surviving in the ruins of California. No matter how you build your character you won't have an easy time in Fallout, but it'd be most beneficial to pick a skill or two to invest in deeply, and then rely on them as much as possible. A ""well rounded"" character isn't quite achievable, in other words.In the world of Fallout you will find many things, but above all else you will find enthralling and captivating places. There are 13 specific locations to explore to be exact, all of which are cleverly designed, and a depressing pleasure to marvel at in terms of what the world has become. The overbearingly bleak atmosphere of every location in the game is palpable, and represents Fallout perfectly. These devastated places have secrets too, and all of them beg to be discovered...Though I'm actively ignoring many of the more basic parts of Fallout's presentation because I see it as unimportant at this stage in the games lifespan, I'd be remised if I didn't mention the phenomenal ambient music, which is tied to the different locations. In a word, Fallout's soundtrack is timeless, and offers some of the most iconic melodies in gaming history.The distinct characters and factions in Fallout also add a great deal to the world building. Each faction and character exudes the classic Fallout aesthetic, and builds another layer upon the all-important lore this game establishes. Every personality is worth lending your ear to, and many of them will give you pause, either to ponder their importance to the game, or to realize how effectively they grow on you in one way or another.A portion of these places, factions, and people will provide you with quests of course, many of which seem mundane on the surface, but I promise you, almost none of them are. Among their individual themes, they all provide something essential to a roleplaying game; a gameplay-arc that can translate to a character-arc for the person who you have crafted. If you immerse yourself into Fallout effectively (which is incredibly easy), you'll see how this arc (provided by the several quests) is bendable to your own narrative vision, making it another valuable tool in your roleplaying arsenal.Ending off the broad and nearly all-encompassing topic of the games world, I'd like to simply state that there are consequences for your actions, a majority of which can be unforeseen. These mutated wastes will shift with time whether you're there and aware of it, or not. Take great care in all of your choices.Now that I've thoroughly praised the game, I should mention the few problems I do have with it. First and foremost, the turn-based combat is simply not for me. I can't help but be woefully bored during some of the larger combat sequences due to how painstakingly long it can be between the player's turns as 15 other people take theirs as well. You can set combat to play at a faster rate, but then a new problem arises as the system begins to feel unnatural in all of its sped up motions. Even in rare moments where the combat system does come together sleekly, the tedium of what you do in battle is still present, because you're never going to have a wide array of flashy fighting tactics; just the repetitive animations of shooting, stabbing, moving, and so on. I wouldn't say I hate the turn-based combat, that's much too harsh a term, but after a couple hours every non-unique fight scenario just felt like a slog.My only other qualm with the game is also brought about by Fallout's age, which is the sometimes unfair difficulty. Don't get me wrong, I love the ""figure it out yourself"" nature of Fallout that has essentially no hand-holding, but sometimes what the player should and shouldn't do is so poorly conveyed that you can get yourself into sticky situations. And because of the manual-save system, these scenarios can potentially ruin an entire playthrough, or at least cause you to loose hours of progress. Add in the fairly buggy disposition of Fallout and the fact that saves made in combat have a tendency to corrupt, and some frustrating moments are born. I was able to go through the game with minimal aggravation, but you may not be so lucky. Save often, and use all of your save slots.A final reminder on the best part of Fallout: the roleplaying. I've talked about it already, but I'd like to emphasize once again just how much narrative and creative freedom is handed to the player to craft their own character and personality. Ample amounts of choices are written for you to express this personality throughout the game, so take advantage of them. If deep and complex roleplaying systems are something you know how to utilize, Fallout will be a dark and twisted fantasy come to life for you.The singular experience that is Fallout took me roughly 24 hours to complete, and while I didn't enjoy every minute of it, every second certainly added purpose and value to my time in post-nuclear Southern-California. If you consider yourself a Fallout fan, you owe it to yourself to play through this game in order to get a real sense of where Fallout truly began; because simple research on the original Fallout doesn’t do it enough justice.Few series’ have ever surpassed Fallout in excellence in my eyes (I can realistically only name one), but not a single game I can think of transcends Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, in setting up such a vast and remarkable franchise. This, is a game for the eons, and one which strode into the annals of gaming history like it owned the place.Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely OutstandingMaybe... you'll think of me... when you are all alone...Maybe the one who is waiting for you... will prove untrue...Then what will you do?Maybe you`ll sit and sigh... wishing that I were near...Then...Maybe you'll ask me… to come back again…And maybe, I’ll say, “Maybe.” "

My Personal Score: 3/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughs.Fallout is one of those classic games that never ceases to charm me everytime I play it. Being the root title in the behemoth of a franchise that it has become, there's nothing quite like exploring a post-apocalyptic Southern California in an isometric view and role-playing with Interplay's primordial SPECIAL system which still offers a unique gameplay experience despite its age. It's going to be jarring to play this game coming from the 3D sequels what with the lack of explanations for the mechanics and skill checks at every turn ala pen and paper RPGs but if you take the time to learn all of its intricacies and having the mindset to play a game like this, you'll be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind experience that only old school RPGs could offer.And there you have it.

It truly took me wayyy too long to appriecate the first iterations of the Fallout series, they were so well crafted. I love Fallout, in every shape and form.

""War, war never changes!""Said Ron Perlman back in 1997 when the first Fallout game was released by the company called Interplay. Unlike Fallout 3 this and its sequel put more emphasis on role-playing. Make no mistake - there's lots of fights but not that many weapons as introduced in later episodes, plus, there's no VATS system here making a single fight like a cutscene.A propos cutscenes: there are many such events occurring when we are met by new people - people that are important in the world and can bring the story forward. We complete quests, gather experience points, converse with strange people (even the zombie-like inhabitants of Necropolis), fight mutants and huge, red scorpions - all in a post-nuclear, radioactive, infested world that looks as if the '50s technology was brought forward. This retrofuturistic atmosphere certainly gives a plus to the gameplay.While there are 3 characters pre-made by the creators you can always create your own here with the game's SPECIAL system (acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck). Plus, you have perks, attributes, skills etc. This is a rather complex system that later iterations of the franchise all inherited.I know Fallout 4 looks better and uses all the current-gen graphical enhancements but if you want to know where it all started and you have around 30 hours for such a pastime (this is for completionists) then picking this one might just be an exciting story for you.PS: The number of hours I invested into the game can be measured in the dozens. This was the commercial version that was released way before Steam hence the short time spent with the game here. Still, it was nice to see that the Steam edition works well and offers even a full HD resolution.			"

												     very interesting game, not my favorite Fallout game but it's sure in my top three.  The story of the Vault Dweller is an awesome one and I had a lot of fun playing through and solving the wastelands problems. The combat mechanics could have been a little more flushed out and I felt like everything moved a bit slow. Even with that said, the game's story is not worth missing out on and do not look up any pictures of the main villan. His revel was creepy and made the experience even better.			"

												This review does contain spoilers and such, so be wary.Fallout 1, even as it has nearly been around for nearly 19 years, is still easily one of the best Fallout games in the franchise. Games such as Fallout 3 are only a 10th, maybe even less, than what this game was, even New Vegas as much as I love it, didn't come close to the experience I got from this.The quest was simple. Find a water chip to save your vault from certain death. Only leaving you with one location of a second Vault (Vault 15). Except when you leave on your mission, you find yourself getting caught up in the problems of other villagers and learning of new unknown locations, how these locations have grown and prospered. Not because you asked for quests, but because the town was placed in the middle of you and your location, not because you were told to. This happens again, with the hub, as you enter not knowing what you'll find, only to get yourself tangled between a shop keeper and a large casino owner in their feuds for business and profit, without you having to ask. And you get to decide who comes out on top, either with one dying or the other, both having their own pros and cons and each side having their reasons for their actions. As you travel further, you learn of factions, areas and dilemmas that you are able to choose who reigns victorious, whether it's the blades or the regulators, shady sands and the raiders, the ghouls of underground necropolis and set, along with the mutants, all while building up information on the much higher, more powerful threat that awaits. The super mutants are in general, dumb and strong, but compared to their creator, they are merely pawns in the larger plan that awaits. You only meet the antagonist once, at the very end, but it feels as if you've known him for longer. He never taunts you or mocks you on your journey, nor is he mentioned beyond the whispers of the cathedral. But you've been learning about him since you began, and it's incredibly fascinating to learn what you missed if you ever go for a second playthrough, which I highly recommend, and is even more of a wonder if you continue to Fallout 2 and absorb the lore, which if you enjoyed then I cannot recommend it enough. His presence is enough to give you goosebumps and you'll remember certain lines from him for a long time. Words can only put it so far. The best way to find out, is to play it. Next to 2, this is an outstanding experience, and makes you forget all about graphics, animations and gives you the freedom to delve into the attention to detail, the characters and the story. If you've played New Vegas, then I highly recommend this, but if you've came from 3 then this game might come as a bigger surprise than you might expect.  "

												This is one of the best of any games I've played! It was kind of confusing at first, and took alot of patience. I went to the options menu and set it to always run instead of that SlO0oow Walking. I also set the VATS turns to very fast. The Game was suddenly lots more fun and it is one of the greatest games once I get used to it and the only frustrating thing left was finding the controller chip in only 150 days. Which means you have limited time to play before you fail the main quest still a great game though. I still don't know where that controller chip is. I saw a dead feral goul standing up, which freaked me out when I thought it was alive. I spent 10 minutes trying to sneak around it then I tried the VATS button and nothing happened 13/10 would find dead people standing up again.			"

Brown. Brown Never Changes. - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Incredibly dark, gritty games are very bountiful these days. Almost everything is trying to be THAT game. You know the one. More shades of brown than the cast of a black sitcom. Everything's gotta be super dark and serious. This is war, man. There's gotta be lots of blood and explosions, and brown. This is serious. People die, man. Death is real. It's coming for you.It wasn't always this way though. It used to be different. It used to be a happier, more peaceful gaming landscape. Sure, there were serious games. There were games with blood, games with death, and games with brown.Super Mario wears brown shoes.But you kids that are always ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not having enough color in games and all games being too dark, you don't know. It used to be something special. It used to be a unique art direction. At least until everyone jumped on the bandwagon and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. There was an original brown game. A game that said, hey, you know the color brown? Well guess what, it's everywhere. And it was a pleasant surprise.The original is still by far one of the bests. It's got the unique art direction, the atmosphere, and it's charming in its own special way. In a sort of, giving a Get Well balloon to roadkill kind of way.Fallout is the original grit. Fallout is the original brown. Brown before brown. Rocks and sand before rocks and sand. The first Fallout. Way back in 1997. Surprise, the Fallout series did not start on 3. There was a first game.Fallout is a truly spectacular game. A marvel of classic RPG's, and arguably better than some modern RPG's in what it offers. Fallout is an open-world, turn-based tactical RPG. Set in an alternate future where Donald Trump became president and everything went to hell, you must set off from the safety of your underground vault to repair the satellite so grandma can watch Spongebob again. She gets cranky if she can't watch Spongebob.There's a pretty large emphasis on you as the character. There are a few pre-made characters to choose from in case you don't know how to choose your stats properly, but it's best if you make your own. Using the ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L."" system, which stands for ""Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Lemons"" you can make your characters as unique as you like. Assign them special skills and traits, and make them special.Not only do you have complete freedom in creating your character, but the game alters dramatically in how you play it based on your character and your choices. It's like some kind of Mass Effect kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥ but like, before Mass Effect. Can you believe that? They had good game ideas this long ago? That's amazing.The major choices and karma system aren't the only familiar elements. There's also a time limit. If you don't get your vault up and running properly again, everyone dies and you're left to feel the shame of disappointing everyone in your life. Also they're all dead.A tricky gameplay element. On one hand, it limits exploration of Fallout's vast world. But on the other hand, it gives you a sense of urgency in your mission. It helps to drive home that feeling of desperation, of helplessness in a desolate world. It also keeps your playthrough fairly contained and quick. There's more to the game, much more. But with so many choices and options, limiting yourself to one long playthrough instead of a lot of smaller ones limits how much of the game you're actually seeing.Fallout has so much depth, and such a dynamic world. In my time with it, I experienced multiple different and unique playthroughs.In my first playthrough, my great hero Dubya set off into the wasteland to save the world. Dubya was a strong guy, but not a smart one. Or one that survived all that long. He spent days crawling through the very first cave, killing every rat he could. Unfortunately, I chose for him to have extra strength at the cost of his accuracy, so the poor guy was trying to punch rats for almost a week. And getting bit, and dying. He finally made it out into the wasteland, where he tried to punch scorpions until he died.At this point, I realized that Dubya wasn't working out and made a new character. Nookyalur, the agile Vault person, used her cunning wit and agility to steal some weapons, which she used to kill everything she could. She made it further, and eventually went on to die in a killing spree when she got in a fight with a merchant and his guards. She had to be left behind when she ran out of time, and her vault crumbled without its precious Spongebob reruns. Not the new ones, those are♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's gotta be the old episodes.It was at this time that I managed to get a grip on how the game worked. So I simply restarted once more, and didn't ♥♥♥♥ up my character. With my powerful stealth and science abilities, I was able to sneak into a military base and set it to self-destruct. So in one fell swoop, without even equipping my gun, I killed so many things. So many. I got like a million experience points.From there, I managed to break my way into another base, and steal some power armor. I was pretty much invincible at this point, probably. So I saved the world, discovered the mutated remains of Donald Trump's hairpiece, and foiled his plan to end immigration once and for all.It was a pretty dank ride.Though all along my journey were other options. Did I recruit the guy with the gun into my party to help me kill things? Or did I go it alone, and use stealth to my advantage? Did I use my awesome talking powers to convince the bad guys to not kill me? Or did I slaughter them all without even blinking? Or do I agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies and decide to vote for him? I can't choose every choice in one playthrough.Even though I've played through the game a number of times, there's still so much I've yet to see. There are different endings, different choices. There are areas I've yet to fully explore, even. It's that deep and complex of a game.On the other hand, Fallout is pretty old. It's not as pretty as one of the modern Fallout games. It's not as user-friendly with its interface either. The interface is clunky by our standards today, but still definitely usable. It also has that ""old RPG"" vibe of all but requiring you to talk to everyone and everything. There aren't any glowing trails to show where you're going, or any markers to show what to do. You may even need a guide to help you through some areas.That's the only real issue that could turn someone away from Fallout. It's kinda old. And kinda dated in a few ways. At its core, it's still one of the great CRPG classics. C standing for cougar. It's that old, but it's still got it. And probably the mother of something, being that old and influential. So you could say Fallout is a milf, I guess.Milfs aren't for everyone. Some like them incredibly modern and fresh. But personally, I always had a thing for retro. Know what I'm saying?If you can look past Fallout's clunky old interface and admire it for its genius game design and aged beauty, Fallout will be good to you. If not, hey, I bought my copy for like a dollar. Besides, now I can brag about how cultured and refined I am for owning retro classics like Fallout. Like owning bottles of wine you'll never drink. You never know when you'll need to impress your guests with how refined you are. Even if you'll spend the rest of the night throwing up and sobbing.I feel as though Fallout has taught me valuable lessons though. Lessons about life, and the world. Like, if there ever was a nuclear apocalypse? We'd pretty much all be dead. Isn't that a comforting thought? We'd all be so very screwed, but at least we'd be dead. And that's okay with me.			"

												Fallout 1 is an old game. It held up decently though. You get sent out form your little hole in the ground community to get a new water chip. Because it's a wasteland full of hardened criminals and raiders - and you're the one that's less likely to get killed if you go into the world with merely a rusty knife (seriously a gun would have made more sense but I guess gaming rules have to go the route of ""Start with nothing and work your way up"").As this game's lore goes somewhere in the 1950s the apocolypse happened. The details are pretty unimportant as the war is something that's from a time no one cares about anymore. It was at least a generation or two ago. But the results of it lasted: a wasteland covering the entire world as far as most around can tell.One of the first things I discovered in this was it's very eager and able to kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes simply walking into a public area is enough for the whole place to kil you. if you die you die perminently. if your party members die they die perminently. There's no revive in any sense of the word for this game. And it takes almost no time at all before any ally you get dies if you aren't abusing saves to redo every fight they died in. It wasn't until I managed to get ahold of Power Armor when I started feeling somewhat badass.It's possible that I am to blame though what with having prioritized non combat skills such as bartering and speach. I garuntee you'll never have any money issues if you put heavy amounts into bartering and charisma. When you start reaching 90% shops start paying you more than you pay them. So you can actually keep trading the same items between each other and just have them pay some caps on top of that - effectively walking away with the entire store for free if you wanted to.The AI in Fallout 1 is pretty terrible. If it's not simply blocking your way so you can't walk through a door for 2-3 minutes straight (and oh does it ever do that a lot) it's jumping in front of you in combat or worse burst firing so it'll kill everyone in front of it - often other party members and yourself. 40% of this game's difficulty comes from the party you babysit. The party doesn't level up with you so they quickly become flat out obsolete. With little to no personality or story surrounding them you really won't feel bad just giving up and letting them die when they die. They're practically faceless. I did find it pretty cool you could have multiple followers though. It actually felt like a party of travelers... until it became babysitting anyway. they lose their appeal when a single super mutant kills all of them with a single attack in your general direction.The turn based top-down combat was not what I expected when I started playing. It was honestly pretty good once the followers weren't involved though.This game suffered from lacking in explaination for the interface. There were some things that were vital to know - such as how to set traps or disable them, how to use stimpacks or how to use items on the environment (which left me stuck near the end of the game as I didn't know how to hook up a radio to a computer until I looked up help online).It also suffered from some nonsense errors throughout the game - such as trying to operate a switch to open a door and getting a ""no space in inventory"" response.Also deathclaws are hell. I have to point them out because ♥♥♥♥ deathclaws. The only way they could be harder is if when you killed them a second one popped out of the carcass of the first - wearing power armor and holding a minigun. And instead of bullets it shot more deathclaws out from it.It's a good game. By today's standards I'd give it a 6/10 realistically, but a 7/10 for fan-factor.			"

												    This is not a review! This is what I feel after finishing the game.First of all, it's never too late to play games like this. I never thought that an old game can hold me for almost 40 hours!The time I spend there was not wasted.The game itself is not just something post-apocalyptic, it has a unique world and atmosphere. Simply unforgetable.Well, as it goes for all games I play, I'll say the same thing for this one:If you believe you're real gamer, you must pay a respect to this game and play it (if you didn't do that already).

												Perhaps the strongest aspect of Fallout is that it is ideal for RPG newbies yet at the same time provides a depth of role-playing that veterans can really get stuck into. It also has the best replay value of any game I've experienced to date.The game play is smooth, using action points for movement and combat and the inventory system is easily managed. Fallout has one of the best character development systems of any computerized role-playing game and the graphics and story make for an excellent gaming experience.For anyone with an interest in complex, combat-heavy, lovingly produced RPGs Fallout is a must buy. In an age where many are predicting the death of traditional RPGs at the hands of multiplayer extravaganzas, Fallout is a glowing example of the genre, one which positively radiates quality. Fallout – it's da bomb.			"

												The graphics can obscure some crucial items or paths required to beat the quest and the game thinks you must've read the manual as the game doesn't explain how to use the UI to its fullest, however it still a great game thats aged amazingly, from what little i've played of fallout 3 i'd rank this game over it (i've only got a few hours in fallout 3 due to crashes). The open ended gameplay is amazing, for example in the quest ""Destroy the Mutant Leader"" you can go in and kill everything but if thats not yuour style then you can ask Morpheus to take you to the master and talk him  out of creating super mutants or you can do what I did, dress up as a child of the apocalypse, explore the base at your leisure but then get attacked by super mutants when you try to interact with a computer (which they shouldn't since you're dressed up as a child of the apocalypse). Then get suspicuos and repeat the process by reloading a save until you get into that room, equip hardened power armour, kill super mutants and find out the computer they were protecting sets a timer for a nuke to blow in 4 minutes.Overall Great game, if you haven't got it then go and get it			"

												Fallout has got to be a hidden gem under my radar. Is still a good classic game and still held up after all those years. You feel like you have to work up your loot, weapons and armor to survive, like in a real fallout scenario especially when you have to talk ""smart"" to some people and make deals to get on thier good side if you want to progress the game further, and man the beginning is brutel (depends on settings) for me if you don't know what you're doing! The only 3 problems I can think of that bothers me is the trading system has a problem and is you can only trade stuff one digit at a time. Is annoying if you have alot of caps. so you have to click it so many times until you reach your number of caps to trade, is ridiculous for how simple it is to fix it. The second is a nitpick and is from the beginning that you have to figure it out on your own how the controls work and which button does it do. Some that are vital like the iconic focus aim shots, I later found the feature in mid game, which I could have learn it sooner before I die alot from the mutants.The third is the fighting system where depends on how many action points you have, you attack on the person, but if the person say 3 guys attack you and you only get one or two actions to attack, the others guys get 8 combine! Even if you're fighting one guy he gets probably 3 or if you're lucky 2 actions. And yes you can increase it, but is so slow to get more action points if you don't know what you're doing. You have to plan your attacks carefully and not strike it blindly which is good, but is hard if you need the exp. Yes, you can decrease the difficulty and plan making a better character but is just my take on my first playthrough.There has been some crashes on my Win. 7 34 bit but only when I input certain commands or moves of the game for reason I don't know why so watch out if it happens. I don't know if it'll work on 64 bit or win 8 but I know they have patches for that on some website that I don't know if it'll work, look it up in youtube.I give an 8/10 rated for a classic gem series that still holds up to a fun level.

Stumbles across Shady Sands and learns they have a radscorpion problem, continues my journey to the vault only to learn that I need to descend an elevator shaft so I'll need a ladder or some rope. Goes back to Shady Sands and asks everyone I can about rope and ladders who all deny the existene of such things, Aradesh does not sell either. I learn of Junktown and a place called the Hub. So I travel to Junktown, they refuse me entry because it's night-time, I travel to the Hub and find a general store that sells rope at exorbitant prices. I purchase one rope, I go back to Vault 15. I descend the shaft, learn I need another rope. Return to the hub, purchase more rope, go back to the Vault. Discover there is no water purification chip there and find rope in a locker.From this day forward I always carry rope on my person 10/10 (The game is actually still really good, if you like today's Fallout games then you'll probably enjoy it.)

												if you dont like older games or slow gameplay than i would advise not buying this game, however for being as old as it is, this title as aged quite well. even the graphics for the combat,areas,and characters are muddy at best, the overall story and feel of adventure you get when traverising the wastes is enough to keep you wrapped up for several hours of gameplay. one of the major flaws however is that it is quite buggy, for instince, i once had a broken arm so i was unable to fire two handed weapons but the game wouldnt let my character or any of the in game doctors fix it.                                                                 As i stated before the combat is slow but very involving and strategical, if youve ever played any x-com games than you will understand the mechanics exaclty. this allows the game to make situations more tense and difficult forcing to do more than just charging in and blasting dudes in the face, but is not such a bad thing. when you have to slow down and analyze scenarios, the combat is more involving and satisfying, because unlike other games where you can just shoot this random dude in the face, you can hide and set up explosives to blow his legs off, run up, and then shoot him.                            one major drawback to the gameplay though is the fact that there is a time limit of 400-500 in game days before you lose the game, so its something like dead rising 2's sand box, where you can goo off and have fun just dont expect a happy ending. also the display screen for your weapons and perks could be a bit more descriptive, but considering the pace games where at that time were at i'll let that one pass.                the last thing i wamt to talk about is the plot whic is actually pretty original considering the setting being completely cliche( post-apcolyptic america). you are a resident of one of the many vaults that protected a select few but one day the water chip begins to go down and you are chosen to brave the wastes and retrieve another. in your adventures you come across such things as crashed aliens, dr. who, deathclaws, giant master race mutats, raiders, and shotgun wileding robo-brains. you must battle all of these and more as you search for your vault's salvation. like i said pretty original.           So all in all it may be old and have some minor faults its still a pretty solid, and one of the best rpgs of all time. if you like turnbased combat, awesome storytelling,and hours of fun then this game is for you. i would rate it 9/10.

												if you haven´t played this i recommend it a 100% sure there is a learning curve and the combat isn´t always that fun.... but considering everything else the game does phenomenally those are just a minor  nuisance. My main gripe is that you can´t play after the games ending but thankfully you can in Fallout 2. This is a good game to own in your library as a huge Fallout fan i can´t not recommend it			"

												Vaults.  Power armor.  The Glow.  These are identifable Icons, that represent a larger whole.  From being beaten soundly by mice, to using coherent light to cut your enemies in twain, almost by accident at times.  A sense of progression that has yet to be beaten.  Fallout is a word with dark emotion, but this dark game is one of the most optimistic of all time.			"

												A niche game, even for its time. Fallout is a classic CRPG that should be played at least once, but preferably twice. While not particularly difficult if you can follow basic instructions, the game is kind of limited in the sense that you have a set number of days to complete your mission. It may seem like an open world game, but it really isn't when you get down to it. There is a specific way to play the game, and exploration is only rewarded when you know where to go and what to do at specific times. Playing with a walkthrough on your second playthrough is not only acceptable, but expected. Some areas are pretty well hidden, and you wouldn't know to visit them on your way to other locations. The voice acting is decent, the animations may seem uncanny but they were quite impressive for the time. The graphics have aged poorly to be sure, but it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this satisfying and nuanced game, especially if you are a fan of the later games in the series and want to see where it all began.

												Fallout is a fantastic game back in the day, but it is becoming pretty obvious that it did not age very well, to put it simply the gameplay and design is outdated. If you never had a knack to play ancient pc role-playing games, chances are pretty good you will not like Fallout. The control scheme is god awful compared to modern standards, and the repetitive textures are just visually boring. The gameplay is very standard for rpg game of the 90s. While Fallout may lack all the basic mechanics that makes modern games great, its storyline, environment, and sound will remain eternal. Fallout created a precedent for all great RPG’s to follow, the ability to shape the ending of the game started here. Much like its sequels, Fallout’s entire game world is flipping massive. Overall this game is in desperate need of a remake.			"

												Here's a recap of my first half-hour on one of my playthroughs.I created a character and named him Beowulf, and I poured all my points into maxing out his Strength and Agility.I then decided to NOT equip the Brass Knuckles, in favor of beating the hell out of everything with my bare hands - in true Beowulf fashion.I then proceded to use this method to kill every rat in the cave, then went to Vault 15 and killed everything there.After that, I went back to Shady Sands, went to the RadScorpion Cave, and punched a RadScorpion so hard in the brain that I knocked it senseless, pacified it, and ended the combat with it still alive.I then walked over to it and ripped its tail off, still breathing.I have since then added a dog and a couple gun-toting thugs to my posse, and have saved a girl from a gang of Raiders by fighting their leader in bare-handed combat (won with hardly a scratch), then went and killed all of his subordinates for kicks.GOD DAMN, it feels good to be Beowulf.

												There are only two reasons to play a game this dated, nostalgia-or in my case, curiousity-since I never got to play Fallout 1 or 2 when they were first released. This game is much too old in my opinion to enjoy the gameplay mechanics, but you get to see where the Fallout story began. If you like Isometric RPG's and have the patience to play an old school game that is challenging for one or both of the reasons above then go ahead and get it.			"

												I played enough already to tell you that this game is a masterpiece and probably every oldschool gamers will tell you the same thing.Being a dystopia of the 50's in a post-nuclear war environment flooded with radiations, mutants and survivors. Fallout is much more open in its variety of choices and possibilities than, for example, Diablo 1 which came a year before.-You can Talk to almost every NPCs with multiple dialogue choices which will grant or deny you some ways to deal with problems.-Not a talker? Kill anyone in sight if you want! Pew pew pew! Takatakatak!A large variety of weapons can be found in the wasteland.-To be (A thief) or not to be? Pick any pocket in sight to get ammo, money, etc!-7 SPECIAL abilities such as : Strengh, Intelligence, Charisma, Luck...-18 skills such as : Small/Big Guns, Lockpick, Steal, Science, Speech...-53 perks such as : Animal Friend, Flower Child, Explorer, Fortune Finder...-Choose 2 personal traits between 16 choices such as :Bloody Mess, Good Natured, Jinxed, Skilled, Kamikaze...-You can take drugs and booze to boost your SPECIAL and Skills(WARNING : May cause addiction)-You can roam the wasteland freely without any limitations but the map borders.-The gunplay and combats are turned based. I think it's perfect because it's probably the only gameplay possible to deal with the way guns works in it.A real-time f**k-fest of bullets would be insane and unplayable.The wanted realism gives a survival side and your health is a part of it.It's not like in Diablo where you can boost your life, use magic and surealist stuff.After playing more or less 1000h hours on Fallout 3, I can finaly say that Bethesda did a great job to reenact the awesomeness of the Fallout series.May the power of atom be with you wastelanders!

												Interplay at it's finest.Created by Interplay's RPG divison (later known as Black Isle Studios for all their later Fallout games), Fallout is a ginormous Post Nuclear Role-Playing Game set in the aftermath of ""the great war"", where humanity got so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they just bombed everyone because they ran out of natural resources.You play a hapless ♥♥♥♥ living in Vault 13. Your vault's water purification system has been damaged. It's up to you and ONLY you to wander the wasteland of California to search for a new one. Released in 1997, Fallout is one of the most intricate and highly detailed RPG's of the '90s. All of your skills all play important parts in the game, unlike beth♥♥♥♥♥das ""Charisma 4: Mass Effect Dialogue Options"". There are multiple endings depending on your actions and routes taken, and it's completely up to you what you do with your time.The original version of Fallout had a in-game time limit of 150 days to find the water chip. If you ran out, you'd get the bad ending by default. This limit was patched out in the early days.The Fallout series has remained one of the most inspiring and amazing RPG games to ever play.♥♥♥♥ Bethesda, this is the REAL masterpiece. Don't mind the ""fallout 4"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the comments of this review. If you are a RPG fan, this game belongs in your library.			"

												*possible story spoilers*I played this for the first time recently (and failed).I wont judge the game completely until I've done a succussful playthough but I'll point out a few things.My first Fallout was 3. Then New Vegas. Then 4. Now this.My impression from what I've done so far? It's not quite the legendary game I've been told it was, but it's still very good.The turnbased combat didn't bother me like I thought it would but I hated how enemies moved 1 at a time (especially frustrating when there's lots of them).I love the atmosphere, and the fact that this wasteland that's been created is actually a harsh and unforgiving place. In pretty much every modern game I crank up the difficulty to the max or mod them to be more difficult because they're too damn easy. But I wasn't able to do a lot of things in this game because it was so hard. My main complaint is that when you fail to get the water chip, everybody in the vault just dies? Like there's a door to the outside world. If I'm not coming back why don't you just leave like I did..? Orrrrrr you can just sit around until you die of thirst... ok. Whatever floats your boat.Would have been better if failing to get the chip didn't end the game and the vault dwellers left and came to hunt you down. It's still a good game and I'll probably update my review after a successful playthrough.			"

												As franchises expand with every new release, thoughts of the previous entires come to mind. With the release of Fallout 4, I felt that it would be fun to replay the game that started it all. Released in 1997, Fallout was a hit and even now playing it 18 years after its release; it essentially holds up.While the last 3 entries are very first person orientated with more frenetic action then the others; the original fallout is a 3rd person isometic turn based rpg that still offers an open world and an enriched story. The character creation is essentially the same as you distribute points in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system as well as choosing skills and a few perks of choose from a few premade characters.The base story seems very reminicent of Fallout 3, and like it once you leave the vault can do as you please. However, the game appears to be time sensitive and while I have no clue as to the consequences of failing have come across many sidequests in addition to the random encounters exploreing the map.One thing I do want to stress is that unlike modern games; the user interface has a somewhat steep learning curve. By that, I mean asside from saving, you must manually reload weapons, and items are only used once at time. Bartering ( which later games simply became shops ) is broken down as placing items you don't want into the middle which will provide a cap value and then you choose items from the other party equal to or less of the value. ( Cap item limits max at 999. so if your trade was 1500 caps you would move 999 caps from other party and then additional 501 caps. NOTE: you can use the numeric keys for the value )Overall, Its been a blast to play this game; and while very slow paced I cant help but appreciate the amount of content here in a game nearly 20 years old. If you a fan of the Fallout franchise, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance and I would recommend anyone on the fence to checkout out some youtube videos of the gameplay. Its regularly 9.99 but during any number of steam sales is probably 4.99 or under.If you found this review helpful or opinions of what could improve my next review, please  feel free to send me a message.

												One of my favorite games. Everything about it is just fantastic, the atmosphere, the diologue and the role-playing elements make it one of those games you can always turn back too. It also has a great story (the Master is an awesome character) and I love how they don't give you any baby steps to figure out what you are suppose to do next, they just have you figure it out. That's why I love this game and everything about it. Now yes, this game will get frustrating, especially for me when I first played. But I was able to learn through many failed playthroughs and the help of friends (also the internet). This game is great and it has helped me appreciate the Fallout universe even more than before and I recommend to anyone who likes isometric crpgs or the other Fallout games.			"

												Great game, especially for fans of the newer titles. If you're a fan of Fallout 3/NV or like old-school RPGs, play the first two Fallout games. Though the functionalities of an older game such as this do take a little bit of getting used to, once you get the hang of it it becomes a rich, very fun experience that is surprisingly similar to what you get in the newer titles. It's actually surprising to see just how much Bethesda got right when translating Fallout 3 into an updated 3D version of the same universe. And although there are some (not uncommon to modern Fallout) glitchy elements which definitely got smoothened out in the second installment, the original Fallout is a fun play even to this day, with an amazing story, hours of gameplay, funny moments, and some good 'ol turn-based combat that features some of the most gruesome and entertaining death scenes I've ever seen.

How it All BeganThis is the original Fallout, complete with original graphics, blemishes and virtues. There is an incredible amount of depth to the world that you can inhabit. Time to go 'in depth' for my new review style. GameplayFallout 1 is an isometric RPG. It is, obviously, a little archaic. There are several different mouse pointers you must constantly alternate between to either examine, move or fight things. The combat is simple yet satisfying, with enough weapons and different combat approaches to each encounter that it can stay fresh. Moving through the desert is a harrowing, luck-based affair, with a grid-styled map that you can move through showing the world. Places of importance are highlighted in green, and random encounters stop you on your journey to keep it fresh. Overall, Fallout has impressive gameplay that stands up to the tests of time. StoryYour vault is running out of water. You are the last hope for your entire vault. This plot hook, though good, actually limits the game. A time limit is placed on you of 150 days, and if water is not obtained for your vault before the end of those 150 days, you will 'fail' the game. This places unnecessary pressure onto your shoulders, although it is incredibly effective at keeping players on the path of the main story. However, this leaves you with little opportunity to delve into other side missions or characters. Several characters will have to be made before you can experience everything. Graphics and AtmosphereQuite obviously the graphics are not going to be current-day good. Don't expect high quality graphics, and if you criticize the game for it's graphics... well then, what do you expect? It's the atmosphere that really sells the game. A broken landscape with intriguing characters and it's own, unique brand of humour really sells the unique vibe of a civilization that never got out of the 50's, and then got nuked. It's very enjoyable just to explore, even if there is no music. SummaryFallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a game that is very much worth your time. With a low asking price and hours worth of fun, there's very little reason that you shouldn't pick up the first Fallout, especially at a time like now when the future of Fallout is coming... why not return to the past?

												Fallout is one of the most polished rpg's I have played.If you are thinking of buying this game please note that 1. The engine used in the game gets some getting used to,but trust me you will get used to it.2 this version is not the American edition,its the Australian edition that has cut critical death animation and a patch called No Kids that cuts all the kids Npc from the game.In order to get rid of this look up Fallout Fixt and download it to remove the patches.

If you've got a little patience for an isometric, turn-based RPG with plenty of options in terms of engagements and outcomes accomplished either by action or through dialogue, give this game a go.Be warned that the people actually responsible for it have long since stopped recieving royalty checks for it, however.

												Fallout was 1997’s best role-playing game. It was released in a time where people had been waiting years for something really groundbreaking to come by in an RPG, and Interplay didn’t miss the mark.In order to survive a great nuclear war in this futuristic game, the survivors of humanity sought shelter in underground vaults to escape the nuclear fallout (hence the title). The character is in one such vault, but escaping the wastelands is not the only problem. This vault’s water-recycling chip has malfunctioned and the leader of the community is asking the player’s character to go to a neighboring vault for a replacement. If only a journey in the wasteland were simple.Players find that there are communities on the surface, and they’re scraping the bottom trying to survive just like those below. Gangs that resemble something from the Mad Max series roam the wasteland preying on those struggling to make a living. Some people have undergone transformations; so have some animals. Finding a water chip or other suitable drinking water is not going to be an easy task.The game system takes some time to get used to, but not so much that it detracts from the enjoyment of the game. Mostly a mouse-driven game, players have cursor options to select actions, conditions, and manage inventory. Taking care of said inventory isn’t a comfortable process, as players are forced to manage all loot in a single columned interface.Fallout does some things quite well. Character creation is quite thorough, including optional traits and perks to enhance characters’ starting abilities, making him/her unique. Fallout’s creators also attempted to implement a system of “right and wrong,” and player interaction with NPCs is affected by Karma. As two more examples, sound and music both compliment the story environment without going over the top.Like games of the time, there are some things that greatly under-perform. Most roaming NPCs are fairly useless for more than a grunt, snide remark, or comic relief. While players can recruit companions, they have no control over them, allowing for situations where the recruits will shoot players (and other NPC companions) in the back or block the path. They do not target what the player targets most of the time, and players will notice when trying to do something nefarious that combat will provoke NPCs to target other people, including children, which just cause one’s Karma to bust. Also, players’re forced to trade with them to provide them any resources. They don’t wear armor or gain levels making them weak and pathetic in the end-game.The presentation of the story is both humorous and enlightening. The previously touched-on story is set in the future, but most everything looks like it came out not long after World War II. What’s left of civilization is surviving under the tow of two-headed cows while rusting autos and modern technologies similar to our era are strune about. Bottle caps are the currency of choice and iguana sticks are to die for.All things being said, Fallout is still one of the best RPGs ever made for the PC and sparked a great trend. It is true that it came out around the same time Blizzard released Diablo, but Fallout breaks the mold.			"

												Old school turn-based RPG/Adventure at it's best.  Great post apocalyptic setting, replayability out the wazzou, and some of the funniest moments in gaming.  Graphics are certainly dated for today's standards, especially with the top down view, but they hold up just fine as the game is more about story and interaction than full blown eye candy.  Don't forget to throw in some big name voice acting (Ron Perlman being my favorite), and it's a classic.  Still as fun today as it was when I first picked it up over a decade ago.			"

												As franchises expand with every new release, thoughts of the previous entires come to mind. With the release of Fallout 4, I felt that it would be fun to replay the game that started it all. Released in 1997, Fallout was a hit and even now playing it 18 years after its release; it essentially holds up.While the last 3 entries are very first person orientated with more frenetic action then the others; the original fallout is a 3rd person isometic turn based rpg that still offers an open world and an enriched story. The character creation is essentially the same as you distribute points in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system as well as choosing skills and a few perks of choose from a few premade characters.The base story seems very reminicent of Fallout 3, and like it once you leave the vault can do as you please. However, the game appears to be time sensitive and while I have no clue as to the consequences of failing have come across many sidequests in addition to the random encounters exploreing the map.One thing I do want to stress is that unlike modern games; the user interface has a somewhat steep learning curve. By that, I mean asside from saving, you must manually reload weapons, and items are only used once at time. Bartering ( which later games simply became shops ) is broken down as placing items you don't want into the middle which will provide a cap value and then you choose items from the other party equal to or less of the value. ( Cap item limits max at 999. so if your trade was 1500 caps you would move 999 caps from other party and then additional 501 caps. NOTE: you can use the numeric keys for the value )Overall, Its been a blast to play this game; and while very slow paced I cant help but appreciate the amount of content here in a game nearly 20 years old. If you a fan of the Fallout franchise, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance and I would recommend anyone on the fence to checkout out some youtube videos of the gameplay. Its regularly 9.99 but during any number of steam sales is probably 4.99 or under.If you found this review helpful or opinions of what could improve my next review, please  feel free to send me a message.

												*possible story spoilers*I played this for the first time recently (and failed).I wont judge the game completely until I've done a succussful playthough but I'll point out a few things.My first Fallout was 3. Then New Vegas. Then 4. Now this.My impression from what I've done so far? It's not quite the legendary game I've been told it was, but it's still very good.The turnbased combat didn't bother me like I thought it would but I hated how enemies moved 1 at a time (especially frustrating when there's lots of them).I love the atmosphere, and the fact that this wasteland that's been created is actually a harsh and unforgiving place. In pretty much every modern game I crank up the difficulty to the max or mod them to be more difficult because they're too damn easy. But I wasn't able to do a lot of things in this game because it was so hard. My main complaint is that when you fail to get the water chip, everybody in the vault just dies? Like there's a door to the outside world. If I'm not coming back why don't you just leave like I did..? Orrrrrr you can just sit around until you die of thirst... ok. Whatever floats your boat.Would have been better if failing to get the chip didn't end the game and the vault dwellers left and came to hunt you down. It's still a good game and I'll probably update my review after a successful playthrough.			"

												Newer generations typically won't appreciate the original Fallouts due to their dated graphics. There's something about Fallout 1 & 2 that Bethesda can't seem to replicate (although Obsidian did a great job with New Vegas). The grungy environment and original plot elements (instead of searching for your son/Dad) keep you constantly intrigued and/or amused with each twist and turn. Fallout 4 can't hold a candle to Fallout 1 or 2 because of one word. Replayability.The cult fanbase is well deserved, and even to this day there are total conversion mods being made for Fallout 2. Make sure to try out Fallout Resurrection and Fallout FIXT mods, or you'll be missing out.			"

The dark and quirky humor, perfect balance between questing/exploration and character development and Mark Morgan's atmospheric OST will suck you in to the story and keep you there for hours.For those of you who have only played F3 and New Vegas and have been wondering to yourself ""What's the deal with all these Vaults?"", snap this and the second one up...heck, EVERYONE who's into RPGs should snap this up! ^_^I'm giving this 11/10 and will be playing this until I go senile. Enjoy.As we come to the end of 2016, I'm still hailing this the best Post-Apocalyptic game I've ever come across, and one that's not only guaranteed to stand the test of time, but will provide inspiration to developers creating games with the same genre.

												Pros: Fallout is one of my favorite gaming worlds. It perfectly blends retro-futurism, post-apocalyptic     surivival, and dark humor to create a very unique universe that is fun to explore.  Your character matters: How you build your character and the choices you make really do change the story much more than in your typical RPG.  I love turn-based combat. While a little rough around the edges it still holds up. The game focuses on your character. While you can get companions the story revolves around you and I really prefer this to having to manage an entire team of characters as I find it more immersive and am better able to role-play.Cons: There are bugs. They shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game and there are fan-patches you can get that improve the game. By today's standards the game can feel a little directionless. Try to embrace it but if you get stuck or lost you can always find a guide online. The combat AI can be frustrating. For example, if you give a companion an automatic weapon they are just as likely to end up killing you as they are to kill your enemies. There are work arounds of course but it would be nice if the combat was a little smoother.Bottom line, Fallout is truly a classic that spawned a huge franchise. If you've never played it you really should give it a shot.			"

												I am a huge fan of all the Fallout franchise, and I was already waiting for the Fallout 4 launch a long time, anyway, Fallout  is a post-apocalyptic world where radiation and war comes along, it is also a roleplay game, that means that you make your very own decisions over what happens with some elements of the game, for a example, if I want to be a good person I help everybody except the enemies, and if I want to be a bad guy I kill everything on my sight.I really do reccomend this game.

												If the first fallout games you played where 3, New Vegas, or even the 4th one then you probably won't enjoy the original two. Format is completely different. It's an isometric game, so not fully 3D. Little voice acting. Turn based attacks. No radio. But thats not to say it's not fun. If you take the time to actually play you WILL enjoy it. The dialogue options are way crazier than any of the bethesda or obsidian verions. TIP: if you want a REAL challenge put your character's intelligience down to 1.			"

												War. War never changes...This is where it all started people, and no matter how great Fallout 4/5/6/ad infinitum may come to be, I'll still be coming back to the source of it all. The dark and quirky humor, perfect balance between questing/exploration and character development and Mark Morgan's atmospheric OST will suck you in to the story and keep you there for hours.For those of you who have only played F3 and New Vegas and have been wondering to yourself ""What's the deal with all these Vaults?"", snap this and the second one up...heck, EVERYONE who's into RPGs should snap this up! ^_^I'm giving this 11/10 and will be playing this until I go senile. Enjoy.As we come to the end of 2016, I'm still hailing this the best Post-Apocalyptic game I've ever come across, and one that's not only guaranteed to stand the test of time, but will provide inspiration to developers creating games with the same genre.

												A great Role Playing Game.  There are multiple ways to play this game.  You can be a bit of a diplomat, talking your way through the game.  You can use fire power to blast away most enemies.  Or you can look for a different approach, like finding an important computer and activating the self-destruct sequence of a place and leaving.  This is an older game, so don't expect great looking character models.Characters you find and add to your group can also be a pain in the butt at times.  They may fire at an enemy behind you, only to hit you instead.  Or they may block a door way and you have to wait for them to move.I did run into some gameplay issue with the more update version of the game, causing the game to crash.  I had to load up the older version to get around this.  Thankfully, this only happened in to areas of the game and did not ruin things (I was able to load up the updated version once I was past the area where the game would crash and would save there).This game can be difficult at times, as things may look favorable for you only to see your enemy get a BS lucky shot on you and kill you.  Overall, I really like this game, especially the ending.  After years of playing Japanese Role Playing Games, I got kinda tired of seeing everyone live happily ever after endings.  This game ending is harsh.  More fitting for the world of Fallout and the landscape, the Wasteland.  If you do plan to play this game, I do hope you do NOT look up the ending on YouTube.  It would possible ruin the experience for you and the work you character does in the game.			"

												What to say about this game? Well, for starters, it's a stepping stone to possibly one of the greatest game series of all time,  the Fallout series (Obviously), you may be more akin to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but both Fallout 1 and 2 are an entire different breed of game altogether.The game starts off in a Vault, Vault 13 to be more specific. A water chip, that keeps the Vault's water supply clean, but then all of a sudden, it breaks. The Overseer, sends out YOU to find a new Water Chip, setting in motion the Fallout series.This game is not totally freely explorable like New Vegas or Fallout 3, it's timed, so you don't want to spend too much time in one place, it take's 150 days to find the Water Chip, which will be marked on your Pip Boy (Not a wrist pad in this version, but rather a small device), the game explains the origins of the NCR, and Super Mutants, and other places.The combat is turn based, not first person, so you're going to have to take individual turns with you and your enemy when attacking, (I.E You attack first, but only for a certain number of times, the enemy attacks after, with the same set of rules.).The plot can be changed, but there is a canon ending which i will not spoil, you should play it for yourself and see what you do to effect the games endings. You can check out guides and other stuff to help you along your way.Overall, it's a excellent game, not meant for everyone though, the time limit can limit your experience wether you want to do side quests or not, and the combat can be a little too tough aswell.But i recommend it, make sure you play this if you want the full Fallout experience (Along with Fallout 2 of course.)

												It has taken me 15 years to complete Fallout 1. Some people say it's the best RPG of ALL TIME! I have found out the truth behind this claim.It's a third person isometric game from 1997. It ran fine on my widescreen Windows 7 set up. Note you need to running a patched version where some bugs are taken out. I played the Steam version that ran fine.The game is set in the USA in a post nuclear war era where much of civilisation has broken down or turned to dust. Some people have survived the nuclear fallout out by living in specialist underground bunkers called Vaults without much knowledge about the world above. You are tasked with saving your home after the water production breaks down.Before you jump ship and begin the quest to SAVE THE WORLD by killing some rats, you need to define your character. I found there was no right or wrong way to do this. Just that each choice will affect your adventure. Choosing a low Strength attribute won't allow you to lug around all the junk that you find. Agility effects action points in combat and how many gun shots you can attempt. Luck, usually a garbage stat effects your critical chances and also your random encounters. You also have skills and traits to choose and develop.You can't have a character that does everything well so you need to make choices on your play style. Go mighty sledgehammer or become a thief and pickpocket to riches. Specialise as a sniper or as a psycho killer, destroying everything that gives you a dirty look. Mwuahhaha!Saving your vault from water starvation is a small part of the overall story. It really gets interesting later on as you explore the desert and come across large towns and even a giant cathedral. Necropolis is full of zombie like ghouls and a super mutant group are on the rampage killing all before them. Then we have Deathclaws - legendary creatures that I found extremely vexing and impossible to take down. Eventually I figured out how shoot them in the leg or eyeballs.So, read the manual and figure out how to interact with the world. There is a learning curve and at the beginning you will feel lost. Damn - where are those pointers saying go there and do that. The end story was quite interesting and I really wish I could do a third play through - but on to Fallout 2.Oh - and don't ignore the timer to complete the initial water quest. I did on my first play through and the game promptly stopped when it said it would.Oh, I came across a TARDIS in the wastelands and then an alien ship that had crashed that contained a picture of Elvis. I also found an alien blaster that was awesome.Fantastic gem of a game. 8/10 as a modern game.			"

												Tags : Isometric RPG - Post Apocalyptic*HALL OF FAME* *ALL-TIME FAVORITES*Heavily inspired by Pen and Paper. Gritty, well designed, solid dialogue, effective turn based combat. This can be a hard game, and you can seriously develop your character into a corner, or have a savegame that can no longer be salvaged and you will have to restart the game if you want to win the main mission. The requirements not to fail the main arc have been heavily relaxed through patching but I personally miss the classic difficulty of version 1.0. Game has been remastered somewhat to work on modern OS with modern resolutions and can be slightly modded by looking for files on the ""no mutants allowed"" forums. It can be necessary nowadays to modify the variable for random encounters in the desert as without them you do not level your combat oriented character nearly enough while travelling, and the amount of random encounters decreases as a function of CPU power, the higher the CPU the faster you travel the less encounters you face, it is strange but that is the way it is coded. This game among with others of its kind has gotten me hooked the isometric perspective and I personally love the work that went into the animations. The character models are reused heaviliy throuought the game however, but there is a fair amount of variety in tiles for locations so you do not always run into the same kind of maps. There is no procedural generation here everything was handcrafted.A masterpiece in my humble opinion and one that sets a personal standard for what a RPG is, your character and your choices will influence the play experience quite a lot here.

												This game is legendarily great. The gameplay and story are compelling, but the world is the real star of the show here. That, and Harold and Dogmeat. They're stars too.Tips for companions:Dogmeat is a machine. Doesn't do much damage, but moves ridiculous distances, attacks 4 times a round, knocks enemies down all over the place so that you can 95% critical their eyes, and, most importantly, is the emotional heart of the story. I kept him alive all the way.Tycho is great. He's smart, durable, and funny. Just keep him stocked with shotgun shells and Stimpaks and he'll never let you down. Unfortunately, he died in the Cathedral.Ian is a staple for the first part of the game, but by the time you get power armor he's basically obsolete. I let him go eventually.Katja can mark the Cathedral on your map. That's about it. I made the mistake of giving her an SMG, and eventually abandoned her along with Ian. Hopefully they're fine in the middle of the desert.P.S. The gory death animations are fine, but the fact that they're used as rewards for winning makes them that much more priceless.P.P.S. I accidentally dropped Vree's holodisk moments after getting it in the Brotherhood base, later realized how important it is, went back, and, months later, it was still there. The Brotherhood really needs a janitor.			"

												Tried it about 8 years ago before I had steam, hated it. Tried it last year when I got the anthology, hated it. Had nothing better to do last week and tried it, amazing. If you actually put some time into this game its great, though it's short, and somewhat lackluster, but it is the first in the series and nearly 20 years old. I'd say it hasn't aged well at all, which is what would put people off. But you should give it a try.			"

												Highly recommend, for any Fallout fan especially. But if you are not a big fan of Fallout, purchase with caution! This game has shown to be unpopular among people such as my friends. But if you're looking for a new post-apocolypse game, from a interesting old-timey prespective in the sky to play, I'd say give it a try!The game is amazing. A real great start to what would become the franchise of Fallout. There are many bugs like with any game, and in my opinion, this game is unfinished in vanilla version. With ending scripts and such not working, quests being non-avaible that break a players potentally desired choices, yadda yadda ... And I believe it was said because of time restraints. Which was sad, that they couldn't fix all this first.So because of these reasons, I point people toward looking up the mod ""Fallout Fixt"" which fixes basically all of this. A super mod that really re-added that kick in the game for me, after finishing it vanilla wise. Making it more so how it was expected to be played, and should be played. Though don't forget to play vanilla first alone, to see what I mean. Even adds a few other goodies too, which makes it all that sweeter. I consider this mod an essential part of the game when I play it now, you could say.Cough And between you and me, this may just be my favorite Fallout with the mod! "

												The game you see now - the undying classic. Everything that has ever been invented in the gaming industry on the part of the post-apocalyptic theme is taken from here. Small half-savage community, cruelty, harsh conditions of survival in a post-apocalyptic world, drugs, cheap alcohol, women of easy virtue. All this was first trumpeted in the distant 90's it was in this game. Unfortunately, in this version, provided it has not provided a Russian translation, but as they say, ""It is better to touch the classics intact."" For those who have problems with English - it is better not to go into the jungle as menus, dialogs and other very confusing and alien to ordinary Russian. No other game did not cause me so much emotion as fallout and, as in the case of tens of thousands of other fans, this game for many decades will warm the hearts of all of us - fans of post-apocalyptic RPG.

But it's the side quests that makes Fallout such a good game. If you just run main story.. First of all, it's gonna be HARD! Secondly, you'll miss out on what makes Fallout so great.I give Fallout 7/10 kittens.The main thing that bugs me is the controls, but for a game being almost 20 years old.. It still rocks!			"

												This game did something only one other 90's game did for me (Half-Life). It took a genre that we know and love today, and redefines it. This game is one of the best, if not THE best RPG I've ever played.+ Amazing atmosphere+ A great amount of detail. Every place feels hand crafted, and polished+ S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a creative way to create your character, rather than making cosmetic changes that RPG's do today+ Pure freedom is encouraged. Fallout 3 and New Vegas are good games, but I believe the first gives the most freedom.+ A few very different, creative, and even horrifying alternative endings+ Great soundtrack, accompanied by The Ink Spots, my favorite 30's-40's band!+ A large amount of enemies. From mutants, to raiders, radscorpions, rats, and tons more+ A great amount of weapons as well. Trust me though, energy weapons are your friend. Remember that while playing.+ Different ways to approach about any mission+ Great final ""Boss"" with 3 different ways to deal with him. No spoilers, sorry+ Writing is alright, surprisingly! A mix of serious and funny! ""Moo, I say!"" -Brahmin+ Although there aren't a whole ton of locations like in F3, and FNV, these locations are huge and branched out.+ You can actually join different factions, rather than sitting next to them feeling like a sidekick. In F3, you helped the Brotherhood of Steel. In F1, you straight up join them!+ Interesting characters all over the world+ Followers that can help you on your quest. Remember, their death is permanent!+ The animation in the game is surprisingly good! The cutscenes are amazing as well, especially for it's time.+ The story seems so simple. ""Go get a water chip"" is the beggining, but it eventually branches out and has a good amount of lore in it as well+ Rather than helping someone in the Crimson Caravan find love (Fallout New Vegas), you actually get to join up with the caravan and make a good amount of caps from it, too+ A good 14 Hours long from what I've played. This is the longest 90's game I've ever played that kept me entertained the whole time+/- You can accidentally shoot your partners. Although it may only happen a few times for you, it will happen a lot with your partners shooting you.- A bit of an anticlimax ""Good Ending"", which is the one I got. Again, no spoilers- A few bugs, too. I can still ask for a water purification chip even though I found it a year ago- The shown chance of hitting a target is a bit off sometimes. ""95% chance to hit this rat twice!? I got thi... I missed both times...""9.5/10 An Outstanding TitleThis is a prime example of what RPG's should be. True freedom to do just about anything, anytime. If you're getting Fallout 1 & 2, just buy the Classic Collection. You'll get Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel along with Fallout 1 & 2 (3 games for the price of 2). Well, off to Fallout 2! Wish me luck!			"

												ah yes, Fallout. The real deal. Playing it now i can say, even with ""everyone has his own taste"" and ""some people like this or that"", people who think Fallout 3 is better than this game can go to hell. We don't need these people. And i say this as someone who's first Fallout was Fallout 3. Yes, that FPS was my first Fallout and i came to this later on.The German version is a joke. Even the cut German CD version was better. Here on steam they just took everything out without thinking or testing. The red keycard that you HAVE TO GET in the glow is found on a burnd body. In the old german cd version of the game, the keycard was just on the ground instat. In the cut-steam version, they just took the body out with all loot on it.They took a item that you HAVE TO get out because it isn't uncut. No replacement, just give up.Game works fine on win 7 64bit, for me. Fallout 1 is better than Fallout 3. I don't care if you have a ""other opinion"", it is just nonsense. The german steam version is missing key-items for the game.			"

												I cannot play this because the graphics are too outdated for my GPU (GTX 760) so I legitimately can't see anything on the game screen unless I wave my mouse over it, and even then it's difficult to read the text as this game was clearly not made for 1920 x 1080 (60Hz) HD resolutions. The cutscenes were just a mash of 256-bit colours and were unviewable due to my GPU, and I couldn't make out what the images were.I know for a FACT that ALL Fallout games (save for New Vegas) were and are excellent games. I do recommend this because of its reputation as a solid 10/10 title. Even though I cannot see anything, it's still a good game regardless.			"

												Let me begin by saying i have played every fallout game to date.Fallout is a Open World Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, Which Is Set 80 Years after the Nuclear War which nearly brought an end to mankind there were a few lucky survivors who were able to enter these giant underground Vault's on the day that the bombs dropped, you were born in Vault 13.The Main Story Plot of Fallout is that Your Vaults Water Purification Chip has Broken and that means that The Vault will run out of drinking water very soon so the Vault's Overseer Send's you the Vault Dweller out on a Quest to find a replacement Water Chip.Gameplay in Fallout centers around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Fallout deviates from most role-playing video games in that it often allows for the player to complete tasks in multiple ways, often choosing solutions that are unconventional or even contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still be rewarded. The player's actions may ultimately dictate the ending of the game, or what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat. Non-combat portions of the game are typically played in real-time.Combat in Fallout is turn-based. The game uses an action point system wherein, each turn, multiple actions may be performed until all points in the pool have been expended. Different actions consume different numbers of points, and the maximum number of points that can be spent may be affected by such things as chems or perks. 'Melee' (hand to hand) weapons typically offer multiple attack types, such as 'Swing' and 'Thrust' for knives. Unarmed attacks offer many attack types, including 'Punch' and 'Kick'. Players may equip at most two weapons, and the player can switch between them by clicking a button. The Perception attribute determines characters' 'Sequence' number, which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and subsequently get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximum range of ranged weapons, and the chance to hit with them.I Would Recomend Fallout To any fan of the Series Or Newcomer.			"

One in particular I'd recommend is Fallout FIXT.			"

												I'm not a fan of turn based games but this one managed to suck me right in. Good writing, story, gameplay, art design, the works. It can be a bit confusing and buggy at times but there are work arounds. Please take a look at Star1s3's guide on how to get it working for higher resolutions and what mods you may want.

												I played this game when it was first released way back before steam was around ,for me this is one of my all time favourite games i have spent countless hours playing this series ,the replay value of this game is massive with different reactions and actions in game depending on which character and how you play it ,i wish games were still made as solidly as this one is ,sure it doesnt have all the pretty visuals of todays game but the story line and the virtual bond you create with your charater is something almost all of todays modern games lack.Do yourself a favor if you liked Fallout 3 etc ,give these older Fallout's a try :)			"

												This game did something only one other 90's game did for me (Half-Life). It took a genre that we know and love today, and redefines it. This game is one of the best, if not THE best RPG I've ever played.+ Amazing atmosphere+ A great amount of detail. Every place feels hand crafted, and polished+ S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a creative way to create your character, rather than making cosmetic changes that RPG's do today+ Pure freedom is encouraged. Fallout 3 and New Vegas are good games, but I believe the first gives the most freedom.+ A few very different, creative, and even horrifying alternative endings+ Great soundtrack, accompanied by The Ink Spots, my favorite 30's-40's band!+ A large amount of enemies. From mutants, to raiders, radscorpions, rats, and tons more+ A great amount of weapons as well. Trust me though, energy weapons are your friend. Remember that while playing.+ Different ways to approach about any mission+ Great final ""Boss"" with 3 different ways to deal with him. No spoilers, sorry+ Writing is alright, surprisingly! A mix of serious and funny! ""Moo, I say!"" -Brahmin+ Although there aren't a whole ton of locations like in F3, and FNV, these locations are huge and branched out.+ You can actually join different factions, rather than sitting next to them feeling like a sidekick. In F3, you helped the Brotherhood of Steel. In F1, you straight up join them!+ Interesting characters all over the world+ Followers that can help you on your quest. Remember, their death is permanent!+ The animation in the game is surprisingly good! The cutscenes are amazing as well, especially for it's time.+ The story seems so simple. ""Go get a water chip"" is the beggining, but it eventually branches out and has a good amount of lore in it as well+ Rather than helping someone in the Crimson Caravan find love (Fallout New Vegas), you actually get to join up with the caravan and make a good amount of caps from it, too+ A good 14 Hours long from what I've played. This is the longest 90's game I've ever played that kept me entertained the whole time+/- You can accidentally shoot your partners. Although it may only happen a few times for you, it will happen a lot with your partners shooting you.- A bit of an anticlimax ""Good Ending"", which is the one I got. Again, no spoilers- A few bugs, too. I can still ask for a water purification chip even though I found it a year ago- The shown chance of hitting a target is a bit off sometimes. ""95% chance to hit this rat twice!? I got thi... I missed both times...""9.5/10 An Outstanding TitleThis is a prime example of what RPG's should be. True freedom to do just about anything, anytime. If you're getting Fallout 1 & 2, just buy the Classic Collection. You'll get Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel along with Fallout 1 & 2 (3 games for the price of 2). Well, off to Fallout 2! Wish me luck!			"

												10/10 - A shining pinnacle of human achievement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GRAPHICS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, graphics aren't everything to me. I grew up with Atari, Apple ][e, PowerMacs, NES, and so on. Fallout uses the good old 800x600 overhead isometric view, and does it quite right. The game has a fair amount of variety in the appearance of the locations, though the ""cave"" areas tend to get a bit too familiar. There is a ton of variety in the objects used, and a lot of areas are just really nice art to look at. It holds up for me, personally. Objectively, it looked great when it came out, but was kind of bashed a bit for not being a light sourced 3D game. Those were the expectations of the time.The best part about the various character models in the game is the way that they are torn apart, melted, disintegrated, exploded and otherwise ended when you discharge your fury on them. The flamethrower is good for laughs, especially. It certainly followed through on the vision of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, in that respect. The dialouge sequences with certain characters brings you to a great looking 3D model of the character's animated head, but other wise all characters are rather small and faceless.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The music, combined with the graphics, creates a thick, perfect layer of atmosphere. The desolation and tension of this setting really is emphasized by the great music. Composer Mark Morgan totally nailed it. The various gunshots, laser beams, rockets and explosions of combat all sound great. The 10mm Handgun especially has a very satisfying ""THUD"" to it.The voice acting is frigging phenominal. Frank Welker, Ron Perlman, Tony Shalhoub, Tress MacNeille, and a bunch more take care of voicing the metric ton of dialouge that exists for all cut scenes and plot ""essential"" characters. It all sounds so good, you will want to have the sound and music turned up nice and loud while you play. Really, really good.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Movement while exploring is similar to Diablo, point and click to go. When combat starts, the game switches to turn based mode. This is where how you build your skills and equip your character matters more than how fast you can click on different things. It is possible to gimp your character, and die repeatedly if you don't pay attention to some basic survival needs. Such as at least one strong combat skill, and average intelligence at the very barest of minimums. Intelligence is responsible for getting more points to put into skills when you level up. One or more of your various skills is going to determine your success in pretty much everything you can do in this game. Speech can be a path netting some extra information and reward often enough that I find it useful too. At least a smattering of everything will come in handy, but I personally wouldn't go without lockpick, medicine (for healing and for quests), and science. For combat, anything will do, but bear two things in mind. Be the best. Choose one of the various combat skills, and pump points into it every level until it is at least 75. Then keep rasing it, but it isn't so much of a priority compared to diversity at that point. Smal guns are the most widely available, but don't let that keep you from choosing your own path as they are all viable. It is possible to ""play the bad guy"" and destroy your karmaic reputation in order to steal, murder, and otherwise plunder the shambles of a society that remains on Earth. Indeed, some quests and items are most easily and quickly performed by stealing something, or locking the door and murdering someone. But, your karma follows you around in this game. At a certain point, you will be unwelcome. Then, people might want to kill you for what you have done. I find that the path of the righteous leads to far greater reward in terms of XP, in this game. There is a wide variety of weapons, armor, enemies, and locations for battle. The battles can play out rather slowly, and being turn based are not everyone's cup of whatever. The game can be rather challenging at the start if you aren't used to these sorts of games, but the difficulty can be changed at any time in game. The game is kind of equal parts combat and exploration. There is a great deal of humor in both, and I have spent plenty of time just watching random NPC's interact with each other. It all piles on to the atmosphere of the fledgling civilization struggling to survive in the harsh new hell they created, only to be found repeating the same death spiral pattern of behaviors that set them on the path in the first place.If you aren't immediately turned off by the graphics and the turn based nature of the game play, then this game might be for you. It is one of the precursors to such games as the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale serieseses.. es. Planescape Torment. Shares team members with Knights of The Old Republic 1 and 2, Fallout New Vegas, Arcanum, and a few more greatest role playing games ever. (KOTOR 2 and Greyhawk have at least been fixed and patched to greatness on PC...) But Fallout and Fallout 2 have always been my very favorites and the most replayed. If you dig a little, you will find that there is a ton of depth and character in this rather slow paced old school game.(Never you mind what the ""hours played"" on Steam says, my Steam was mostly offline for intermittent years. When I played the game for hundreds of hours since its release, it was the CD-rom version.)			"

												One of the best games I have ever played and was surprised to see that it didn't have 99% for positive reviews. So naturally I checked them and can confirm that roughly every negative review was from some retard who didn't so much as look at screenshots, doesn't have any patience whatsoever (I dont even know how you could need patience for this game but people said it was to slow???), and failed to try and even understand how to play the game. Example being ""I can never hit anything"" Most likely but everything into melee and tried to make eye shots with a gun completely ignoring the % chances to hit specific areas. Normally I would suggest looking at negative reviews because they can point out some huge drawbacks in the game that might make you want to rethink buying it, but in this case they are all pretty much written by ADHD children who wanted a first person shooter (again not a single look at the screenshots).  The only decent one was the top voted one that talked about how this is ""slightly"" censored and you cant kill children, which I agree is complete bull... You probably want to play with the Fixt mod for this game, basically its a giant patch, doesnt really add anything and the few things it does add are entirely optional. (psst with this you can make your companions move the ♥♥♥♥ out of the door finally). If you truly want to see the game for what it is and get a good idea watch some youtube videos of this game, it is a popular game and has many HD videos with/without clear commentary.Side note: Also dont judge the positive reviews based on time, because with that patch along with the one for fallout 2 you load the game diferently and it doesn't go through steam. Hence fewer hours being shown.			"

Just buy it and play it already.It would be amazing if they could make more games like this one with the apocalyptic theme and perhaps the mythology one.Don't let the graphics bother you, this game is amazing and it's totally playable. Anyway, a real gamer knows that graphics are not what makes the game.9.5/10 I would suggest it to any apocalyptic, Fallout, WRPG, classic, open world, isometric, turn-based, atmospheric and retro fans.

												So one day i bought FALLOUT  and i had already played 3 and new vegas before that, and i had no expirence with turn-based bird-view RPGS, so it was really hard to get into this game and i was almost to the point with saying F this game.But i kept playing and now I F*****G LOVE THIS GAME <3 <3 <3 <3 <3.So first of all the story:So the story is quite simple you are from a working vault called Vault 13, but suddenly the Overseer(king of the vault)says that we are running out of drinking water and he wants you to find them a waterchip to fix thier problem. The waterchip is used to fix up radiated water.One thing i really love about this game is that you can complete all the main quests without any help or given locations.Like for example one girl actually knows where to find the waterchip and it is in a place that you could get a holodisk to find or you could just travel around the wasteland until you find it.another thing is that the water quest is actually timed so you have about 120 days to find it or else you loose the game!! So now i will give  pros and cons about ths gamePROS-gameplay that works-great story-pretty good graphics- talking like a retard with low intellgence skill-TOO AWESOME-can be played on pretty much any computer-CONS-no journal, what i mean by that is that i tried doing a quest for someone and he said something about go west then south when you find this place and then kill them, but i completely forgot where to go and he didn't mention it again so i either had to remember it or write down on a piece of paper, it's not a big deal but i didn't like it :(-too short dunno man i just wanted more.-MY OPINION i only thought this game was awesome when i had good guns and protection, but that's just me and not really a con but i had to mention it.-No freeplay after main quests, this really sucks if you have unfinished side quests that play a big role but actually in the end the narroter tells about what happend to ceartain places if you didn't help them which is really cool ;DSO overall i think that this is one  of the best RPGS ever made even though i'm not a hardocre RPG'r,i will say that this is proabaly one of the best games that i ever played in my life, AND i cannot wait to play fallout 2 i'll just wait for a discount though.OKAY I'VE TALKED ENOUGH THIS GAME GET'S A 8.9/10  "

												Where it all started, Fallout. Before Bethesda got the rights to the Fallout series and gave us the wonders of Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4, Fallout was owned by Interplay and Black Isle studios. The classic Fallout games (1-tactics) were isometric turn based rpgs with a heavy open world exploration aspect to them. Now, jumping away from the history lesson and back to the game at hand. Fallout is a gritty, post apocolyptic rpg set after a nuclear war. And it really shows, raiders, super mutuants, anything in this wastland can be a friend or most likely a foe. The game can be very diffucult if you don't know what to expect. Everything you encounter, from cave rats to the brotherhood of steel, can kill you. Here's some spoilers, so don't touch if you don't want the story ruined. Ready? Alright.  You're tasked by the overseer of vault 13 to find a new water chip for the vault, as the one they have has died and water is running low. Setting off into a cave and the huge wastes, you must find a water chip and destroy the ever looming threat of the supermutant army, led by the Master. Once you complete these tasks in any order you please, you return to the vault you just saved....only to be banished.  If you're looking for a long, difficult at times, classic rpg, you should turn to the classic Fallout series. A definite must buy for any rpg fan.			"

												Fallout is possibly the first game to have a wide variety of choices and consequences. (and perks/traits.) And it shouldn't be played just because it's the first to do it, but because it does it very well.It starts with a simple premise: You live in an underground nuclear fallout shelter (aka, a Vault) 80 years after a two-hour war between China and the US basically ended up in the both countries getting wholly nuked, and the water chip that keeps a supply of water to the whole Vault was damaged, and you were the unlucky one to have to venture out into the outside world to find the closest Vault and get another chip to save everyone you know. You are expelled into a cave full of rats (the ultimate and classic RPG enemy) and have to venture out, the first of your Vault to do so.Fallout's system, SPECIAL, was made in a week (with the exception of perks), and it shows. The original goal of the team, when the game still had a license for GURPS (another system) was that no skill or stat should be useless. Well, first tip to creating a character: dump Charisma and get 4 free stat points. There are also a lot of mostly useless skills, but anyone with half a brain should distinguish the useless from the useful.Combat is nothing special, except for the gory death animations: When getting crits with different weapons, enemies (or you) will die in very elaborate deaths: getting cut in half by the sheer amount of bullet holes a burst fire of a mini-gun has gave you, for example! It's pretty fun, even though the combat itself lacks tactical depth (sure, you can aim at limbs, eyes and crotch, but you'll end up shooting eyes always - well, maybe crotch for some amusing banter :))It's not a very long game, but throughout it you venture through several settlements that have been built   by the surivivors of California.

												Fallout is possibly the first game to have a wide variety of choices and consequences. (and perks/traits.) And it shouldn't be played just because it's the first to do it, but because it does it very well.It starts with a simple premise: You live in an underground nuclear fallout shelter (aka, a Vault) 80 years after a two-hour war between China and the US basically ended up in the both countries getting wholly nuked, and the water chip that keeps a supply of water to the whole Vault was damaged, and you were the unlucky one to have to venture out into the outside world to find the closest Vault and get another chip to save everyone you know. You are expelled into a cave full of rats (the ultimate and classic RPG enemy) and have to venture out, the first of your Vault to do so.Fallout's system, SPECIAL, was made in a week (with the exception of perks), and it shows. The original goal of the team, when the game still had a license for GURPS (another system) was that no skill or stat should be useless. Well, first tip to creating a character: dump Charisma and get 4 free stat points. There are also a lot of mostly useless skills, but anyone with half a brain should distinguish the useless from the useful.Combat is nothing special, except for the gory death animations: When getting crits with different weapons, enemies (or you) will die in very elaborate deaths: getting cut in half by the sheer amount of bullet holes a burst fire of a mini-gun has gave you, for example! It's pretty fun, even though the combat itself lacks tactical depth (sure, you can aim at limbs, eyes and crotch, but you'll end up shooting eyes always - well, maybe crotch for some amusing banter :))It's not a very long game, but throughout it you venture through several settlements that have been built   by the surivivors of California. You will have several multi-pathed quests and consequences, though, sadly, most of the consequences are only showed in the slideshow at the end of the game. Still, you will feel that your choices matter. The atmosphere is great, with no small influence of the great ambient soundtrack Mark Morgan produced, and the game gets better the more you progress into it: The final two areas have the most different ways of approaching the obstacles presented, and the game ends with one of the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""final bosses"" of game history, if you choose to not kill him directly: You talk him out of doing spoiler , but your speech skill won't do it alone.

												Fallout was the first computer game I ever owned. I have played every game in the series, including the horrible tactics. But every now and then I have to go back and revisit what started it all for me.This is a classic RPG that changed the consequence game for us all and if you enjoy the newest games in the series, you should check out where it all began. A great story, challenging game play and horrible 90's graphics!			"

												I played this game when it first came out on PC. Back when Nintendo and Sega were the only names in console gaming. For those who played fallout 3,  New Vegas and 4 only you might find this a boring and short adaptation of the ones you have played. But for the older gamers who still say things like ""ff7 was the best one"" and ""back in my day we were lucky to just have 32 bits"" this is the game for you. Also it may confuse the **** out of you with the insane differences in plot lines between the original fallouts and the modern ones. Worse time paradoxes than the terminator movies so try not to over think it.			"

Simple Review: Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing GameThe original Fallout.  A true masterpiece in many regards.  The story is very good from start to finish. and will be something that you won't forget.  As a player you're put under a lot of pressure throughout the story, but are given just enough oppurtunities to succeed.  The characters are well written and all have distinct personalities.  Characters in the game have integrity and interacting with them can bring rewards but also many consequences, and it feels just right.  The environments are superbly done graphically for the time, and are also very detailed.  Every place that you visit during the game can tell its own story through the art and flavor text from examining objects.  The roleplaying experience is almost perfect, allowing you do create virtually any kind of post-apocalyptic survivor imaginable.  The game also gives you at least two if not more ways to approach every quest in the game, so playing can suit the character that you've created.  The gameplay through combat and interacting with the environment however aren't done nearly as well as the rest of the game.  The combat is unbalanced, favoring certain weapon types heavily over others at various points in the game, while practically neglecting a whole weapon type for the entire game up until the final few of hours of play time.  Many skills that have to do with environmental puzzles are almost entirely useless and are only applicable in a few areas of the game,  with one skill being (for all intents and purposes) completely useless throughout the whole game.  Despite these setbacks the other areas of the game more than make up for it all, and will end up delivering a remarkable experience.  If you like turn-based role playing games from the golden era of PC gaming, this should be a no brainer.  For everybody else I would still highly recommend this game.			"

												+Great game, lotta fun once you figure out the combat system+Learn a lot about the Fallout universe that you wouldn't know from only playing 3 or New Vegas, such as what happened at other Vaults, the origins of things like super-mutants and Raiders+Awesome weapons+Turn-based combat is tough and always keeps you on your toes+Enemies are scarier as a result+As far as I know, you can't become an invincible god like in 3 and New Vegas which gives you a sense of humility+Which also forces you to fight cautiously, strategically and pick your battles+Random events are either positive or negative so you're hopeful, yet cautious when traveling+In-game time is important, which gives a sense of immersion+In-game time isn't too fast or too slow, it's just right+It also goes into much more vivid detail than most games, there's an in-game calendar and things happen on certain dates, most games do night/day like , occasionally you'll see a game that does time of the day or day of the week+No fast traveling like in 3 or New Vegas. Instead of pulling up your Pip Boy and selecting a place, you have to actually leave your current city, then travel to the next. You're shown a map of the whole area and once you click somewhere, your guy moves as in-game time flies by at a realistic and believable pace. You also slow down at mountains and stuff, to make it seem more like you're climbing them. Occasionally, you get a random event which stops your traveling and gives you more of a feeling like your actually adventuring-Combat system is hard to get used to-Enemies can be a bit too tough at times-If there are too many enemies, you're going to die, no matter how much skill or luck you possess-If there are enough NPCs during a battle, you have to wait forever for your turn as each NPC moves and attacks one at a time, especially during missions where you help escort the Crimson Caravan-During such battle, I bet I could walk away from my computer, make a sandwich, and come back and still be waiting for my turn-Turn based combat is annoying and confusing before you learn how it works, which is not easy because it isn't self-explanatory in any way+/- Even though it's Fallout, it has a completely different feel if you're like most Fallout players if you've only played 3 or New Vegas. I like this fact, but I can imagine that others wouldn't+/- Neurtal NPCs react to you unholstering your weapon. From a realism point of view, it makes sense, but from a gameplay point of view, it can be annoying			"

												This game is quite old, feels kinda nostalgic no matter if you have played it or not (or if you ever played turn-based strategy games with 2d-graphics). It got a lot of hidden stuff which rewards the highly curious looter. It got a lot of funny dialogues and what you will find will truly be amazing. If you like slow-paced RPG’s with highly immersive and unpredictable environment, then this is the game for you. Definitely give it a go if you are into some of Bethesda’s continuation of these games. "

												“The struggle for survival is a war without end. And war… war never changes.”Fallout is one of those rare role-playing games oozing quality from every pore – one might even say radiate. The gameplay is smooth, using action points for movement and combat. In addition it has one of the best character development systems you can wish for. The amazing story, great love for detail and high replayability make for an excellent gaming experience.Fun fact: Fallouts retro-futurism has been inspired by 1950s pulp magazines, superhero comics of Atomic Age and classic Science Fiction films such as Forbidden Planet. There are also many references to the events and the style of Wasteland (PC game from 1988) in the Fallout series, which is why Fallout is sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland.--My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(I am the bringer of death! Fall to your knees and beg for mercy… or give me a sandwich, I’m pretty hungry.)Characters: S-Rank (Do I have to sacrifice a puppy to join?)Details: S-Rank (To see a valley filled with my enemies’ heads mounted on spears. A silent valley, except for the wind whistling through their ears.)Tactical gameplay: S-Rank (Don’t drink glowing water.)Story: S-Rank (There is a bad place where the bad mutants come from. It is bad. Vault is good. Please, go and destroy bad place.)Combat & Controls: S-Rank (Excuse me while I gloat…)--There are no achievements to conquer.Achievement difficulty: none--Fallout: New Vegas (PC) – Action role-playing game (Post-apocalyptic Science Fiction) – 2010 -Fallout 3 (PC) – Action role-playing game (Post-apocalyptic Science Fiction) – 2008-Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (PC) – Squad-based strategy game (Post-apocalyptic Science Fiction) – 2001http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/recommended/38420/-Fallout 2 (PC) – Turn-based role-playing game (Post-apocalyptic Science Fiction) – 1998http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/recommended/38410/-Fallout 1 (PC) – Turn-based role-playing game (Post-apocalyptic Science Fiction) – 1997			"

I haven't downloaded anything more complicated than a webm in about three years though so take it from me when I say that this is some good stuff.Save often though. It's kinda hard sometimes, and you can screw yourself over a bit. By the way, Ian is a damn terrible shot.

Luego fue cuando vino lo de ""War...the war never changes"" y asi dio comienzo una de las mejores sagas de todos los tiempos.Si alguien necesita que le expliquen el porque y el como es porque es un recien llegado o porque no tiene ni iidea de que va todo esto.  Fallout es la historia viva del genero, es el alfa y el omega, es el principio de todo. Y sobre todo Fallout es IMPRESCINDIBLE.			"

												I found the first Fallout game in the series to be absolutely amazing! Takes a little time to adjust to turn based strategy if you have never played one before. All gamers must adapt to different gaming styles, and this game has a solid story and massive open world for 1997 to say the least. So if you are looking to start the series please take a look at this game. I give this game a 10/10			"

												One of the best RPGs ever created, and the first game in one of the greatest game series of all time. If you're a fan of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, you need to play Fallout & Fallout 2. If you're a fan of RPGs, you need to play Fallout, if you're a fan of original, immersive, interesting, and amusing games with interesting characters, quests, worlds, and items, you need to play Fallout. The biggest complaint I hear people give Fallout and Fallout 2 is that they're ""outdated"" and that they've aged terribly, when this simply isn't the case. And what's worse, is that I hear this from people who supposedly claim to be HUGE Fallout fans. Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game becuase it combines the skillful writing, RPG elements, and interesting characters and places from Fallout and Fallout 2, AND the first/third-person 3D open-world that I am used to, but even then I'm still able to turn off my FPS fanboy goggles for a little while to play an Isometric turn-based RPG because I love Fallout. I just really can't understand, if you really love Fallout, how any of the supposedly ""outdated"" elements of the original two games can hinder you from enjoying them, grow a pair and play them, It's not that difficult.Compared to Fallout 2, Fallout is probably a little lacking, as Fallout 2 practically improves in every single aspect of the game, a larger game world with more quests, more people to meet and more places to explore, however, the only thing FO2 doesn't really improve upon was the somewhat ""serious"" tone in the original, as Fallout 2 makes Fallout look like Heavy Rain in comparison. Although I myself prefer Fallout 2 for the reasons listed above, the original is still one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and of course, the forerunner for the complete Fallout series, which, for good or bad, is still going strong today. Also, don't give Ian the SMG.R.I.P. Ian, died while rescuing Tandi from the Raiders.R.I.P. Tycho, died while cleansing the Deathclaws from the Warehouse.R.I.P. Dogmeat, died while eradicating the Super Mutants from the Watershed.R.I.P. Katja, died while fighting the Super Mutants in the LA Vault.PS, game can actually run on Windows 7, *cough* Fallout 3 *cough*			"

												This pretty much sums up my opinion of the game. Yeah. That good.1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)2 tablespoons sugar2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup milk2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil1 large egg1 tablespoon vegetable oilAssorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate syrupPreheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.			"

												I have already played this game via buying a soldout software collection. I spent many hours playing this game and I admit I needed a walkthrough as the difficulty of this game is based on you have a limited number of days, based on the storyline.The Story: For those who don't know, you start out as a vault dweller whose parents took shelter in vault 13 along with many others to avoid the coming nucular missiles at the height of World War 3. The residents are meant to stay in the vault until such a time as the raditation levels have gone down low enough as to not be a issue, however your vault's water chip has broken. The main source of drinking water based on a recycling system in the vault. As they have no other option, they need to send out one of the residents and you volunteer to enter a world that has completely changed since your ancestors walked the surface during the war and find a new water chip as the Overseer knows of a nearby vault (Vault 15) which may have a spare chip to use.The combat system is turn-based and on a invisible hex-grid. It is also based on Action Points and in combat uses what was called the VATS system where you can aim for a specific point on the creature, but if you were to take the trait that lets you shoot more often (forgot it's name) you will be unable to do accurate aiming. It's a old-school PC RPG where your decisions are totally up to you and ethics are optional in how you get the waterchip or where from. With multiple endings and detailed tellings of what happened to the places you visited, after you left leaves the game open for many multiple play throughts  for endless gameplay and always discover new things and easter eggs such as ""the holy hand grenade."" and other references too numerous to count.A brilliant game and well worth a purchas if you are after a old-school RPG, but as it is so old and not altered for modern systems (unlike on GoG) you will need to look up how to run the game without weird graphical glitches.

												as you have most likely read the gameplay is nothing like fallout new vegas or fallout three, but if you are willing to give this game a shot i am sure you will be surprised by the sheer awesomness of this game, sure it doesnt have the best graphics but if that is the only reason that you buy a game then you are not the smart consumer, now to the review, the guns are confusing to reload aat first but fast once you figure it out, the combat is turn based so it isint the they are shooting at you while they are shooting you but it can be just as exciting as some of the battles in fallout three and fallout new vegas, the story starts out slow then picks up later, so onto the pros and cons.pros+entertaining+good atmosphere+good dialogue+you reflect your intelligence (you dont speak the engrish if you set your intelligence below 4)+ interesting npc'scons-random encounters can be to difficult for low level players (3 radscorpions at level one)-wierd barter systemfallout always has been and will always will be one of my favorite game seriesoverall I would rate it a 9/10			"

												Pop some mentats, grab a Nuka-Cola and have a blast. Don't let my time on this game fool you, I have played it through at least 4 times outside Steam, if I had played it with Steam (at the time) I think would have at least 80-100h on it.Fallout, where it all started. The atmosphere, the ambient music, the amazing characters, the vast interesting world, the combat system there is nothing I can name that I do not love about Fallout. The many different playstyles you can go at this game makes each new playthrough a fresh experience. This is and always will be a game I come back to time to time like a really good book you just want to pick up and read through at least once a year. The immersion alone makes this game a treat.Definitely a masterpiece that to this day is with great looking visuals, immersive world and just plain fun gameplay.			"

												I bought this game after I played Fallout: New Vegas a while back, I never got around to playing it much, but from what I've played it's a very enjoyable game, the only flaw I'd say is that it's a tad dated for todays general audience, but if you're a Fallout fan, you need to try the game that started it all!And also, if you're like me and got a couple colour related bugs when trying to play the game, the way in which to fix it is as follows:1. Get FAllout FIXT from here: http://www.nma-fallout.com/showthread.php?1945622. Copy that file over into your Fallout folder in Steam, so for example: Program Files (x86)/SteamApps/Common/Fallout3. Run the patch (the file) and follow the instructions from it4. You should have a file called ddraw.dll in your Fallout folder, rename this to f1ddraw.dll5. You're now ready to start Fallout with Steam :3 "

												I played this game to completion in 2001 when it was only available on cd-rom. Since then I purchased copies on GoG.com and Steam.Fallout is the standard by which every other entry in the franchise should be judged. It is the more focused, balanced, thematically coherent Fallout experience available and the only one released with main designers Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson still on board.By today's standards the game still hold up well even without fan patches and resolution mods, which are still strongly recommended. The engine and interface does show its age and the sequel, Fallout 2, improves a few things here and there. But the turn-based system and top down camera are not products of their times. First person view and real time combat are not ""modern"". Changing the former for the latter doesn't constitute an improvement, but a complete change of direction.This kind of game wasn't made that way due to technical limitations. Bethesda released its first Elder Scrolls game in 1994, the year Tim Cain started working on what would become Fallout. No, the intention was to make a computer rpg that felt like playing a pen & paper role playing game. It wasn't about player skills, but player choices. The perspective is from someone playing Dongeons & Dragons, Shadowrun or (more appropriately) GURPS, seeing the world through the maps and descriptions provided by the game master and, ultimately, interpreted by the player's imagination.It isn't the most popular perspective but a legitimate one nonetheless, which suits computer rpgs like a glove. This is how Fallout was meant to be played and, frankly, that's how it should have stayed.			"

												Released back in 1997, Fallout is still one of my favourite RPG's ever made. A spiritual successor to Wasteland with heavy influences from the 1981 movie Mad Max, this is a true blue, old school CRPG, no kiddies allowed. Don't expect any level of hand holding here. You're meant to explore, investigate, and actually think about what you do. Dialogue has meaning, and if you say or do the wrong thing, you might just♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off so bad you'll be screwed out of a quest forever. The combat is simple, yet deep enough to be engaging. Battles are turn-based, with action points determining how much you can do each turn. Most of the combat is driven by some heavy dice roll♥♥♥♥♥♥ so expect to be screwed over by a bad critical hit and lose all of your health in a single turn, when previous attack dealt zero damage.Most of the map is empty space. Instead of walking everywhere, you travel on a world map to locations of interest, wherein the real♥♥♥♥♥♥happens. Ranging from small settlements to the ruined remains of ancient cities, these locations are teeming with mysteries to unravel, choices to make, people to meet, items to loot, and a bunch of people to murder, if you're feeling sadistic. Quests often involve multiple outcomes, with several offering the choice between two opposing sides. Whether you're a ruthless mercenary willing to take on any job, a generous saviour, or an evil monster, this game accommodates you, allowing you to approach the game any way you see fit.The game's SPECIAL system offers a surprising amount of depth in character creation. Will you be a gun-toting wanderer who solves problems with his guns, or a smooth-talking snake who solves problems without ever resorting to violence? How about a strongman who smashes his foes with a sledgehammer but is so stupid he can't even carry a conversation with people? Yes, you can do that. No matter which perks you pick or what skills you invest in, you're character will always end up with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. With these systems, the player is given a great deal of options that allow them to fine-tune their character, creating a vastly unique playthrough each time. The story, characters, and setting are all iconic at this point. Though much of its aesthetic is derivative in some way, Fallout carved a unique personality of its own regardless. The narrative is nothing too complicated, and yet it's well-written and impactful at the same time, leading up to one of the best endings in RPG history. There's only three quests in the main plot lines, but these are long involving journeys that will take you all across post-apocalyptic Southern California. As you go from town to town, new quests, jobs, and side activities will open up, which can ultimately serve your primary objectives as well. Know that there is a finite end to the content, however. Though there's a lot to see and do (my first playthrough clocked in at about sixty hours), the game ends once you've beaten the main quest, and outside of that, you can't explore every nook and cranny like you can in Fallout: New Vegas. There's a limit to just how much you can do, but I feel this adds more to the experience, as it lends meaning to your actions. Don't expect to get every skill to a hundred and unlock every perk in a single playthrough.As a game that came out in the late nineties, there are definitely some issues. First, there are major graphical bugs which can be fixed, but may persist nonetheless in more benign forms, which is to be expected of a game that's almost seventeen years old. Then there's some other annoying nitpicks, like unintuitive UI that feels clunky and the odd limitation like not being able to move more than 999 bottle caps at a time when bartering. The AI can be absolute garbage at times, too. Let's put it this way. There were times when I felt grateful that one of my followers was standing in a corner and not fighting, because that means he couldn't shoot me in the back. Without the ability to control your party, things can get pretty frustrating later in the game, when you're rolling with a huge posse to beat the final boss. Hint: save often, and in many slots.So, would I reccomend this game? That depends. Are you looking for an old school CRPG with deep combat and meaningful choices and character growth? If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than Fallout.			"

												So I recently replayed this game for the first time since the 90's. Here's what I think now, without the nostalgia glasses on.Funny, slow, a bit repetitive but charming story.I probably killed the fun in this game when I figured out an exploit. I like to set my LUCK to 10 at the start of the game so I can more easily get the random event with the UFO. The UFO blast gun is hands down the most powerful gun in this game and it's the only thing you need to be successful. It's lightweight, holds tons of ammo and destroys everything you throw at it. Make sure to dump a ton of points into ENERGY weapons at the start and buy ammo from the hub. Another thing I did that I guess could be considered cheating was I boosted my gambling skill to around 60-70%. I gambled in the hub and the chance of you winning over losing is greater. I took 2 iPhones and postioned them on the keyboard to hold down 1 and 3 on the keyboard I believe. It forces the game to continue gambling rapidly. After 30 minutes I came back to discover I now have 250,000 bottlecaps!Anyways, the point I'm trying to get at is this game is pretty flexible and has some really unique elements you're not going to find anywhere else. I personally prefer this game and FO2 over the new Fallout games. I don't think Bethesda really fully grasped this franchise and how it's supposed to feel. +I'm a big fan of the SPECIAL system.+Combat is a bit lackluster but it works.+Make sure to speed up combat in options, otherwise companions will annoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.+Dogmeat companion.+The ending boss is hilarious and well worth the journey. Make sure to watch all of his responses on Youtube.-I wasn't a big fan of all they portrayed your vault. I think it would've been better to never have the ability to re-enter the vault 13 so your imagination can go crazy for how it should be in there.			"

												I have already played this game via buying a soldout software collection. I spent many hours playing this game and I admit I needed a walkthrough as the difficulty of this game is based on you have a limited number of days, based on the storyline.The Story: For those who don't know, you start out as a vault dweller whose parents took shelter in vault 13 along with many others to avoid the coming nucular missiles at the height of World War 3. The residents are meant to stay in the vault until such a time as the raditation levels have gone down low enough as to not be a issue, however your vault's water chip has broken. The main source of drinking water based on a recycling system in the vault. As they have no other option, they need to send out one of the residents and you volunteer to enter a world that has completely changed since your ancestors walked the surface during the war and find a new water chip as the Overseer knows of a nearby vault (Vault 15) which may have a spare chip to use.The combat system is turn-based and on a invisible hex-grid. It is also based on Action Points and in combat uses what was called the VATS system where you can aim for a specific point on the creature, but if you were to take the trait that lets you shoot more often (forgot it's name) you will be unable to do accurate aiming. It's a old-school PC RPG where your decisions are totally up to you and ethics are optional in how you get the waterchip or where from. With multiple endings and detailed tellings of what happened to the places you visited, after you left leaves the game open for many multiple play throughts  for endless gameplay and always discover new things and easter eggs such as ""the holy hand grenade."" and other references too numerous to count.A brilliant game and well worth a purchas if you are after a old-school RPG, but as it is so old and not altered for modern systems (unlike on GoG) you will need to look up how to run the game without weird graphical glitches.

												The Fallout series has been known for it's great exploration, looting fun, and character progression as you endure many different radioactive wastelands. But I think that Fallout 1 is by far the most immersive of them all. Although it's late 90's graphics are nothing compared to the modern graphic card melting games, this game's experience is told through reading, dialogue, scrounging for information, and plain old exploration. This game gives a more vivid and detailed image of what the reality of a open wasteland filled with murder and death feels lke than any other fallout's even come close to. That's more than enough reason to pick this game up, especially now that you can play it without uninstalling windows, thanks to Bethesda's new hi-resolution update!			"

												My introduction to the Fallout series was Fallout 3. I had never heard of the series before that, but after a few months (because I wasn't paying much attention to the community) I heard long time fans of the series were upset with how Bethesda handled the game. I wasn't completely disillusioned with Bethesda yet at this time and I hadn't started looking at things more critically, so I didn't understand the problem back then. I also had nothing else to compare it to at the time.Then Fallout: New Vegas came and it was better than FO3 in every way. Then Fallout 4 came and it was worse than about anything I could compare it to in very nearly every way. During this time I had tried to get into Fallout 1 a number of times, but never really did, farthest I had made it was to Shady Sands before quitting. Until this past week, that is. According to Steam I've played about 18 hours in the past week and I'm really loving it so far and I can see why so many long time fans have an issue with Fallout 3 and 4.			"

												Wow, where do I begin? You can probably tell by looking at my profile picture that I'm a fan of this particular franchise. Let me tell you a story about how my Fallout journey began... Back when I was a young lad, I was thumbing through a gaming mag (believe it or not, that's what we had to do before the internet exploded) and saw a page dedicated to Fallout 2, with some screenshots and synopsis, etc. 'This is interesting' I thought to myself, fresh off the high that I got from playing Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII; I was excited for more deep, mature and thought-provoking games. But then I noticed that it was a computer game, which is, sadly, rather hard to play when you don't have a computer. So I let it go. Fast forward a year or two later and there's a new PC in the den, but by then I had already forgotten about that obscure magazine article... But luckily, later that year on my 17th birthday, I was in a retail store looking for ways to waste my money. While walking toward the Playstation aisle I passed by a small section dedicated to PC games. It was a pathetic display, mostly consisting of FMV puzzle games and flight sims. But then I saw it... like a black hole pulsing with darkness and malice... Fallout 1 and 2, together, for a mere $10. I looked over my shoulder to verify that no one was watching as I picked up the M-rated game(s), one of the few I placed my hands on. There was a stigma attatched to M-rated games, back before they were making billions, and they were few and far between. The mere sight of the M was enough to make parents cringe. Thanks to Mortal Kombat and Doom, there was the notion that these games were evil and soul-stealing. So as I gazed with awe at the box art, I was thankful that my brother had driven me to the store and not my mother. I took it to the counter, and for the first and last time ever, I was asked to show my ID for the purchase. I was nervous, but I was 17, so there was nothing they could do to stop me.I waited until my parents had gone to bed before installing the game. I had an idea of what to expect, but I admit I was still trying to wrap my head around the concept of a world where the Jestons-inspired retro version of the future was true, and the cold war turned into a nuclear reality. I had never heard of such nonsense in my life, but somehow, it made perfect sense. 'War never changes'... the haunting opening entered into my mind and settled comfortably, as if my mind had already decided that this was going to be something special. And Oh, how it was, and is... Fallout is brilliant. A dark, atmospheric, violent and oddly loveable adventure into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Taking inspiration from the Road Warrior and twisting it into something grand and absurd. I won't go into anything specific about the story and setting, because by this point, 15 years later, you may already know enough. If not, you are in for a treat. I would say that it still holds up, but that's because I got in when it was still pretty new, so my perspective is a bit skewed. What I will say is that still, to this day, even with all the amazing advancements in games, it has some things about it that have yet to be surpassed. The exceptionally well-concieved levelling system, for example, is probably the best there has ever been in a game of any kind.   I could spend another hour writing about why I love this game so much, but if you are one of those people that have yet to experience it, I think it best you go in with as little information as possible. I can not recommend this game enough; It is truly a masterpiece that every RPG fan should know by heart.			"

												It's Worth It, Just Be Prepared to Mod ItFallout's strengths lie in two areas: atmosphere and customization. The atmosphere of Fallout is amazing. It's one of the few games I feel that has gotten its atmosphere down right, combining a dangerous and barren post-apocalyptia with a retro 1950s undertone, and maintains a great balance between feeling ridiculous and serious. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's an effective motivating force for the game. With that in mind, know that if you pick up Fallout, do NOT consult any walkthrough or wiki when playing it because, trust me, it'll spoil the fun. Fallout is the type of RPG that's made a whole lot better when you live with your consequences and aren't certain about where the story will take you. As for the customization, Fallout has it in plentiful supply and I'm not just refering to the moral choices available to you. Rather, it's the character customization which is some of the best. Between getting to specialize in a wide variety of weapon types to being able to having your intelligence level effect your choices in the game (Anything below an Intelligence of 4 makes you a bumbling idiot, and this is reflected in game by your dialogue options which are limited to ""me have trouble thinking"") there's a great amount of replayability to this game. However, while I recommend Fallout it does come with a bundle of bugs, some of which have the potential to be game breaking such as being trapped in a corner by an unmovable companion NPC. Because of this, I recommend you mod it. My personal recommendation is called ""Fallout FIXT"" by Sduibek. It's a great megamod which fixes a lot of problems, and is VERY customizable allowing you to choose between general bug fixes and improvements, or changing the feel of the game entirely. It's a great download. Anyway, Fallout is a fantastic (though not a perfect) game. I highly recommend it, ESPECIALLY if you can bag it for cheap!			"

												This game is really fun, and actually challenging. Although the controls and story is hard to understand at first, i would still reccomend this game to anyone. One downside to this game is there is no tutorial whatsoever. You just get thrown out there with no clue how to play. But when you actually understand how to play, it is definitely worth it.			"

												It's Worth It, Just Be Prepared to Mod ItFallout's strengths lie in two areas: atmosphere and customization. The atmosphere of Fallout is amazing. It's one of the few games I feel that has gotten its atmosphere down right, combining a dangerous and barren post-apocalyptia with a retro 1950s undertone, and maintains a great balance between feeling ridiculous and serious. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's an effective motivating force for the game. With that in mind, know that if you pick up Fallout, do NOT consult any walkthrough or wiki when playing it because, trust me, it'll spoil the fun.

												The game hasn't aged well, but I could see it being big back when it was released. This is the game that started it all before Bethedsa took over the series and made Fallout 3. The gameplay mechanics thus are vastly different from the more recent titles. For one thing, you play in a top down perspective and basically attack enemies during turn based combat. However, you can move your character around freely during your turn so it's not as restricted as other turn based games. You also have various RPG elements such as stats you can improve, loot and inventory, and different outcomes based on your dialogue choices. I like the amount of freedom the game gives you since you can pretty much play the game how you want. There's a good amount of side quests that you can do if you want and the lore is there if you're interested in that stuff. What I don't like about the game is two things: the interface and the combat speed. The interface can take some getting used to because moving your character around, accessing weapons/inventory, etc. is done in an unconventional manner in my opinion. Also, the combat in this game can take forever especially if you are facing multiple enemies. This is because the characters move so slow when they walk and going through all the animations can end up making a large battle take 15-30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who haven't played old 90s PC games before because like I said the interface and the combat mechanics can ruin the experience for you. However if you want the full Fallout experience this is where it all started.			"

												Even after Fallout 3, I still hungered for more, and considering that it was titled with a 3, I figured thre would be more of the series. I wen back even further in time to see Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: BoS. And while I was immesnslly surprised at how old the series actually was, and how the gameplay was actually converted from a Top-down trunbased game (save for Fallout Tactic: BoS which was tactical combat) to a first-person open world. I looked to the original Fallout first, and was amazed at the detail that it had and how even with the way the game was in the different gameplay, I still felt like I was in the Fallout universe, and I think that Bethesda did an omaculant job at convering the game without changing the game's atmosphere and story world.

												For those of you who got this game after playing 3, New Vegas and/or 4, prepare for a whole different cup of tea.This game is a isometric top down RPG(in case you didnt see the screenshots) and is a game that does not hold your hand whatsoever.And this being an older Fallout game means.....1) No tutorials and you are just thrown into the game straight.2) No quest markers meaning you might bang your head trying to find the correct location.3) You have to figure things out on your own.4) You have to save frequently lest you lose progress.5) Combat is significantly different that what you are used in future Fallouts, being slow and tactical.6) Inventory management and bartering is more cumbersome.7) Movement and exploration is slow with random encounters of random difficulty.If any of those turn you off then I suggest you rethink your purchase. Other than that, the game has a compelling story, great characters and quests to take on, its pretty much what you expect from the Fallout games, you are tasked with a huge responsibility and you set out to explore the wasteland. Its a very good game for its time and if you can get over the old game tropes I listed above, you are gonna have a good time.And look.....just be safe out there...ok.			"

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: HighBudget: Worth it if you're a fan only as the game is very old and dated. If you have no knowledge of the game, don't bother throwing a cent at it. Lenght: Unknown. At least a week. Probably more. Fallout is an old classic. If you've played fallout 3 or New Vegas and taken an interest in the series and want to try this, I seriously recommend watching a few youtube vids first, as the game is very old. It's not exactly easy to adjust to a game this dated. That said, even on windows 7, it plays without error. The game will probably remind a lot of people, initially of the more recent fallout games. They seem do have done a great job of passing on the setting. Bear in mind that this is turn-based combat, and top-down view and isometric. It's truly an oldie. The game is crafted with a lot of detail in mind. Each map allows for every single item to be examined, and unlike in more recent RPG's in general, you will not be told when to use skills. There is no tutorial (to my knowledge) but the game isn't super hard to figure out, and if it becomes tricky there are guides on the internet. It's a good holiday project, but hardly a treat for a gamer who seeks a visual challenge and revolutionary gameplay. For gamers interested in gaming history or people in general who can stand playing old games, you will have a chance to experience a rolepalying game that dates to the time when people really knew how to craft a world with eye for detail. Personally I tried fallout when I was a child, having barely a clue what I was doing. I've since stumbled on it again and again with friends who time and time again referred to it as a classic. It truly is.			"

												Having been a veteran of Fallout near 13 years now, I recall my first time playing the first Fallout. Back then I was pretty young and didn't have exactly a firm grasp of reality and the seriousness of Fallout.Now, upon purchasing the classic pack, I delved back into the world of Fallout, and after having some memories flood back and some trials and errors, I once again (without help this time) beat Fallout, I survived, I learned, I made decisions that made me question my humanity as a whole, thank god for the comic relief in game otherwise I would've gotten depressed real fast! Now that the compliments are outta the way, let me begin by saying this a game befitting anyone's game library.Fallout, as a whole, makes you question and discover yourself (Get ready for group therapy session!), its amazing locales and set-up make it a unique game to play, I could actually spend hours trying to figure out what and where I find the Red Ryder LE BB Gun (Special Encounter). Beautifully detailed yet desolate and unforgiving landscapes and settlements make for a great experience, mechanics are smooth and simple, once you figure them out of course.I was pretty much thrown into the game without prior knowledge of the controls or how combat and interaction function, once I remembered some bits and pieces and tried different things, it was simple.A colorful cast of characters that antagonizes and emphasises on a great deal of comical and serious matters, each one, be it a ""talking head"" or just a regular NPC, will have you wonder ""Do I join this group? Do I shoot this guy? Why does the man keep screaming about cheese? Should I prevent or stay out of this fight that possibly decides the outcome of an entire game?""Ladies and gentlemen, I tried my best to explain what Fallout entails, what it does, how it makes me feel, and how much I love it. But I sadly cannot put into full detail how amazing Fallout is.All I can say is Fallout is like a wonderful sight of a game, a whole lot of what-ifs, and lovely interaction.Though humanity may have blown itself up, that is not the end of the story, because war... War never changes...10/10.			"

												EDITED (rewritten) : the negative mark is explained below*, but the game is original, good and fun in terms of RPG adventure and freedom of movement.WARNING : once you are aware that the saved games tend to break, you can avoid much frustration.  How: save your current game in many slots and never save in Combat mode (even if there is no actual combat, do not save in that stance or mode).On a technical level, the game is a bit painful, but you can greatly make it more player-friendly and more fun with the version called ""Fallout Fixt"" : independant programmers and modders have combined to allow a much better experience (source: nma-fallout.com ).  For example, the 'Fixt' version allows to control the companions directly (!), pressing ESC closes most windows, etc. * When you sell a game on Steam for 10 $, without giving a warning about a game breaking bug (that can be circumvented), it is not ethical nor honorable.  I am told that the original company no longer exist, but someone is making money now.  Everything can be justified with logic or reason, but I don't accept that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The game has been improved many times back then, but the game breaking save bug remains (i.e. they could just block the possibility of saving in combat mode for example).  The game is worth it once you know that.			"

												+ amazingly interesting quests+ great RPG system, perks+ unforgettable soundtrack+ dark, yet humorous+ funny and believable dialogues+ incredible atmosphere+ challenging to beat; not overly hard though+ runs perfecty on modern systems after one fan-made patch- doesn't run perfectly on modern systems without the fan-made patchThe ultimate post-nuclear experience. Forget the F3/NV; Fallout 1 (and Fallout 2) is how the post-apocalyptic world could actually look like.Harshness, seriousness and darkness of the post-apocalyptic world? It's in it.Humour, hyperbole, light tone and pop-culture references? It's in there, without diminishing the serious tone of the game.INCREDIBLE dialogues and your possibilities in it. Great music, fits the atmosphere perfectly. Decent storyline. The number of possibilities on how you could play through this game is uncountable. You can beat this game in 9 minutes 17 seconds (literally, speedrun is on youtube somewhere) or in average 20 hours without getting bored for 1 second. For me it's possibly the best RPG out there.New Fallouts were decent games but sh*t-tier Fallouts. You want to know why is Fallout considered one of the best RPG series ever? Play this (or Fallout 2) and forget the sequels for now.↑ all of this applies to Fallout 2 as well			"

												For all its weeping sores, the best PC game of the 1990s except for Homeworld, and probably the best RPG on Steam. Lots of freedom, likeable characters, an intriguing backstory, a main quest you can straight-up fail, some of the greatest endings in any game, and a gorgeous dark-ambient soundtrack.On the down side, the interface is clunky and slow, especially inventory. NPC sidekicks can be frustrating to work with and will often harm you or each other. (It's not nearly as bad as some clumsy players will tell you it is.) And a few quests can hinge on pixel hunting - not intentionally, but simply because items can be hard to spot against the dithery backgrounds.Be advised that all combat in this game is turn-based. It's fun, but it's NOT optional like you see in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. You will take turns spending action points on a hex grid, every fight. Fallout is a slow RPG. It is not by any definition an action game.Highest possible recommendation.			"

												Although somewhat different from FO3, and FNV, Fallout is definitely a classic. The range of weapons is quite large and fun to try out. Essentially, the arsenal available in Fallout ranges from melee weapons like knives, combat knives, crowbars, batons, sledgehammers, brass knuckles, the power fist, the ripper to singlehanded firearms like the laser pistol, the alien blaster, 10mm pistol, the 14mm pistol, the desert eagle, the .223 pistol, 10mm smg to two handed firearms like the hunting rifle, the sniper rifle, the combat shotgun, the shotgun, the minigun, the flamer, the rocket launcher, the plasma rifle, the gatling laser etc. The combat system is essentially turn based. When combat is initiated by the player or by enemies, the player must spend action points to access their inventory, fire a weapon, reload a weapon, or when picking something up. Essentially, action points are based on the players starting agility level. So, if the player modifies a preset character to have an agility of 5, their action points will be 7. According to the Fallout Wiki it's based on equation like so ""Agility level + agility level/2=action points."" To improve your agility level you can choose the Action boy Perk when leveling up. When actually hitting the target you may find yourself chuckling in amusement at the explosion of fallen enemies from the impact of a laser beam from your newly acquired laser rifle or being able to watch the falling burnt corpses of your enemies after engaging them with a flamethrower. My only grimace is the combat system itself where players even with a 95% chance to hit a target can often time miss. Despite that, the combat itself is much more enjoyable later in the game with end game weapons and higher combat skill levels. The story line is short. SPOILER. There isn't much aside from a few hours of gameplay for the main story. The main story essentially is about attaining a water chip to save your home, Vault 13. While it may take new players hours to find the water chip veteran players may be able to accomplish this task in less than an hour. Just a tip, but if you can't find the water chip in the allotted time of 120 or so in game days, you can visit the water merchants at the Hub and pay them 2000 bottle caps to get an additional 100 days. Note: after a certain amount of days the environment in the game changes as the super mutants over run Necropolis (the place where you get the water chip). This essentially makes your task much harder b/c if you do not have better quality weapons like rifles, combat shotguns, grenades, flamethrowers, etc. you may not be able to kill them as easily. After acquiring the water chip, the main story develops a bit more as the overseer (leader) of your vault tasks you with destroying and discovering the secret behind the super mutants at the once abondoned secret U.S. military base. Within this story, the player has a few choices as they can decide how the fate of the wasteland turns out. Aside from that, there are a handful of side quests that can be found in the game. You can even join the Brotherhood of steel, the thieves guild, kill the Gun Runners, kill the Khans, etc.A very basic and nice feature is the ability to get companions! Their features are very basic b/c it can seems like you can not equip them with more advanced gear like power armour, or trade back gear if youu decide to use them as a pack mules unlesss you use the barter system. From my understanding there are only three followers you can attain. You can recruit Ian from Shady Sands for 100 bottle caps, Katja from the Boneyard library for free, and dogmeat, a dog located in Junktown. For the most part, these followers can be useful in absorbing the brunt of damage from early game enemies, but are easily killed later on by super mutants and the like who are often equipped with gatling guns, laser rifles, flamethrowers, etc. For the most part, new players can expect at least 10-20 hours through the main story and side quests. P.S. make sure to make additional saves. There is no autosave feature in this game. If you screw up somewhere in your game you can always revert back to an earlier save. Also, some skills are worthless like the Outdoorsman skill and traps.			"

FalloutIf you're a fan of the series and you haven't played the original Fallout yet, I highly recommened it.The gameplay and graphics are obviously very different from the more modern Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but the RPG and exploration elements are all there. Unlike those, the original Fallout is an isometric (not exactly, but whatever) and turn based RPG.The main theme, concept and overall design are also shared with the other Fallout games.You can still interact with every NPC, either by talking to them, bartering, stealing from them or just slaughtering them however you please. Watch out though, you'll easily die if you go up against enemies much better equipped than you or if you're significantly outnumbered. You can also explore and interact with objects such as lockers, dresses, desks, etc... and search for various loot.Most (if not all) of the chems like Stimpaks and Psychos are here too, along with weapons from pistols and rifles, to miniguns and energy weapons. The armor is slightly different, but you have Mad Max's leather jacket and Power Armor, so nothing to complain about there.You have companions that will follow you around and help in combat, like good ol' Dogmeat.The way you navigate around the map is a bit different though. The wasteland isn't just one huge map. If you want to travel to other cities/areas (there's 13 different locations, if I'm not mistaken) you leave the one you're at and a map comes up. From there, you choose where to go and all you do is watch a cute little map marker (you) move towards the destination, unless you encounter something (like raiders, mutants, a corpse to loot, etc..) or you deliberately stop.The leveling system is pretty much the same, where you allocate SPECIAL points and choose 2 perks at the begining  of the game and gain experience to level up. You can then level up your skills (which I also think are the same from Fallout 3 & NV) and earn a perk every few levels.One thing that's noticeably different however, is the way you make use of your skills. If you want to, for example, pick a lock, you'll have to go your Skilldex and select the skill you want to use (in this case, the Lockpick skill) and then you click on the object you want to use the skill on (the lock). Other skills also work like this, where you select the skill then the target to use the skill on. Except for Sneak, which you just click to start sneaking and that's it.So yeah, to sum it up, if you're a Fallout fan you should definitely check this one out, even if just for the lore.If you're new to the series, you're better off picking up 3 or NV first.Side-note: This comes from a teenager who played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this one, so there's no nostalgia involved here.

												Give the first game of this series a good try - even if it's surpassed by its more than splendid sequels. If you ignore a few annyoing bugs, some unfair battles and and the obsolete inventory/item management you'll experience an ~15 hours long trip like you've seldomly seen before in any other video game. Atmosphere, music, freedom of choices and the character development system stood the test of time and already cult - and even the isometric graphics have their very own charm.A tear of joy will definitely roll down your cheek when you finally defeat the obscure «Master» at the end of the game - how you do that is completely up to you.

												Don't kid yourself, this game is OLD, almost ancient.You should probably only play this if you are a die hard Fallout fan or you're really into post apocalyptic isometric RPGs.You start off with almost no weapons from your Vault. Your mission: Find water. You only have a certain amount of ""days"" to do that (in game the time does not stand still). I don't know what happens if you fail, to be honest.You will have no one holding your hand in this game. No one. You have no quest log (as far as I can tell), you only find out what to do and where to go by talking to people (no, they do not have exclamation marks for quests). They give you missions, directions, intel, etc. These missions will have consequences. If you simply murder stuff or do shady deals and people find out, you get negative karma points and some people will be hostile. That being said, the choices you can make are rather nice, but can also screw you over. There are good walkthroughs out there if you want the optimal way to play, i.e. where to go, who to talk to and how to get the most XP and bottle caps.The latter are the game's currency. Although you do not strictly need them, because everything can be bought with everything. All items in the game have a certain value and you can simply trade them in. However, items also have a weight associated to them, so the bottle caps are definitely worth having. You can, of course, only carry so much (depends on your strength value). However, there is a trick, whereby your companion, which you can hire or not, can seemingly carry an unlimited amount of items. Of course he won't give them back to you for free, but you can steal it from them and they won't complain apparently.Your starting values and skills will be important and you can already mess up the game here. Every now and then you get a level up and can choose a new perk or upgrade one (not every levelup). You can also invest skill points into your various skills, from picking locks, to sneaking, conversation, healing or different combat traits. You can level a skill up to 100%. I would strongly suggest to invest into small arms initially, as most weapons, especially early on are in that category (from pistols to shotguns to rifles). And missing in this game can be your death.Combat is done turn based with action points and initiative. The values are often hard to gauge though. In any case you will usually have some sort of firearm and armor equipped. You can swap weapons mid combat, but it costs action points (AP). Everything costs AP. You can either fire your weapon unaimed, which costs less AP, or aimed. The latter allows you to target specific parts of your opponent. For example shooting and wounding the leg causes monsters to be slower (i.e. lose AP). Shooting the arms may cause opponents to miss more. Shooting the eyes give you a chance of blinding them. And a headshot can potentially do the most damage. Of course your hit percentage depends on your skill with a weapon type and the distance to the target. Funnily enough you can also fire your sniper rifle from point blank range. Generally speaking, the more damage a weapon does, the more AP it requires. You will also have to reload at times, which also costs AP and potentially your whole move. Some weapons also offer other modes of fire. Automatic weapons have a burst fire mode, which costs lots of AP and wastes lots of ammo and should only be used on close targets, but can kill targets quickly and also hurt other enemies nearby. Speaking of ammo. Every weapon in the game uses a different type of ammo, so try to specialise on 1 or 2 weapons, otherwise you will just be carrying around lots of additional ammo, which takes up weight.If you want to and find one you can also hire a companion...you should ♥♥♥♥ing do that. I can't imagine how to win the game without one. Tycho for example has loads of HPs and can fire almost any weapon. Be aware though that there is friendly fire in the game and the friendly AI cannot be controlled or given any orders. They will act on their own and they're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, so don't stand in the way and try to keep them alive. It doens't help that you can't see their HPs...you can give the AI weapons and they will use whatever they deem best from their inventory.Movement and menus are a pain for modern days to be honest. Combat is ""ok"", but it just has this ""feel"" to it that makes it great somehow.Overall I like the game, though the story in general isn't very good imho. It's the individual people and missions that make this one entertaining.There is no difficulty setting I think, so I would urge you to read some guides on what to do and how to even play the game, because there is no tutorial.

												Don't kid yourself, this game is OLD, almost ancient.You should probably only play this if you are a die hard Fallout fan or you're really into post apocalyptic isometric RPGs.You start off with almost no weapons from your Vault. Your mission: Find water. You only have a certain amount of ""days"" to do that (in game the time does not stand still). I don't know what happens if you fail, to be honest.You will have no one holding your hand in this game. No one. You have no quest log (as far as I can tell), you only find out what to do and where to go by talking to people (no, they do not have exclamation marks for quests). They give you missions, directions, intel, etc. These missions will have consequences. If you simply murder stuff or do shady deals and people find out, you get negative karma points and some people will be hostile. That being said, the choices you can make are rather nice, but can also screw you over. There are good walkthroughs out there if you want the optimal way to play, i.e. where to go, who to talk to and how to get the most XP and bottle caps.The latter are the game's currency. Although you do not strictly need them, because everything can be bought with everything. All items in the game have a certain value and you can simply trade them in. However, items also have a weight associated to them, so the bottle caps are definitely worth having. You can, of course, only carry so much (depends on your strength value). However, there is a trick, whereby your companion, which you can hire or not, can seemingly carry an unlimited amount of items.

												=--------REVIEW SYNOPSIS-------------=Ah... the classic. It's ancient... very old. Despite that however, Bethesda still shows love to this timeless classic created by Fallout's original makers; Interplay. This is the one that started them all. It hasn't aged well as far as graphics and gameplay goes, but it's true to the RPG format, and one of the original US Turn-based RPGs from the 90s era. It spans the entireity of the Mojave Dersert-region... more precisely, the deserts of the California and Nevada regions. You begin as a Lone Wanderer set upon a quest to restore your Vault-Tek™ Vault's water chip; the sole thing that purifies the disease-ridden, irradiated waters of the surface world so that your vault's inhabitants will have fresh water to drink. It having broken down, you're sent out to find a new one. Along the way, you'll encounter many strange people... and many deadly enemies, not-so interesting companions... but companions none-the-less.=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=*Elder to the first US-based RPGs*Turn-based (You are free to plan your next move, it could be your last!)*Compatability/Optimized for Windows 7+ Operating Systems*Compatability/Still contains the original version for 98/XP-based Operating Systems*Brutal difficulty (Just how you remember it)=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=*Ancient graphical detail*Linear storyline*Limited range of weaponry/gear*Brutal difficulty (No forgiveness for mistakes)*Clunky UI (For what it was back in the day, hasn't aged well IMHO)=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=I give this game a 8/10I give this game a [LEGENDARY™ MOLE RAT STEW]			"

												A very immsersive experience from back in the day, Fallout is everything  a role-playing game should be. You've got tons of options in how to customize your character, and can do practically anything. Someone insult you? Give em a bullet to the brain, a verbal smackdown, or a grenade in their pants! The plot is also well told, though requires some exploring to truly understand.All of this, however, is overshadowed by one unfortunate flaw: current computers cannot properly handle it. This leads to many graphical bugs that make it nearly impossible to play. Thankfully, many people on the internet and even here on Steam have come up with solutions. Look around for a mod called Fallout FIXT on the site No Mutants Allowed, and don't  afraid to ask for help!			"

Posted: September 12, 2015
												Although this game is extremely boring for me, I can see its appeal. Being introduced to video games in the 3D era, I am somewhat allegric to old games (2006 onward is okay for me). I understand that most of the mechanics in this game are very outdated, because most of the mechanics in this game have been refined and improved in modern games. Therefore, there is a lack of something new or something that is very attention-grabbing. Most of the NPC's don't have their own audio dialogue and character models, the UI is very clunky resulting in repetative gameplay, and the start of the game is very boring and un-fun. I have played through an hour (or more) of this game and I haven't actually been introduced to new quests besides the main quest. Quests aren't very organized and the game does not hold your hand in trying to find where you are actually supposed to go (there are no quest markers, from what I've seen). If you've seen gameplay of this game, you might be fooled into thinking it's sort of an open world game. Actually, the world is separated into grids and you have to travel via map or cross the border to get to the next one. Combat is also very dull and repetative. I have to stab a mole rat 4 times before it gets to die (sometimes I even miss), and guns aren't very useful for me because I miss anyway. The VATS system isn't very useful, because it takes a few clicks to actually GET to the menu, and all that is probably not worth it because you're not even sure if you are even going to HIT that body part. Combat is also very slow. It takes a few clicks to actually shoot/stab someone. It also takes a few clicks to interact with objects and the enviroment as well. The first time I finally got to talk to someone, I had a lot of things to say, but most of those choices were pointless and the responses were boring anyway. In conclusion, I can understand why so many people like this game. Its charm is wonderful and the character creation is one of its strongest features, which the game supports very well. Too bad Fallout's other mechanics didn't hold up as much as its character creation did. Just like borderlands, I wish this game's world could have been introduced into a different genre, and that's what Fallout 3 did. Thank god for Todd Howard, eh? I would only recommend buying this game if it's very cheap or if you think you could tollerate its outdated mechanics and repetative gameplay. If not, this isn't the game for you and I would definately recommend buying Fallout 3, which aged very well. Out of all the games that I sincerely wish could have been remade into the modern era, Fallout would be one of them...EDIT: After forcing myself to play this game, after about 3 hours I got hooked and I played the heck out of it. I really, really like it!!! Although it says that I played only 4 hours, I probably played almost 40 because I have the Fallout Fixt mod and steam doesn't detect when it's being used. I strongly recommend playing this with a walkthrough the first time around, and then play it again without. But, to be honest, I don't want to play this game again... instead, I'll play Fallout 2!!! Fallout 2, watch out, 'cause here I come!			"

There have been many a time when I have both screamed with joy and hatred at the seemingly randomly handed out criticals that can make or break the fight. This game is a wondrous experience for both newcomers to the fallout franchise and nostalic veterans looking back from fallout 3 and New Vegas and should definetly be added to your basket.			"

												This fantastic RPG has been in my Steam Library for some time now, and have posessed the desire to dive into it for quite a while. But only a few fays ago did I begin to play, and I have been hooked. So hooked in fact, that even when my save corrupted and set me back a few hours, I felt inclined to redo all that I had lost. I suppose it is feels just that fantastic to obliterate a base full of supermutants with a 40 shot burst minigun. For those who do not enjoy the turn-based style game, this is still highly recommended. It is a different style of combat compared to the modern first person Fallout titles, however it feels just as awesome and immersive to roam the wastelands and destroy the enemy. 10/10 Great GameP.S. Give the controls some time, you will come to understand and enjoy them.			"

												This game is the beginning of my favourite series of games ever. I assumed that due to it's age and the companies behind it, that it would be pretty bad and boring, but I was very wrong. This game is full of a fair amount of quests that all have good story to them. The visuals are fine when the HD patch is applied. There is lack of audio in the game aside from the odd sound effect and combat related sounds such as gunshot. The game also has fairly slow paced gameplay and you'd have to be patient to deal with it at times. The game has turn-based combat using a targeting system called ""V.A.T.S."" that works on percentages. The games RPG elements are detailed with many perks and skills to train as well as using speech options that effect how the game plays out.If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic setting, don't mind the dated graphics and slow paced gameplay. This game is for you.12/15 - ""Brilliant beginning to a brilliant series"" "

												Fallout 1 servile guide 1) luck to 102) crank small guns and energy weapons to 110 or so 3) run around the desert till u get the random encounter (return to area 51 u will see)4) take gun from encounter and beat game 5) play fallout 2 only crappy thing about fallout 1 is there is a time limit for water chip and after so u can not just screw around like in fallout 2. other then that its one of my favorite games form my child hood and so many funny random encounters u can seal form a Newka cola and get a bunch of freaking gear.

												Things I Liked:Good StoryVery Strategy-Centric - hexagonal tiles mean that strategy is keyVariety in weaponsLore is really interestingThings I Didn't:More RTS-like than RPG, although RPG elements are thereThe graphics do not work on modern machines - many graphical glitches on my machineCombat is action point reliant - can be pretty dullGame mechanics are not very well explained - trial and errorOnce you die, you lose your character (may be a welcome challenge for some, but I am not a fan)No autosaves (adds to annoyance of above point)The Fallout series is well known by the gaming community, mainly for Fallout 3 and New Vegas but many have missed the first entry in the series, which can be picked up pretty cheaply on Steam.I had pretty low expectations for this game, being released in 1997 and all, but even so I was honestly disappointed from the get go, when I couldn't boot up the game, and when I did the opening cutscene wouldn't show without rainbows fizzing across my screen.Anyway, as I got into the game these glitches went away for the most part, and I could get onto playing the game, which was difficult without any clues on where to go or how quickly (you are given a time limit to complete the game, by the way). The storyline you follow is dull, although the background information is really interesting, with the end-of-the-world scenario that kicked it all off in pretty much every game since. be prepared though, this information is pretty much shoved in your face every time you talk to anyone. They respond to a two word question with a five hundered word essay, and you have to read it all to make sense of what's going on.The combat is what I thought the Fallout series would excel at, but I was wrong. enemies surround you far too quickly, you have to use 'action points' like a turn based strategy, in fact that's what the combat is, and I find it a hard concept to master.Overall this game is great for its story and lore but not so strong with its combat and mechanics in the modern era. Recommended if you can put up with the flaws of older titles.			"

												The controls aren't initially too bad, especially when you finally master them. Unfortunately, Black Isle Studios didn't have the knack to implement an abundance of voice actors. Truth be told there are only a handful of them in the entire game. Everything else is good old fashion dialogue. Sure, you might here me and other people complain about this. But let's just say, for the shake of this review. I get over the fact the game only has a limited amount of voice actors until Fallout 3. The only major problem I've encountered thus far with Fallout 1 through 2 (including Fallout Tactics) is the despicable combat system. I mean this combat system sucks.. I'm talking atari style combat.. A friendly individual fires first, then a hostile target fires second. It essentially goes back and fourth until one or the other is dead. This is extremely unrealistic, and truthfully. I don't believe there was any excuse for this whatsoever. Take my word for it, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series; but this is just ridiculous. In closing this message, I want to add the story is of course outstanding. I hope one day they'll consider doing a remastered version of both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Preferably with Fallout 4's new creation engine.			"

												Just get it. It runs well and you can beat it in one evening if you really want to. Side quests are not very interesting IMO. No Fallout 2 fun here. Kill a gang, help a gang, kill deathclaws, save Tandi...  I suggest you beat this FAST and move to Fallout 2. That's where the real fun begins. Loved the part where Brohood of Steel sends you into a radioactive hole in the ground 100s of miles away for your initiation mission... just a tip, if you run around in there without RadX you will come out with about 2400 points of radiation. Rad away only removes 25 soooo yah. Brotherhood of Steel are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s =) I suggest you get their power armour and murder em all! Totally justified in my mind.Anyway buy this to marvel at how good Fallout 2 is. If you play this after playing Fallout 2 the game will seem bare bones (and it it is).			"

For a game that was made in 1997 it is definitely still relevant, and WONDERFUL. The story is amazing, and truly had me immersed the entire time. I will be sure to play through a few more times as to get a few more favorable endings! BTW this game is TOUGH. Don't be to ashamed to look up some help every now and then!			"

												A game with gameplay that is so challenging most modern gamers can't even be bothered to wrap their heads around it? A deep lore, unique story and world? Replay value?Oy vey!Wait, how do I play it? How do I get past this cave.Fallout 3 is better because I can play it, it's like Call of Duty so it's better. Video games are better when they're accessible, all the best art is accessible to the masses. That's why Transformers is the best movie ever made, goy.TL;DR it's one of the best games ever made are you're probably too stupid and lazy to appreciate it.			"

												Thumbs Up!  Best Fallout Ever!  Look at those graphics.  OMGosh!  So Cool!;POk, really!  Why would anyone recommend this?  Well, for a blast from the past.  No mods!  No High Def!  Oh and some pretty tough game play (at least for me).  I picked it up simply for storyline and slight nostalgia.  Which is what I think most players picked it up for.  To complete the set and get that little bit of Lore you always wondered about.  Seriously, buy this game only if you want to experience the classics.  It's like buying Final Fantasy 1 cause you enjoyed 10 so much that you want to know the first game better.  It's a completely different beast but worth experiencing even if you never finish it. Or like playing Pac Man or Pong.  It's a classic worth trying.			"

												Thumbs Up!  Best Fallout Ever!  Look at those graphics.  OMGosh!  So Cool!;POk, really!  Why would anyone recommend this?  Well, for a blast from the past.  No mods!  No High Def!  Oh and some pretty tough game play (at least for me).  I picked it up simply for storyline and slight nostalgia.  Which is what I think most players picked it up for.  To complete the set and get that little bit of Lore you always wondered about.  Seriously, buy this game only if you want to experience the classics.  It's like buying Final Fantasy 1 cause you enjoyed 10 so much that you want to know the first game better.  It's a completely different beast but worth experiencing even if you never finish it. Or like playing Pac Man or Pong.  It's a classic worth trying.			"

												This game is the beginning of my favourite series of games ever. I assumed that due to it's age and the companies behind it, that it would be pretty bad and boring, but I was very wrong. This game is full of a fair amount of quests that all have good story to them. The visuals are fine when the HD patch is applied. There is lack of audio in the game aside from the odd sound effect and combat related sounds such as gunshot. The game also has fairly slow paced gameplay and you'd have to be patient to deal with it at times. The game has turn-based combat using a targeting system called ""V.A.T.S."" that works on percentages. The games RPG elements are detailed with many perks and skills to train as well as using speech options that effect how the game plays out.If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic setting, don't mind the dated graphics and slow paced gameplay. This game is for you.12/15 - ""Brilliant beginning to a brilliant series"" "

Seems Promising, but I haven't gotten to it yet Then why are you reviewing it already??!! Haven't played it much yet, but I plan to after I finish other RPG's like Fallout NV and Star Wars KOTOR. From the little I have played, the Fallout lore is definitely there, and I expect a future playthough to really open my eyes on how ""watered down"" FO3 and NV are. Or maybe not, maybe Bethesda did a good job. Probably not though, since the jump to 3D probably required them to cut lots of content. "

												This isn't a game, this Is an Experience. :DDon't buy it if you don't like reading, roleplay, using your brain, a challenge, or strategy. The combat really makes you think as opposed to just shooting randomly in big 3D open worlds where everything is a movie and holds your hand. There's no Autosave, sunshine. Welcome to the 90's. If you forget to hit that save button after defeating a horde of deathclaws and get shot a screen over by a bandit, tough Sh*t. Do it again.You'll learn to appreciate gameplay over graphics for once in your close minded life.Unlike the failure Fallout 4, (A blasphemy to the genre and series) there is more to the combat than just meets the eye.Chances are, if you're not a fan of dungeon crawlers, and whine about Nethack and the like as being ""too hard"" (Wah Wah you little baby) then go lower your IQ some more and buy the modern garbage they call video games and stop wasting your time on this classic.This game will wreck you, make you cry and then hug you and give you a cookie. It's not for the faint of heart, and neither is Real life when you think about it.If you think this review is too brutal, that's because this game twice as brutal.Fallout can change a man (but war, war never changes), I used to be as soft as a kitten before playing this harcore Sh*t. ""Git Gud or Git Gud Not, there is no try.""And you're gonna need to memorize these keyboard functions before you play, otherwise, expect carpal tunnel from all the clickin.

												Fallout is a controversial came to me because there are many good and bad things about it. It can be genuinely fun, but you have to be willing to overlook a few problems. For one, non-violent character builds (i.e. focus on skills like sneak, speech, science, etc) are pretty much impossible to play for several reasons. A) There are random encounters in this game, which you will get constantly while fast traeveling. Unless you're really, really, lucky, you will get murdered by raiders and scorpions over and over again. B) You will miss out on XP through combat, which will make you way too low level. Secondly, most skills in this game are uneccessary or plainly useless. In order to have fun, I recomend you play the following character. Choose gifted and fast shot as traits, lockpick, science, and small guns as tag skills. Then go with 2 cha, 4 int, 4 str, 10 end, 10 agility, 10 per, and 5 luck. Trust me, just do it.It kind of feels like a let down in that you don't get a lot of freedom to do what you want. This game is very combat-oriented.  Another problem is the graphics. It personally didn't bother me, but I know it can upset some people. If that's important to you, maybe don't play it. Lastly, the game is arbitrarily hard. The first time I saw a mutant, I got blasted to bits in one hit. Make  sure to save often and I recomend playing on easy, because Fallout enemies are super unfair. However, don't let that stop you from enjoying it. There are many good things about it also. What I really enjoyed was the simple fact that no other franchise really makes post-apocalytpic RPGs. The enemies look all mad max style, how cool is that? The setting is really cool, and frankly, underused. I've always maintained that interesting settings *make* RPGs. The story of Fallout is actually pretty interesting, even if it is rather bare-bones. I was also really impressed by the goal of Fallout: you have only 150 days to get a water chip, which your vault needs. You're on your own and you have to figure out where it is quickly. It's almost like a sleuth or detective RPG. If you feel like the good outwieghs the bad, you should try it. It's not a perfect game and I probably wouldn't finish it gain, but it's a unique experience.			"

												>inb4 new player to old style games like thisAs someone who fell in love with the series at Fallout 3 I must say this game series has come a long way. This game is very simlistic yet incredibly difficult. I cannot seem to figure out the control scheme and how to use the vats system effectively without me moving 2mph around every corner. As someone who has never played games like this and if you havent either I wouldnt recommend unless you're very committed. I give this a 3/5 as I know it's the foundation for one of my favorite series; however, with the controls and outdated format all together I cannot see a new player base for this game. PRO:Beginning to Fallout seriesProbably has decent story and good charactersCON: very outdated and extremely difficult for new playersif you've played games similar to the control scheme of this game I recommend as I'm sure it's a fantastic title. However if you're a newcomer to these older style PC games I would not recommend as they are way to outdated to truly enjoy.			"

												I love Fallout 2 that game rocks and I really recommend playing it if you want to experience what Fallout games, in my opinion, are really meant to be. But Fallout 1... I just can't get into.(tl;dr at the bottom)My problem with Fallout one is the water chip an Item that forces you to go and find it in 150 days. In theory this sounds great, an object that forces you from one location to another in a certain amount of time that makes sure that you aren't straying. But the execution is horrible, I found myself with a crap ton of towns unlocked early into the game. This resulted in me traveling to a nearby one and finding out that a water chip ""apparently"" in a town that is 5 day days travel form where I currently am and resulted in me going there and finding out that there are freaking super mutants in the place in which Im searching for the water chip. So I proceed to turn around and go to the brotherhood of steel which is a 10-15 day travel from where I am as that sounds like a place where I would find a water chip. When I get there I am told to go to ""The glow"" which is 10 days there and 10 days back and retrieve and item. When I do that they let me in, and guess what they don't have a water chip. So now I am sitting at 53 days left as I also made Detours to other towns to do crap.tl;drBut enough rambling I will just get to the point. Fallout 2 was fun because it gave you more freedom and all the the time in the world, as thirteen years is enough to do everything in the game 5X over.Fallout 1 on the other hand, while smaller in scale forces you to play it's pace rather then yours and gives you a small amount of time to do everything. If Fallout one was my first old school Fallout game I would have just dropped the series entirely and never picked it up again.edit:spelling			"

												Fallout is a classic Post-Apocalyptic role-playing game that took RPGing to a place other than medieval fantasy lands. It solidified the open-world genre with its highly interactive world and demonstrates an unusual amount of self-awareness.GAMEPLAY: 9/10Fallout is a game about choice. Every decision you make is acknowledged, either by scripted events or with the in-game Karma system. This game lets you do things that no other game would let you do. You can side with the main antagonist, kill children, or even complete the game without killing anybody. It's very big on the role-playing aspect and your stats matter. For example, playing as a character with low intelligence will reduce your character to a grunting idiot. It's not one of those fake RPGs where you just do the same thing over and over until you level up. In fact, grinding is pretty much absent since there are so many unique ways to gain XP. The combat system is decent but not the game's strong point. The game is full of well-written dialogue and complex conversation trees. There are many different paths to take which give the game incredible replay value. Overall, full of great non-linear gameplay. If the thought of not always knowing exactly what to do scares you, just view an online guide and you'll be fine.PRESENTATION: 7/10Fallout's graphics have aged much better than other games of the period due to using pre-rendered graphics. However, despite this, the game is still rather low-resolution and the UI is somewhat clunky. However, the sound design is excellent with great voice actors. The head models used when conversing with important characters are detailed and look pretty realistic for an old game. This game also game has excellent death animations that accurately reflect a weapon's kill power. However if you're squeamish you can change the settings to make it less gory or eliminate blood entirely. The CGI cutscenes also look great too. The music tops it all, however, with an excellent score composed by Mark Morgan.STORY: 10/10Fallout is an excellent example of combining gameplay and story. They are essentially the same thing in this game, as every action you take makes an impact on the plot. With loads of interesting characters Fallout will please fans of quality video game narratives.Overall this game is highly reccomended if you're a fan of intelligent and mature games. You don't need to be particularly intelligent to figure the game out, but you'll find you using your brain a lot more than other video games. A lot of people say it's just nostalgia, but the game was already over ten years old when I first played it, and I loved it. Definitely reccomended if you're a classic gamer or a fan of games that give you lots of choice.			"

												[WARNING: Not a standard review, but rather a guide how to play old games when you first played newer ones, ie. Fallout 3 and New Vegas]This game came out in 1997, when I was only 2 years old. I doubt I was even self-aware back then.It won't be a surprise that I am much into newer games then. However, I like old games too, since I've been a player since I was 3 or so. However, I never had the pleasure to play any games from Fallout series until about, I guess, 2010 or 2011. The first game was Fallout 3 and the only thing that encouraged me to play this masterpiece (with flaws, bit still a masterpiece nonetheless) was the fact Bethesda Softworks made this, and I've been familiar with this company due to The Elder Scrolls. I was already a big fan of Morrowind and Oblivion back then, so I checked on (ie. downloaded it from torrents) Fallout 3, which was great, but also very black-and-white when it comes to story, moralities and taking sides.Then I checked out New Vegas. It was great, and I also noticed that it was more morally ambiguous than Fallout 3. There were much less obvious choices when it comes to what will come out of them next. I read some reviews on both games. Seemed like old veterans of Fallout series liked NV more due to it being more like previous games than Fallout 3. So I figured out that NV is somewhat like first two Fallouts, to some degree.In the meantime, while I was sucked into NV (after I bought legitimate versions of these games on Steam), I was trying to play older Fallouts (these were initially downloaded from torrents as well). Both first and second. I really tried, but couldn't do this because these games were... I don't know. Not outdated, definitely not. But definitely not as ""user-friendly"" as F3 and FNV. These newer Fallouts simply had more intuitive interfaces, prettier locations, simpler controls, beautiful and detailed environments and you could approach these games in many varying styles. Fallout is much more difficult, because you don't have autosaves, interface takes time to learn (especially exchanging equipment and trading), if you can do something, it is much less obvious, because it is a lot simpler to engage in straightforward combat rather than research how you can click on repair and/or sneak or science or whatever, and like Morrowind compared to Oblivion, much of combat isn't based on how skilled you are (ie. the player) at playing games and aiming, but on your character's skills and probability (ie. dice rolls). So it took me several approaches to both games (which took me several months) to try to figure these games out. I was constantly dying, I felt the pressure of time (150 days remaining before you can find the water chip for your Vault, jeez...). It was very hard to bear with.However, several days ago, original Fallouts were on sale. -75% off. Only 5€ for F1, F2 and FT. Would be a sin not to buy them. I bought them, despite the fact I knew it was very unlikely that I'd like them anyday soon.But you know, it's weird, because once you BUY something instead of getting it for free, you feel obliged to try it out even more. You feel like ""for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, I paid money for it, so I MUST COMPLETE THIS GAME!"".And I felt like that too. I still feel like that. It took me several months, but I ♥♥♥♥ING DID IT. I learned how to actually play this game!And I can wholeheartfully recommend it, but only if you know how it is like to play old games or if you are inhumanly persistent.			"

												This game came out in 1997 and it surprisingly holds up to this day. I was afraid I wouldn't like it because of how old it was and that I had played Fallout 3 and New Vegas first but I was completely wrong. It's basically the same as Fallout 3 and NV but isometric. The classic Fallout charm is present in this game with a main story and a few side quests. Though the game seems kinda basic in some areas a lot of the game seems a lot deeper and more indepth than a lot of Modern RPG's. At the time I can imagine this was quite revolutionary setting the standard for RPG's in general.Only once or twice I got fustrated at the game, not due to the lack of direction but due to the logic I was using to solve a problem not working even though I felt like it should. However it turned out the thing I was doing you were actually meant to do later on but I originally didn't try it again until I looked up I was doing it correctly just in the wrong area. Oh well.As I mentioned earlier, the lack of direction is a big thing in this game. The first quest is ""Find the water chip. Here is a place it MIGHT be."" and that's it. It's very satisfying to complete quests because of this as you need to ask around and gather information to solve the quests for yourself.My only complaint with the game is that the combat is unforgiving and can be fustrating at times as you can get instakilled just because of a random critical hit. The accuracy is also unforgiving at times as well especially in skills that you haven' trained as much. It's not that it's stupid it's far too unforgiving for what it is.The bottom line:If you enjoyed the other Fallout games (including 3 and NV) you will like this one.			"

												Welp I think its time I make a serious review about fallout 1. So I have played every fallout game, ( yes even the horrific tactics game), Beaten all the dlc's, and have modded the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of all of them. Also i made mods myself for the game. This game is amazing! Compared to the newer fallout games, this has a much better story, better quests, and balance. The story is you have to get a water chip for a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in your vault, and saving everyone from the new mutant race. A much better story then finding a poker chip, in falliut new vegas Kek. The game may be old but it flows very well! Combat is tactical and fun, missions have humour and are exciting, and deathclaws are still huge pains in the♥♥♥♥♥ The barter is much better in fallout 1 rather than selling your useless hunting rifles in fallout 3 for 12 caps. The locations in the game are very interesting and theres plenty of content to enjoy. There are multiple endings and each one of them are satisfying in their own right. Fallout is definitly a game to be played by anyone who loves post apocolyptic games. All in all, its still better than fallout 4!12 caps out of 9!Did I also mention theres sex with random woman in villages?			"

												Good game. If you're like me and you played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this it might be a bit hard to get used to the old style of things, but you'll find it to be quickly addictive. I don't know what it is about it. Maybe it's the awesome story, big world, or blasting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of something with a minigun that keeps me playing, but you'll get your money's worth easily.It should be noted that there are a few annoying quirks, like followers not being able to equp armour, some S.P.E.C.I.A.L.S and skills being almost 100% useless, and the sometimes downright unfairness of combat, where you can sometimes die instantly while having full health with the best armour and every buff imaginable. Prepare to be amazed when literally none of that stops you from being hit for 200 points and having your ♥♥♥♥ing guts flown across the room by a super mutant with a gatling laser. In a game like this, combat usually involves lots and lots of saving... And luck.Heavily reccomend looking at some mods to remedy♥♥♥♥♥♥like this. Still a gud game though10/10 Like Skyrim wid guns.

												Fallout 1 is a very ♥♥♥♥ing good game. In fact, it's probably one of the best games of all time, and is definitely the best RPG ever made. Everything from the combat, which still holds up well today, to the dialogue, which is deep and satisfying with many options and even more outcomes, even to the ambient music, is perfect. Though the main allure here is the role-playing. Your stats actually matter (unlike the most recent FO games to an extent). In fact, early game your stats are the only thing that will keep you alive. If you chose wrong or without thinking, you're screwed. There are so many different outcomes to every quest and the game is very narrative-driven, but it still manages that feeling of complete player freedom that Bethesda have sacrificed so much to achieve in the newer games. Really, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Go buy it.			"

												Very early RPG by turns.Interesting but, a tad slow and not intuitive.As the very old RPGs, it has a deep story line and not so exciting graphics.Compared to Shadowrun, this one has a complexer turns system, closer to a table game and, it's not linear but, allows you to explore the map and sites in any order.Drawback is that you loose lot of time searching for nothing.But, if you like by turns RPGs, this one was one of its kind and, brook with typical dungeons and dragons ones.

												Good game. If you're like me and you played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this it might be a bit hard to get used to the old style of things, but you'll find it to be quickly addictive. I don't know what it is about it. Maybe it's the awesome story, big world, or blasting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of something with a minigun that keeps me playing, but you'll get your money's worth easily.It should be noted that there are a few annoying quirks, like followers not being able to equp armour, some S.P.E.C.I.A.L.S and skills being almost 100% useless, and the sometimes downright unfairness of combat, where you can sometimes die instantly while having full health with the best armour and every buff imaginable. Prepare to be amazed when literally none of that stops you from being hit for 200 points and having your ♥♥♥♥ing guts flown across the room by a super mutant with a gatling laser. In a game like this, combat usually involves lots and lots of saving... And luck.Heavily reccomend looking at some mods to remedy♥♥♥♥♥♥like this. Still a gud game though10/10 Like Skyrim wid guns.

												Welp I think its time I make a serious review about fallout 1. So I have played every fallout game, ( yes even the horrific tactics game), Beaten all the dlc's, and have modded the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of all of them. Also i made mods myself for the game. This game is amazing! Compared to the newer fallout games, this has a much better story, better quests, and balance. The story is you have to get a water chip for a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in your vault, and saving everyone from the new mutant race. A much better story then finding a poker chip, in falliut new vegas Kek. The game may be old but it flows very well! Combat is tactical and fun, missions have humour and are exciting, and deathclaws are still huge pains in the♥♥♥♥♥ The barter is much better in fallout 1 rather than selling your useless hunting rifles in fallout 3 for 12 caps. The locations in the game are very interesting and theres plenty of content to enjoy. There are multiple endings and each one of them are satisfying in their own right. Fallout is definitly a game to be played by anyone who loves post apocolyptic games. All in all, its still better than fallout 4!12 caps out of 9!Did I also mention theres sex with random woman in villages?			"

												Even today, this game is great. Isometric, turn based combat which actually takes strategy and planning. Its genius is its simplicity. Only problem it faces today is it isn't 100% compatible with newer operating systems, so unless you go into the ddraw.ini file and modify one of the values, you're gonna get screwy colours.EDIT: Since the updates a while back, that last bit is no longer an issue.

												A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)[1] is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"".[2] A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[3]			"

												Skip Fallout 3, avoid it like the plague and cancer it is to gaming as a whole. Get Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout: New Vegas.This one is the most unforgiving of the three. You're on a time limit, certain dialogue options can completely destroy your reputation in some places, resulting in death or simply being unable to continue any further conversation. The atmosphere is great, so is the story. The writing is exceptional, but nowhere nearly as good as Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that while the series has always prided itself in player choices, the game kind of feels linear at the start. In fact, the dialogue is so inconsitent that it almost feels like Skyrim. The combat system is also very comfy, just turn the combat speed up a bit so you don't have to sit there for 30 minutes and stare at some cave rat walk across the run while you're trying to run away from it.

												Not as good as the second game.  Much shorter (entire playthru doing everything except grinding random encounters for hours for most is around 20 hrs), and the whole timer thing puts a damper on things.  I play RPGs to avoid quick thinking.  I do that all day.  I like to think out my moves, and the turn based combat in this game allows that.  I like to explore.  I like to take forever to actually dent the main storyline quests.  The timer kills that quite a bit.  I get what they were doing, and that sense of dread was very real.  The writing is solid obviously, Black Isle duh.  I know what the timer was there for, and can appreciate the device it represents.  Any arguments for it are valid, but I am sure glad they took it out in FO2.  Other than that play this game.  If the graphics matter to you don't, also if you are impatient.  The UI is chunky, as it should be.  I actually like it, the whole pip boy novelty is solid.  It takes a few minutes in these games to shed off the expectation of convenience I get from the newer games today.  Not necessarily quest markers, or quest info even, but more ease of operation.  You gotta try things till they work in these games.  I like this.  Takes me  a few minutes to realize, but the wastelands are so harsh, even the game's ui fights you.  The hostility is palpable, and it is entirely worth it.  Who needs fast travel quest marker quests, banging out 5 at a time, when you could literally spend an hour pixel hunting, trying out different skills, talking to npcs, trying anything to avoid having to shoot up the place and make your life a ton harder.  All this just to get that one part you need, to trade for that other one part you need, so the guy who you are getting said part for will just give you bad information.  PLEASANTLY frustrating! :)			"

You have to research online and find fixes, still some do not fix everything.Overall this game shouldn't have been added to Steam yet, at least not until it was properly tested on multiple platforms.Maybe you should try the GOG version.Conclusion: Do not waste your money until they fix it.

												I want so bad to give this game a good review. I really do. I like this game, for the most part. But let's be honest here, it hasn't aged well at all. There is a lack of control over your other characters that is just horrible. There's a severe lack of balance in the way damage is delt. The way you interface with the game is probably my biggest problem, it makes the game practically unplayable. Everything is slow and delayed. I'm not recommending this game, don't misunderstand my intentions here. I'm not recommending the game because it's a good game, by 1997 standards. It's a classic, and it runs like a classic, that's been horribly neglected. This game really needs a remaster. A facelift and some adjustments to the controls, some minor adjustments to how your followers interact with you and you'll have something really great. As it stands though I just can't recommend it. It will be more frustration than fun. I do love the depth of the game, it's really great. And if it's on sale grab it, you might enjoy it, otherwise I think I'd look for something else. It pains me to hit the thumbs down button here but as it stands I feel this game provides more frustration than fun. I've spent more time waiting on screens to open and close and waiting on my items to switch than I have actually playing it. Here's hoping for that remaster.			"

												9/10 - excellent rpg and game and worthy of several playthroughs at leastCons: You really need to play the gog version if you want the HD patch (or at least I had to)My reviews are always based on the following-I only play hard or impossible-I don't save/load scum, live with mistakes (exceptions in this game, I save once an hour or so)-I don't use 3rd party cheat tools-I don't play multiplayer and am reviewing singleplayer aspects unless otherwise noted			"

												This is not like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. This game is tough especially for people who are not experienced in cRPGS. With that being said, this game is enjoyable- i clocked in about 25 hours. This game has many problems - bugs, broken and cut quests, outdated graphics(even with highrez mod), not fully fledged or connecting dialogue, outdated gameplay mechanics, having to optimize this game for your comp by yourself(THANKS STEAM...) and my main gripe that this game feels to me a beta for fallout 2 which most people say is the superior between the two.I feel this game gets the classic nod, because of what it brings to the western rpg genre  - a unique rpg system with perks, special stats and skills which affect the world around you, ambigous morality, interesting setting and lore, great story line, fairly good dialogue, random encounters.AS a person who's first fallout game was New Vegas, i felt really out of place when i first dl this game. Its really difference and theirs a learning curve to it.This game is old and outdated - this is true no argument about that. So it will affect my final score.My Score system: 10/10 is a perect, 5/10 is average, and 0/10 Horrible.This game is a 7/10, a good game. It should be played if your a fallout fan and have never touched this old cRPG classic. "

												In my original review of fallout i praised the game for having many different ways to accomplish things, (which i still stand by)  and being an overall fun time, but playing the game more i felt large amounts of frustration starting to build up within me. To put it simply after the first half of the game  i started to hate it.It instantly turns into a cliche kill these bad guys because they're bad kind of story, all i could do was roam around the wastes until i found the brotherhood of steel who ask you to do a quest then seem to let any old person into their base. I then talked to someone and had to go kill super mutants at their base and they had machine guns and rocket launchers that could one shot me.So far in the game i have used one weapon as an unarmed character which are brass knuckles and i have yet to find anything better which really irritates me. I now don't actually want to play it anymore as all i do is die to overpowered weapons and have no clear indicator of where to go or what to do, ( i don't dislike games that don't hold your hand, heck i love dark souls to bits and it does not hold your hands by any means).And now i sit here, and in all honesty only buy this game if you like the fallout franchise or older RTS games, and even then you might struggle to enjoy it.

												Well, at least I can tell myself that I tried. After hearing around the whole internet that this game was definetly better than Fallout 3 and on, I decided to buy it. I was sure that the game would have some pretty bad graphics and what not, but personally I don't mind old games and bad graphix at all. What a game should have, its value. A game with a good story, a good gameplay. and a good fluidity , it's a good game. Fallout 1 only gets the story characteristic right. Yes, the story is amaing, and t gets the feeling and atmosphere right. It was amazing to get inmersed into the wasteland for the first time, but, that's about it. Honestly, even modern Fallouts get this right. The problem with this game is the gameplay, and the pacing. My god.    The gameplay is horrible. It is so slow, and ridiclous, that it makes it boring. It's basicaly a point and click battle system, with enemies that deal ridiculous damage and never miss, while you are too weak and are constantly missing.   It never made me feel good, like an RPG usually does, about getting stronger with EXP., and then tackling the stronger enemies and achieving victories. Why? cause, and this is the best part, at the beginning of the game, you have a stupid time limit. You can't go around exploring the wasteland and getting stronger at your own pace! Nope. You need to hurry and finish part of the main quest with as little moves as possible, so you don't get a game over. If you are like me and you don't like looking up things at google to solve games, then you'll probably have to start over from scratch more than once to figure out what to do to solve this problem. It's just not fun. Anybody that likes this game is because they feel nostalgia. That's it. The game itsef is garbage, quite honestly. Every single character is shallow, except for the final boss, and the side-quest are crap. If you lived in the 80's and 90's this game would've been mind blowing. Today, it's crap.			"

												A classic in all regards I must say: gameplay, presentation, and story. Also when it comes to classics, however; an obtrusive control interface and mechanics that don't work in modern times. I've been a big fan of the Fallout franchise for at least 9 years at this point, my obsession starting with Fallout 3. A game that I believe still holds up quite well, same goes with New Vegas (the sort of actual sequel to Fallout 1 and 2). Although 3 and New Vegas have their problems, with their clunky combat system and more bugs than a cabbage field that hasn't been sprayed with pesticide, are what I classify as fun. Fallout 1, is not fun. As I mentioned earlier, it's controls are garbage and hard to get a hold of today and certainly was a niche for certain people back in day (I presume at least, I was born a year after the game came out.) Maybe I'm spoiled, I probably am, but the way you go about ANYTHING in Fallout 1 isn't intuitive in the slightest. Wanna check out that body? Right click mouse over the body, hold the left click down, and then move the mouse down to examine the body. Wanna hack a computer? Click on the red button at the far right of your interface and click ""Science"" and you'll get a yellow crosshair. Mouse the crosshair over the computer and HOPE you hack it. Hacking/lockpicking/any sort of skill check is asinine. You never get any indication of how tough a skillcheck will be unless you try to bash your head against it until you break the lock, get locked out of the computer, or magically it works. Combat I'm very split on. When you don't break your gun, drop your weapon, stab yourself, or miss, combat can be decent at times. Although even in a full suit of power armor, you can magically get one shotted by super mutants because...because. Fighting in enclosed locations is a hassle as well, since sometimes you can't see what position your enemy is at so sometimes your shot may be blocked so you have to use up precious action points to get an angle on them. Companions are also a detrement in combat, since they can miss and end up shooting you, getting a critical hit, and kill you. Thanks Ian. Other times they bug out if they run out of ammo, and ditch their gun. Even after giving them extra ammo, they never reverted back to their guns and only used a knife or just never ever fought any enemies ever again. I had to make 5 characters because each time I ran out of the very stupid time limit that's forced on you at the start of the game. Oh about that, this game is an semi-open world RPG with a TIME LIMIT. You have 150 days to get a water chip for your vault or else it's instant game over. 150 days sounds like a lot, but it really isn't. You'll use up those days trying to find a god damn piece of rope you need to travel down another vault to get said water chip. At least once you get the water chip, the time limit is gone. Looting is a pain if you're running with laser weaponry too, since you end up vaporizing your enemies who drop all their goodies on the ground. You have to individually mouse over items to pick them up, and sometimes items are so small, you miss them. I had to reload a save that was hours back, just to get a item I needed to complete the game with.tl;dr/wrap upFallout 1 can be fun at times. Most times however, it isn't fun at all. It's aged poorly, has a terrible interface, and has really dumb, easy to miss plot crucial items. It's neat to see where the series started, but I'd stick with any of the newer games.			"

												This game for me is terrible , its probably because I don't really play alot of RTS games , I don't mind slow combat , but this is made bad in fallout because you ue action points which limits your attacks but it also makes opening your inventory minus action points , and also it uses turn based combat and not real time strategy combat.One thing that also bugs me is the time limit , i know they added this because it would make no sense if there was not a time limit in this situation , but it limits what you can do , like collect all the weapons and those weapons cost an arm and leg.Luckily the rest was ok good story , awesome perk system and how your choices change the game.

												I missed this in 1997.  While the story telling might have been top at the time, judging by the 9/10 scores it got back in the day, the quest system is just abysmal.  In a year that saw Postal, Age of Empires, and Total Annihilation top the charts, I just don't see how Fallout got the praise it did.  Maybe it was the customizable character advancement, which I admit might have been unique at the time.  But it just hasn't aged well.  X-COM was infinitely better and it was released 3 years prior.

												The short version would be for you to get an upgraded experience from Fallout 2 and read about this one on the wikipedia or something.So this game has a lot of fan boys... This game suffers from serious gameplay drawbacks that make it more frustrating than fun. Like seriously I think a 5 year old could have designed better math models for the hit percentages in this game. Seriously, I had VATS 87% chance to hit then shoot and miss 18 times in a row. Guess what game... that's not an 87% chance. Now if this happened once or twice, ok that's one thing, but this is a constant fight the game puts you against for no reason.Next is the criticals... worst experience with them ever. After the first quarter of the game they will be the only enemy attack that will kill you. The normal attacks will hit you for 0 HP continuously, but then a mole rat will crit you for over 110 HP. The last boss is a perfect example of this. Him and his Super Mutants regular damage 0 HP lost, then a critical 200 HP lost. Your life will depend on a critical attack every turn of every encounter. Dreadul to a mathematical power of 50.Then there's a mixture of feelings when it comes to the stories and plot in the game. The NPC's are pretty deep and well planned out. They offer information on the world, and allow you to see a sort of cultural element to the Wasteland. I liked this alot, and the locations you do get to visit are unique and inspiring. Yet in the end they are far to sparse to really feel connected to. Then the map... oh god the map... You will waste most of your time traveling into areas that will never lead to anywhere. Then in a moment you will realize that 80% of the map is dead, worthless space. Thanks for wasting my time game walking through desert fighting mole rats for absolutely nothing.These combinations of bad gameplay make this a terrible game, but a great story. That's why I recommend reading on this one then moving to the second one. Nearly all of the problems in gameplay this faces are rectified in the second. Making Fallout 2 a much better choice for your money.			"

Simply put, Fallout 1 may have been great for its time, and spawned a successful franchise, but it hasn't aged well. At all. Unless you knowthat you will absolutely love this game, don't buy it. Again, no offense to anyone that likes this game, but this is my take on the matter.			"

												I am a big lover of the original Fallout series games. However since Bethesda has updated the game they have ruined it. They only applied a well known resolution patch which has been avaiable for years on the net to increase the resolution to fit most modern screens. However no improvemnt or bug fixes have been made. I also would like to point out that the resoution is horrible. There is no HD patch upgrade like in many other games from other developers like the stronghold HD series which is a great patch. But again like always Bethesda has dropped the ball in our belived Fallout series. If you want this game find an older version if you can. I dont find the quality of the recent patches made by bethesda even adequate. I loved this game now I have to find my old windows 95 cd-roms and try to install those instead :(			"

												I never thought that a classic game such as this would be so bad.I really wanted to play this for the story but man this just isn't worth it. If you genuinely think this is a 10/10 game you must have been 10 years old when you last played this. Nostalgia has to be the only cure for this.As I'm writing this I just finally ragequit after playing an 9 hour session, in the middle of which I had to start a new character because I found out that I had basically just lost the game there and there was no way to return. The reason I just ragequit is that pretty much the same thing happened again. I went into an area from which I could not get out alive. Of course I only had one save because I couldn't ever have expected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this.The game forces you to save every 5 seconds because you never know when YOU are going to ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELF over by choosing one of the wrong answers in some conversation (even though it might be a completely normal thing to say).If you fail to choose the ""right"" thing to say from the 4 or 5 dialogue options some NPCs will NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN. Their hatred for you burns with the heat of the sun because you asked how they were doing instead of if they had a job for you.The NPCs also seem to ignore the stats that bind the player. They shoot you with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starting pistols from a mile away and do damage you can only dream of doing yourself.Other than that the combat mechanics are pretty interesting and work well. You can plan your moves well and do some really nice tacticool stuff. It was really satisfying to clear out the Raider Camp but after meeting Super Mutants and finding out that they have infinite health I just didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do to get more levels.Some of the objectives were also almost impossible to find out for yourself. Sometimes there is a pixel-fine line between advancing to the next area and ""nothing interesting happens"". I only checked a guide once to see what to do next and I am sure I would have been there for two hours and restarted the whole game after that if I didn't do it.Maybe it was all my fault and I'm really bad at video games. But damn this game isn't hard, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Mechanical difficulty is entirely different from what this game is.Don't buy this game if you want to find out about the Fallout story. Just go read it.

												Don't bother purchasing Fallout, if you're interested in the older installments purchase Fallout 2. The game is riddled with bugs, so don't bother playing it without the Fallout FIXD Mod.  The actual game itself leaves a lot to be desired, as the gameplay and story are paper thin.  Most perks and skills are useless in the game, so you'll likely need to read up on how to build your character before you begin playing, so as to not put yourself at a major disadvantage at the onset.  This is extremely dissapointing for an RPG game, as it forces you to play in a certain way, not the way you want to play.  The world is small, and main baddies (super mutants), play almost no role in the game, save one instance, until the finale.  The controls take a few hours to get used to, but even after a day of playing, you may still be unsure how to approach certain quests and objectives presented within the game.  (You need to ""use"" a radio to disable the forcefields at the military base, wah?, and good luck figuring that out without using google.)   There's little reason to explore quests on the side, some are only initiated with very specific dialouge (despite it seeming as though you've reached an agreement), and some quests are hinted at but don't even exist at all!  The rewards that come from completing the various quests are useless unless there's some type of loot you'll find along the way.  Don't bother saving up money to purchase the various in game weapons, as you'll find all the ammo and weaponry you need along the way.  There are only a few talking heads in the game, but other than the Mutant at the military base and the ""Master"" during the end-game, the characters are bland, boring, and offer little in the way of interesting information or background.  All of this takes away from the games interesting premise that paved the way for much better Fallout sequels.   Towards the end of the game, I finally realized that there's little meaningful dialogue and reason to explore the map and grinded through it, only to have the game crash at the end.  Good aspects of the game include the excellent voice acting (despite most of it being shallow), and a few interesting story bits provided by the two meaningful characters.  The combat can also be fun in final stages of the game, but boring at the beggining and middle portions.  Overall the atmosphere and originality of the game and its sequels makes the games existence seem worthwhile.  However, as a standalone game it has little redeeming qualities, and at the insanely rip-off price of $10, you're better off watching the cutscenes on Youtube and passing on this so call ""classic"".

												I would only recomend this game to a die hard fan of the fallout series and not a casual person looking to have fun, I did not enjoy this game other than the plot and music. The only thing I did enjoy about the gameplay was hearing the famous ink spots ""maybe"" play in the begining of the game. The only reason I played this game was just because I wanted to say I played it. The game itself (without a walkthough) is VERY time consuming (even for an RPG standards). It took me a whole 10 minutes to just leave the cave! there is no real help or objective other than a sticky note on your pip boy. Also every battle was very boring (slow) or too hard, it was nearly impossable to shoot something and monsters do WAY too much damage! (to be fair you're only given so much health in the beginning)  Hell elderscroll's ""arena"" played smoother than fallout 1... I don't know... maybe i'm just bias because I played fallout 3 before I played fallout 1...  also the npc faces freaked me out.in short the only reason some one would enjoy this game today would be for nostalga reasons because frankly this game has not aged well.

												I had high hopes in this legendary game, and was terribly disappointed.From the beginning, the game plays extremely slow and felt more like work than like fun. I seriously had to force myself to keep playing the game, and if i hadnt paid for it, i would have already deinstalled it!About the reasons: The difficulty is extremely hard, as the hero is very weak, and hardly able to kill anything at the beginning. Be prepared to reload very often, as random encounters are usually much more than you could take, and as the leveling process is painfully slow!Then, as you would expect from such an old game, the graphic is terrible, and the game mechanics are outdated. Dont expect the comfort, complexity and polish of modern games. Without fanmods, this game is hardly playable at all, and even with, the game crashes constantly and lots of bugs remain. And finally, there is a time-limit for your mission, which causes a tough game to become stressy and annoying.Personally, i cannot recommend this game at all!			"

												This game is terrible. It makes me wonder how they ever raised enough funds to make it to a Fallout 4. The graphics are dull and lifeless even for the time period it was made in. The story line is boring. The characters are lifeless and the talant system is overdone and makes you not even want to get through the character creation screen.

												Disclaimer: I have previously played Fallout 3 and enjoyed both the game and universe. That being said, I looked into the original games a bit before purchasing to see what type of gameplay it was.The Basics:  This game has a top-down view with turn-based combat. The game came out in 1997, so the graphics are starting to show their age.My Opinion: I didn't care for this game at all. There are two big things that ruined the game for me: poor direction and terrible combat. When it comes to quests, I would like some for of, ""the main mission/quest is in this general direction."" I want some idea of knowing how I can progress. I am not asking for the game to hold my hand. I actually don't care for games that hold my hand. However, I shouldn't have to look at a walkthrough to tell me where I have to go for the main story. It would be one thing if I didn't know where to find a side mission/quest. Sometimes people get lost in games, sure. You start out lost at the beginning of the game with no sense of direction in a cave. The combat was the second issue I had. It's clunky and bland. Maybe I just didn't play far enough into the game, but it just felt sloppy and wasn't engaging. It didn't feel like I was able to do anything. You start off with all of your items, and weapons, in your bag. You have nothing equpped. Take a few steps forward and you are in your first battle. Now, almost every single game I have ever played has you start with a weapon equipped, or you fight to gain that first weapon. As I said, you have your first weapon, why the hell is it not equipped or tell you to check inventory? So after you either fail or realize, ""oh hey, I have a ♥♥♥♥ing gun that nobody told me about,"" you finally equip it. Now you can fight rats and point blank range with a gun. You shoot, you miss. You shoot again, you miss again. Meanwhile, this rat is going to beat the hell out of you and you lose half of your health while shooting and outline of the rat around him.Conclusion: This game isn't for me. The sloppy direction and combat are what drove me away. Maybe the game is too dated. Maybe if I had tried it a few years soon, I might have been able to enjoy it. The fact is that now I don't find the game enjoyable at all.3/10			"

												I played the game back in 97 and didn't really like it. I played it again a year ago and couldn't get into it at all. Now I tried it for the third time and it just doesn't get any better. I know that the game eventually gets more interesting, but the first quest that you need to do to be able to play the game freely is just so mind-boggling boring. It might be a whole different story if I played it more when it came out, but today I really can't recommend it.			"

												Ah, the original Fallout. One of the classic RPGs that's generally (and unfortunately) overlooked by people today.This game would be slightly better if the port was updated to the point where it wasn't so glitchy. First of all, the cutscenes are very blurry and rainbow-y. Second, there is no sort of instruction at all (which isn't Steam's fault, the only instructions that came with this game originally came in the manual booklet). Thirdly, there's few to no options with which to change resolution or full-screen/window.The game itself is much more difficult than I expected, which is neither a plus nor a minus. Some games are harder than others, so what?Honestly, while I like the game, I don't really recommend buying it unless you're willing to fix the bugs and learn to play completely by yourself.			"

Getting around is a chore and the graphics look like mud, which is appropriate for the setting, but it's visually muddy and low-res.If a remake of this game was created in Fallout 2's engine it would probably be wonderful. This was a game-changer when it was released; but it's hard to play in 2014 without getting a little bit frustrated.			"

												Really slow and quite boring to play. Since I played the newer games first I probably grew to expect fast paced combat in all the games, but instead you get slow, and I mean SLOW, turned based combat. The action point system really annoys me as well, Ive got like a 9 out of 10 for agility or endurance (or whatever) in my stats which I expected, like in the newer games, would make me run faster and for longer but Ive got like 10 ""action points"" instead which I know sounds big and you think you might be able to do loads of stuff with them, but each 'action' takes about 3 or 4 points, so you end up only being able to do like 2 things per turn. Oh and by action, I mean: Walk around, look in inventory (which takes 3 action points by the way), shoot/attack something, look at something, or literally anything really. So when compared to the incredibly slow combat, with you maybe, (if your lucky) getting 2 shots, or attacks, on an enemy each turn, you get an even more slow and boring game.The story isnt that great also. All you need to do is get a water chip or something so your told to go to another vault and find one, so then when you get there you're literally just told: ""OH ITS NOT HERE, PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN"". I got bored after that and just stopped. The game makes me feel really tired, honestly about 30 minutes of gameplay and I need to quit otherwise I might fall asleep. I know that Im being harsh but because I grew with the newer generation Fallout games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas I felt really disappointed by this one. This is just my opinion by the way but if you do get bored quickly and if you hate slow gameplay then this is NOT the game for you. I give it about 4.5/10			"

												Never having played this game back in it's heyday and after hearing how asweomse this game is from every corner of the internets. (Thank you Al Gore!) I decided to pick it up on sale and give it a go. I was surprised that I just couldn't get into it. It's not the graphics, I love old school games. It's not the character building. I loved that. My dissapointment set in for the first time when I traveled on the overworld map. You just click where you want to go and a red dot moves across the map to the position you chose. That's it.

 Skip to 14 minutes 45s to see what Im talking about.I guess I was just expecting more after all the hype. Maybe Wasteland 2 will satisfy the oldschool post apocalyptic itch for a whole new generation. Myself included.			"

												All of the older fall out series have a color glitch and makes the game literly un-playable, but it did bring my favorite games Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas. Saddly i am going to have to not recommend buying this game or any of the other older Fallouts due to this glitch, (I have googled how to fix it and found nothing). Other then that i want to thank these 3 Fallouts for bringing me FO3, and FO New Vegas.			"

												It didn't take long to decide I didn't like this game. The menus are fiddley.Locations are hidden behind walls until you move a character there.The real dealbreaker, however, is the combat.  You have to move a character to the edge of the map to end a fight, such as when you have a random encounter with ""radscorpions"" that you can't deal damage against.  I encountered such a situation and while I moved my main character (who is the only one in your control, by the way) to the edge of the map to flee the scorpions chased my ally off the the screen and then killed him.  Again... they were fighting off screen!The entire combat system is overly simple to begin with:  Use action points to move, shoot, reload, switch weapons or use a healing item.  You can only do maybe two per turn.In short, combat which is half the game is a complete joke.  Don't waste your money.			"

												LET ME MAKE ONE THING ABSOLUTELY CLEAR:  IF YOU PLAYED FALLOUT 3 OR PAST THAT, AND EXPECT THIS TO BE SIMILAR, YOU'RE IN FOR A BAD TIME.Fallout is different.  The graphics aren't the best, the game play's difficult, and there's a timer for the better part of the game.  I didn't care for it, but, then again, I played Fallout 3 first.			"

												It's good for the time, bugs are unbearable, some even cause the game to break and make it impossible to complete. Due to that, I can't give it a good up rating, if you can get by all that though and the constricted and sometimes boring gameplay, it's great, not that it's boring either, but sometimes it can get boring, not much replay value here.For what it's worth, it's a good first time game, you'll have a bit of fun if you enjoy this type of game, but as I've discovered enjoying these types of games isn't enough for a second or third playthrough.

												If you're buying this, just know it has a sħitty mechanic where the game ends (wont let you keep playing) abruptly if you take too long to find the water chip or just dont care about finding it like i did, THATS RIGHT, this crap game will throw away all your progress just because you either didn't care for the main story or was too busy grinding, why this game wont let you play after your vault dies is beyond me other than the fact that interplay is probably braindead, I shouldn't have to make a new save just because i don't care about the water chip. 6 hours of progress gone just because i wanted to grind so that i would actually stand a chance against tougher enemies. Thank's interplay.Update: Just got done playing fallout 2, it's even worse. It forces you to have 4 intelligence or more to beat the game (You can't find vault 13 without it) and have a melee build at the start of the game or you can't win the fist fight with the guy at the end of temple of trials (Basically you can't progress and you're forced to make a new character). Speaking of the temple of trials, you can't skip it, even if your character has 10 intelligence and charisma you can't convice the guy outside the temple to move out of the way, same for the guy at the end of the temple, nice immersion interplay. And if your character has three intelligence or less, good luck finding a cure for jet addiction. This game is so bad it makes fallout seem good in comparison, atleast in fallout you can beat the game with a low intelligence character, with any build, And theres no forced/scripted events that you can't skip or intervene in. If there's anything good i can say about fallout, it's that atleast it's not fallout 2.			"

												Awful game. History is pretty good and the concept of a post-apocalyptic lone survivor in the future is something we saw in Mad Max and we know we love it. But the commands and controls are beyond bad and incomprehensible even after an hour or 2 playing. Only way you can walk is by using walking points, the only way to attack is by using action points and if you get surrounded by enemies and there are no action points left (meaning you cant attack) you'll be stuck eternally LOL laughable engine material. This game apparently was made by some lunatic Dungeons & Dragons fan who wanted to f*ck you up and give you a hard time so you'd know what's it to be a total nerd who has no idea of what a life or a p*ssy is. Don't get me wrong, I personally love the story of the game and the concept. Fallout 3 was a great reinvention of the series but this is just outrageous and unnaceptable. Made for a different era and for people with special needs. Just don't buy it. Not worth a penny.			"

												A classic, plain and simple. Its a merciless game but, intensely addicting. Vastly different play style than from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, its a third person view turn based combat, there are plenty of fights you'll encounter that require a good deal of planning. The storyline is shorter compaired to the other games but eacht ime you play the experience is completely different based on your SPECIAL stats. The only downside is this has trouble running on current machines, I tracked down some patches that fix it but still run into some issues with stability. This of course is to be expected from an older game.			"

												This is a very, very thick game.The amount of RPG and options is mass, and the different storylines and endings are quite fun to accomplish. Hell, I lost A WEEK AND A HALF PLAYING THIS. Look at my hours clocked!Where can I start. Ever played S.T.A.L.K.E.R.? Imagine that but in a top-down shooter, with thicker character traits that can help or kill your plight into the Wastelands.You start off in the remains of California after a generation passed, following the Great War. There's so much to explore and so much to do that I cannot put it all into one review.Things I liked the most were the replayability, the charcters, the dialogue, the content, the setting, the sheer fun of getting drunk and shooting Bandits and Raiders and Monsters. Depending on how you're built, you can decide just who accompanies you, what you do, when you do it and where. You can take jobs, continue with the quest, become a breeki, so much to do.Take a look for yourself, be warned, spoilers ahead.

If the angle and the controls are too clonky for you, I highly recommend starting in New Vegas or better yet, Fallout 4.http://store.steampowered.com/app/22380http://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Be warned, you WILL miss out on a lot of story and that's just what I loved about this game. Also if you decide to buy, I'd recommend this: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/45615/ Over just Fallout by itself. Unless you're really unsure, then just grab this one!I can't wait to get to 4, just now beat the game and after some going back to goof around, gonna work my way up to the big ones.			"

												I originally played Fallout 3 first. I loved that game and wanted to play the ones that came before the 3rd one. I was hesitant to play them because they were made in the 90's and I was afraid I would not get into them because of the game play and the graphics. I was so wrong! Fallout is so much fun! I did have a hard time playing it since I never played games on a PC.I give this game a 10/10.			"

												What can be said about this classic masterpiece, that hasn't been said already? if you never played Fallout, you might be wondering if ""it is really that good, or it is just nostalgia"". The short answer is yes, it is incredibly good. It is easily one of the best 5 RPGs ever released.I'll start with the aspects of the game that may not be that good. Inventory management is cumbersome, as you can only view a few items at the same time and have to scroll up and down constantly. Overall the UI is not as ""comfortable"" to use as modern UIs. Also, the enemy AI is a bit primitive (not that newer games are any better, actually...) and you'll also find that some character development options are obvious ""traps"" that may make you restart the game. for instance, there's certain skills that you can raise easily spending money in-game; if you don't know that and spend your valuable points there, you'll seriously handicap yourself. Same with some weapon skill choices. Finally, companions are rather weak, since you can't equip them nor they seem to progress nor follow any orders; they are fragile and suicidal, so in the endgame you're better off without them. Now that the ""not perfect"" things are out of the way, let's get to the meaty part.The setting and the whole idea about Fallout is brilliant, and has been executed perfectly, much better depicted and detailed than in the new Bethesda sequels. Dialogues are short yet well-written, the layout and pacing of the story makes sense, and the atmosphere when you explore places like Vault 15 or The Glow absolutely delivers. The game can feel oppresive and dark when it wants to, yet there is plenty of humor that even breaks the ""fourth wall"" sometimes, and it has been added with good taste, so it doesn't erode the game's apocalyptic atmosphere.Quests in this game put to shame most of the quest writers in this generation. So many different ways to solve them! and no, I don't mean the trivial meaningless choices for one reward or another you see in Skyrim; I mean that you can solve almost all the situations without violence, and you can make choices that really alter the world. There's a ""dumb way"", a ""talky way"", ""sneaky way"" to solve each problem, to a degree like no other RPG I can think of. This variety of choice is the essence of RPGs, what really makes you feel like you are ""playing a role"" in a unique way, different from what other players did. One of the reasons Fallout is so immersive is because it really brings on the table the element of survival. Unlike in most RPGs, where you quickly escalate the curve of power and become invulnerable, you can be easily killed in Fallout, always. Friendly fire is always a big risk, and even in the end game, and having good weapons and armor, you can get shot down rather quickly if your strategy is bad. Which encourages thinking, and caring. Survival becomes the main focus in the game, which is quite amazing. The moment you begin feeling ""safe"" in a setting like this, you can say that it has failed to deliver.Yet, once you understand the tactical elements in the game, it is not that hard. Difficulty is very well gauged in my opinion, punishing you when you are reckless or pick the wrong fights, yet allowing you to gain advantage when you do things right and choose the right tools for each job. As it should be.There's many more aspects I could talk about, I suppose. Sound and music are good, art is sometimes outstanding, sometimes adequate. Overland map allows to travel in a non-cumbersome way, without losing the feeling of ""exploration"". And the details make obvious this game was made with love and patience. Little things like weapon descriptions, or small humorous references in dialogues, or some of the random encounters. Classy. Timeless. 10/10. Must play if you love the genre.			"

												Fallout, no point in saying how good it is, because it's won a cult status. Interesting and exciting gameplay, despite the outdated graphics, replayability, interesting plot, and incredibly vibrant world of post nuclear America.A pleasure to explore the world in which established new rules and towns. The most remarkable is the ability to complete the game as you want, to decide whom to live ,who shall die, who is good-natured, and who a villain. There are no boundaries, just you and wasteland.This is a game that probably should play everyone at least once. Such games - a rarity.			"

As for me I sort of blindly went a step too fast in the main quest and ended the game a bit sooner which is kind of ironic. But hey I liked it for what it is.			"

												I completely missed the older installments of Fallout like many fans; I didn't pick up the series until Fallout 3 and had little knowledge of the predecessors. The gameplay is vastly different, but I was pleasantly surprised and love how the theme and culture of the game really did ring through the series. I was in awe about how great the atmosphere of this game is; the music, brutality, twists, and the little tidbits that make it a great RPG. Granted, it's from 1997 so the expansive of the game was obviously limited by capabilities at the time.  Despite of that however... this game can get you addicted and playing for many hours! Leaving you begging for more and you understand why it's a series. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of Fallout theme; post-apocalypse, gritty realities, gory outcomes, and a moral compass thrown out the window. You'll fall in love with the towns, people, missions, and the outcomes that directly correlate to what you do. The action in this game is oriented toward classic RPGs; it is turn/dice roll statistics dependent. So you won't be running around... but you'll question your sanity when you smile every time an enemy's torso blows in half from a critical hit. You'll get 20+ hours of gameplay from this game if you play the main storyline and do the essential/big missions. I imagine there's much more to the game that I missed during my playthrough. Buy it. Enjoy it. And smile knowing there's sequels waiting for you.			"

												Fallout 1 and 2 are the greatest RPGs of all time.  Bugs, fairly clunky interface and controls, turn-based combat and all.  The game draws you in, and won't let go even after multiple playthroughs; and on that note, this game is one of the most replayable of all time.  The depth and flexabilty of this masterpiece rival any RPG.  Stealth is well implimented, hand to hand combat is very distinct from ranged, and diplomacy and deception will often avert the necesity for combat at all, allowing players to possibly avoid combat completely (as boring as that sounds).But is the combat fun?  I mean turn-based combat sounds fairly tedious in todays generation of fast-paced gaming right?  Surprisingly (for an ADD guy like myself) the turn-based combat here is incredibly addicting, with each and every action point precious and not to be tossed off lightly!  For some gamers, the combat will certainly be too in depth, and simply not within the range of their gaming interest, but many would be surprised if they gave this gem a chance.The writing is excellent, and I'm not an easy sell.  But the voice acting is probably the best ever in a video game.  I know, I know, sounds like an over-zealous fanboy, but... the voice cast is almost universally professional actors, with the great Jim Cummings edging out the rest in quality.  His three distict characters (Gizmo, The Master, and Set) are performed so well, that they are some of the few game performances I'll sit back and listen to without reflexivly skipping past.  They're that good.And one final note.  The game designers took the time to include a very unique feature, the dumb character.  If you choose to create a character with intelligence 3 or fewer, he will be an effectivly mentally challenged character, unable to converse fully with npc's.  This provides a new challenge, very different from a game with an intelligent character.  Sounds novel, I know, but the game creators literally made every single npc react to such a character as they would to a incredible dumb person, witch is often very funny (and difficult) as you will be unable to aquire many quests.Anyway, as you can tell I love this game, and highly recommend it to any and all RPG fans.  Believe me, if you give this game a shot, chances are you'll have a great time.			"

												If you haven't played Fallout 3 already, you're missing out. So not playing this might as well be the same thing. A top down mix of real time combat and turn based, Fallout will imerse you into the game GREATLY. I mean seriously, you can right click and hover your mouse cursor over anything and you get a detailed discription of it, then you can even left click to get an even MORE detailed description of it. The music is usually dark in most cases, kinda makes you feel like when the npcs' say, ""It's dangerous there!"" You feel like it's actually dangerous there. And speaking of danger, THIS GAME IS DIFFACULT. Half the time you die you don't even know the reason! Moving on to weapons and armor. New weapons and armor are quite rare, so actually finding a new weapon makes you feel great for finding it. I personally love this game, but it requires a lot of time, a lot of saving and a lot of imersing yourself into it, kinda making yourself feel like you are actually you in the game. I give it a 9/10. (Also there are a TON of easter eggs in the game that give you a fun challenge to do if you're bored; which you won't be with this game :D )			"

												The first fallout game is indeed my favorite, fallout is near and dear to my heart, one of the first real rpg games i ever played. the first game just feels so nice, civilization is scattered and sparce, it feels right, and everything feels nicely made and placed.in comparison to 2, i just feel like the first game had more of that 'apocalypse' feel to it, where 2 kind of felt ( not in a bad way ) slightly overpopulated, as well as communities being a bit too well established. i dont know, alot would disagree, but as far as i can say, fallout 1 is a brilliant game, and id recommend it to anyone willing to give it a go.

												Fallout is quite an experience. Like most games, Fallout has its quarks and times when you get a little frustrated at a small detail or lack there of. However, for myself, when I began to play Fallout I was enthrolled with the world in which I was to explore. Being a vet of Fallout 3 and New Vegas I wasn't sure how I would feel about a tactical turn based combat system. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how much it felt like I was playing a tabletop RPG. All in all, Fallout is a game I will always remember fondly with its exciting quest plots and interesting characters and situations. But it's downsides were slightly taxing, I would say it is worth $10 but if you get it on sale it is absolutly worth the time and investment.			"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcLUcvXREHEAfter playing and beating this absolute masterpiece for the hundredth time, an urge to write a review about it arose within of me. The reason why i decided to write this review is so that newer players (specifically, newer Fallout fans) could get a clear picture as to what this game really is. An intention to place emphasis on this RPG's stronger and weaker aspects is present in the review (fortunately there is significantly more of the former than the latter), as well as some inevitable spoilers, so read at your own consideration!  Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, today known simply as Fallout 1, in my opinion, is a game which is far beyond any rating, even the most highest one. The reason for this lies in the fact that Fallout 1, being the first in the series, gave a solid start to an awesome franchise which today, with the upcoming Fallout 4, stirred up an unbelievable scope of agitation. All of the subsequent Fallout games which were released after Fallout 1 had the same majority of concepts and design, which once again proves - original and good things are difficult to create, but can last virtually forever as great success. Today, most, if not all concepts which were present in the first Fallout can be seen in the newer Fallout titles (Brotherhood of Steel initiates getting blown up in a Vertibird by the  protagonist in the Fallout 4 trailer is a good example of this). This simply goes to show, that the original Fallout isn't merely a game, it's an expertly designed world which was created in the distant 1997 and is being graphically refined up to this day. What the original Fallout 1 (and 2 for that matter) definitely had is an indescribable atmosphere and spirit around it, something which can't be brought into a video game simply via graphics and todays technological marvels. Younger players often tend to judge a title by it's visual qualities, and frankly speaking, a video game which is 18 years old cannot possibly meet modern graphical standards. I first discovered Fallout thanks to a good friend of mine, when he was playing it at his place back in 2002. By that time, Fallout was five years years old, and during those days, i have already seen and played some newer games like Jagged Alliance 2 or Diablo II:Lord of Destruction, and found these games to be somewhat more graphically advanced. Both of these titles could of been visually compared to Fallout since they share isometric, birds view graphics. At first, i found the graphics in Fallout 1 & 2 to be bleak and somewhat devoid of color, so the first impression  of the game wasn't the most positive one, although i instantly noticed it's brutal, apocalyptic style. After i immersed myself into Fallout i realized, that the designers made the game with such somber colors intentionally, since this way they could portray a more realistic, grim atmosphere set in a broken world... At that time, such design and setting was was very original and uncommon, for we gamers were all well familiar with, for an example, a fantasy setting full of orcs and dragons and magic, but no one had the pleasure to blaze lead or laser beams at huge, hulking atrocities known as Super Mutants or steal bottle caps from unaware wastelanders, or explore a huge, adventure and danger filled world with full freedom, being restricted only by a certain time limit. Despite the fact that the graphics in Fallout are outdated, the amount of detail which the developers added to this game arouses a feeling of admiration. The in-game UI visuals resemble equipment, possibly or even probably an extension of the pip-boy which the protagonist is wearing, and indicate any information regarding the world around the player. The game features a wide arsenal of weaponry, each gun has background description related to it, as does armor and other items. The surrounding  environment is somewhat repetitive but by no means boring. The game takes place in post-war state of California, which is now a barren wasteland that will always accompany you during the course of your adventures. Besides the wasteland, your character will also see many other places and environments, such as mountaincaverns or the interiors of pre-war installations. Combat animations in-game are absolutely stunning and full of gore, your enemies die in the most bloodiest of ways, as does your protagonist, if you get him killed... The atmosphere in the game is very ambient and complemented by one of the best video game OST which i have ever  heard. Most of these soundtracks were written by Mark Morgan and made their way straight into Fallout: New Vegas.The storyline in Fallout 1 can fit into many genres at once, it's an action-adventure, to a certain extent with elements of mystery and even horror (Masters Lair, anybody?) I won't ruin your gameplay by writing too much spoilers, but all i can say is that in Fallout, the lives of many people depend on the actions of your protagonist, but at the same time, he has the freedom of choice to follow the path he pleases or sees as the most  right one. There are many interesting and memorable factions and NPC's present in the game, and during the course of your adventures, your actions will affect those around you. The player can often choose between morally right and wrong decisions whilst performing side-quests, and has the freedom to travel between locations in any order he pleases. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L system which many are familiar with from Fallout 3 or NV is also present in Fallout 1 and allows the player to choose between three premade characters with their unique background stories and perks or make a custom characters and pick all of the perks and stats for him manually. One of the more annoying things younger players might find in Fallout 1 is the combat structure, or more specifically, the critical hit system. If your planning to beat Fallout 1 by means of direct combat approach (the game provides multiple approaches in order to beat it) you must assure yourself that your hero is going to die at least good few dozen times. The aforementioned critical hits in Fallout are absolutely ruthless and unbalanced, towards both you and the enemy. Wearing the best possible armor with a conjunction with a few Psycho chems for damage resistance will do little against a critical hit from a Super Mutant Minigun or a Deathclaws strike, and you will quickly see your hero either being shredded to pieces or being clawed to death even while wearing Power Armor. Engagement with enemy, aside from being at times disbalanced, is nonetheless cool, challanging and will fit your liking if your into turn based combat while drinking a cup of tea or a coffee. If your more of a Call of Duty fan though, and waiting isn't your thing, id suggest sticking to Fallout 3 or NV, on account of that they both possesses an element of a shooter, not just a turn based RPG. Fallout 1 deserves to be played and deserves to be admired, because even though it's an outdated game, it's the foundation of the whole franchise in terms of both lore and mechanics. The game also possesses great replayability, which means that you can basically beat it ten times and still miss a thing or two. I recommend Fallout 1 first and foremost to Fallout fans and those players who like old-school gaming. Secondly, i recommend Fallout to anyone who likes RPG's, although i do warn you, if your into newer games and won't cope with the restrictions of the old school graphics and gameplay, feel free to whistle a tune and pass on by, theres nothing to see here' friend.

												This is such a good game considering it was released so many years ago. There is so much depth to it, so many possabilities. There were times when I wasn't sure what to do but after a while I soon got the hang of it. There is a widescreen option (steam version) and it works on windows 7. The problems I had was the graphics are not great, it was sometimes difficult to see my character and the game did crash few times but it was still playable. So different to Vegas and Fallout 3 but I still enjoyed it, 8/10. Fallout 2 next...			"

												Fallout is such a wonderful game! I love how Interplay Studios made Fallout's graphics so cool! And how Interplay Studios had come up with so many ideas for Fallout, such as the Brotherhood of Steel and their Power Armor, Vault 13 and the Vault Dweller. I used my imagination for the game, pretending that the three pre-made characters knew each other. The ending was cool, especially when you see your character leaving the vault. Fallout will forever be my Number 1 favorite game series in the world! If I was in the world of Fallout, I'd be the Vault Dweller, a teenage boy of course, not an adult. It's pretty cool how Interplay Studios made the setting take place in the 22nd century, and how they were able to make future objects such as the Power Armor, the Stealth Boy 3001, the Laser and the Plasma Rifles, et cetera. And the characters like the ghouls, the Super Mutants, et cetera. It took a lot of time and patience to make Fallout come to life! Thank you Interplay Studios for making Fallout, and thank you Brian Fargo for creating and thinking about Fallout as your idea! I look forward to more Fallout games to come! Thanks for giving me the time to review on Fallout! ""War, war never changes.""			"

												Fallout 1 and 2 are the greatest RPGs of all time.  Bugs, fairly clunky interface and controls, turn-based combat and all.  The game draws you in, and won't let go even after multiple playthroughs; and on that note, this game is one of the most replayable of all time.  The depth and flexabilty of this masterpiece rival any RPG.  Stealth is well implimented, hand to hand combat is very distinct from ranged, and diplomacy and deception will often avert the necesity for combat at all, allowing players to possibly avoid combat completely (as boring as that sounds).But is the combat fun?  I mean turn-based combat sounds fairly tedious in todays generation of fast-paced gaming right?  Surprisingly (for an ADD guy like myself) the turn-based combat here is incredibly addicting, with each and every action point precious and not to be tossed off lightly!  For some gamers, the combat will certainly be too in depth, and simply not within the range of their gaming interest, but many would be surprised if they gave this gem a chance.The writing is excellent, and I'm not an easy sell.  But the voice acting is probably the best ever in a video game.  I know, I know, sounds like an over-zealous fanboy, but... the voice cast is almost universally professional actors, with the great Jim Cummings edging out the rest in quality.  His three distict characters (Gizmo, The Master, and Set) are performed so well, that they are some of the few game performances I'll sit back and listen to without reflexivly skipping past.  They're that good.And one final note.  The game designers took the time to include a very unique feature, the dumb character.  If you choose to create a character with intelligence 3 or fewer, he will be an effectivly mentally challenged character, unable to converse fully with npc's.  This provides a new challenge, very different from a game with an intelligent character.  Sounds novel, I know, but the game creators literally made every single npc react to such a character as they would to a incredible dumb person, witch is often very funny (and difficult) as you will be unable to aquire many quests.Anyway, as you can tell I love this game, and highly recommend it to any and all RPG fans.  Believe me, if you give this game a shot, chances are you'll have a great time.			"

												A classic RPG in every respect. You may have a hard time playing this one if you’ve never done it before. I played this back when it was new, though, and it’s a blast to relive the memories.The only knock I have against it is that inventory management is a complete pain in the @$$. Other than that, it’s wonderful. Very happy this has made it to Steam since my original CD can no longer run the game.			"

I didn't think I'd much like the post-nuclear world, but I found myself immersed and fascinated by the world and the aftermath of said nuclear war. And the power armour is so cool. So long as you read the manual and know how to play the game, its quite fun. I'm now a Fallout fan.			"

Regrettably, after playing the latter fallout games, it is hard and disappointing to use the interface in the first ones, but it is understandable since they worked with what was available during that time. Still, memorable locations and some characters who reverberate across the series.			"

												This game is actually pretty good, even if it is tough to really get into. I highly recommend playing at least one of Bethesda's fallout games first (Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4) to get into the franchise. The whole fallout universe is very well put together and really quite intriguing, but I wish this one got more into it. I do have some complaints, like how the GUI feels cumbersome and kind of frustrating to learn at first, but all in all I would definately recommend this game.			"

												Fallout will please roleplaying fans everywhere. Set in a post apocalyptic world, Fallout starts out with you (the hero) leaving the safety of your underground village to search for a water purifier which is essential for the continued survival of your village.The outer world has a similar feeling to the 'MAD MAX' movies without the cars. Through many towns you interact with seperate factions and gangs, often invoving your self in quests, or trying to avoid being killed!You can design your own character or use a predesigned character. You have several statistics which combined with some 'characteristics' give you a list of percentile abilities (e.g. small gun 65% - meaning you have a 65% chance of hitting an enemy in normal conditions!).The world is set out in several sections. Based on a vast grid, you have many wilderness boxes and several 'towns' such as Junktown etc. In the wilderness you can encounter travelling tradesmen or evil creatures out to get you.The game is very intuitive allowing you to do most things with your mouse. The combat is particularly easy, aiming at an opponent gives you a pecentage chance of hitting. You can either shoot or try a different opponent. You often meet peole who will join your group, but be careful not to stand in front of them as they often manage to accidently hit you in combat!The graphics and sound are very atmospheric adding a little excitement to the game. Although the plot is weak, I found the game to be very enjoyable with some neat touches here and there. This game is definately a must for most rpgers out there.			"

												It's the very first Fallout; nothing more or less than an absolute classic. The game will reward the players if they love the Fallout Lore & have previously played Fallout: New Vegas (Since Fallout: New Vegas is practically a sequel to Fallout 1 & 2). The game itself is very slow paced, and at times VERY frustrating, Anyone new to the original Fallout titles may not be thrilled at first, but once you start picking up on how the game plays, it's a lot of fun. Unfortunatley, you have to understand that this game is almost 20 years old. There are more glitches in this game than there are craters on the Moon! On top of that, you may experience a crash every now & then. Overall, the game is pretty solid for it's age. Worth a look!			"

												The one that started it all.Together with the bugfixing/restoration mod Fallout Fixt, which has been maintained and updated to this day and I recommend it very much (http://www.nma-fallout.com/showthread.php?194562-Fallout-Fixt-0-81alpha-July-5th-2015), I have gathered around 80 hours of playtime in this game (the mod unfortunately uses its own shortcut to start the game and that's why my playtime isn't displayed on Steam). After the 1st attempt to start playing it half a year ago, I gave it a second shot while flying on the Fo4 hype. I've seen the story videos before already because I never expected that I'll play it. But that didn't stop me. All I can say that I was having a fricking blast while playing it, a bloody great and addictive game. Getting used to it takes a bit of time at the beginning, but don't let that to distract you. This starting guide is ideal for first time players and also has a picture of the keyboard shortcuts to save you some time: http://newfallout.com/fallout-1-quick-start-guide/If you get lost during the walkthrough, this one is perfect to get you out of trouble: http://strategywiki.org/wiki/FalloutAll I can say is that any true Fallout fan should check this game...either play it or just watch the story videos on Youtube.Highly recommended from me.

												Fallout 1, where to start...Well, it's smaller than Balder's gate, that said. it's got a unique setting, crushes Fallout 3 in terms of dark atmosphere (as do most things, since Fallout 3 was written by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey only 10 times smarter than Stephine Meyer) and generally is pretty good at what it does. That said, I only recommend playing it with a mod called Fallout FIXT, as it's pretty old and quite a bit didn't get to get implemented in the game either due to time or tech constrants. This mod puts a lot of it back in.While the story is quite simple and linear, the ways you can complete it are quite varied (unlike Fallout 3).There is some fridge logic involved at point (nowhere near as bad Fallout 3), but I won't spoil it.

												This is a good game for those curious about the fallout series. This game plays out vastly different from fallout 3 and new vegas. This game plays out more like a turn base system but its fun, it give a more strategic game to mind sort of like chess.Pros: good writing, humor, action, fun quests, fun references, story.Cons: fish out of water, over world map pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ item management a pain.

												Fantastic! An honest 10/10 here. Can't say it's better then 3 and NV, but it's not even relatable to them (Meaning Gameplay).Other then Nuclear Apocolypse, and Vaults, and Fallout lore, ect. But it gets a 10/10 for this kind of game, it was fun, I didn't know what to do until I watched someone play it (first mission so it didn't spoil!), but then it turned into an amazing experience, for both me, and my character. Would definitly recommend this game to anyone, even if it's your first time playing a game like this. (It was my first, and with no tutorial, you'll have to watch some stuff) Good luck out there, it's a pretty harsh world.			"

												Not big fan of turn based combat in games but this is by far a decent example of how they should be...no real tutorial which is a good and bad thing but it gives you full control and adds a different touch to the game. saying the game came out in 1997 this is still a good game to play even today and is filled with side quests to keep you going, not played much so far but seen the list of all available side quests and will tie me over till fallout 4. only bad thing is that there is no autosave or anywhere to prompt you to save and when you die you get taken back to the main menu.

												For the ones who want to play the original Fallout that became a very popular franchise or simply for the love of experiencing an old video game, I would say this game is for you.It's not as long as the modern Fallouts (3+) but you can count a good 12 hours if you take your time to look around. As for me I sort of blindly went a step too fast in the main quest and ended the game a bit sooner which is kind of ironic. But hey I liked it for what it is.			"

It took me roughly 50 hours to complete, and I can't remember the last time I felt this satisfied after completing a game, but I sure do feel extremely accomplished right meow!I highly recommend this game to any all looking to play one of the greatest games of all-time, and would really love to feel a great sense of accomplishment for mastering such a one of a kind game.I give Fallout a game grade of 100% all day long baby!

												From what I've played (slightly more than my in- game time by a few hrs because I played on a friends' account too), this game is a masterpiece of 1997 that can run on even the slowest of toasters. The game itself is a turn- based role- playing game, which has its pros and cons:Pros:- It's a classic game, and looks it, but still is amazing fun.- Fans of other Fallout games will finally get references that you didn't get before. For example, you meet than man who ends up later on as the founder of the NCR, and the town he lived in. You'll meet Harold before he branched out. (Go on then, give me the thumbs down for that pun), the original Dogmeat etc.- It's hilarious on a 1e AD&D level. It's possible to play a character with a maxed out guns skill, and miss a man standing right in front of you with a pistol and drop the gun right in front of him.- Dogmeat is a boss. He will single- handedly destroy ANYTHING in your path short of a Deathclaw or Super Mutant. Give your human companions decent gear, and they'll do the same.- It feels awesome to get hold of the better stuff, like Power Armour.- Has a brilliant sense of humour. You'll see hilarious random encounters on rare occasions.- The amount of care put into this game is INCREDIBLE. Just give your character 3 Intelligence at creation, you'll see exactly what I mean.Cons:- One of the most unforgiving games I've ever played. (Word of advice, don't talk to Rhombus, he'll kind of kick you out of the BoS if you walk into his room). One false move, and it's all over. Need to reload the other save.- ""Tell me abouts"". You can ask a man in Shady sands to tell you a little about the place, and he'll say ""Never heard of it"". It really isn't worth using.- You're rushed from the start. The world is your oyster- once you get that water chip back to the vault.- Steep learning curve, and no tutorials. Watch a couple YouTube vids or look for guides online to learn how to properly play.I'd recommend it as an 8/10. Just make sure to tag the Small Guns skill at character creation (and use guns over any other weapon), and you'll be fine.			"

												Fallout is deserving of the title 'classic'. Some people struggle with the graphics these days but this has absolutely no bearing on how good this game is. The writing and tactical turn based combat work just as well today as they did two decades ago. It is a strong story driven RPG with quite a lot of adult/dark humour. It also doesn't really hold your hand and there are some people/creatures you don't want to mess with. Save often and don't start what you can't finish.Be sure to download the various fan made mods that include restored content and bug fixes to maximize your enjoyment.8/10			"

No open world, a limited amount of time, and yes, you could end up wasting your time out there in the wasteland... and yes, the whole vault could all die, and your game would be over. I don't think you COULD see everything in one playthrough. Gosh, I'm just all nostalgic over here... you'll have to excuse me, I have something in my eye... *sniff*			"

I'm going to have to go back and play a lot more cautiously next time, perhaps invest more in sneak and luck.  If nothing else, I'll need to at least meet my first NPCs out in the Wastes.For any Fallout fan, this game is at least worth picking up on sale and playing a little to see how the story began.			"

												To me, Fallout is THE definitive RPG, similar to Doom being THE definitive shooter. Although the world offers a lot of depth, it affects the player directly enough to inspire purpose. For example, it has more story compared to Icewind dale, but is not as long-winded as Baldur's Gate. Nevertheless, the writing is superb and combined with an amazing soundtrack it creates a memorable retro-futuristic experience. The game is also more open – there is a map, but it's up to you to discover if, when and where you will travel. Even though combat is turn-based, it is surprisingly packed with action. Just make double sure to turn combat speed all the way to maximum in options. Even today, one has to appreciate the animations when you blow a hole through an enemy's torso or cut him in half with a laser rifle.I think that since its release, I completed this game at least 50 times. So why do I still consider it worth playing after so many years, since I pretty much know its world like my own backyard? Despite all of this, there is still plenty of variety in the game. You see, the player has a great deal of control over how linear, open, short or long the playthrough is, even though you do not realize it at the beginning. So first, there are so many different approaches and play styles simply related to what kind of character you design and act as (commando, sniper, spy, librarian, doctor, pacifist, Hodor, etc.). Then there is the absolutely amazing diversity of how you deal with problems. When you complete it more than one time you will sometimes think: “Wow, I did not of this before!” Let me just point out that it is possible to complete Fallout 1 by leaving behind hundreds of corpses or by never killing anyone (I am not kidding). It all depends on how you observe, interpret and act upon the game world. And finally, there is our mistress random chance. Her effects are subtle and never in the game you get the feeling that regardless of your skill it all comes down to a coin toss (like in FTL, for example). But they are present enough for the game to be able to surprise you regardless of how well you know it. For example, in my many playthroughs only once I had such amazing luck that after leaving Vault 15 I was ambushed by a well armed party and after disposing of them I received a much better armor than is expected at that point in the game. Almost immediately after that I encountered a merchant party and decided on a whim to be an evil materialist. I put my above average gear to use and slaughtered them all. As I prepared my backpack full of goods to be sold later and thinking things can't get any better at this point, I received the Alien Blaster special encounter (never happened to me so early in the game). So before I even got to the Raiders or Junktown, I was already outfitted well enough to be a real threat to basically anyone in the game with the correct use of tactics. And on the other end – only once I had such bad luck that before reaching Vault 15, I was ambushed so severely that there was no way to ever win and I had to try very hard several times to even escape alive.

												Hands down one of the best games I've played, for a game that came out in 1997 it was way ahead of its time and is still a blast to play toady. You will find that every thing you love about fallout is included and if you are a true rpg or fallout fan and have not played this game I highly recommed you pick it up.			"

												Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy the original fallout, but I was very happy to see my expectations blown through the roof.  Now I'm not saying that Fallout 1 is only better than bad or horrible, it is GENUINELY GREAT.  The core turn-based gameplay is highly addictive and does encourage players to not necessarily fight harder, but also to think smarter.  Fallout 1, unlike some other games, is not solely driven by brutally blowing off bad guy's limbs (however fun that always is), and it always adds some depth behind every enemy encounter.  Sure, methodically killing rats and radscorpions never quite requires any real mental strain, but I often found myself dreading gang attacks or other random encounters, as violence is the only real option in a RPG strongly based on player choice.  WARNING: Don't expect the gameplay to always seem fair, as the game loves to grant enemies with loads of critical strikes which often add to the player's annoyance.In addition to the combat, the exploration portion of the game is also excellent.  The gigantic wasteland offers many great random encounters, and a certain giddyness comes with finding and exploring a new town, Vault, or any other settlement.  Spoken dialogue with NPCs is scarce however, but the few pieces of spoken dialogue and face-to-face encounters with NPCs really color the scene.Don't expect too much from the graphics. Remember, if this game was a person, it would almost be reaching drinking age!  Sound effects are well produced if a little repetitive from time to time.The overarching main story and varying additional quests will keep a player well occupied for a long time, and with Fallout 4 approaching, the game provides a good excursion to the original West Coast Wasteland.  So do yourself a favor and pick up the classic RPG that started the franchise, either as a trip through memory lane or as a first time trip through the nuclear apocalypse.			"

												A great deal different than the newer Fallout games but damn, this game is good. The atmosphere is great, loads of content and the gamplay is addictive. One of the best things about this game is the amount of interesting side-quests!The voice acting is also one of the best I've heard in a game hands down. My only complaint would be with it is that the first half is time restricted, but after that you're pretty much free to do anything you want.			"

												So a couple of months ago with the imminent release of Fallout 4 looming a decided to go back and see what this franchise was all about. I figured it would be a good idea to start at # 1 in the series..... I was wrong. I'm sure that if I'd played this in the 90's it would have been acceptable, even good but I'm sorry this game by todays standards looks and plays terribly. The controls are beyond clunky and the learning curve is very steep. You will die a lot. A hell of a lot. It's a shame because the great Fallout concept is still there and you want to see what's around the corner but randomly searching a desert then coming across enemies that you are not yet equipped to defeat and dying isn't all that fun alas.I'm moving on to Fallout 2 to see if that scratches my itch. If you're like me and are new to the series and want to get into it maybe just go straight to Fallout 4 but rest assured you're better off without the original.			"

												I must admit that I didn't fall in love with the original games, but rather, with the Bethesda-era ones. My first game in the series was Fallout 2 and while I LOVE older games like this, there was just something that didn't capture my attention like NV eventually did, which thankfully got me into the whole series.That being said, after playing countless hours of 3, NV, and 4, I decided to come back and have another go at completing the originals, going in order. I haven't quite finished this game's main quest, in fact I haven't really even come close, but I have to say that these games are far more enjoyable when you understand the game's universe and decide to force yourself to be patient with an unforgiving game. Typically, I don't like brutally tough games because I play games for enjoyment rather than overabundance of challenge, but once you get the hang of it, the challenge in this game goes hand-in-hand with the choice and depth.I will say that for a game of its age, it looks pretty good. However, my complaint is that because they went with the isometric approach, I find it harder to actually become immersed in the world itself. Instead, I find myself revisiting my childhood as I see images of 90s-era 3D in my head, trying to imagine what it would have looked like had they made it in first-person like Bethesda did with their games. I like isometric games, one of my favorites being the first two Rollercoaster Tycoon games, but for a semi-depressing, deep RPG with questions of morality, it feels lacking in the immersion factor.Where the graphics are lacking, the gameplay and story make up for it though. I have to say I despise the combat system mostly because you're locked into a single decision every round, but the turn-based system does allow for far more decisionmaking and strategy in combat which is nice. I can't begin to describe how many times I've died in the more recent games simply because the in-the-moment decisionmaking pressured me into pulling off a stupid move, so the turn-based system helps prevent that. I don't care much for the random encounters either, as they get annoying when you're trying to travel.The world itself is well-designed, despite the graphics being less immersive. The stylization gives a depressing, dark atmosphere of a ruined world, and there is something about that era of graphics/design that really hits you just right. The world isn't extremely open-world, but this isn't meant to be an open-world RPG. You use a fast travel type system between cities, settlements, regions and you're often interrupted by random encounters in the middle of nowhere. The larger cities/dungeons themselves tend to be split into several separate maps. There isn't a whole lot of variety in environment design but it doesn't need it. In general, the world captures you in a way you can't really describe with words, though not really by immersion factor.The story is entertaining, and it's fun to be able to basically carve your own path to your endgame objective, as RPGs are meant to be. The story begins simply, but then begins to expand until you realize it's a plot larger than you could have imagined. It involves choice in ridiculous amounts, not to mention it tries to reaffirm the series motto: ""War... war never changes."" by showing that despite destroying ourselves, humanity is still its selfish old self, yet we also have the capability of goodness and love.I apologize that this review was kind of scatterbrained, but I can't really do an appropriate review until I finish the game in its entirety like I have with the newer ones. Altogether, despite my complaints with this game and the original games in general, I do strongly recommend this game both for Fallout fans seeking nostalgia and for fans of traditional deep RPGs with a turn-based combat system. It's a load of fun, particularly once you get the hang of how it works.			"

												It's a good game, that's for sure. It really stands on its own as an innovation in rpgs. This is the great gand-pappy. The original progenitor of something great. It took a lot of innovation and imagination to make something like this happen, and we should be observant and respectful.There's a lot of limitations contained within; as is often the case with something new. Parts of the game don't feel fleshed out completely. As a result, I wouldn't classify Fallout as a complete experience per-se. No, the real reason to play Fallout is to experience the atmosphere. This game is full of ambient tracks and colorful dialogue. There's are also some ""talking heads"" you get to talk to, which further cement the experience. It lives and dies on its roleplay aspects. And even when things don't feel quite as complete as later fallout games, you have to give fallout some serious props for getting a lot of things right.Gameplay wise, there's not a lot to say. If you're serious enough, you could complete this game in 8 minutes. I guess that's where the weakness of Fallout comes from. Its limitations translates into a limited gameplay experience. And that's ok. Fallout is still a good game, and should be a must play for anyone who loves a good old-fashioned traditional rpg experience.			"

												I played this game many times back in the day. It's replay value is great because of all the different storylines you can take. Like all the fallout games afterwards, this one has multiple endings depending on the choices you make. The story is so well developed in this game you'll wonder why you haven't played this game sooner. When you start the game you'll be treated to with one of the most chilling, well-written introductions a game has ever been blessed with. Above all, the NPC interaction and voice acting are the best in any game to date. This game is possibly the best investment an RPG fan can presently make, and will prove entertaining for countless gaming hours. The game has excellent character generation and skill system, great story, and classy delivery. The compelling plot, and intuitive gameplay should deservedly broaden its appeal beyond the hard-core role-playing game audience. However, unlike the new fallout games, this is turn based which might turn some people off. If you are fan of the new Xcom, then you will be fan of this classic game.			"

												One of the all-time classic RPGs which focus on a post-apocalytip setting and the people therein. You are a vault dweller, one of many who hid within deep underground vaults as nukes scorched the earth, sent on behalf of your community out into the world.The strength of the game lies in:- The overarching plot.- Great dialogue and characters.- Presentation of the setting and environment.- Character customization.However, as this is an old game, some features are a bit clunky for those of us more familiar with newer RPGs. You have to manually save and load the game, or set up the quicksave and quickload slot each time you start a game or have overwritten the slot. The environment expects you to engage it with the skills you have, such as using science on computer terminals and repair on machines, which may cause you to miss out on important clues. A very helpful keymap is shown when F1 is pressed to aid you.Overall, this is one of the classics of the genre which must be tried.			"

The gameplay is good but has its fair share of bugs. Do NOT go into this game thinking you will automatically kick but, YOU WON'T. You will die many, many times before your'e even adequetly prepared for regular enemies. things got SO bad for me that i had to completely start over from scratch and that is NOT a fun thing to have to do. The story is good for its time and the characters are well written though the voices are wonky. great game overall and i highly recommend you purchase it IF it is on sale. NOT worth dropping 10 dollars for an almost 20 year old game. 9/10			"

Lots of interesting and exciting places to explore, countless ways to tackle situations and a lot of fun.  You can play as a bruiser, a sharpshooter, a smoothtalker, or a ninja.  It's up to you.			"

												""Fallout"" is a classic. It's notably unforgiving and sometimes a bit flukey. Dying is very easy and you have to be careful with your resources...because when dying is easy, getting in to a fight so as to grab a bad guy's gear can be a shaky proposition. This game is a real uphill climb, both ways, in the snow, without shoes.This is NOT an isometric version of ""Fallout 3"" or ""New Vegas,"" folks.This IS the root. The great-grandfather.Give it a go, but remember to buckle up.			"

												I suck at this game or am very unlucky and keep running into enemies, but I see how it'll play out and it doesn't seem bad at all. The time of attacking will take a while to get used to, and it's funny that in for intel. is low you don't know how to speak and just grunt like a caveman.			"

												I've only played falout 3 up until now i decide to play the original fallout. I first thought that this game was going to be terrable, I was so wrong. I've been missing out on these classics and what i played through was amazing fighting mutants, raiders, etc. If you are curious about trying the original fallouts buy them you won't regret it although i personally would start out with fallout 2 but falout 1 was one damn fine game. 8.5/10			"

												Great game. Refreshing change from modern gameplay. Something I found interesting is that fast travel is used extensively. Not the modern teleporting type, but your character moves across the map as an arrow when travelling between locations. Can be attacked along the way, cancelling the travel - likelehood of being attacked dependent kf skills. Also is how random encounters are experienced. Higher chance of specific encounters when moving across certain map tiles. Due to overhead view, exploring locations is quicker than modern fallouts, as you can see everything around you - needed for the rich environment. Highly recommend.			"

												If you are used to the endless dog-quests of Fallout 3, NV & 4; prepare to think. Prepare to prepare as an onslaught of possibly impossible enemies is placed before you. Get ready to scrounge, get ready to simply try and survive, with the vault’s survival weighing over you in an actual day-timer. 	The feeling of Fallout lingers. The world, more than in FPS sticks with you. A weighted lingering that haunts you, making one think of the world about, the world shattered beyond comprehension. An occasional far-off reminder, whispers that this is California. 	When you play this game, you feel like you are playing a legend. Seeing where it all started, and how far (or not) things have come. One thing I will tell you, this is no easy walk in the wasteland.			"

												I  really love the older Fallout games. They have more of a focus on the world surrounding the game itself. You learn as you go and there are no tutorials. They make you work for what you want, Plus, the turn based combat is simply amazing. The RPG elements are very refined as well. All in all, some 21st century gamers may not like this game, but I'd recommend you give it a try anyways.			"

												2016 Review:This is a great game if you can't get enough of that fallout vibe. From the moment you see the intro you know this is going to be a great game... the game does take some getting used to if you have never played a turn based game like this one it will take AT LEAST 30 mins to learn the controls but it is worth it as the game has aged surprisingly well the graphics used are similar to the retro look indie developers try to go for nowwould wait untill a sale though... I have seen it on sale several times after I bought it (on sale)			"

												If you want to see where it all started, check out the first installment of one of the best game sagas in existence.Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game features a pretty great story line, creative and compelling and before its time. Character customization even in this early installment still gives you a lot of control over your character and their capabilities, and plot lines altered by players' decision give the player a sense of ownership over the outcomes. Games like this spark the fire that become today's RPG gaming. Turn-based game play involves a little more forethought in strategy than fans of modern games are used to, you find less quick reaction is useful and more preparation and anticipation of combat needs will save you. It is important to remember that 1997 is before the time of auto-save.			"

												I love playing old games, specially RPG. The old ones are incredible amazing and always surprise me! I've already beaten this one and I'll one more time to do all the quests possible. It's a masterpiece with a great story. For me, much better than the newest Fallout games. But it's my opinion, of course. For those who like a pure RPG with much texts and a great difficulty, I highly recommend Fallout 1. And, if you love your companion, please don't let he die. He'll be out forever. Like in Fallout 3 and NV.  "

												WOWThis game is amazing. I have bought a million copies of this: the big box when it was first released, countless jewel case releases, got it for free (?) on GOG when they were just about to lose the rights to distribute the FO series, and finally on Steam as part of a sale a year ago or so.Each time I tried to get into this game, the interface turned me off. Now, I grew up playing RPGs on C64 so you could say I have some tolerance for cumbersome interfaces. However, FO's interface defeated me at every turn. As much as I like the game, the interface is still annoying, with my three most hated things being:- Inventory UI: the fact that each item is a giant picture and 90% of the screen is wasted makes managing inventory a colossal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Toward the end of the game I was sporting enhanced power armor on a low STR character, so I had to manage inventory a lot. I seriously spent an hour toward the end just cleaning everything up, selling stuff I don't need (999 bottle caps at a time...), and shuffling (using pickpocket... how ridiculous is this) inventory between my companions, only to just ditch them for the last two segments of the game- Conversation UI: a measly few lines of text, with 90% of the screen being taken up by the UI. I am not complaining about the space for the animated faces (very useful to gauge reactions), but all the♥♥♥♥♥♥on the sides etc. This is true also for the TINY window on the bottom of the screen listing game information. There were cases where normal events in the game would overload that tiny display with text and I would have to go scroll through it all to read it. Why does a GIANT picture of your equipped weapon/item take us so much space on the main game screen? Makes no sense.- Companion interaction: total nightmare. Even if you spec a combat monster, you will need companions to get you through much of the early game. Outside of battle they are not only useless, but hinder your every move. Walking into small rooms is a nightmare because they will inevitably stand in the doorway... and just stand there. You can ""pickpocket"" (!!!) them to give them better weapons, but they are stuck with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ armor the entire game. Even using them as pack mules is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ During the last 20% of the game I just dismissed them all, since they would all be killed instantly by mutant patrol miniguns.OKWith that all out of the way, Fallout is still one of the greatest if not the greatest RPG ever made. The sheer number of ways to complete this game, all the sidequests, the fact that you will never see everything in a single game... wow. Playing through to the end for the first time, I felt like, no matter what I did, the game was one step ahead of me. You think of some way to tackle an objective, and Fallout just goes, haha yeah I knew you'd do that and gives you a kickass weapon anyway.I started out with a high INT/speech character with small guns tagged, so a lot of early stuff was talking my way through situations. Once I got a sniper rifle, I basically turned into a combat beast and I plowed through the last quarter of the game in power armor, basically untouchable. I have never played a game that gives you so much freedom. I wonder if there is a character build that is literally impossible to finish the game with.On top of all this is an amazing presentation. It still looks great today (especially the backgrounds), and the soundtrack is incredibly moody. It took me 20 hours start to finish, not including time spent dying/reloading, and I savored every minute.My recommendations for playing:- First of all, save often and have an open mind.  Have fun with the game, it is a playground of imagination.- I suggest keeping the resolution at 640x480, which the game was designed to be run at.  Higher resolutions do not do the art justice.- Turn fog of war on so that uneplored parts of maps are blacked out.  Might be a personal preference, but this made me want to explore each map even more, and felt more realistic than being able to see everything the minute you walk on to a new map.- Move the pathfinding slider all the way to the max.  You will have to go back and forth over several maps over and over, and the pathfinding restrictions in the vanilla game are annoying.  Max it out so you can just click on the exit and have your characters navigate to them themselves.			"

I was hesitant to play them because they were made in the 90's and I was afraid I would not get into them because of the game play and the graphics. I was so wrong! Fallout is so much fun!

												What can be said about this classic masterpiece, that hasn't been said already? if you never played Fallout, you might be wondering if ""it is really that good, or it is just nostalgia"". The short answer is yes, it is incredibly good. It is easily one of the best 5 RPGs ever released.I'll start with the aspects of the game that may not be that good. Inventory management is cumbersome, as you can only view a few items at the same time and have to scroll up and down constantly. Overall the UI is not as ""comfortable"" to use as modern UIs. Also, the enemy AI is a bit primitive (not that newer games are any better, actually...) and you'll also find that some character development options are obvious ""traps"" that may make you restart the game. for instance, there's certain skills that you can raise easily spending money in-game; if you don't know that and spend your valuable points there, you'll seriously handicap yourself. Same with some weapon skill choices. Finally, companions are rather weak, since you can't equip them nor they seem to progress nor follow any orders; they are fragile and suicidal, so in the endgame you're better off without them. Now that the ""not perfect"" things are out of the way, let's get to the meaty part.The setting and the whole idea about Fallout is brilliant, and has been executed perfectly, much better depicted and detailed than in the new Bethesda sequels. Dialogues are short yet well-written, the layout and pacing of the story makes sense, and the atmosphere when you explore places like Vault 15 or The Glow absolutely delivers. The game can feel oppresive and dark when it wants to, yet there is plenty of humor that even breaks the ""fourth wall"" sometimes, and it has been added with good taste, so it doesn't erode the game's apocalyptic atmosphere.Quests in this game put to shame most of the quest writers in this generation. So many different ways to solve them! and no, I don't mean the trivial meaningless choices for one reward or another you see in Skyrim; I mean that you can solve almost all the situations without violence, and you can make choices that really alter the world. There's a ""dumb way"", a ""talky way"", ""sneaky way"" to solve each problem, to a degree like no other RPG I can think of. This variety of choice is the essence of RPGs, what really makes you feel like you are ""playing a role"" in a unique way, different from what other players did. One of the reasons Fallout is so immersive is because it really brings on the table the element of survival. Unlike in most RPGs, where you quickly escalate the curve of power and become invulnerable, you can be easily killed in Fallout, always. Friendly fire is always a big risk, and even in the end game, and having good weapons and armor, you can get shot down rather quickly if your strategy is bad. Which encourages thinking, and caring. Survival becomes the main focus in the game, which is quite amazing. The moment you begin feeling ""safe"" in a setting like this, you can say that it has failed to deliver.Yet, once you understand the tactical elements in the game, it is not that hard. Difficulty is very well gauged in my opinion, punishing you when you are reckless or pick the wrong fights, yet allowing you to gain advantage when you do things right and choose the right tools for each job. As it should be.There's many more aspects I could talk about, I suppose. Sound and music are good, art is sometimes outstanding, sometimes adequate. Overland map allows to travel in a non-cumbersome way, without losing the feeling of ""exploration"". And the details make obvious this game was made with love and patience. Little things like weapon descriptions, or small humorous references in dialogues, or some of the random encounters. Classy. Timeless. 10/10. Must play if you love the genre.			"

												Today, a conversation about the pros and cons of Fallout 4 lead to a co-worker getting nostalgic for the original Interplay Fallouts, with supposedly more in-depth interactions with NPCs, where decisions regarding finite character builds hold more weight, where targeted shots (now V.A.T.S.) actually matter, and where power armour is something to work towards.When Fallout was new my only interaction with it was watching over the shoulder of a friend as they slid items in and out of equipment slots and frantically clicked on a green diagram of giant scorpion parts.Two years ago I thought I'd try it for myself but was quite shocked to realize I'd just bought a game from Steam that would not run as-is. After venturing into unofficial patches and the realm of ""fixt"", I got so far as a green triangle on a world map labeled ""unknown"" just outside Shady Sands. And no matter what I tweaked regarding installed patches; trying to enter Shady Sands would cause the game to fail without fail.I gave up and let it collect dust.Until today. Thanks to my co-worker reminiscing on the things Fallout got right the first time, I decided to give it another go. I searched for any new news in getting the old game to run but just ended up feeling like a super-mutant wandering through ""No Mutants Allowed."" But while thinking up my negative review I did the one thing I hadn't done: deleted the patched-and-tweaked-game, then downloaded, reinstalled and ran it again, completely vanilla.And it works. No colour issues. No black screens. How? Why? I don't care. I'm looking forward to finally... fiiiinally talking to these peasants in this boring town of Shady Sands, then maybe punching some radscorpions this guy Seth told me about... and whatever else the game has in store of course!So if others were running up against the same problems and beginning to go insane: here's hoping I haven't simply fallen into some anomalous group of people for whom the game ""just works"" and that it works for you too!

												I originally only heard of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas and never heard much about Fallout or Fallout 2 until I heard some people talk about it online saying they are amazing. I decided to give it a try and to be honest I was blown away. It's an extremely old game but it still gives that feeling like the first time I played Fallout 3. I would say it gives a complete vibe of loneliness; a desert that is unforgiving. I found at first it to be a bit difficult until I got down leveling and how to actually fight. I finally ended up beating it and absolutely love the story and premise.			"

												I conquered this absolute gem of a game on max difficulty, and 100% blind! I challenge all of you to do the same. This game, among so many made back in the day gives you very little hints and arrows along your journey, so you have to be smart, and very very persistent in order to figure it out. It took me roughly 50 hours to complete, and I can't remember the last time I felt this satisfied after completing a game, but I sure do feel extremely accomplished right meow!I highly recommend this game to any all looking to play one of the greatest games of all-time, and would really love to feel a great sense of accomplishment for mastering such a one of a kind game.I give Fallout a game grade of 100% all day long baby!

												Fallout is deserving of the title 'classic'. Some people struggle with the graphics these days but this has absolutely no bearing on how good this game is. The writing and tactical turn based combat work just as well today as they did two decades ago. It is a strong story driven RPG with quite a lot of adult/dark humour. It also doesn't really hold your hand and there are some people/creatures you don't want to mess with. Save often and don't start what you can't finish.Be sure to download the various fan made mods that include restored content and bug fixes to maximize your enjoyment.8/10			"

												Fallout will please roleplaying fans everywhere. Set in a post apocalyptic world, Fallout starts out with you (the hero) leaving the safety of your underground village to search for a water purifier which is essential for the continued survival of your village.The outer world has a similar feeling to the 'MAD MAX' movies without the cars. Through many towns you interact with seperate factions and gangs, often invoving your self in quests, or trying to avoid being killed!You can design your own character or use a predesigned character. You have several statistics which combined with some 'characteristics' give you a list of percentile abilities (e.g. small gun 65% - meaning you have a 65% chance of hitting an enemy in normal conditions!).The world is set out in several sections. Based on a vast grid, you have many wilderness boxes and several 'towns' such as Junktown etc. In the wilderness you can encounter travelling tradesmen or evil creatures out to get you.The game is very intuitive allowing you to do most things with your mouse. The combat is particularly easy, aiming at an opponent gives you a pecentage chance of hitting. You can either shoot or try a different opponent. You often meet peole who will join your group, but be careful not to stand in front of them as they often manage to accidently hit you in combat!The graphics and sound are very atmospheric adding a little excitement to the game. Although the plot is weak, I found the game to be very enjoyable with some neat touches here and there. This game is definately a must for most rpgers out there.			"

												I could not tell you about my love for  the first fallout game, but I shall try. Fallout is the story of the vault dweller......no duh. He is sent out to look for a water chip because the one in his vault has died. It is a race against time to save your vault and meet some rather odd people along the way.The atmosphere for this game is great. It is rather dark and sometimes rather depressing, however, it has some of the best dark humor I have seen in a game to date. The only problem I have with this game is that it is slightly unforgiving and will take a while to understand what you need to do and where you need to go. There is also a time limit at the start of the game, but it goes away after you main goal is done (Well, it gives you 13 in game years, which is more then enough time to finish all the side quest and more).I give Fallout a nice 4/5  for being a great game that holds up rather well for today's standards.

												The past several years haven't exactly been kind to role-playing game fans. Very few role-playing games have been released since 1993, and those that have made it to retail shelves have largely been unsuccessful at combining playability and originality with the complexity that role-playing game fans love. The release of Blizzard Entertainment's action/role-playing game hybrid Diablo in early 1997 only increased role-playing gamers' anticipation for an equally playable game in a more elaborate, detailed world. After a four-year drought, the wait is over. Fallout is one of the best role-playing games to be released in several years and it succeeds in entertaining gamers by providing a fresh and compelling storyline, good graphics and sound, and attention to those little details that can transform a good game into a great one.Fallout is an unofficial sequel to 1987's Wasteland, one of the most popular role-playing games of all time. While the overwhelming majority of computer role-playing games are set in some pseudo-medieval, Tolkien/AD&D-inspired world of orcs and battleaxes, Fallout is set in the future, several years after an exchange of nuclear weapons has devastated most of the world. Inhabitants who survived did so largely by sheltering themselves in giant underground vaults. Your character's life has been spent entirely within one such vault. A broken chip for your vault's water recycler forces your character to leave the relative safety of the vault to search for a replacement chip aboveground in the wasteland, where you'll encounter struggling communities of survivors, Road Warrior-esque gangs, human mutants, and even stranger creatures. Hardly a typical setting for a role-playing game, but the originality of the setting is one of the strengths of Fallout. In Fallout, rather than trudging through yet another dreary dungeon, in search of ye olde magic artifact to expel demon horde #782, your character will explore the haunting remnants of our own civilization and attempt to unravel the mysterious forces at work in postapocalyptic Southern California. The old 90210 neighborhood has changed, gang violence is rampant, two-headed cows roam Rodeo, and the new fashion accessory is a rocket launcher. And if the guns of the locals don't get you, the radiation might. Brandon, Kelly, why are you glowing like that?			"

												My first Fallout game was Fallout 2.  This plays just like that.  Great tactical combat, and roleplay experiences.  I like the choices you can make, obviously 2 was more polished and had more humor, although I am only 2 hours in so maybe their will be more humor as I progress.  Anyway, if you like tactical turn based RPGs and post apoclypatic settings then you should really play this game.  Also steam has fixed issues with it not running on modern computers correctly.  I am playing only via steam and everything works great, and it seems to support modern resolutions.I would like to add this game does not hold your hand.  If gives you a mission and sends you out the door with a small lead.   It's up to you to figure out what to do from then on out, it's not mission based but fairly open world.			"

												Overall great game with a great story. It can be miserable at times especially during combat hence the fact that it is turned based an very slow paced. This game and Fallout 2 have both aged terribly, but if you put that aside, they are actually fun. If you missed out on Fallout 1 and 2 adding them to your steam library will be worthwhile.I hope Bethesda remakes these two classics, so gamers today can relive the experience that gamers did during the late 90s.

												Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy the original fallout, but I was very happy to see my expectations blown through the roof.  Now I'm not saying that Fallout 1 is only better than bad or horrible, it is GENUINELY GREAT.  The core turn-based gameplay is highly addictive and does encourage players to not necessarily fight harder, but also to think smarter.  Fallout 1, unlike some other games, is not solely driven by brutally blowing off bad guy's limbs (however fun that always is), and it always adds some depth behind every enemy encounter.  Sure, methodically killing rats and radscorpions never quite requires any real mental strain, but I often found myself dreading gang attacks or other random encounters, as violence is the only real option in a RPG strongly based on player choice.  WARNING: Don't expect the gameplay to always seem fair, as the game loves to grant enemies with loads of critical strikes which often add to the player's annoyance.In addition to the combat, the exploration portion of the game is also excellent.  The gigantic wasteland offers many great random encounters, and a certain giddyness comes with finding and exploring a new town, Vault, or any other settlement.  Spoken dialogue with NPCs is scarce however, but the few pieces of spoken dialogue and face-to-face encounters with NPCs really color the scene.Don't expect too much from the graphics. Remember, if this game was a person, it would almost be reaching drinking age!  Sound effects are well produced if a little repetitive from time to time.The overarching main story and varying additional quests will keep a player well occupied for a long time, and with Fallout 4 approaching, the game provides a good excursion to the original West Coast Wasteland.  So do yourself a favor and pick up the classic RPG that started the franchise, either as a trip through memory lane or as a first time trip through the nuclear apocalypse.			"

But certain bits of the main plot didn't make me stop thinking about the atmosphere and context I've been exposed when I played it. Tried it again and was a different experience already. The way you can accomplish tasks by different ways and how nothing is granted even reaching the highest level because of in-game decisions, probabilistic and cause-effect, and of course, the main plot that made me feel immersed in a post apocalyptic world. All those things make this game a masterpiece IMHO.			"

It's one of my earliest memories of enjoying the hell out of a game and really comprehending how to play a game efficiently rather than just arbitrarily flailing at the controls as I often would as a child.   Fallout has an amazing setting, and a wonderful sense of humor.  A world where America never really left that era of 50's idealism, and kept that attidude and commerical style all the way through to World War 3, which saw the destruction of nearly all of the civilized world.  Many people sought shelter from the Nuclear War in underground, impenetrable vaults where they thought they would be safe until the planet recovered.  As a man/woman who must venture out into the wasteland for the sake of their vault's survival, and brave a world warped by war and fire, patrolled by freakish mutants and roving gangs of bandits.  Amazing RPG. Memorable conversations, events and characters.Play this game.			"

												One of those Golden Classics, the Combat can be a bit slow, you might be a bit used to Autosave and forget to save now and then, but definatly worth it.Agility and Intelligence is quite important in the two first fallout game as Action Point and Skill Points are your bread and butter. There are also possible to pick up books to acquire skills to a relative high level, and in this game you can even buy them from a store in the Hub. I suggest Saving often, especially before you start quests and the like because the game run on its own time table once you take a quest, and the bad guys might kill the good guy because you used to long. Which is one of the things I used to love about this game.Getting a Power Armor really makes things easier as it boost your strength with 2 so you never really need more than 8 in strength as 10 is maximum, Ranged Fighting is definatly the way to go so I really suggest stacking agility, perception and intelligence above the other stats (or cheat all the stats to 10 in everything :D) Anyhow the story is amazing, the music gives me goose bumps, and blasting muties to high heaven with a rocket launcher or saw em in half with my lazer gatling gun or Turbo-charged Plasma Rifle..... Worth every god damn penny.I think that Bethesda never did Fallout 1 or 2 any justice, it was like Fallout Tactics was placed in 3D, without the option for multiple party members.  I know I am a Bioware Fanboy, but I think they would have done a 1000 times better job with the game series than Bethesda ever could hope to come up with. But this isnt about those awful games that came after these gems... Fallout 1 and 2 are worth it.			"

												A classic, plain and simple. Its a merciless game but, intensely addicting. Vastly different play style than from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, its a third person view turn based combat, there are plenty of fights you'll encounter that require a good deal of planning. The storyline is shorter compaired to the other games but eacht ime you play the experience is completely different based on your SPECIAL stats. The only downside is this has trouble running on current machines, I tracked down some patches that fix it but still run into some issues with stability. This of course is to be expected from an older game.			"

												A rpg game with a turnbased battlesystem. Briliant unpredictable story that you shape yourself. Follow the Vault Dweller as he sets out on an epic quest to save his home in a postapolyptic world, that has frozen in time since the early 1900. With plenty of companions, a exelent levelup system and detalied text dialog. This really is a fantastic game and should be played by every rpg fan. Old school that still makes you laugh all the way down to your gut. The only minus has to be the lack of some good music, but you can always put on some Fallout 3 soundtrack while you play to complete the experience. 9/10 "

												My first Fallout games were Fallout 3, and New Vegas. While I was initially attracted to the fact that those games were 3D, and to an extent First Person Shooters, it was the story and character development that kept me playing Fallout for hours on end. Having just played through the original Fallout, I can say that the original is just as good, if not better considering that the game is now 16 years old. I laughed when the PC demanded donuts from thugs, I cried when my poor decisions lead to Dogmeats death, I saved Southern California from a dangerous cult. 10/10			"

												If you want to see where it all started, check out the first installment of one of the best game sagas in existence.Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game features a pretty great story line, creative and compelling and before its time. Character customization even in this early installment still gives you a lot of control over your character and their capabilities, and plot lines altered by players' decision give the player a sense of ownership over the outcomes. Games like this spark the fire that become today's RPG gaming. Turn-based game play involves a little more forethought in strategy than fans of modern games are used to, you find less quick reaction is useful and more preparation and anticipation of combat needs will save you. It is important to remember that 1997 is before the time of auto-save.			"

												Fallout is quite an experience. Like most games, Fallout has its quarks and times when you get a little frustrated at a small detail or lack there of. However, for myself, when I began to play Fallout I was enthrolled with the world in which I was to explore. Being a vet of Fallout 3 and New Vegas I wasn't sure how I would feel about a tactical turn based combat system. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how much it felt like I was playing a tabletop RPG. All in all, Fallout is a game I will always remember fondly with its exciting quest plots and interesting characters and situations. But it's downsides were slightly taxing, I would say it is worth $10 but if you get it on sale it is absolutly worth the time and investment.			"

												I was late to get into the Fallout games but I have finally dug in and I enjoy the world and the progression in this game a lot. I am normally averse to turn-based type games but the fallout action points system to me seems very well integrated and keeps things fresh and intersting. The character creation is fairly robust, (aside from the inability to really change the character model in meaningful ways) and its great that the game really gives a breadth of options to get past its obstacles. The Fallout universe is by far the most interesting post-apocalyptic world I've been exposed to. It feels like a living, breathing, and extraordinary world with individuals struggling to survive in the wasteland. Leveling up and succeeding at tasks feels very rewarding. The perk system allows a lot of room to make a unique experience with each character and lets you really take advantage of what you value in your playstyle. Its definitely worth being considered a classic.			"

												Fallout is a really great game once you get into it.  At first, the game can be difficult to get into because it is so much different than Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.  If you don't build your character correctly like I did on my first character, you may not enjoy the game very much (I know I didn't).  Once I looked up a guide on how to build a good character and then started a new character following the guide, Fallout became much more enjoyable because I was actually able to kill things more powerful than Radscorpians and Mole Rats.I would also recommend looking up a quest list for each area in the game.  This way, you know what characters to talk to to start each quest.  After that, solve the quests on your own, but use the guides to at least start them.  On my first character I didn't do this and I found myself bored very quickly because I wasn't able to find anyone that would give me a quest.Overall, Fallout is a great game.  It is a little dated and the combat system will take some getting used to, but the story is great.  Fallout will give some great backstory for players that have played Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.			"

												Fallout is one of the most amazing RPG games you will ever play. While the graphics are dated, and hardly any game in today's market uses hexagonal, turn based movements, the story and gameplay are amazing. Fallout, obviously, inspired Fallout 2 (another turn based hexagonal game), Fallout 3 a FPS RPG, and Fallout New Vegas. While the roots of Fallout exist in the revamed editions, the true experience of brutal Post Apocolyptic California comes from the original, and should leave you craving more!			"

												Multiple endings, moral choices, multiple factions, strong voice acting, tactical gameplay.  1997.  Insane that this game came out over a decade ago.  It has some aged graphics – but do yourself a favor – fork over the $10 and play the game that really put post-apocalyptic games into the foreground.  Watch some Mad Max while playing to get the full effect of how awesome the 80s and 90s were.			"

It is however a very unforgiving game, read the manual in your steam folder before you play. The storyline is cleverly implemented and I see things from Fallout referenced in Fallout 3 all the time now.Edit: I forgot to mention that you might get some hardly noticeable graphics glitches, in my experiences this always happens with ""very"" old games.

												[Note: The game time logged on Steam does not reflect the time I spent playing Fallout to date. I bought it back in 1997 on CD-ROM and have owned a couple of other bundles which included it since, and have completed Fallout at least a dozen of times since first release.]This was the very first of the Fallout games, and it is still in my all-time-favorite games list today. With added community enhancements, hi-res patches and unofficial updates, this game is still fun, unique to play, and more complex than it was on its release date; and the best part is, even a low-powered netbook can run this just fine. The post-apocalyptic world is diverse, the humor is brilliant to say the least, and this game is just worth being played just for the random encounters alone.The character creation is fun, you get a wide array of cool weapons (such a modified shotgun based pistol!), and even after a number of playthroughs, there are still new items to discover. If you love RPGs, if you love a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, and if you have an affinity for the Fallout universe (even if you started with Fallout 3), then you should certainly give this a try, even if it might look a little dated. The graphics, as they are, in fact help the atmosphere. I probably completed this game over a dozen times.Given the fact that Fallout is from 1997, a time in which video games were not quite established yet as a socially accepted entertainment form, the voice acting provided by actors like Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn and Dwight Schultz is also superb! If you don't like this game, you were born a generation too late and I feel sorry for you!			"

												For those of us who cut our teeth on later installments of the series, Fallout may seem a bit unpolished. However, there is everything to love in and about the debut title of the series. Targeting your enemies squishy bits with bullets, lasers, or melee strikes is just as much fun as it ever was. As always you're free to sneak around, pick locks, and steal loot to line your pockets with bottlecaps. Even though there may be less character development in Fallout than in later installments, it's worth exploring the humble beginings of the factions and storylines that have been developed throughout the series.If it existed in a vacuum I might say that $10.00 is too steep, and if one had no connection or attraction to the series at large I would likely advise against starting with Fallout. However, for those of you who already love one or more Fallout games do yourself a favor and go back in time to where it all began.			"

												This game is a classic that laid the foundation for the popular Fallout games that followed. However returning to this game years later and leaving my nostalgia glasses on my bed stand I found this game to still be enjoyable, funny dialogue, rewarding gameplay, dynamic-ish character development (even if it is just gun hoping until you eventually find a laser weapon and start maxing energy weapons).However this game is certainly dated, with a lot of issues with character controls, targetting, and map navigation. Also the ambiguity factor is set at a 10, which is fine for games like Dark Souls where there's really only so many places you can go, in this you'll run your cursor across the screen playing ""find the named NPC"" and hope they can feed you the next bread crum so you can figure out why you are in the place you're in.Furthermore this game, being a product of the early DnD era suffers from what I like to call the ""Lol get crit ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" syndrome. Where fully encassed in power armor some guy will punch you for 0 three times in a row, then on the fourth punch get lucky enough to touch Zeus' beard with that 20 and crit you for anywhere from 30-70 damage. Makes constant saving and loading essentially a necessiry as you play post apocalyptic craps. Though I could write an entire thesis about why I dislike crit mechanics like these, it basically boils down to your crits of this magnitude never feeling rewarding, as it feels like the win was just given to you, while the enemy crits of this magnitude feel cheap and unfair leaving the player feeling like there was nothing they could do they simply lost this spin on the slot machine.This game may have been a 9/10 then, but probably only like a 6 or maybe 7 now. Game aged about as well as a gallon of milk left out in the hot SoCal sun.Overall Rating: 6.5/10			"

												What can be said about this classic masterpiece, that hasn't been said already? if you never played Fallout, you might be wondering if ""it is really that good, or it is just nostalgia"". The short answer is yes, it is incredibly good. It is easily one of the best 5 RPGs ever released.I'll start with the aspects of the game that may not be that good. Inventory management is cumbersome, as you can only view a few items at the same time and have to scroll up and down constantly. Overall the UI is not as ""comfortable"" to use as modern UIs. Also, the enemy AI is a bit primitive (not that newer games are any better, actually...) and you'll also find that some character development options are obvious ""traps"" that may make you restart the game. for instance, there's certain skills that you can raise easily spending money in-game; if you don't know that and spend your valuable points there, you'll seriously handicap yourself. Same with some weapon skill choices. Finally, companions are rather weak, since you can't equip them nor they seem to progress nor follow any orders; they are fragile and suicidal, so in the endgame you're better off without them. Now that the ""not perfect"" things are out of the way, let's get to the meaty part.The setting and the whole idea about Fallout is brilliant, and has been executed perfectly, much better depicted and detailed than in the new Bethesda sequels. Dialogues are short yet well-written, the layout and pacing of the story makes sense, and the atmosphere when you explore places like Vault 15 or The Glow absolutely delivers. The game can feel oppresive and dark when it wants to, yet there is plenty of humor that even breaks the ""fourth wall"" sometimes, and it has been added with good taste, so it doesn't erode the game's apocalyptic atmosphere.Quests in this game put to shame most of the quest writers in this generation. So many different ways to solve them! and no, I don't mean the trivial meaningless choices for one reward or another you see in Skyrim; I mean that you can solve almost all the situations without violence, and you can make choices that really alter the world. There's a ""dumb way"", a ""talky way"", ""sneaky way"" to solve each problem, to a degree like no other RPG I can think of. This variety of choice is the essence of RPGs, what really makes you feel like you are ""playing a role"" in a unique way, different from what other players did. One of the reasons Fallout is so immersive is because it really brings on the table the element of survival. Unlike in most RPGs, where you quickly escalate the curve of power and become invulnerable, you can be easily killed in Fallout, always. Friendly fire is always a big risk, and even in the end game, and having good weapons and armor, you can get shot down rather quickly if your strategy is bad. Which encourages thinking, and caring. Survival becomes the main focus in the game, which is quite amazing. The moment you begin feeling ""safe"" in a setting like this, you can say that it has failed to deliver.Yet, once you understand the tactical elements in the game, it is not that hard. Difficulty is very well gauged in my opinion, punishing you when you are reckless or pick the wrong fights, yet allowing you to gain advantage when you do things right and choose the right tools for each job. As it should be.There's many more aspects I could talk about, I suppose. Sound and music are good, art is sometimes outstanding, sometimes adequate. Overland map allows to travel in a non-cumbersome way, without losing the feeling of ""exploration"". And the details make obvious this game was made with love and patience. Little things like weapon descriptions, or small humorous references in dialogues, or some of the random encounters. Classy. Timeless. 10/10. Must play if you love the genre.			"

												I completely missed the older installments of Fallout like many fans; I didn't pick up the series until Fallout 3 and had little knowledge of the predecessors. The gameplay is vastly different, but I was pleasantly surprised and love how the theme and culture of the game really did ring through the series. I was in awe about how great the atmosphere of this game is; the music, brutality, twists, and the little tidbits that make it a great RPG. Granted, it's from 1997 so the expansive of the game was obviously limited by capabilities at the time.  Despite of that however... this game can get you addicted and playing for many hours! Leaving you begging for more and you understand why it's a series. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of Fallout theme; post-apocalypse, gritty realities, gory outcomes, and a moral compass thrown out the window. You'll fall in love with the towns, people, missions, and the outcomes that directly correlate to what you do. The action in this game is oriented toward classic RPGs; it is turn/dice roll statistics dependent. So you won't be running around... but you'll question your sanity when you smile every time an enemy's torso blows in half from a critical hit. You'll get 20+ hours of gameplay from this game if you play the main storyline and do the essential/big missions. I imagine there's much more to the game that I missed during my playthrough. Buy it. Enjoy it. And smile knowing there's sequels waiting for you.			"

It changed roleplaying games forever, and birthed a post-apocolyptic sub-genre that still thrives today. The character creation system leaves the door open for multiple playthroughs, and allows you to feel more in touch with the character. Talk about pure roleplaying. Do you want your guy to be a scientist? A born-leader and hero? How about the dumbest man on the earth, but he's great with a sledgehammer and minigun? There are so many options. Playing with an intelligence of 1 will just make you laugh. You can always come back to this game for a good time. Another great thing to keep in mind, is that this will run on about ANY Windows machine. You can put it on your laptop for the go for a great travel game. And with the addition of Fallout FIXT, the game runs phenominal at 1080p resolution, and the community went ahead and fixed some of the issues plaguing the game since development halted years ago. Actually, Fallout FIXT was just updated on December 23, 2013! Let's hope that the classic Fallout titles return to Steam soon, it was sad to see them go!			"

												As a quasi-modern gamer, I shall catagorize this game as 'somehow good'. The game play is definitly not my style but it did the job very well to get me addicted. Story is not so fascitating but the logical structure is very good. I named the protagonist 'Max Pinn,' and will certainly name his son 'David Pinn,' his grandson 'James Pinn,' and grandson of his son as 'Max Pinn II.'Schit, the map is too big for a very old game like this. Everything looks the same [booring], so I only played just the main quests. And know what? The game didn't let me play the rest after finishing main quests!Aight then. Recommend anyway.			"

												War... War never changes.A concept that has driven a younger self to delve into the depths of human history and indulge in the ages of humanities stife. Fallout and its proceeding series has taken a Post- Nuclear apocalyptic outcome of humanity, peeking subsequently in the attitude, culture and design of 1950's United States of America...  on October 23, 2077 a final Nuclear showdown between the powerhouses of the world finally push the resource crippled Earth to its limits.The aftermath that ensued is what caries the Fallout series... 2161... 84 years after the grand conclusion to Man's pinacle.Unfotunately, the scarred earth was not left without it's demons looming. Pulling humanity ever downward or to one binding will or another.This did not mean all was lost though... Emergent groups; once sealed away long ago before the world went silent still had a chance to re-inherit a land all but forsaken by it's previous masters. The time had come for the those fortunate enough to hide away in sealed underground fortresses known as Vaults. These Vault Dwellers experienced a different form of life... Far from the raptured barren lands of the nuclear wasteland that was now the Americas.Fallout will take you through the Western United States of America, your mission... Save the Vault, your objectives, retrieve a Water-purification chip  and return with any details of the land.With the goal established you are pushed onto a desert frontier, far from the lush lands that once beheld the view.The game plays from a Top-down view of your characters, combat revolves around Action Points and maybe a bit of luck ;) to resolve any experience. Weapons range from rocks, spears and knives... To sub-machine guns, rifles and shotguns... Chainguns and rockets all the way up to the sci-fi laser and plasma weaponry in similar previous fashions.The Vault Dwellers or later to be known to most as The Wanderer... journey is one that always kept smirk of satisfaction on my face. The stories created here are later on exemplified in later games from the series.TL;DR: A game that was likely overlooked if you're in your early 20's and younger. Take the time, see how the story began and enjoy some good old fashion hexa-based combat.			"

												My Fallout experiences and what I thought of Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing GameMy introduction to the Fallout franchise was through a friend of my elder brothers. Before going out, he peered his head into my room and left an Xbox 360 copy of Fallout 3 on my table for me to borrow. I was addicted. The start of the summer of 09' was spent wondering the DC ruins and soaking up everything that that insane game had to offer. A year later in 2010, New Vegas had came out. I ravenously guzzled it down within a month and was still hungry for more. For a massive history-buff like me, and all though it's set in the 2100's, the Fallout series offered a unique experience and had me totally engrossed in it's seemingly endless codex-like information and lore.So, some time later it is payday December 2013. By now I am on Steam (albeit still a noob) and I am searching the store. I get home from a freezing night of Christmas shopping with the girlfriend, and I notice the 'Fallout Bundle' going for around £3. Was this real?As soon as Fallout 1 had Installed I jumped on in.It took a while to get used to the old turn taking system, but you have to be open minded. Playing game series backwards in age is going to be off putting so you have to try and enjoy it for what it is. Saying this though, I got bored (Guilty as charged) and didn't play it for about half a year. As much as it pains me to say this, I just lost my will to play it entirely from sheer boredom.Into the not-so-distant future and the Fallout crave had started to come back. I reinstalled F:aPNRPG and jumped on into a new game. This time round, I curbed my ego and instead of playing Fallout 1 like I played Fallout 3 and NV, I decided to take a completely different approach.I forced myself to remember, this game was made when I was fifteen months old. Times were different back then. So I dumped myself in the desk chair, grabbed a tall drink of cola and walked out into the Vault 13 Caves.I didn't look back, and what a game it was. A solid 10/10. A beautifully minimalist/simple and believable plot too. Try it for yourself. If you are approaching this game from the future like I did, then be open minded. Only play it when you crave to. Otherwise you'll get bored and this gem will be missed out on. Next up, Fallout 2.			"

												[Note: The game time logged on Steam does not reflect the time I spent playing Fallout to date. I bought it back in 1997 on CD-ROM and have owned a couple of other bundles which included it since, and have completed Fallout at least a dozen of times since first release.]This was the very first of the Fallout games, and it is still in my all-time-favorite games list today. With added community enhancements, hi-res patches and unofficial updates, this game is still fun, unique to play, and more complex than it was on its release date; and the best part is, even a low-powered netbook can run this just fine. The post-apocalyptic world is diverse, the humor is brilliant to say the least, and this game is just worth being played just for the random encounters alone.The character creation is fun, you get a wide array of cool weapons (such a modified shotgun based pistol!), and even after a number of playthroughs, there are still new items to discover. If you love RPGs, if you love a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, and if you have an affinity for the Fallout universe (even if you started with Fallout 3), then you should certainly give this a try, even if it might look a little dated. The graphics, as they are, in fact help the atmosphere. I probably completed this game over a dozen times.Given the fact that Fallout is from 1997, a time in which video games were not quite established yet as a socially accepted entertainment form, the voice acting provided by actors like Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn and Dwight Schultz is also superb! If you don't like this game, you were born a generation too late and I feel sorry for you!			"

												A classic, plain and simple. Its a merciless game but, intensely addicting. Vastly different play style than from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, its a third person view turn based combat, there are plenty of fights you'll encounter that require a good deal of planning. The storyline is shorter compaired to the other games but eacht ime you play the experience is completely different based on your SPECIAL stats. The only downside is this has trouble running on current machines, I tracked down some patches that fix it but still run into some issues with stability. This of course is to be expected from an older game.			"

												A rpg game with a turnbased battlesystem. Briliant unpredictable story that you shape yourself. Follow the Vault Dweller as he sets out on an epic quest to save his home in a postapolyptic world, that has frozen in time since the early 1900. With plenty of companions, a exelent levelup system and detalied text dialog. This really is a fantastic game and should be played by every rpg fan. Old school that still makes you laugh all the way down to your gut. The only minus has to be the lack of some good music, but you can always put on some Fallout 3 soundtrack while you play to complete the experience. 9/10 "

												Fallout, the first game in one of my favorite series of all time.  This game is awesome.  The pacing is great and isn't as difficult as the second one.  It works super well on any pc which is awesome.  The game's combat and exploration are its trademarks.  You can loot, kill, and do just about anything.  It is alot more forgiving than Fallout 2 but it isn't as long.  The story itself is unique and well paced.  I never felt while I was playing the game was taking too long.  I liked how you can find all the cool easter eggs that most companies don't ever put in their games now.  Get this game and it is on sale plenty of times so get it during one of the many sales steam does.			"

												   I was first intorduced to the Fallout series when I played Fallout 3, which my friend highly recommended. He had been trying for weeks to get me to play, I finally gave in a decided to try it and I LOVED IT! I went on a Fallout binge, often playing for 10 or more hours per day. Then I finished the game and moved on to New Vegas.   Recently I decided I wanted to go back to the beginning and play the earlier games. I wasn't expecting very much, especially since it was made in 1997; but when I first started it I felt like it was a waste of money(even though I bought the bundle while it was on sale). After getting my butt kicked by Radscorpions and not knowing how to get better equipment I was about to give up, then I started goofing around and found out what I wanted to know.   So far I haven't progressed ver far in the main questline, but I have developed a new found respect for the original, in my opinion being better than the newer ones. The areas are quite large, the music is addicting,and the combat system is not as bad I though it to be.    My biggest challenge when I started playing was adjusting to the combat system. Since I started Fallout playing Fallout 3 it took some time to get used to the combat system in this game. After I got past that I started to love this game.   I highly recommend this game to any fan of Fallout			"

												If you haven't played Fallout 3 already, you're missing out. So not playing this might as well be the same thing. A top down mix of real time combat and turn based, Fallout will imerse you into the game GREATLY. I mean seriously, you can right click and hover your mouse cursor over anything and you get a detailed discription of it, then you can even left click to get an even MORE detailed description of it. The music is usually dark in most cases, kinda makes you feel like when the npcs' say, ""It's dangerous there!"" You feel like it's actually dangerous there. And speaking of danger, THIS GAME IS DIFFACULT. Half the time you die you don't even know the reason! Moving on to weapons and armor. New weapons and armor are quite rare, so actually finding a new weapon makes you feel great for finding it. I personally love this game, but it requires a lot of time, a lot of saving and a lot of imersing yourself into it, kinda making yourself feel like you are actually you in the game. I give it a 9/10. (Also there are a TON of easter eggs in the game that give you a fun challenge to do if you're bored; which you won't be with this game :D )			"

												Do you like wandering through caves, stabbing rats, and finding nothing of use? How about traveling the desert wastes, getting jumped by huge ganges of cow-sized radioactive scorpions and nearly dying when you discover your pistol is all but useless against them? Cus I do. I definitely give this game a solid 11/10 so far.			"

												A surprisingly mature, well-written RPG that stands the test of time well. Though the controls, combat, and interaction may feel dated at first, once the player is immersed into the rich world of Fallout it is easy to look past such minor annoyances. There are some arcane solutions to quests, but due to the open-endedness of the game this is hardly an issue, as there are plenty of other paths to take if one becomes sealed off. The game is intelligently crafted so that each new playthrough can feel fresh (despite this being a rather linear game in comparison to newer entries), and the story is both well-paced and adaptive to the player's actions. This, when compared to, for example, Fallout 3, contains not only a great deal more player agency, but also an ending that changes and carefully describes the player's impact on the game's world. I was found reflecting on my earlier actions when the final cinematic rolled for the first time, questioning just how much of the plot's aftermath was directly influenced by my choices.If you are interested in a smart, deep, and very unique CRPG, then Fallout is an excellent way to spend $10. If you are coming from the new games to experience the beginning of the franchise, then consider that this game is much more complex and difficult than the newer entries. This is not to discourage, however, as this game is, all in all, a brilliant experience that has proved itself to be a classic in my eyes.			"

												Fallout 1's story was concise without being simple. Everything that was there needed to be; there was no fluff, no fat, no waste. The quests you undertook were relevant to the main plot and visibly moved the story forward. The villain was appropriately menacing and evil, but his actions made sense. When you asked 'why', he gave you a reasonable answer. The ending was emotionally impactful, not just for your character, but for you - being turned on at the end felt like a punch in the gut, but once again, it made sense. The overall story was a hero's journey, but the plot elements were still unique. Regardless of which game you like best, by artistic standards Fallout 1 the best written narrative in the series hands down.			"

												This game is highly recommended for people who want to play a good RPG. What's especially nice is that, for the first time, Steam had updated both Fallout 1 and 2 to no longer have the resolution problem or the ""rainbow pixels"" that many people, like myself, had previously experienced. Hopefully, Steam will do updates for all DOS games that are available in the Steam Store (I'm looking at you, Ultimate Doom). All in all, because of the update, there really shouldn't be anything stopping you (other than money) from buying both Fallout 1 and 2, if you want a fairly open-ended RPG.			"

												Fallout sufferes from some of the same issues that most early 90's games had. The direction of the story was vauge and hard to follow. That being said the gameplay is solid, I had no issues with bugs or crashes. This early role playing game fills a hole in my heart with post apoc turn based role playing. Each addition to the game series grows from this one and improves the world of post nuclear U.S.A.			"

												At the very beginning I was angry I bought this game because of bugs and poor gameplay implementation that broke immersion. But certain bits of the main plot didn't make me stop thinking about the atmosphere and context I've been exposed when I played it. Tried it again and was a different experience already. The way you can accomplish tasks by different ways and how nothing is granted even reaching the highest level because of in-game decisions, probabilistic and cause-effect, and of course, the main plot that made me feel immersed in a post apocalyptic world. All those things make this game a masterpiece IMHO.			"

												A classic isometric cRPG, set in a post-nuclear war California. The main storyline itself is interesting but short. The best experience you get is from wandering the wasteland, completing side quests, talking to people about their experiences in the wasteland, and getting powerful weapons and armour. Places and towns vary from the bunker of the brotherhood of steel, to the 'Boneyard' (a ruined Los Angeles).The exploration is done differently from the bethesda fallout games. Instead of a continuous world like the elder scrolls games, you travel from place to place on an overhead map, going into real time when you enter areas and towns, or when you encounter enemies, like raiders, super mutants, and other special encounters as you travel across the wasteland. It's different, as it makes the wasteland seem more empty and barren (like a wasteland should be). The range of locations is large, from pristine pre-war vaults, to ruined cities, to gothic cathedrals, making each stop in the game world interesting.Character creation is the most complex in the series, similar to that of pen and paper RPGs. SPECIAL is a system which determines your base stats, which you build upon with a plethora of skills, optional traits (most of which have both a good and bad effect on your build), and perks, which you gain every 3 levels (4 if you have the 'skilled' optional trait), which gives you benefits in different areas. This game depends alot on numbers and stats, so choosing the right build and developing correctly is crucial.  Combat is turn-based, and resembles table-top combat. It's difficult, but you won't be constantly dying. No cover mechanics to be found here. But this doesn't mean the combat isn't complex. Your character build is very important, and your stats influence what kind of approach is best. A high endurance and strength character, who specialises in melee combat, will do well up close, instead of shooting from afar. Aside from that, you have lots of weapons you can use, from shotguns and sniper rifles, to rocket launchers and mini guns. Unlike Fallout 4, which seemingly gives you the power armour quickly for some reason, you can get it through different ways, such as repairing a broken suit, or stealing one, each way requiring you to be part of the brotherhood of steel. On top of that, you can harden your power armour, making it even more durable.Interactions with NPCs are interesting, and tell you more about the wasteland. Your interactions with them are constant. If you insult someone, they won't like you, they won't give you a job or a quest, or may even call on hired guards to kill you. This may seem simple nowadays, but it was cool to have back then. Important NPCs are shown with animated faces, and they can vary from paranoid businessman, to mutant ghouls. Your acts in the wasteland will change your reputation, and this will affect interactions with NPCs, which may lead to certain benefits or disadvantages.The atmosphere in this game is some of the best in a game to date. Gritty, dark, but with a touch of sarcastic and black humour, this game obviously draws influence from films like a boy and his dog, Mad Max, and books like a canticle for Leibowitz. It's art direction draws on from the 1950's vision for the future, with robots looking like something from forbidden planet than from the terminator. The humour is sparse, but well placed in characters like Harold, who despite living in an immortal agony, he can still make a joke or two. The music adds to this, each track a poignant, ambient soundscape of the area you currently, filled with industrial creaks, whining winds, and sudden crashes of metal on metal, emphasising the unforgiving world you must surivive in, instead of constantly hearing about ""Butcher Pete"", or whoever that is. Unlike Fallout 2, you won't have constant Monty Python references thrown in your face every random encounter, but there are some interesting ones, like a random encounter with the telephone box from doctor who. This game is old (1997), and it shows. The enviroments look nice and detailed, but still have that pixely look. The UI can be confusing and off putting, and things like quests and missions are marked with little detail (e.g. ""Find the water chip""), which means you'll have to remember the vital quest details. The combat is VERY slow, but can be sped up in the options, though this won't do much if you have lots of enemies to fight. There's no auto-saving, and you'll need to save often, or when you get killed, you'll have to load a save you made ages back. The inventory isn't amazing, as you'll need to keep clicking down and up arrows to get what you want. Also, thanks to Bethesda, this version of the game is the UK censored edition, removing swearing and other adult themes from the game entirely, as well as a poor port which you need to use patches to fix the resolution. This game is about a nuclear wasteland, where all hope for humanity is gone, mutants roam around killing people, and the only known technological power that isn't killing everyone (The Brotherhood of Steel), won't communicate with the outside world. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU REMOVE A BIT OF SWEARING!? If I wanted a family-friendly game, I would play lego star wars. Overall, Fallout is an awesome game. Complex, with alot of custimisation, interactions and exploration, in a very large and dangerous world. However, confusing UI and quest tracking, along with some features some new players may find very annoying, means you'll need to get used it, though it is definitely worth it.			"

												Some of the best writing I've seen in a videogame. It starts out as a humble quest to save your home, but soon you're out to save what's left of humanity from a fate that's worse than nuclear war. The main antagonist is a the best kind of villain -- not evil for the sake of it, but because he's flawed, he has truly admirable goals and motivations but his methods leave a lot to be desired. I'd say give it a chance. Learn to get past the dated graphics and the turn-based gameplay, and just appreciate the story.			"

												In my opinion, one of the best games in history. This game defined me as a gamer as a kid, through nothing more than a demo on a disc. I remember the first time I booted this game up, and got blown to bits by bandits because I had the fix idea that I should pickpocket or loot them all. Why one may ask? Well, simple really. I would be damned if I didn't have that awesome looking black uni-sleeved leather jacket!Enter my mother, seeing the splatter, who in turn look at me with a most disgruntled expression before asking me politely what the hell I was doing. Being a wise♥♥♥♥♥ I told her the truth, I was getting myself some better gear!Twenty years later, I'm still brutally blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥to bits for better gear! Safe to say, that Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game has created not one, but millions of monsters across the globe with it's brutal humor. Much love.			"

												Normally when I restart a game every time I launch it, it's because I have no investment in it (as was the case with Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, where I couldn't even bring myself to finish the opening narration), or it's simply not a game meant to have one playthough happen across multiple sessions (like FTL, or Long Live the Queen). Fallout, however, keeps me coming back consistantly despite how often I decide to try out a new build. It's definitely antiquated, but that shouldn't be a huge problem. If you started the Fallout series with one of the newer games (As I did), then the Isometric camera, turn based combat, and MUCH more open ended gameplay may take a bit of adjusting, but it's definitely worth perservering. If you want to try out an old school western RPG, then this is definitely a great choice.			"

Its timeless gritty graphics surprisingly add to the post apocalyptic feel. The soundtrack is perfect and amazing. The story is really cool and its pace seems perfect. It's filled with memorable characters, quests, weapons, and places. The turn based combat is perfectly paced and incredibly satisfying. The great character creation and dialog system makes realizing unique characters a blast... Very replayable. My only complaint is that Katja (an NPC) arrives too late in the game to be very useful.
