												Sudeki's a “But… if…” game, which are always the hardest ones to review. The “but” comes from a handful of mitigating factors: it’s fun, but easy; interesting, but derivative; initially engaging, but soon begins to feel rushed. Every positive facet of Sudeki comes with an accompanying drawback.The “if,” of course, is that if you like action-RPGs, there is nothing in Sudeki that will actually harsh your mellow. It’s not a bad example of its genre by any stretch of the imagination, and is often really entertaining despite its flaws, presuming that you like the genre in the first place.Sudeki is set on a world of the same name, which warring gods have split into opposing realms of light and shadow. The game begins in the kingdom of Illumina in the Light realm, where a soldier named Tal splits his time between defending the countryside from berserk Shadow monsters, flirting with the princess Ailish, getting yelled at by his father, and being the lone survivor of any mission he’s sent on.In the aftermath of a battle, the god Tetsu appears to Tal, and lets him know that an end is coming; the current troubles between the Light and Shadow worlds are just the beginning of a larger struggle. Tal, Ailish, a demihuman warrior named Buki, and Illumina’s head scientist Elco have been chosen by the gods to combat the forces of the Realm of Shadows, whether they like it or not.Sudeki will frequently allow you to control at least two of your characters simultaneously. Like Knights of the Old Republic, any PC who’s not under your direct control at the moment is controlled by the CPU; unlike KOTOR, you move your active character in real-time. Tal and Buki are short-ranged melee fighters, controllable in third-person and attacking via a timing-based combo system, while during a fight, Ailish and Elco move and shoot in first person.You can switch between the members of your current group at any time using the Black button, which is excellent for micromanaging difficult battles. Each character brings a unique mix of skills and statistics to the table; Tal is basically a meatshield, Buki is a mobile attacker, Ailish wields spells and high-damage magical staves (one of her later weapons is not so much a magical cane as a two-shot rocket launcher), and Elco provides covering fire using a variety of pistols.The fun of Sudeki is largely in the combat. A battle’s usually a chaotic melee, full of flying projectiles, charging opponents, devastating spells, and unpleasant surprises. A lot of people have claimed that Sudeki is a button-masher, and if you want, you can hammer on attack buttons all damn day. If that’s your kick, go to it.The reality is that Sudeki's combo system is actually designed to punish button-mashing. Tal and Buki’s melee combos depend largely on timing, forcing you to land two quick hits in preparation for a devastating finisher or a series of juggles. Anyone who’s trying to get through the game just by hammering on X or A isn’t going to do as well as a player who studies opponents, looks for an opening, and lays into them with a careful string of hits.Meanwhile, Ailish and Elco’s job is to hang back from the melee and rain death upon anyone who isn’t looking. The more powerful their weapons, the more recharge time they’ll generally have between shots, which means you’ll need to dodge and weave to stay on your feet. Once again, you can just hold down the trigger and spray death at your enemies, but the low hit strength of the weapons with a high rate of fire means that you’re really spraying minor annoyance.Out of combat, each character has a further unique ability which allows you to discover secrets and solve puzzles. Tal can push around local designated Shoving Objects, such as crates. Buki can climb up walls using her claws, Elco’s rocket pack lets him fly as long as there’s a yellow crystal handy to power it, and Ailish possesses Second Sight, allowing her to penetrate and dispel illusions.When you level up, you can spend advancement points to raise each characters’ stats and teach them up to six skills. In villages, you can further improve a character by welding magical runes to his armor or weapons, providing power boosts, special abilities, or immunity to status attacks. (The latter’s important, since everyone and their mom in Sudeki can inflict status ailments on your party. It’s not unusual to have two or three going at once.)This is usually the point where I ineptly segue into discussing a game’s flaws, but aside from some dodgy character design (I hope you like Buki’s♥♥♥♥♥ because thanks to the gods of Sudeki, you’ll be staring at it for a long time), Sudeki plays just fine. The biggest problem it has is that there isn’t enough of it.For one thing, Sudeki is dead easy. Part of this is because Elco gets his best weapon about four hours into the game. With a little work and a few levels, he’ll be popping conventional enemies like a grape with one or two shots. This comes in handy, since Elco gets one of the hardest fights in the game all to himself -- Sudeki’s bosses always seem to contrive a method to make sure you fight them one-on-one – but it also means that any group with Elco in it skates through combat.You can also easily get all the best skills early on, since none of the spells or abilities in Sudeki come with a prerequisite. You can easily grab all the stat-boosting or protective skills first thing, then use them at the start of any fight to stack the odds in your favor.In addition, any given boss can be defeated with the use of a simple trick, which looks more like a glitch than anything else. Every time you use a skill, your character enters an invulnerability window that lasts until the end of the move. There’s at least one boss fight where you can completely ignore all of its attacks and instantly counter, as long as you keep casting spells.Combine that with a few runes, some decent weapons, and Ailish’s tendency to obliterate anyone who looks at her funny with Celestial Circle, and Sudeki's main characters wind up looking less like heroes and more like exterminators.In addition to being easy, Sudeki is ridiculously short, clocking in at twenty-five hours max. For a game that was purported to be the first real epic RPG on Xbox, this is almost incomprehensible.Playing through the endgame, one wonders if Sudeki was meant to be far longer, but was rushed to completion. Many plot threads are abandoned or tossed aside, including a major life-changing event right before the final battle. Both Tal and Ailish have major issues that simply aren’t resolved, involving his father and her mother, and Elco is the focus of a major plot twist right before the finale that, unfortunately, doesn’t wind up meaning anything.It’s a fun game, and it’s not a bad game, but it’s over right when most RPGs are just getting started.Recommended!

												First off, Tom Baker! He narrates certain parts of the game and also voices one of the characters - not a main character, but an NPC that shows up here and there throughout the game (Tetsu). When I learned that, I had to pick it up immediately, regardless of whether the game was any good or not. Aside from the fourth Doctor, the game is also fully voiced with cutscenes, NPC chatter, and dialogue options.Sudeki is from 2005 and it shows. The graphics are a bit primitive, about the same level as World of Warcraft, although the art style is different. It has a more Asian vibe. It's actually a very pretty game, with bright colors, dazzling particle effects, and great character designs. It's also an obvious console port, with no mouse control within menus, a checkpoint save system, and limited options. The default POV is third person with no Y axis control, but certain skills require first-person view which does allow you full X & Y angle control. Ranged characters play in first-person by default during combat, then switch back to third-person when moving around out of combat.Combat is fluid, and plays differently for each character. Some have combo moves which aren't too complicated (L/R/L, L/L/L, R/L/L, etc.), others have various weapons you can switch between during combat for various effects. There are also spells and special powerup moves you can activate. Combat pauses while you select these from a menu, and they include cutscene style animations with epic effects. This makes it feel a bit like a turn-based RPG like Final Fantasy VII when you trigger those off, which is kind of fun.There are shops and save checkpoints scattered around here and there. Weapons and armor can be upgraded with runes to add various effects like damage shield on armor, or extra crit chance on weapons, things of that nature. The game-world is composed of corridors divided by zones. There is no jumping, and sometimes you might encounter an invisible wall where it looks like you should be able to go a certain direction, but you can't. In this way, the setup reminds me a bit of Kingdom of Amalur. You can go almost anywhere, although some areas are blocked off until you unlock them through the story.Speaking of the story, it's actually quite good. The characters are interesting, there are quite a few subtle jokes and innuendos thrown in here and there, and it has a lot of personality. I didn't want to stop playing but alas, sleep beckons. I look forward to playing through some more, as the game is actually quite fun. For the price, it's very solid entertainment. You just have to overlook the dated graphics and console feel.I'll update my review if I discover anything that changes it but so far I'm really impressed.			"

												This is a great RPG and I highly recommend it. It has pretty decent graphics (it is an almost 10 year old game) and the gameplay is engaging and fun. You go through a quest that gets bigger and more complicated as you continue. You pick up sidequests as you go along. The combat is fun, too. It is an action RPG and as you get more playable characters and skills, things become more challenging. Incredibly, the game reminded me a lot of Landstalker for the sega genesis. The reason is because the game world is so beautiful and well put together. Each town has a destinctive look and feel and even seems alive. Also, the pacing is just right with a progression that feels natural and is interesting. Overall, I was suprised at how deep the game is. It has virtually everything you could want from an RPG.One other note: the game is amazingly optimized for PC. The loadtimes which I assume existed on the console are eliminated on PC. The game worked great with keyboard and mouse, but I prefer playing with the gamepad. Also, the graphics options are easily accessible and modifiable.			"

												Sudeki honestly feels a little like a JRPG version of Fable.+   Very well made HD remake. Kept the game how it looked liked, while making lines more defined and adding shadows.+   Old school feel.+   Very comfy.+   Original story.+   The whole game is played as a team of four, with small chapters focusing on single characters.+   First- person combat using Ailish and Elco+   Pretty ladies+- The voice acting is terrible, but it adds charm to the game. Cracking voices, crappy emulations of accents, etc.-   Melee combat is extremely lame imo. Combos are too slow to feel useful.-   Controls on keyboard and mouse feels wierd.			"

												I can highly recommend this game to any fans of classic or action RPGs. The value for the price is great even without a sale, and with a sale it should be in the library of every RPG fan.+Graphics good for the time, and hold up decently+Fully voiced dialogue for all conversations+Unique characters with different traits and talents, customize as you level+Decent story depth and length (15-20hrs likely depending on style)+Unique and fun combination of first-person and third-person real time combat+Switch seamlessly among party members in and out of combat+Equipping different weapons/armor will change character model appearance+Controls customizable and work well, keyboard/mouse or game controller+Plenty of exploration, side quests, and treasures for those interested-Voice acting is mediocre, sound/music is nothing memorable-Camera can be annoying at times-Map system is not great, easy to get turned around in dungeons-Only 4 playable characters-Armor changes occur with the story so if you prefer one look there is no going back			"

												I can’t run it off Steam on my crap laptop, so I’ll review using my old copy.Short Story: If you can run it, TRY THIS GAME! For $5, you will not regret it. Long Story: It a good mix of both West and J-RPG essentially. The game has flaws, yes; but at the same time it oozes charm, humour and plain enjoyment every step of the way.The real selling point IS “Sudeki”, the world itself. The environments are varied and exploring around the Palace and the countryside will make you wish you could spend a summer visiting and living in the game world. And to top it off there is a great soundtrack that gives each town and village a sense of identity.  I sometimes just sit and listen to the music, it’s that good. The story, though it has cliques, has its twists and turns and it’s interesting enough to keep exploring the world. And has almost a Disney-esque feel to it: hopeful and silly sometimes and then surprisingly dark other times. Voice acting is not always great, but you will find characters you love and characters you hate. Gameplay is ok, if a bit repetitive and linear. Good enemy variety, simplistic combo system and RPG customisation for weapons and two ranged and two melee characters to switch during combat. Oh and class specific spells. I'm very happy they finally got this game on the Steam Library. I played it as a kid and loved it and even today I come back to it every 2 years or so and do a playthrough. I was very sad when I found out the sequel got canned, but Sudeki easily stands on its own. Now if you’ll excuse me I’ll be in New Brightwater, smashing crates and listening to the soundtrack :)			"

												Sudeki is a real time action rpg with a little bit of everything.Set in a fantasy medieval era where two nations are at war, you play as a protagonist named Tal who assembles a party of somewhat unique characters that must learn to trust each other to meet their individual goals.Of the four main playable characters, two are melee and two are ranged. Melee characters perform combos to attack, ranged characters have a FPS POV. Every character has their own skills that are almost identical to the others such as line, arc, and AOE, but also have unique powerful skills of their own. Combat is clunky but is not hard to get used to. Once the player understands how to coordinate attacks and abilities between multiple characters combat becomes easy. Very easy unfortunately. However it is still very fun because the game throws multiple different types of enemies and enemy compositions at you that successfully winning with little to no damage taken feels rewarding. The player must learn to adapt to situations where they do not have a full party, are playing as a single character in some encounters, and during dreaded escort missions  (thankfully there is only one but it is very painful).  One great aspect of combat is the ability to actively switch between different weapons. This allows you to use weapons that have increased damage at times when you need to burst, or when you need to steal life or mana, or dispel magic from enemies. Overall, combat in Sudeki is good and unique but has some balancing problems. For me the game shines in it's exploration.The world is small but offers a lot of variety. Landscapes are cool, bursting with treasure to find, npc's to talk to that occasionally offer quests or information about the world. Dungeons are very much labyrinths that can be confusing to navigate along with some puzzles that range from ridiculously easy to one in particular that took me a solid 20 minutes to figure out. For $6.00 I recommend this game to anyone at least willing to try it for 2 hours before deciding on finishing the game. A playthrough is short, clocking in between 15-20 hours. As with all old games you have to play knowing the era. For 2005 everything is decent but lags behind. Compared to Fable which was released a year prior, the graphics and voice acting are a little dull.7/10. Pros Fun combatFully voice actedRewarding explorationDecent story with minor pacing issues, but plot twists that keep it interestingClassic RPG style with unique elements Cons Loose ends, ending feels rushedMinor bugs that require the need to have several save filesToo few bossesVery little replay valueSome dull quests "

												This game claims to be an action RPG but in fact it's an FPS with RPG elements. Well, it's all depends on your play style, so you actually may use fighters as... you know... fighters. But why would you do that when you have a guy with a railgun and a girl with a shotgun and rocket-launcher? Well, the last two are disguised as staffs but does that really matter?This game is old and graphics dated, but it's a good game and price won't leave a hole in your pocket. Give it a try. I'm sure you won't regret it. The only part which I don't like in this game is a voiceacting. In the most cases it's really awful.			"

												A no hesitation buy for me.I played this game years back on PC and the funny thing is, about a week ago I was looking at the original disc I had, which I accidentally damaged and was thinking to myself, ""I wish this was on Steam."" LOL. xD Now here it is, ON STEAM! OMG. Sorry, I'm just a little hyped. :P I can finally finish the game! :)Ok, so the game is a really good Action RPG. The controls are pretty much like most Action RPGs so if you played games like Fable you should be able to get used to this fairly quick. And the 360 controller support is a plus.The graphics are very nice considering this was originally released in 2004 on the Xbox and 2005 on PC.If you like Action RPGs with a somewhat Japanese Fantasy style to it then you will like this game, and for the price of $4.99 USD, it's worth the experience. :)Edit: After comparing some of the files I had managed to salvage and backed up from the original UK disc version, I noticed that the video cutscenes were enchanced for the Steam version to support higher resolution displays. Nice! :DI posted comparison photos for you to see in my Facebook game community here:https://www.facebook.com/gamergenkisan "

												I've been waiting for this game to come out for a long time. I only recently learned it was released for Windows a while back, but who knows what compatibility issues await with an old copy. I was expecting it to show up on GOG but was just as delighted to see it appear today on Steam.I wrote a full review of the original XBOX version on my own site with minor spoilers that's too long to post here: http://thebestgameneverplayed.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/sudeki/To boil it down, imagine if an older action/adventure SNES game like Secret of Mana was remade using today's technology.

												Sometimes people ask my why The Fast and the Furious is one of my favorite movies. I can explain it about as well as I can explain why I like this game so much.Is it the characters? Sort of, not really.The story? No. Definitely not.The action? It is pretty good, but I can't say it's amazing.The level design/setting? Uh, well, it's pretty good except for that one ♥♥♥♥ing sound puzzle because would you give me a break on that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Who even knows sounds that well? Do I look like I have rhythm or a working understanding of tones?Maybe, like The Fast and the Furious, I just remember this fondly from before I had to get a job and before I had disappointed everyone in my family to such a terrible degree.Probably that last one.

												sudeki is an obscure RPG that got its start on the original Xbox. The game was largely ignored but it shouldn't have been. The game takes about 20-30 hours and can best be described as a slightly mroe open Fable. The characters are interesting if a bit cliched. The graphics are surprisingly good for the time period also. The audio is standard fare with a few standout tracks (New Brightwater). Overall it's a fun game with some unique ideas such as the two ranged chaacters using first-person mode in combat maknig them paly like they're in an FPS. (a tip: If you're using a controller, when using these characters, use a mouse to aim as it's MUCH faster). Overall an enjoyable title and well worth it at the price point.			"

With a little bit of work, until a patch comes out, this is a must buy!First Edit: Still no luck trying to play the game in various compatability modes. Regardless of choices after the opening video about the two btothers the game completely freezes up. I've had the Steam Overlay up as an experiement and until that moment all is fine. I do believe this is a Windows 7 problem but it might also be a 64 Processor problem as well. I know others that have reviewed have been able to play it, so hopefully I'll be able to change this Recommendation from a No to a Yes soon.			"

												I never really owned or even played an original Xbox, so that's why this game flew under the radar for me. It wasn't till much later that I actually got the chance to play it. I have to say though if they had released this on the Playstation 2, I would have been all over it.Sudeki is a unique RPG in that it doesn't follow your typical JRPG formula. Being a British based company, Climax Studios brought something new and different to the US during it's initial release. While at it's core it still feels like a role playing game, Sudeki also contains elements of third-person, action, adventure, shooter, and even first-person shooter games. The voice acting can be a little campy at times, but sadly most games during that generation had the same problem, fortunately it is tolerable. I do have to admit, the graphics and shaders still look really good, unlike other games that do not age so well. I'm pretty sure they were able to add a lot more to the PC version(because, you know, PC MASTER RACE), because it shows, and it has aged well.At least until we get to the point where we blur the lines between reality and virtual reality, where our brains won't be able to tell the difference... Then you can run a Sudeki emulator to play it, and wonder how we used to play these types of games. Until then, give this one a shot. Buy it, Play it, Love it.			"

												All right i just figured out how to fix the issues concerning game play on this game. It will run perfectly if you do a few things first. I am running windows 7here is how to get the game running on your PC for people running Windows XP, vista, 7 or newer OS systems, provided you were experiencing the same compatibility issues i was. (I hope steam will post this in the game descriptions also)1. Buy and install the game from steam ( i highly reccomend this game i had it for xbox it was awsome)2. after you install the game go to your folder directories or whatever folder where you install your games, my folder for my games for example is...Computer--Local Disk (C:)--Program Files (x86)--New Folder--SteamApps--common--3. Find your folder file that is titled Sudeki and locate your Sudeki.exe file4. Then you right click on it with your mouse and click Properties5. Next click on your compatibilty tab and check mark the box to run inWindows98/WindowsME mode. Then click apply. 6. Now go back in your Sudeki program files and locate your SudekiLauncher.exe file follow the same procedure as listed in steps 4 and 5.7.Once done with that go back into your Sudeki program files and locate the folder _CommonRedist, click on the folder that says DirectX, then click onthe folder that says June2010 and locate your DXSETUP application file. Now when you locate that file follow the same steps as mentioned in steps 4 and 5.8. Next goback into your _CommonRedist folder and locate the folder vcredist click on that folder, then click on the folder 2010, then locate your vcredist_x64 application and follow the same steps as listed in steps 4 and 5.9.After that locate your vcredist_x86 application and follow the steps listed insteps 4 and 5.10. Now exit completely out of your files, click on the icon to start your game and enjoy playing your game. If you did your steps right as mentioned your game will run smoothlyI am going to immensly enjoy this game I hope you do to.I can recommend this game without even playing it. i had this game on xbox. one of the more decent rpg games for the original xbox. i loved the game. the graphics were great and the plot is well written. It is a great game plenty of action plenty of exploration. i logged some serious hours when i had it on xbox. i am super excited i bought it for PC. However, for serious and not so serious RPG gamers this game is a must buy.			"

												At about 20 hours worth of game play (including the little bit of grinding it takes to reach the relatively low level cap of 30) this game is not one to get if you are looking for an RPG to dump hundreds of hours worth of your time into (ah-la Skyrim, etc). But at only $5 you certainly get a good bang for your buck. Assuming you can get the game to load, and play due to it's poor compatability with modern OS's.Over all, a good game for the money. Oh, and let's not forget hot cat-girls in extremely skimpy outfits. Always a plus.			"

												*sigh* alright. So this is my 3rd review. The first one was positive, then negative due to several crashes NOW .. here I am yet again. I am not sure if setting Audio Quality to medium helped any. But the truth is I do love this game. I just really hope all the crashes will stop. When I first saw that Steam had Sudeki I bought it instantly. I've last played it way back when I was a kid and always have loved it and still do. It's bright, colorful, silly and fun. To me it's very nostalgic on top of all that.Now, all that being said, $5 is really not a lot. So I'll stick with a positive review. The game is loads of fun. I mean it. I am hoping for another update that might help stop the crashes altogether, or at least ... minimize them even more. I also still cannot tilt the camera up or down.But all in all ... I am glad I have this little gem back.			"

												Sudeki is a game from the long ago of 2005, and it shows. That isn't a bad thing, the game is old and there isn't a reason to update all the graphics and what not just because you are putting it on Steam now. The game has been avilable on the PC before. The game has it's flaws, but it is still a good game. I finished the game in a little over 10 hours without doing side quests. It says I have 9.7 or what ever, but I had a save file about 40 minuets in from when I had it on the PC before hand but never got around to playing it. So it is kinda short, but I am glad it had enough for the time it took, and didn't drag the game on longer then it needed. The combat in Sudeki is a little varied, but not a whole lot. The two ranged people and the two melee people play kinda the same as each other, just with different active abilities and weapons. There is a combo system for the melee attackers and the ranged just shoot the crap out of people who get too close. I had this game on the xbox as well a long time ago and I never finished it, got about 3/4ths of the way through. Since I hadn't played it for a while and liked it so much back then, I hyped it up in my mind when it came to Steam to the point I thought it was amazing. Sudeki is good, just not amazing. It needs a good polish to fix some of the problems, like getting trapped in the corner in combat and it glitching you during combat cutscenes. The latter example happened to me during a boss fight and it broke the game to the point where I had to reload, so save often encase more problems pop up. I would recomend this game for 5 dollars, or even 10. I think it was still a good game and I hope that other people do as well. Side note: To those who can't get it to run for what ever reason, it is on your side not Steams since I booted it up without a problem every time I played.			"

												This game is a classic Action-RPG. I played it on Xbox ages ago, and I was not disappointed with it then, and was only seriously disappointed on PC by one thing...What disappointed me:- Camera doesn't auto-adjust when going up-and-down hills/stairs/etc, but you can do First-Person View('F'/'V' by default) and go back to Third-Person to correct it.What didn't disappoint me:- A well-built storyline with characters that are truly expressed well.- Numerous optional/side-quests to benefit from and enjoy.- Various traders with regional pricing and 'preference.'- Various styles of combat, AI optimization/control- Various customizable weapons and armor.- The ability to switch between characters(micro-management, combat specialization)- Combo-based melee combat allows the user to specialize in heavy single-target hits, light AoE attacks, quick single-target hits, charging maneuvers, and a few other attack styles; Somewhat of a con is that you have to memorize which combo is which, and you have to time your attacks correctly or the combo will fail.- Fairly adaptable leveling system with individual character management(distributing attribute points to stats/skills)- Combat-areas 'respawn'(in a sense), allows the player to acquire extra florins(currency) for buying potions, upgrading equipment, etc. - and allows the player to acquire additional experience(on currently active character(s)) so to level up your character, which I find very helpful if I'm having issues with the current quest.GraphicsThe textures are a bit dated and may appear pixelated on higher resolutions and especially on larger monitors, but the animation quality is quite amazing. The game supports 144FPS which I personally think is amazing. "

												Sudeki - such an amazing game. The music in this game is a 10/10, the story is pretty good a 9/10. This is a must buy, my only problem with this game is after you beat the final boss there is not much of a tie up with the story. Yes you can really tell what happened, but i would have loved just to have seen it in a final vid.			"

												This was one of my fave games on the X-Box. And I'm so happy to say that it's transended well on to PC.It's pretty much the same as it was,The graphics look a better than they were originally, also the loading times are miles better. Loading was a big pain that I had when this was on the X-Box. Do you remember when it used to have a loading title when you were in the overworld, and you were going to the Beach from the place where the Lighthouse was? Doesn't do that anymore.If you loved the game or like it even, then this is worth the money. This is something that's a blast from the past, and if you want to be caught in it, buy the game again. Note: It's a bit weird using the Mouse and Keyboard with it, but if you have a controller, use it.			"

												Sudeki. What words can Describe Sudeki? Fun. Nostalgic. Revolutionary. This is a game worth picking up and wringing every last bit of content out of. I used to play this endlessly with my dad on our Xbox, Before it broke, And, after 7 years, I could play this again. The needless abundance of DOOM level gore per kills, The Common Norms and trends of the traditional JRPG this game breaks, And despite it clocking in at only 20 hours of full content, this is a game to be cherished, with the unforgettable landscapes, unforgettable characters, and unforgettable soundtrack, this game deserves a resurgence, hell, even a remaster. Play. It.			"

												Besides the fact that it's an older game with outdated graphics and the sort, it's still a very enjoyable title that I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates a nice RPG. There are a few issues here and there, but like I said, the game is outdated. (Weird camera spazzing)I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm about 3-4 hours in to the game right now and it's had my full attention so far.Both combat and story are really enjoyable to go around with and despite the fact that the game is outdated, it's very charming!No need to read any further, just spend the 5 bucks to get this lovely title and enjoy!

												This was one of my favorite RPGs on the original xbox. It's pretty much a perfect port to the PC. I can even use my xbox controller so it feels like nothing has changed. Great game if you keep in mind that it is very dated. By today's standards it might seem very average but it has a very nostalgic feel to it.			"

												So I have no idea how this ended up in my library. I must have bought it, or had it given to me, but I really don't know where I got it. I vaguely remember a game by that name for (I think) the Xbox, which I didnt own. Having gamed since 1984, I can tolerate old games better than some, so I fired it up.I noticed it has many positive reviews, mostly it seems from people who remember it back on Xbox. I didnt play it back then, so theres no nostalga factor involved. But I will do my best to review the game for ots own era, and only point out things by today's standards if they are so glaringly dated that it ruins immersion.Its a 3rd person JRPG-art style action RPG. You know, button mashing so your guy swings his (ridiculously long) sword around and stringing together combos, theres an inventory where you can get better gear, a monster compendium, map, stats you can improve. Standard action RPG fare. The graphics are nice for the era, and are brightly colored. Of course they look a bit dated, but not terribly or distractingly so. So far everyone, including random NPCs in town seems fully voice acted. Now, I am not a fan of full voice acting in RPGs. (Long story short - you can get a MUCH more in depth story hiring one programmer to write many lines of text for NPCs to ""say"" vs. having to hire people to voice different NPCs. Voice acting is expensive, and having full voice acting for everything, not just main cutscenes/characters, makes the story detail shallower. Case in point Morrowind VS Oblivion) But I digress...Anyway. By today's standards the voice acting is terrible. And even by the standards of the time (which I am trying to review this game by), the voice acting is laughable at best. Comparing the voice acting in this to say, Persona 3 (PS2 game) or even Baldur's Gate 2, there's just no contest. This sounds like it came out of the era when the first put badly voiced scenes in games circa 1992. Take the worst dubbed-anime voices and timing you can imagine. Yeah. It sounds like that.Again, a case where it would have been better to only have a couple main characters voiced fully and save my ears. There are a few decent voices though. The main character Tal is listenable at least, as well as a couple other NPCs who's names escape me at the moment.The script is ok. Not great. Its kinda...overblown and really seems translated from a different language. Not as bad as the voice acting though, just not great. I actually don't think it owuld have come off as bad if the voices were better.One great thing is that its fully Xbox controller compatible (or Xinput for us Logitechers), as playing an action RPG like thos without a controller isnt advised. The controls are smooth on my Logitech, easy to understand and intuitive. Its fiun to go around bashing the crap out of enemies and learning new skills and making combos. THAT is where this game really shinesOverall, its not terrible, but at least for what Ive seen of it (I will update it if it blows my mind through awesome plot development later on - but as of right now I doubt it), the nostalgia factor seems to weight heavily in on whether people like it or not. If you are a fan of this type of game and are way more into the combat and character levelling then by all means, grab it.			"

												So, Sudeki is an instant buy from me.Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of 'Xbox' feel to this thing. It's definitely not the most modern release Steam has seen.However, It's unbelievably amazing. Morrowind aside, it's by far the next best xbox title that made it to the PC to date.Yes, it's a little dated, but so is the great classics (Baulder's gate anyone?), I recommend Sudeki whole heartily, for the story, game-play, discovery, character development. So long as you can look past it being slightly dated in some game-play elements (can you believe these textures were once 'next gen'), it'll work itself in alongside some of the best game-play experiences to date.[Not to mention $5 is a steal for this thing] Buy it!

												This is a decent Action RPG. I'd recommend it for anyone out there looking for a simple ARPG if you're not afraid of a few ugly 3D models. It's not my place to criticize the character design but they're a bit over-the-top and heavily influenced by anime, not that it matters but this game is not japanese.This game was one of the handful of RPGs that Microsoft made with interest of slipping the Xbox console into the Japanese market. While the game was not a commercial success, what we ended up having was easily a fantastic RPG on Xbox and even though it's been out for PC for quite a while, it's such an obscure game that nobody really noticed it much and now we have it on Steam and I couldn't be happier.The story, as well as the characters are somewhat forgetable, but it's got amazing scenery, the style of the world is similar to Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Very colorful, full of fantastic devices and monuments and very green with lots of vegetation too.The gameplay is the most important element in this game: it's fluid and it gives you a few choices, you can play an action hack-and-slash type of character or a First Person Shooter type.You get 4 characters to play with, all play together in the battlefield but you take control of one while AI takes over the others. 2 of them use Melee (Hack-and-Slash) and the other 2 use long range attacks (FPS). Each of them has different skills and combos and you can enter a slow-motion mode when you go through the skills and pick one to use, so the game never truly feels like it comes to a halt. This makes things stay interesting for a while.I could go on and on about who's who and what each character does but honestly, it's not that important, just know they're all very different in their style even if their gameplay is similar. Combos are different, they use different weapons, skills are definitely very very different so you'll have favorites. Also, all their one-liners are SUPER CHEESY so you can't escape those either way. The voice acting is not very good, you can see it's not a big budget game but these fantasy RPG type of games are TEXT-HEAVY so the voice acting is basically cutscenes and one-liners.On the technical aspect of the port: I am playing with an official Xbox 360 Gamepad and it's playing really GOOD, no complaints on the controller scheme, it's basically the same as back on the Xbox (although it's been almost 8 years so...don't quote me on that). The only problem I see is how the game text uses  ""Button1"" and ""Button2"" instead of labeling it ""X"" and ""A"", but that's not a big deal.I'm not on the high-end of PC gaming but I can run this game fine and so far I've seen no issues with widescreen or sudden crashes (from a bit of play-testing) and the frames per second seem fine too, I do see some issues with vertical sync but it doesn't take away from the experience. I do wish there were some mods for this though, some 2D art and 3D models are ugly (my opinion) and I'd love to change them.Although it is not some sort of hidden underrated gem, it's definitely a good game that didn't get enough attention and I'm sure most sales for this will be nostalgia-induced, and that's not necesarily a bad thing. It's based on something real good, enough to stay in your mind and make you want to play it again.			"

And is here on steam for $5.00.Anyway  i had problems with the game, it never load and i did everything written on the help. The game must be played on windows 98/me compability mode and on run as administrator also you have to install some components that are on the file within steam and i'm not quite shure but it never worked on Windows 8 but when I upgraded to Windows 8.1 the game started without any problem. well the graphics are the same but i must say that it looks good considering that is a game from old Xbox era. Is an action RPG you can use 1 of 4 characters 2 of them are melee and the other 2 are ranged and this 2 also when in battle mode the appear in 1rst person(its easier to shoot). This game is a must have.			"

												Short, but sweet.A really underrated Action RPG for it's time and one of my favorite Xbox games. Hopefully more Xbox games show up on Steam now, but anyway...Game has a simple but effective story. The combat is clunky due to being among the first 3D action RPGs of it's time but it introduced some interested mechanics to the gameplay element. You can switch between members on the fly and they change how you'll play the game. A melee character can combo their way to victory while a certain caster enters a first person style shooter mode. There isn't much outside of the core game however, you can do enchants but it's basic and you're free to determine your characters growth (for better and worse!) so it lets you meta-game to an extent.Graphically, the game runs and looks better than the CGI cutscenes, which is pretty funny. Luckily they aren't used as much as other turn based RPGs.Just be aware, apparently others are having problems getting the game to run. I haven't had such an issue but just be wary about it when you get the game, which at $5 USD I completely recommend.			"

												VERY impressed with this re-port. Sudeki was originally released on PC as a port shortly after the original Xbox game was released (so don't expect amazing graphics or anything like that, whilst it does still look good) - but had a myriad of issues. It wouldn't run on newer operating systems, didn't have proper controller support (the 360 controller didn't exist then so I can forgive them that) and had horrible mouse support.This updated version (it IS updated) fixes all of those issues and SIGNIFICANTLY boosts performance. On the non-steam older version I get around 25-30fps. Now, same PC (i3 380m 2.53GHz x2 HT, integrated, 6GB) I get around 30-50fps. Very impressed. Also button prompts have been updated to show 360 controls. Whoever updated this, you've done yourself proud.			"

Corny dialog, generic light world vs dark world, bring balance to the force JRPG shenanigeans we have seen a million times before, questionable voice acting, etc. But some how it works, this on top of having fun and engaging combat and colorful art direction will make for an enjoyable experience and for a reasonable price of five bucks. My only problem with this game is its length, it clocks in at around 20ish hours.Overall score: 7.3/10			"

												As others have noted the game is a little dated, which mostly shows up in the duration of the load screens (which takes longer than you would expect on good hardware) and the clunkiness of the combat, particularly in cancelling animations and dodging.  I highly recommend using an XBox controller for the PC if you have one.  The PC controls are not as good.  They work, but the controller works better.Second, you HAVE to run this in Windows 95 compatibility mode or the game WILL NOT work.  You will get past the loading screen and everything will go black.  To set the compatibility mode you need to find the file in your steamapps folder, right click on the file, go into properties, and set the compatibility mode.  You have to do this for both Sudeki.exe and SudekiLauncher.exe.  Then you can run the executable.  The first time the game loads it will take a while to get past the ""Loading..."" screen, but once you save the game and re-load it it goes much, much faster.All that said, the game is worth $5 in my opinion -- you can't even go to the movies for that these days.  Been a shortage of decent RPGs on the PC of late, and despite the game's age the graphics and sound are still servicable.  It's fun, and can offer a decent challenge.  What more can be said.			"

												Very good game for the time it cameout, graphically impressive for the original xbox. I was fully aware that it cameout on pc and i still own both versions but it is nice to see it on steam.  I bought it again because the pc version i have isn't that great in playability since it has issues that were never patched in my version before the company sold the IP.   If anyone is curious with the story it is a little drab but gives lore to anthropomophic animals who you encounter throughout the game and the freedom to combat how you want is always a plus and if you need more action it allows for fps style shooting and magic casting aswell third person swordplay mechanics.The game works perfectly fine so I have no clue what the hell anyone is talking about it not working on windows and it does not need compatiblity mode set maybe learn to use a computer and it's software before purchasing things.I will however mention this is an nvidia heavy game so those with ati cards will most likely have said mentioned problems. Allot of old xbox games and ports run on Nvidia software drivers so it might explain just a few things. As for fixes if you happen to have problems starting the game google the old fixes for the cd version and download their files to jumpstart the sucker they also contain patch fixes that address some problems if you encounter them that some seem to have with the game.Update - I have done much comparison between all three versions and can confirm this is a better HD version than the rest and includes improved mouth sync,graphic rendering,and dialogue that was missing with the exception of the FMV's that were left original and look really dated.

												Was a really good game. I also feel that for a game adapted from console, they did an incredible job with the controls. I might feel differently if I didn't have the MMO7 mouse, but I found the controls didn't feel awkward like so many other adapted games. I have a game controller, but I found I actually preferred to play this one with a keyboard an mouse. Any other projects that are converting a console game too PC should look to this one as a model.			"

												the game is great if you are into RPGs that has a little bit of everything for ever style. technology, JRPGS, traditonal RPGs (like swords and sorcery in mideval times), then you can switch to a ,somewhat, fps. though it is going to be a short time until you can get to the other characters. speaking of the other characters, they are (to me) kind of uninteresting but they do have their own sparks in terms of their historys' with their parents, or where they grew up. so in final this game is worth the price			"

Has some AI system of the knight of the old republic of what mode you can change them to or take control of the characters temporarly making it not feeling repeatative for a rpg.  Oh an also the feel of playing goldeneye or timesplitters is on it for 2 of the characters and the others have a Melle combo system giving it a good variety of moves and uses timing for different moves can't have you mash buttons to win.However there seems to be some textures missing  from what im seeing in this port nothing terrible but you will notice.

												One of the few great games that ever came out on the original XBOX. I have played and beaten this game multiple times. Once I remember how to find that one chest in the Grotto, I plan on livestreaming me playing this game. The best combo to fight is Mouse 2, Mouse 2, Mouse 1,1,1,1,1. As for the Krenn fight: Shoot at him until he comes up on you, then use a special attack so his attack will go right through you. Then when he goes back to the center, keep your eye on him, when he stops and turns to face you, go towards him off to the side a bit and past him. He will not be able to hit you as his blast is aimed away from you.			"

I will say that the CGI has aged noticeably and doesn't hold up very well. However, the in-game graphics are great and the resolution is fantastic.

												An old time classic that really shone on the original Xbox. This is certainly a high recommendation to give to anyone to play.Also after glancing over the ""Negative reviews"" for this game, I would like to point out that this game DOES work and play on Windows 7. I have been able to get it working first time without issue on Windows 7 64 bit. Though it might be an idea to run the game as admin AND to put it into compatibility mode along with Steam itself.I do honestly want to stress that most of the negative reviews should be ignored due to the lack of knowledge some gamers seem to have regarding their own PCs. Other than that, this is certainly one of those must play RPGs like Final Fantasy VII, Morrowind and Fable			"

												I owned the original game and soundtrack and loved every second of it. When I saw it one Steam, I couldn't wait to play it. There were definitely some graphical bugs that I had to work out to get it to play smoothly (which confuses me for a game that is so old, but whatever), and once I did, it runs great. It's a different type of RPG that's for sure. There are no 'random' encounters so to speak, instead enemies pop-up when you walk through certain areas and all the exits become blocked until you defeat them. You do get levels and points to spend on various things like health, damage, magic abilities, magic power, etc. There are a numerous amount of weapons for each character, but only one set of armor that gets upgraded through out the game.If you are a fan of simple pleasures and easy to get lost in games, then give it a go. For $6 ($3 on sale) what have you got to lose?			"

												TLDR:  Favorite original Xbox title of all time, decent port.  Recommend purchase, strongly recommend gamepad.Long version:  Tight, skill-based combat, memorable characters, and gorgeous graphics (especially when it first came out, but they hold up well in HD) redeem what could have been ""just another RPG"".  The melee combo system relies on precise timing, button mashing prevents maximum damage and makes the game feel clunky.  Ranged combat is done from the first person perspective, a novelty for RPGs, but it works extremely well.  Each character in the game (even the little side characters) is lovingly crafted and painstakingly unique, even the playable characters have completely unique walk and run animations.The Caveats:  Charmingly bad voice acting, a mediocre story, and zero re-playability prevent this game from being perfect, but perfection is overrated.  While the core cast is nearly perfect, all the side-characters have amusingly phoned-in voice-work and obviously affected accents.  This would normally be a bad thing if each voice didn't seem like it completely belonged coming out of each character, you'll get used to it and this is by far my mildest complaint.  While the plot has some interesting twists and drives the protagonists around three gorgeous worlds, it ends up making the game feel longer than it actually is.  My 19.6 hour playtime at time of writing is a 100% side-quest, collectable, and max-level run.  Admittedly its my third time playing through the game (the first two were on the Xbox) and I already knew where all the secrets were.  This brings me to my final complaint: other than going back for an OCD run, there is no incentive to play the game multiple times.  The plot is on rails, there is no player agency at all.  This is brought to the players attention in the most jarring way possible when, three-quarters of the way through the game, you are presented with a single moral choice and the game immediately renders your decision irrelevant.  Other than 10 seconds of cutscene and 2 pieces of dialog, there is absolutely no effect on the game.Gameplay tips: As quickly as possible, give each character a weapon with the bat fang and spirit bite runes.  This renders potions almost obsolete and makes the game significantly easier.  There is a long and difficult sequence early on in the game where two of your characters cannot get these runes, use the “Spirit orbs” to regain health and mana before each fight.  The best weapons for Ailish and Elco are the Wizardwood Stave and the Ion Fluxinator respectively.  These “railguns” have strong damage, pierce through any number of enemies in a straight line, and knock those enemies down.  The first level up point you spend on each character (other than Tal) should be for their buff spell: speed for Ailish, regeneration for Buki, damage for Elco, and defense for Tal (after you survive the first boss, anyway, grab health and mana first).  On Elco's solo boss, the eye is the only part that takes damage, shoot the Tesla coils when they come out of the walls.  Before the final fight, make sure Tal has a weapon with two large “Essence Burn” runes to dispel positive status effects on the boss and at least one golden panacea to dispel negative status effects on yourself.

												This game had a lot of issues when the steam version first landed but they've finally managed to iron them all out. I will say that it looks a hell of a lot better than i expected, your best bet for improving visuals would be to use CCC or nvidia control panel to force appropriate texture rendering. Playing in 1440p you would not think this game is a as old as it is. The game itself is probably not that great tbh, i probably only played it again because of the nostalgia but it is definately a rewarding game to play with a completely unique play style and a story/themes that are surprisingly dark at times.

												It's a pretty shoddy port job with some pretty terrible bugs (crashing during saves corrupting files, freezing on loading an area, battles that never end despite all enemies being dead, to name some I've run into). Also some of the cutscenes seem to be in terribly compressed video that would probably look hideous no matter what monitor you put it on.I should note that the Devs seem to be on top of thigs as far as trying to fix the existing bugs, but as of right now, they're there, and they're bad. Running the game in Windows 98/ME compatability mode  seems to remedy the most serious problems, but runnning the game as such may cause some fairly crippling load times.Sudeki is an RPG, it's got a really silly naming sense using Japanese words (you've got a shopkeeper duck that's named Duck in Japanese... the game is not Japanese by the way), it has an ultra cliche storyline/cast of characters, and its got a battle system that consists of a rather clunky combo system for melee characters and a whole lot of circle strafing and/or kiting for ranged characters.Honestly, the game is pretty mediocre just in general, but I played it when it came out for xbox a decade ago (and I'm replaying it now on PC), and I still somehow enjoy my time with it. At 5 USD, despite the glaring problems, I think it's worth it (assuming that losing progress to glitches doesn't make you want to flip a table every time it happens; save points are fairly frequent).

												Sudeki is a game where you get to play 4 heros in a fantasy world trying to stop evil. You have the sword guy(who is a tank), a dude witha gun (who shoots good), a nice pair of breasts  and a nice♥♥♥♥♥with a magic stick (she heals), and a nice pair of breasts and a nice♥♥♥♥♥with claws(she does... stuff(?)).The aim of the game is to try and collect crystals to help your empire, or at least thats what they would have you believe. The real aim of the game is to find the best weapon for each person, gun guy automatically starts off with a rad gun that shoots through enemies with high damage, healing breasts gets her cool staff mid way through the game, it does the same as gun guys weapon(shoots through enemies, high damage, high crit), claw lady gets her good weapon early on when you visit her tribe of furries and retrieve their bad dragon order from a temple. sword guys stuff is all kinda okay, just use him to tank damage.The game looks pretty rad, apart from all the cutscenes, which for some reason look kinda pixelated and rubbish. Sometimes you get some cutscenes that aren't the prescripted ones and the AI will walk in  dumb positions . Butt that doesn't matter too much.The combat system is rather cool and needs skill and timing to get combos rather than mashing buttons, then again in combat all I ever did was ""X, X, A, > A, A, X"" which had a nice continous loop for juggling enemies.All out this game is pretty good for something originally released on the ORIGINAL xbox. I rate it 10/10 it's okay. "

												Sudeki was a game that I started out thinking was ok, was impressed with for a bit, then disappointed.It is a game that had incredible potential, that was wasted on simplistic puzzles, shallow story and pidgeon holed game play in which certain characters were not available during certain sections of the story. In some cases, that made sense, but in other cases, like the final boss - (in which you think you'd have access to whatever character you wanted to play, you were limited to one), it was distressing.It's a game that idea-wise was great, but in execution left me cursing at the stupidity of the story at times. Don't get me wrong, it does have it good points. And it was fun for as long as I did play it, but at some points there was simply confusion as to what to do next, how to progress the story, etc...I just wish that more time were devoted to the concept and an engrossing story, because it did have potential to be a great game, but missed the mark in my opinion.

												It's not terrible and I can see the reasons why someone could like or even love this game, It's a British attempt to make an jRPG-style game, published a year before the Bioware's Jade Empire. Both these games threw away the infamous turn-based combat system and are basically action jRPGs. Both were published for Xbox and have some gameplay similarities, like autospawning enemies and grinding. I have to admit that Sudeki's magic system is more interesting than JEmpire's and graphics are fine for 2004, but, unfortunately, in other aspects the game is much worse. At first I was charmed, but after 10+ hours (half of the game) I got bored and annoyed.Music - unlike JE, Sudeki has very boring and generic music with no distinguishing style. Not a single track is worth recommending and they do little to nothing for the overall atmosphere.Voice acting - while most of the sound effects are decent, voice acting is laughably terrible.Walking simulator - most RPGs have some annoying walking simulator elements, but this game made it something unique. I think I spend more than 15% of this game pointlessly walking from one point to another while doing ""bring me X"" quests or getting to a specific merchant or altar. And since most of these areas were already known and additionally I had to face randomly spawning enemies - it was exhausting.Portals - the worst portal systems I've ever met. Sure, most non-sandbox RPGs don't even allow you to go back to previous areas after finishing a plot chapter and it's awesome, that you can do that in Sudeki, but using a portal always takes a minute of boring cutscenes and is almost pointless, since the portals are always in the middle of nowhere and are very far away from most important areas (another walking simulator element).Battles in the 2nd half of the game take too long - most of the midgame-lategame battles are very long, don't show anything specially new and exciting and are just annoying, especially since enemies are showing up in waves what makes the AOE spells less effective. Some fighting scenes took 5-10 minutes of repeating one decently tactic. And since you mostly can't avoid the randomly spawning enemies in certain areas, most of the fighting scenes brought nothing to the game's plot.Overall plot is boringly cliche - while a lot of jRPGs (and even American Jade Empire) can do a great job entwining generic threads and some unique ideas and Sudeki avoids some of the most obvious concepts (for example: no fake-ending, no burning the family village, main villain has no ""real form""), there is literally not a single original idea in the entire game, especially since...Boring fantasy setting - ...the entire game's world is just Another Fantasy World with no main theme beside ""good vs evil"". It kinda feels like an RPG Maker game made by a 18yo who decided to ignore plot by reducing it to minimum and focus only on graphics, cool mechanics or useless cutscenes or animations (like climbing on a high wall aka Pressing One Button or Portals) and walking to make the game longer. And also...Game takes away your PCs - The plot for whatever reason mostly does not allow the player to control all his or her party members. Instead the game constantly takes away some of the Player Characters and forces us to walk solo or with two characters, especially when fighting with bosses. It even teases us showing us areas, which the characters we control can't enter, but gives us clues, that other PCs can go there. This tease means to encourage us to return to the same area 1-2-3 hours later to finally see, what was this previously unavailable secret...I think I'm done with this review but I'll end with a quick reminder - it's not a terrible game, it's not even bad, however even though I spent 20+ hours playing it and I bought it in a bundle for like 0.40$ it is true I was enjoying myself while playing this for maybe 8-10 hours. The rest of it was either boring, repetitive or just poorly executed. I don't mind playing a game 8 hours long, but if I have to force myself to endure another 10 hours, to get this 8 hours of decent gameplay - I don't think it's worth it.EDIT: Also, the camera in some locations is just terrible, and the game does not know what to do when an enemy pushes our PC to a wall - we can't see  the enemy at all and we have to defend blindly.

												Sudeki is a typical console RPG. While it is an XBox (original) port, the graphics have been updated to support higher resolutions. This is most obvious when watching the non-engine generated cut scenes. These really show their age.For me, the game was okay. Four heroes are needed to collect crystals to make a ""peace keeping"" device. Turns out the peace keeping device is a energy sap to conjure a powerful demon. There is a shadow world and big epic boss fights.  It is linear: go here, go there, but you can't go to this other place. All the while you must stay on the path. And there are savepoints.You do get to control all members of your party during combat. Combat also is more than button mashing. For the melee fighters, there is a combo system. Three hits in a row and you execute a combo. Ranged fighters are in first person view. For the most part the AI for the other party members is decent. I heard it is way better than the original XBox version.There is a skill system. Each of the party members have both defensive and offensive skills. I did find that they seemed very unbalanced. And then there are the skill strikes. Bestowed upon the characters by the Gods themselves these are extremely powerful attacks that you must defeat enemies in order to charge the skill strike meter.I did have some crashes near the end. Also, the arena fights of the boss monsters sometimes left crazy camera angles and not much time to correct them. This was distracting more than anything, but getting walloped due to poor camera angle plain sucks. I also didn't care for the fan service. The female characters, as is seen in much fantasy, barely had any armor on.Not a bad game, but not necessarily one that I can recommend.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I just couldn't. I got frustrated over and over again, not because the game was hard, but because the controls were♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is a really bad port and is just not very fun to play with mouse and keyboard. To begin with, the mouse is hyper sensitive and there is no option menu once you get into the game. Not only is the mouse hyper-sensitive, it also moves the camera which means that your camera is going to be flickering all over the place. On the camera issue, the game also moves the camera around automatically as you move to the left and right and sometimes just randomly. If this was played on a controller, it would be so much smoother, but as for this port, it is so bad. The game is also a bit old and the graphics and gameplay aren't the smoothest. Sometimes you will get hit when you shouldn't have and other times you won't get hit when you clearly should have. Aside from the gameplay, I did enjoy the music and I think it fit in quite a bit.If I had played this game back when it came out with a controller and not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse and keyboard port, I probably would have liked this game a lot. But as for the current game and its enjoyment, I cannot give this a recommend.Rating: 6.6/10Recommend Price: Under $0.79			"

												This game... memories all over again.I played this on my old xbox and now it's here.Let's get straight to the point on thisit has alot of good things and some bad things(disappointments)Remember that this is my opinion thoughSudeki is an awesoem rpg that could possibly be a bit outdated.Defenitly a must have if you love FPS games and RPG'sFPS? you might think, well when you progress your story you get more people that will join your party.2 of those people are melee which you will then fight as in third person with a combo system.the 2 other people are ranged and you will go in First person mode and shoot them with your staff/gunEvery character has his/her own abilities which makes it alot of fun.A downside to this is that when you love 1 of the 2 fighting mechanics you most likely only focus on that.But be carefull the game will sometimes force you on a character so train every fighting aspect.Overall this game is very fun maybe a bit linnear but that's for you to decide.Great soundtrack and all thatthe only bad thing is that i excpected to get an HD version with this and as of yet i didn't notice this.This doesn't bother me but i excpected it.my score for this game : 9.5/10 just buy it cause it's cheap and it holds more nostalgia then your photo albums.

												For six bucks it is a good price for a classic game.This game's graphics are poorly rendered. Multiple polygon distortions in both HD and UHD; with or without AA. On R9 290x Asus video card the game's polygon glitches are such an eyesore that the game is virtually unplayable.The parts of the game that render properly are stunning, especially in 4k graphics, unfortunately that covers Ailish's♥♥♥♥♥and 90% of the road terrain, most of the trees are blotchy and out of place, even in lowly 1080p.There are no known fixes, but maybe someday, we can have this game more polished or even a sequel, I would rather see Climax spend their money they got out of me for this game to make a sequel than to fix the graphical errors.For me the rendering issues make the game unenjoyable and ergo: unplayable.

												Come on. i can understand a challenge but the further u get in this game it just gets more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes 30 minutes for just about every battle it only takes them 4 or 5 shots to get u at low health but it takes u 4000 hits to frickin kill them.( exaggeration but u get the point). the mage does crappy damage elco dont do crap for u. buki is just a rip off of the wolverine from x men and doesnt do no damage like a DPS is supposed to, she should be eating up the floor not dying the most. u fight pretty much all the bosses with one character but u play the whole game in a party. like what the hell is the point of making a party based game if u cant use ur party in a boss battle. knockbacks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. it takes forever for them to get up and by the time theyre up theyre either triple teamed on, knocked back down, or dead. if ur up for the challenge, by all means get the game. but its not worth the money for something im gonna blow up on and throw my computer through the window over.

												While this game certainly does have its good moments, and sometimes even a little intense, and I poured several hours into it, there were certain things that in the end made me regret this purchase. One of them being that the party you assemble is ultimately pointless because every single boss fight is single player. By which I mean that every serious boss fight picks one of the members from your team to fight alone which completely ruins the point in leveling your entire party. Another being the companion interaction. The dialogue is cheesy and predictable and as the game tries to create a magic vs science conflict, this fails hard as the arguments from both sides quickly become tedious and you find yourself not caring for either one. At all. It was a fun game, but after I got to the last boss, I felt like I had wasted my time and money.			"

												I almost abandoned this game shortly after starting it but I persevered through most of the game and now think it would have been better if I had given up right at the start. The main problem with the game is the combat. You start off as a melee fighter and the combat mostly relies on using combos. These require slowly pressing different combinations of the mouse buttons which feels unnatural as you expect the combat to be fast paced, they are easily interrupted too. After a while you unlock a ranged character which has a standard FPS style in combat and is quite fun to begin with. As the game progresses the fights get more drawn out and tedious, you end up just running round avoiding enemies, hitting them to remove tiny amounts of health until you finally wear them down. The game also keeps splitting up the party with most the boss fights being one on one, so once you find the character who suits you best you will still be forced to use the ones you hate.Another thing that aggravated me was the amount of retracing your steps you have to do if you want to complete the side missions. For example in the first village you arrive at the villagers talk about a ship wreck and it must have been the Amazon delivery ship because half the village was expecting something on the ship. So this seemed like an easy bunch of side missions, just head down to the beach collect all the flotsam and return. However it doesn't let you collect all the items at once you have to go back and forth to the beach 3 times and of course all the enemies respawn. There is a fast travel system but that is only unlocked so late into the game I had already lost all interest in doing anything that might prolong the game.The bit that finally got me to give up on the game was near the end you have to escort a character to safety and I had saved my game when this NPC had low health without realising that I could not use any of the many healing potions I had on her This meant that no matter what I did she immediately got killed in the next section of combat and I really couldn't be bothered to go back and try again from my last save point so I just looked up the ending on youTube.Other minor annoyances were as follows. The camera controls, moving the mouse up and down does not rotate the camera up and down as you would expect, this is really disconcerting at the start but I got used to it. The voice acting is terrible, it is like they thought it would give the characters more life if they had a wide range of voices but they just ended up with a bunch of terrible stereotype accents. There is no mouse cursor in the menus, this creates the weird control scheme of being able to select items with a mouse click but having to use the keyboard to navigate the menu. The pre-rendered videos are terrible quality, much worse than the gameplay.Credit where credit is due apart from the lack of cursor in the menus the PC port is actually decent. The visuals were pretty good, a little dated but still good. The story was entertaining too but not enough to make the game worth playing in my opinion.			"

But I did ask in another  post here if I am only one with these video issues but others said its happening to them .I miss out by one hour of a refund but I feel game issues should be refundable , because the rest of the game I seen sofar I really liked, like the collaration I like a game with voices and everyone you talk to in this game has voices ..But for now I think I will delete .

												I played this back when it first came out. I saw it on steam and thought ""Oh ya this game"" and bought it. Now I question old me's choices. There are a lot of good ideas presented in the game. It's seems like someone put a lot of effort into the lore of the world. Much of this world is lost in this games presentation. I would suspect that someone was putting a lot of effort into this game and then it was hurried out the door before it was totaly ready.The combat is clumsy and repetative, and feels like it uses a flaws in the combat system against the player. Voice acting is painful, and the animations are bad ever by early 2000's standards. In short it hasen't aged well because it wasn't that great to begin with.			"

												I mostly play offline, so my real playtime is something like three hours. More than enough for a solid first impression.What you have here is something as pointless as a skill-based combat RPG with no lock-on feature, sluggish, awkward controls, a protagonist who leaves huge openings in between his attacks and a dodge move that doesn't follow the camera direction. Top top the whole thing off, the game asks you to defeat large groups of enemies, rather than maneuvering around a few at a time. And if you fail, there is no guarantee the game will even let you return to town to buy healing potions so you can at least spam your way through the nonsense. That's playing with a controller, while the forums say K + M is even worse. It's not a coincidence that you haven't heard of this game before. There are indications a solid game is buried beneath the godawful control scheme somewhere, but I couldn't be bothered to dig it up. The best the fanbase can tell you is, ""stick with it"" and ""why would you need a lock-on?"". Stay away.			"

												I really , really want to like Sudeki and I will keep trying BUT the combat is just plain boring and uninspired. You'll quickly get tired of doing the same combos to beat the same enemies again and again.And once you unlock skill strikes its the same thing each battle. Cast a shield magic so you get 70% less damage , then cast a revive spell once your party's health gets too low. Luckily you can switch between characters and you basically have the choice between hack and slash and a first person shooter. Good news is the FPS portion is well made. Bad news is it does not fit with the rest of the gameplay and feels sluggish and grindy all the same. I have always hated games that need to switch perspective to work properly. I get that porting it was a bummer , and they havent even managed to make the camera work on the Y axis in third person . Maybe that's the reason they left it as is , I dont know. Anyway , the FPS part works ok , and is somewhat fun , it just does not fit with the overall pacing of the game. And once you get to the tougher enemies that can heal themselves faster than your slow firing weapons can produce a shot it just becomes a game of ""dodge and shoot for 15 minutes"" .  What really saves it though is the ""Lost Vikings"" aspect. After about a couple of hours you will unlock all the characters and the game will either suck you in or push you away. The four playable characters each have a unique skill that is required in solving some of Sudeki's not-so hard puzzles.			"

												I believe that at its core, this is a good game with an interesting story, but some of the basic elements I find mandatory for a good RPG game were just not present.I found that the world was well crafted, it looked nice for a game of this time period. This is where the game really shines, I really enjoyed the diverse and creative map design that this game features. The character design was also very nice, featuring unique and well crafted characters.The voice acting was a bonus for sure, but the dialogue overall did not feel at all natural, as if the dialogue was there only to quickly give you information relevant to the the story, delivering it in a way that felt forced.  It had no enjoyable feel to it. Although this did not affect the story in a large way, the player must 'translate' what came out of the dialogue and piece together the story which makes almost no sense at all until mid-game.I'm not sure if I was missing something, but the battles were not fun at all. There are areas in the world that spawn enemies, locking you in the battlefield until all the enemies are defeated. This was frustrating because there is no opportunity to escape from a battle, there is no way around battle zones and you must replay the battle even when passing through a battle zone you have previously defeated. The battle system itself was not bad, but battles seemed to take a very long time, especially once enemies started regaining health. As the game progressed, the battles got only slightly more difficult, while the length got unbearably long as you deal minuscule amounts of damage.The keyboard controls were terrible, making movement and battle very difficult. It is much, much better with a controller.Overall, even for the $6 this game costs, I cannot recommend it. "

Great! the battle system? Great! So, what's wrong with this game? the Balance!normally in a RPG the enemies are balanced out with your level or close to the level your at! not this game!Oh No! the incounters are Pre-Programmed into rooms so you re-enter into one because you took a wrong step? you fight them again! and they get harder every time regardless or not you leveled up and they Overstay their welcome!3.Boss Fights:Ok, this gets irritating.Normally in a RPG when you get ready to fight a big boss you overgrind or overpower yourself to fight the big baddieHere! you fight them One on One!, Mono-a-Mono, Hard? sometimes but still managable4.The Dungeons:By far the most annoying peice of Dog-Dung everthey are beautiful and big but ANNOYING AS ALL HELLlater on the game it gets ridiculous later on,and there is no way to leave other than litterally walking out the front doorso, if your low on Items,HP?

The fact that it is rated ""very positive"" overall also helped my decision, but I am honestly mystified as to how it managed to achieve that score.Some of the worst melee combat I have ever experienced in my entire video game life. Terrible.			"

												IT'S GOT TOM FREAKIN' BAKER IN IT!!!!!!Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing about it.  Here are just a few of the issues I've noted with this game.1.) The story is confusing.2.) The combat is unfair in a number of ways.      A.) You have 4 characters.  Two of them are melee fighters and control exactly the same. You have a combo meter, and can pull of combos through a series of heavy and light attacks.  To successfully make a combo, you must press your next button when the next circle in the meter is lit up.  Miss it, and your subsequent attacks are slow and clunky.  But sometimes, the circle lights up for a very short time, or not at all.  Your other two characters are ranged attackers and, again, control the same...i.e. HORRIBLY!  Even though the view is of a third person perspective in normal gameplay, during which your characters movement is perfectly natural and fine, when entering combat, you are forced into a first person view, and suddenly your character turns like a damn tank!     B.) There are no invincibility frames, so if enemies gang up on one of your characters and corner you, you'll probably lose health pretty damn fast.     C.) Enemies respawn too damn often.  Specifically, if enemies spawn in one portion of a particular area, and you defeat them, explore another portion of the same area, then return to the first portion, the enemies will respawn!  I can understand them doing this if you went to an entirely different area and came back, but not while you're in the same damn area!3.) Even putting my love for Doctor Who aside, the voice acting by anyone in this game not named Tom Baker is dry at best, but for the most part grating.4.) The camera can zoom in and out and adjust horizontally, but not vertically.5.) Your characters can not use magic abilities if you're not in combat, particularly annoying as one of your characters is a healer.6.) Speaking of healing, there's a 4-slot Quickslot system in the game.  You're supposed to be able to go into the menu, go to the item section, and highlight an item and assign it to a slot by pressing the corresponding button.  The only trouble is half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's easier to just press Y (on an XBox controller) during combat to find an item you want that way.If you're a fan of Doctor Who or of Tom Baker in general, this game might be worth looking at just to hear him in it, but other than that, I can find no redeeming features about this game.Please check out Gemini Does Games on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter!

												Not sure about it. Looked cool but cannot get it to run on my laptop under Windows 7. Plays the intro sequence then does nothing stuck on a black screen.Changing the C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sudeki settings of the Sudeki.exe file to run in win98/me compatability mode seems to do the trick, for me anyway. Will perhaps modify the review once I have played for a bit. But really most people have modern systems these days and if you are selling these older games they should be more accessible to play. So not criticising the game but rather steam for not sorting that issue out. Have no problems when purchasing old games from ites such as GOG.			"

												I remember playing this on Xbox and having a blast. Sudeki is a visually appealing game with fun side quests and an interesting story. The whole universe and the Tetsu mythos is pretty fascinating as well.The game works as a fantasy rpg with plenty of action. There's also a puzzle element involved. Talk to everyone and always look around; you could find something interesting.The first half, though, is superior to the second half. Sudeki's plot seems to have been rushed during/immediately after Transentia, and the final boss fight is a bit of a let down. It's still fun and definitely worth playing.			"

Bottom Line: Recommended for people that have played through many big name action RPGs and are still looking for more.Gameplay: 7/10Many common RPG elements can be found in Sudeki. Armour and weapon upgrades, leveling up, increasing stats, using special abilities. There are side quests in the game but they aren’t anything more than fetch quests which often result in mediocre rewards. The rest of the game, although it technically takes place in an open world, is mostly linear in terms of what you need to do next. Combat can be fun, however it can also be annoying sometimes when you try to pull off a combo, to find that your character was facing just to the side of the enemy and you start swinging at the air. The game also has full controller support and it works great.Story: 7/10For the first 70% of the game there is little to no story development. Then near the end the story comes together and it’s actually not that bad. Overall not that much happens in Sudeki story-wise, so if you’re only looking for a deep plot, you’ll need to find it somewhere else.Graphics: 7/10Given that this game was originally released on Xbox, the graphics are decent, and a noticeable effort was made to make the game look nice in HD. Although you probably won’t need a powerful PC to run this game, you still have a fair amount of graphics options to choose from.Audio: 6/10Every character has a heavy accent (from a different region of the world). The music is nothing special. "

												Definitely a nice game. Decent story and top tier visuals for it's time. You see MMOs with worse visuals than this in current modern day so these haven't aged THAT much. The style is semi cartoonish as well so there's no real need to go so intricate with graphics anyway. For those who have played this on XBox and are afraid of the ultra long load times this game had in that console, I'm glad to say those days are gone. The game has near no loading now. Also this game now has HD visuals so everything just looks prettier than you remembered. As sounds and voice go, the acting is average. Does the job but some characters sound less lively than others. My only gripe is that some cut scenes remained in low resolution. Mainly the very first intro to the game world, which would make players think the game is not HD. They used the in game engine to render them but they are still FMVs. An upgrade to these could have been nice, if possible. But it's minor in the end as many cut scenes are made non FMV.As for gameplay. This game is an action RPG with some first person shooter elements. See, you play (eventually) as four characters. Two use melee weapons, one uses staves that can shoot magic and the last one uses magic infused guns. In combat, you switch through these characters at will, switching from third to first person depending on the character. Your spells are done in bullet time, as the game slows down to almost a full stop. Your enemies are fast and relentless so you need to strategize with all four characters if you want to survive. Combat itself is medium paced for melee users. Reminds me a bit of Phantasy Star Online and it's three attack combos for melee characters. First person is pretty much as you'd expect. You aim and shoot and that feels good and evenly paced.The world is rather big for it's time and you have to run in the early levels to places that are rather far, yet there's no real loading times between most doors so the experience feels very open world. There's stuff laying about the world for you to check and interact with, and places with hidden treasure or screenshot worthy vistas. All in all running around the game world is an interesting experience.In the end, yes, I recommend this game. It's good, solid and you can sink a few hours in it. A great job of a game indeed.			"

												One of the best PC ports of an old console game I've ever played. Natively supports Xbox 360 controller, beautiful upscaled textures, and runs flawlessly right out the gate.An old favorite of mine from the original Xbox, this game was released just before Fable, but much lesser known.Gameplay is similar, but more of a traditional action RPG, with multiple characters fighting on the field at the same time.Some drawbacks are the slightly unresponsive controls, that make it difficult to properly defend against attacks, and the terrible AI for party members that are not in your control.Otherwise, a very solid, and often difficult game, that you can easily sink hours of time into.

												It truly is one of a kind... a ""JRPG"" made approachable for the West... Or was it the other way around? An original Xbox title that was meant to strengthen the gaming system mainly in Japan... (Pretty positive it was this one!)I was never big on Final Fantasy... yet I love Sudeki.I wanted to like the ""Tales of ..."" Series... But still just loved Sudeki.I even tried community favorites and hopefuls like ""Ys"" or ""The Legend of Heroes""... But there is nothing like Sudeki.Even over 10 years later... I am playing it via the Steam Link on my TV...Even tho there are a few visual glitches... But they are forgiven, as they never crashed the game for me... Yes, the voice acting is kind of terrible... But for some reason... I don't care! I lOVE SUDEKI - immensely! Because it is a (J)RPG and not a J(!)RPG. It is nostagic, somewhat romantic, and definitely a gew to own on steam! PS: I found out about Sudeki on the Fable Disc (which i also enjoyed back the) on my original Xbox way back when and awaited its release, just for story and atmosphere reasons... A lot of people recommend Fable as somewhat similar... And i just want to say: It's not!			"

Overall, I think it aged quite well, and its a fun game.			"

												One of the best PC ports of an old console game I've ever played. Natively supports Xbox 360 controller, beautiful upscaled textures, and runs flawlessly right out the gate.An old favorite of mine from the original Xbox, this game was released just before Fable, but much lesser known.Gameplay is similar, but more of a traditional action RPG, with multiple characters fighting on the field at the same time.Some drawbacks are the slightly unresponsive controls, that make it difficult to properly defend against attacks, and the terrible AI for party members that are not in your control.Otherwise, a very solid, and often difficult game, that you can easily sink hours of time into.

												Pros+ Graphics still look good for a game from 2004+ Dialogue is fully voiced+ Combat system is fun+ Story seems original+ Character design+ World design+ Can switch between multiple characters Cons- Alot of backtracking and traveling on foot- No auto saves, need to use save points throughout game- Music and voices can be irritating at times- Most of the voice acting is mediocre - Some cutscenes don't look very good- The character development could've been a bit more in depth / customizable* Overall the game has solid systems in place and is enjoyable to play. I would definitely pick it up for $6, especially if you are a big RPG or Fable fan.I will update with more info.			"

												This game was one of those guilty pleasures I enjoyed during my teenage years with the original xbox. It was as corny as hell, but it had its charms-none of which had anything at all to do with Buki's outfits...... >_>If you like your fantasy RPG's to be fanciful and colourful, Sudeki's got plenty of it. And with full HD support at 60 fps, there are few pre-DLC games of its type that can stand with it on steam. You've got unique gameplay elements, mixing hack n slash, and first person shooting with your RPG-all in real time!...that being said, it's a 10 year old game. And it shows. Though the artstyle holds the graphics up well, you can see its age through all those blurry textures. It's nothing a mod couldn't fix, but given that this is such a niche title, it's unlikely anyone would take an interest in it.And while the gameplay as a whole works, its individual elements fall short on their own. Melee combat feels sluggish. The timing of combination attacks is too slow, and too often you'll end up taking a pounding while waiting for the next button prompt. And that goes without mentioning the lack of a free dodge system which we all take for granted in today's games. Meanwhile first person shooting is hampered by your movement speed. The gameplay only seems to show its strength when you've got a full party of 4. Anyone goes missing(this will happen often), and you'll start to see the holes, resulting in difficulty sparks abroad.Finally, we gotta talk about that voice acting. It's not Chaos wars bad, but jesus christ guys. Let's look at our protagonists here. Tal sounds like he's trying too hard at being generic, Elco sounds like every European guy ever, Buki sounds much older than she looks, and then there's Ailish........ No words man. No words.Do I recommend it? Only to existing owners who appreciate its charm, and want that cheap trip down nostalgia lane.			"

												Amazing game. For what it is, this was one of my favorite games ever when i was a kid. I am so glad i found it on steam so i can play it again. Its probably one of those things where i hype it up cuz i have such fond memories of it, but so far i am not being dissapointed. Definite recomendation. Pretty linear, not open world or anything, but then again it is an older game and its to be expected. Good combat system.			"

												An old gem. I'm biased into loving this game as I played it as a teen on XBOX over a decade ago. I don't think it's aged exceptionally well, but if you adored the PS2 era J.R.P.Gs this might just win you over in 2015.Pros: Unique characters, charming story-telling, Good combat.Cons: A little on the short side. Few unlockable upgrades. Oddly placed items/secrets for collection.Personal score: 9/10Objective score? 7/10			"

												Had it on the original XBOX back in the day. This game has aged like mammas breast milk but, still drinkable! it's a fun game that has four different playable characters that you can swap on the fly. The plot isn't even as deep as a ♥♥♥♥♥s throat chamber but gets the job done. Four heros brought together to save the world, real ground breaking stuff I'm sure. There are two kinds of battle systems here, Melee combat thats a bit clunky. Kinda like you first car, but it's servicable. and the FPS combat that inspired Call of Dutys control scheme. Anyways each character has thier specail ability that you can use to help you on your way through Sudeki. Tal can push♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ailish can use magic but can not dress herself,Elco can fly using yellow kryptonite ,and Buki can Stirpe and climb on walls of moss (Very Exotic). If you have the RPG erection, for 5.99 this will satsify you for at least 15-20 hours!			"

												i am not really that much into RPG's.. when i take my time devloping my character, i sometimes get too connected to the proccess and feel like i can't really leave if im doing well. but this is one of the RPG's i've playd during my late childhood, and i don't regret a second of it. its challanging and charming. the graphics are good, the game mechanics works well and the story is intriguing with the best of plots and twists i've seen. it start outs pretty mundane, but the more you play, the more you get swallow'n into the depth of this game. im actually saving this game for a lp, but im not sure it will do that well on youtube. its more of a twitch game, where you gotta put your time into it and dont stress a moment. if you do, you're sure as hell is missing out on the game.it got its edges here and there, but i dont really remember what they were. they didn't bother me that much as a kid. except for the fact that the walking is sorta slow compared to the size of the map, i can't really say i remember anything else that was an annoyance. it is a great game and it really is worth checking out, specially if you're into RPG's.
