 This review is a bit old, and doesn't represent my writing skills accurately. I write honest, unbiased reviews for any game, as long as the game is provided. To contact me, email me at Cadereviews@gmail.com This games is amazing. Ill start with the cons, then lighten up with the pros-------------------------------------------------------------------~CONS~Ads pop up every 30-60 mins.Real-money purchase prices are stupid($17.50 for a flying mount and $7.50 for a ground mount) *to be fair, u can earn themAggrevating limits for non-All Access users, such as:^No General chat, your forced to use the newbie chat. This means you have to type /tellchannel newbie before every message; and no one ever uses this chat.^Some servers are off limits^Some purchases are off limits^Limited guild functions^Please reffer to the EQ2 membership web page for more info on All-Access.-------------------------------------------------------------------~PROS~Unlimited gameplay- I am never running around aimlessly, trying to find somthing to do. There is ALWAYS somthing to do.Amazing community- The community has helped me with the most newbiest of questions and, what seemed to me, the hardest dungeons around. Basiclly, all I had to do was say the word, and I had help :DBeutiful enviroment- The world of Norrath is amazing for its age(12) and every zone is always so much different than the last!Its basicly crack on a computer screen- Thats a good thing, right?Character creation- I was overwhelmed with all the choices and variations I had to choose from. I finally ended up making a bland ol' human assassin :3Crafting- The crafting is amazing. Its so in depth and well thought out. You just have to try it yourselfFree 2 Play- This isn't quite true.... If you get as hooked as I am, you will catch your hand reaching for your credit card without you even knowing it. Seriously, it is completely possible to enjoy this game with a F2P account.EDIT**Fixed minor errors, Rewrote all points due to having more experianceIf you find that this review is not helpful, please comment why, so that I can correct it based on your help. If it was helpful, however, please take the time to ""thumbs up""!EDIT 2**Just edited for a badge :3			"

												Not free to play. Cannot do much without subscription. And if you do get good gear while under subscription they take it away till you get a subscription again. So it is not free to play. Free to try out.			"

												Five years into playing this, I have yet to find another MMO that immerses me in quite the same way or has the variety of content for all playing styles.  I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.			"

												Everquest 2 remains a staple of MMO's in which it is a market dominated by new and better hype. In my opinion Everquest 2 is the underdog and a sleeper hit never at the forefront but also never to be underestimated. If WoW is not your type of MMO then I would reccomend Everquest 2 if only for completely different vibe then what is on the market today.			"

												If I would have written this review when EverQuest II went 'Free2Play' I would have NOT recommended you to play it, because SOE (now DayBreak BTW) had made the in-game cash shop a Pay2Win one and the 'free' game was extremely limited, almost forcing you to subscribe - even former subscribers had to ditch at least half their stuff to continue to pay for free!!!It's a good thing that SOE has learned and has lifted most of the restrictions of the game. Now as a free player you can enjoy almost every aspect of the game (aside from the best gear and the latest expansion) and walk around in a world that litterally lets you EVER QUEST (oh yeah, pun intended there).And that world is quite beautiful indeed. Every zone has it's own setting where you can pick up new quests and explore for hours to go. The only sad thing is that the zones are not directly linked, but you get a loading screen from zone to zone.Crafting in EQ2 is probably one of the best systems I've seen in any MMORPG. You can actually influence the quality of the outcome, or fail misserably. And when you're trying to make something that's real hard to fabricate, you can even be hurt during the process.In all, I thikn EQ2 is a pretty well done MMORPG. Sadly though, I'm a bit out of MMORPG lately but might pick up EQ2 at some later time again.			"

												Played EQ back in 98 for years and years. Many friends from all over the globe. Then EQ 2 came out. I had all the CDs to install when it first came out, retired from military, lost them all in the move, found the install on STEAM. Great game, the only issue is, not a lot of players like there used to be back in the day and now a days the game leans more towards instant lvling to keep playes interested. Its not hard to get a max level character.... *sigh* I miss the good ole days of months and months of playing to get high lvl and decent gear. Nows its all instant gratification. Still though, a very good game and lots of fun!			"

												Everquest 2 is in the same league as World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and even the new Final Fantasy MMO, but none of these other games are so evolved they’ve revolutionized the overall experience. This results in an overload of similar content presented through different layers of graphics, lore, classes, creatures and underlying support systems (such as crafting and raiding). Don’t get me wrong, many of the games have “unique perk features” (e.g. GW2 allows you to dodge attacks), but these perk features don’t qualify as bringing MMOGs to the next level of gaming experience.EQ2 trumps the competition when it comes to overall content, playability, many features and functionality; and in some cases far beyond the other games.1. Mercenary, which is like having another player with you, a single character can solo most of the dungeons and heroic areas/monsters of the game. This opens all players who use a mercenary up to the majority of the content without having to look for a group and rely on others to play.2. Alternate Advancement, a system that allows the player to decide what percentage (up to 100%) of their experience they want to go to this secondary point system, which opens some new skills.3. Quests, EQ2 has an unique balance of presentation for it's quests. The players can quickly and blindly click through things to move on through the next step whereas players who are heavy into a storyline/lore can interact and engage with the NPC. The rewards are also well designed and refined imo.4. Guild, EQ2's guild system brings their players together, sharing their accomplishments and keeping them connected better than any other MMO.  The guild system with automatic notifications toward the player's achievements, level gains, and finding valuable items. It also has a built in Voice Chat which works great. EQ2 has the best Guild system out of all mmo games. Period. EQ2's guild system also have the Guild Hall (home of the guild). No other mmo game comes remotely close afaik. "

												If you want an out dated, over saturated, played out MMORPG...look no further. Don't get me wrong, I've been playing EQ2 since 2006, and continued up until about 2015 only ever missing ONE expansion. There are A LOT of reasons to play this game...HOWEVER, there is one really big reason not to play this game. It's age, and let me clarify. Because of the age of the game, new players aren't really welcomed in. As a new player you won't find anyone to run relevant content, you won't find a fair and forgiving economy, you won't find a lot of help learning your class..Also, most of the content has been obsoleted. Quest lines, and loot from lower level dungeons, both give useless loot, and little to no reason to waste your time. The community and player base consists mostly of quiet and solo players, OR, trolls and abusive arrogant jerks. The quiet solo players keep to themselves and run the markets, whereas the pompous players tend to get carried through content based on popularity. If you can't solo, and you don't make a name for yourself, there is a chance you'll spend a lot of time alone.Overall, there is a lot of fun to be had, but if you go in expecting a fulfilling and social experience, you'll be disappointed. At this time, just based on the games age, the lack of a welcoming comittee (bad community), irrelevant content, over inflated market, and the cash shop (which does offer some very slight pay to win features), I can't recommend this game. It had it's day, perhaps 5 years ago, I'd give a different review, but the game is and has been on a decline.			"

												EverQuest II.............AMAZING, when most people think time sinking in a videogame the first game to come to alot of peoples mind is skyrim, but I disagree heavily, even though skyrim is great. I've been playing the game for about 1 and a half years (a bit more then that actually) but I can safely say the 2000+ hours I spent on it have been amazing. Great community, great gameplay and although the graphics aren't godly they are still pretty good. There is no P2W in this game the closest things are the heroic characters. You buy them at level 90 (originally lvl 85) and they get good armor for the levels. But then you realize the gear you get from raids and Tradeskillers and hell even quests are better. There are no special bonuses on the heroic characters. Now going back to the great community, there are a bunch of servers you can play on. I personally go on antonia bayle (great server) and let me tell you this. If you are friendly to the people and don't use them you can ask just about any of the crafters to see if they can make you some equipment and they will happily oblige. Another great thing about EQ II is the housing system, each character (refered to as toons in most communities) can have upwards of 20 player homes and let me tell you this the player homes don't feel like a hassel to decorate and it is honestly one of my favorite things to do. Would I say EQ II is perfect, no. No mmorpg is perfect EQ2 has it's flaws namely some of the animations are a bit off, and the lack of a playable wolf man (similar to the worgen in WoW) is an annoyance but overall the game is great, the music oh don't even get me started on how great the music is. Long story short if you are a fun of RP and MMOs EQ2 is a great choice and if you want to get into MMORPGs EQ 2 is a great place to start. I give the game a 8.5/10 if they fixed the animations then it would easily be a 9.5 or even 10 out of 10. I give this game the thumbs up, so come join in on the fun and be absorbed into the world of Norrath.			"

												Note: Going to update and make a very long detailed review of this game since I played it off and on for ten years since launch until 2014. Right now a bit too lazy to do it. To sum this all up for now: During moments of its lifespan, it was very underrated, did things other games both in the MMO genre and outside didn't do at the time and never had its true potential released due to multiple reasons such as unoptimized engine with severe limitations and SoE not knowing how to do PR and turning everyone away from their products any chance they got before they could experience the depth of the game (Smedley Disease). The game went through many literations in terms of gameplay over the past 12 years and if it was possible, I would probably write six different reviews for each 2 years because that's how much SoE changed things up. And for the most part, it holds a special place in my heart, especially during 07-08 during the RoK and TSO expansions. But when SoE became DBG and was sold off to some suspicious Russian company, it was the sign that it was high time for me to leave. Quality of the gameplay was slowly degrading since Destiny of Velious in 2011, but really ramped up with Chains of Eternity in 2012. Tears of Veeshan in 2013 had some decent content but quantity lowered. And by the time Alter of Malice came out in 2014 the game already hacked off over half its employees for the EQ2 team alone and by the time DBG downsized, they further reduced the size of the team. Which is a true shame since the engine EQ2 was using got easier to use and more optimized thus the artwork and overall unique visuals and environments got drastically better with each expansion.SoE was losing employees left and right for the last 5 years and the EQNext expedition turned out to be a ten year vaporware failure. If you really want to know how ♥♥♥♥ed up it became, just go to glassdoor.com and read the Sony Online Entertainment Reviews. Anyways, dev team is now under a very suspicious Russian company with no real connection to the game industry outside of buying the Rock Band franchise several. The game, and perhaps the franchise is kill. Good job Smed, you wasted years and years of potential for this franchise out of your own self interests and incompetence. Maybe you should have done a mix of singleplayer games to garner interests along with not relying 100% on the MMO genre that has since been on the decline and interests of consumers.At this point, no, I wouldn't recommend it, the game is on the verge of death. The only people who play it are the ones who don't wish to give up on a decade worth of investment and the F2P microtransaction model has gotten each more dirtier with the Russian Company incharge of DBG.

												I'll be honest, to me, EverQuest II really enhances the feel that rather than a game it's a world. While you can follow the quest line and get pretty high soloing, the game in my own opinion is more fun just running around with a group killing camps and dungeons.I've gotta say, right now, in comparison to other MMORPGs, this game's graphics are very nice. I've always loved that feeling of such darkness in some places in Norrath, and such light in others. Personally, it's worked charms on me. I love the style.You may be thinking 'this guy has spent tons of money on this game', but really, I haven't spent a dime on EverQuest II, though it definitely deserves it. With tons of races and classes, this game reaches maximum variety of choices. It has many little features that are cool like SOEmote with face tracking, now it has voice chat for groups/guilds, and it's graphics are stunning for a modern MMORPG.Also, I thought I should mention... There. Is. A. Ton. Of. Content.I play this with a few friends, so I suggest doing the same if you can!			"

												As a fan of this series, I will try to be as partial as I can. Everquest 2 is hands down one of the best MMO's out right now. The ability to create everything about your character, quests, the player community is all great. Development Staff try their hardest to fix bugs within hours of being reported. Sadly, there is no more PvP unless your a paid member, but the experience and friends I have had while playing Everquest 2 outweigh all the cons, which are very few. One of them is that if you put in a support ticket, it can take up to a week for a response. One pro is the new expansion: Terrors of Thalumbra, that went live last month. This content actually requires strategy, teamwork, and a lot of thinking to be done. And this game is friendly to everyone. Solo, Grouping, or Raiding, this game has it all.			"

												Contrary to my steam play time I have well over 1,000hrs invested in EQ2 with my 3 endgame characters. This was by far the most fun I've ever had in a generic style MMORPG. I did play WoW for a while but the graphical style of WoW and the over simplified skill system kinda bored me to death.Everquest utilizes an in depth skill system that requires you think before using points in a particular tree. Granted classes are not really open like in some of the new MMOS but the class itself has a lot of customization.Example: A wizard has class restrictions forbidding the use of heavy armor and a variety of weapons. But it allows a rounded out skill selection including element proficiency and damage/debuff modifiers.All in all I strongly recommend this game for any and all MMO players. F2Players are not restricted like in many other F2Play games. Level cap is 85 and the auctionhouse requires F2Play auction tickets to use otherwise buying the All access pass makes most everything free besides Expansion stuff.			"

												While the graphics, combat, and numerous other updates from original EQ are better, the multitude of advertisements, and limitations of the free player are too great of a hindrance to enjoy the game.I understand that Sony wants to make money on the game but I am more inclined to buy from a company that doesn't consistantly annoy me to do so. The limitations make the game seem more of a ""pay to win"" instead of a ""free to play"".I have always supported Sony, but I have to draw the line on EQ2. Then I downloaded EQ and found the same, so I don't recommend this series anymore like I used to. "

												I started playing Everquest (1) right after the Velious expansion, and transitioned over to Everquest 2 when I received a beta invite.  I stopped playing the game right after the Age of Discovery expansion was released in December 2011.In the first few years, the game was addictive and time consumining and had a lot to see and do.  The story line and side quests were interesting and faily immersive.  All this was great for a single guy with loads of time on his hands.Fast foward to the F2P changes, and the game started to lose my interest.  I preferred a subscription based experience versus the micro transactions.  I had to pay to unlock gear I had already obtained amongst other things. Content seemed to get boring - doing the same mundane tasks over and over again.  I didn't care for the grind and was never an end game type of player.  I liked playing for the feeling of accomplishment and exploring.The game started feeling more like a SIMs type game with all the interior decorating and appearance items.  Ignoring all this, the game wasn't too bad. I did enjoy displaying trophies and artifacts, but it started getting repetitive after a while.As a side note, the card game Legends of Norrath is very interesting and fun to play.  It does allow for you to get ingame items for either EQ or EQ2.  I have found though that I enjoy Hearthstone much better, and I have never been a WoW fan.I do not know the state of the game as of this writing, but based on my experiences, I would say the game is worth trying as it is ""Free"", but do expect to spend a lot of time, and money now due to F2P, to really get a lot out of the game.  I loved the time spent playing this game and would even go so far as to say my friends would have considered me an EQ fan boy. Having said that, I would not recommend the game due to the changes made over the years.  I feel the original vision of the game was abandoned.			"

												 Well I once played Everquest 2 before about maybe a few years ago before it went F2P, but now have came back and see there is quite a bit more now that I recall. Personaly I do not have the newer expansion for it so I have one AA tab locked and prestege trade skills locked, but so far I do plan on getting the expansion, as well as paying for the dungeon maker. While if your a F2P or silver tier modle the restrictions now seem way less then they used to be before. I have not personaly gotten to far yet in my replay though starting off again ( used to go evil side but this time went good side ) as I am just taking my time to play the game how I feel I want to play it. Also on a good note the cashshop is not what I would call game breaking either, plus there are people who buy tokens and sale them on the auction house broker that when used will grant the person using it thier account to have 30 days gold membership, so far those prices though range from 1000 plat  or higher  depending on what server your on. So I personaly feel its a well worth game to try and see if you like, you never know maybe its the game you want to stick with.			"

												Wanted to get into the game and get my old account back after years without playing, but the customer service is like talking to a brick wall. They said it was my fault that my account was accessed after I hadn't been playing for years although I was overseas without internet access. I didn't have the info to my old account because it was changed, so they kept replying saying no it was the wrong info, try again. Customer service was bad when SOE was in charge, Daybreak seems just as terrible.			"

												This is a very well made game.  For those of you that come from World of Warcraft(WoW), it has some of the same qualities; raids, PvP, and Guilds.  The one thing that surpasses WoW is its races and styles to choose from.  It has more the blah 4 or 5 races on each side to choose from and the basic 5 styles to play.  It has three sections to pick from as well instead of horde or alliance.  It has your three basic Dungeon and Dragon alliances, chaotic good, neutral or evil.  Within those there are a variety of races to pick from each with their own speciality, but not restrictions, so pick away the style you want.  After that the 5 basic styles are there but each has 2-3 sub-styles to choose from.  So just from the start you can build you hero/villian any way you want that would fit your way of play.  The Advanced GUI Experience: The next big thing is the GUI format.  It has way ahead of WoW, you can move everything want for starters, putting things where you would like them.  A big plus for this is towards us druids and spellcaster alike.  You can not only move the hotbars around, you can also scale them.  For example you can make them nice and big if you only have a few spells, or when you get into the game and I am only talking about level 20(when you can start doing raids/dungeons[the only downfall I see from WoW where you can raid anytime you like at any level]) you can make them soo small that you casn have 5 hotbars and they barley take up any room on the screen(like WoW were when you get into a raid you can barley see what is going on, only a variety of colorful hotbars covering your screen[this is without any mods of course]).  Another nice factor that blow WoW out of the water is the ease of editing your hotbar.  You no longer have to delete the whole hotbar in order to make your own.  You have two choices; 1. you have to right-click the spell to get rid and click delete or if you are just replacing one spell then drag and drop your spell of choice from the spell menu and drop it on the one you want to replace. 2.  You can choose a setting that lets you slide the spells around freely whenever you like.  So now you can just click-hold and drag the spell to a new slot and if a spell is there that one is now automatically grapped to be placed anywhere and soo on.  It does like WoW have a local hotbar delete all button.(just to point out, each hotbar has its own settings, so though one might be small the next one on the screen will be big.  after making one however, every new hotbar you make from here on out will be the size of the last one you have.  Now this is just the GUI.  Now the real game begins.Basic Leveling and The Amazing Skill Choices:So like any other MMO you do you missions, grinding out farm kills, etc.  The interesting point to this pre-level edit.  So when you go to choose the passive skills and all that good stuff, you notice a dropdown box in the right hand corner.  It already has 3 pre-made settings; solo, PvP, and Group(raids/dungeons).  Now those are for those purposes only and are role specific.  For example, if you pick a druid-substyle-fury, you will have three styles of play, healer, tank and dps.  It is a good for being stable during solo play, which is mainly dps and healer for the most part.  But in group it will mostly go go down healer with some tanking. If you go PvP mostly DPS with basic healing and tanking to just be sustainable. Surpise though, you can make your 3 custom slots as well.  When you do this it will give you the MAX amount of points that you will get.  These points however are seperate to your normal leveling.  They are points you get every so often(I will be honest forgot the exact name but when you look at the bar with your experience recieved and to go, the button on the right will have three different options and one shows the bar for these attribute points) and are used for your tree build, spell specific passives, your trade skill, etc.  You will start off with 321 and you can either use the points you think you have or just use them all.  Now caution be warned, the order you put those points in will be the order they are used when you are leveling. So try to think what you will need. But don't worry if you do not like what you have then just go back and restart from the point you think it all went wrong.  But another caution, some of these come with extra spells, so if you do not go down the path of before then you will loose that spell but it will yet remain on you hotbar.(the only bad thing I saw when it came to leveling and the hotbar spells. Going on, you will notice that when you pick these points you have 4 choices at the top of the window, these is for your subclass, spell specific passives and one that the DLC is needed.(btw the premades use the DLC but they are not added to you sooo keep an eye out on that because you will be wasting points early on)Then you also have choices along the side and each one of these has its own points to use and will also be given when you level in that category, so remember to harvest, gather etc so you get points for that.  Now basic levling will come with its own set of spells, but it also has passives, this is your basic leveling again. Every so often you get a point to use for you character specific passives(usually is every 9 for some. every 10 for others(total of 10 for 9 and 9 for 10.) And these are usefull so check them out before hand to see if they will work with the skill points you have chosen.Now the rest is up to you.  Go out and game, level, join up with others and farm away.  The game in itself is a great game.  It has great grpahics and you can zoom in and out of first person(think of skyrim).  If you are a fan of WoW then you will love this game.  It is free-2-play(outside of that you can choose silver member for $5 and get two more character slots plus can use expert level spells and make your own guild or your basic WoW charge for 2 more slots, Master level spells, and more) But really it is not needed.  You might only have 2 slots for character off the bat, but $5 for 2 more and expert level skills and make your own guild(you can join any guild however without having to pay anything.)you can not go wrong.  I will say it is fine with out going silver.  You have everything you need if you are just someone who makes one character and just plays the crap out of it.  While you are playing go into the settings and write a Bio of your character(has a limit) and let people know who you are, how you play, and what you wish to attain.  So go live it up!! Make your character now and get started, and it is all for free, how can you go wrong?!			"

												Everquest 2 is the biggest mmo ever made to date. The amount of content in this game is overwhelming. You can play for many, many hundreds of hours and barely scratch the surface of all the different things that you can do, see and achieve.Of course there is the straght-line play, go from lvl 1 to 100 as fast as possible then do raids for great gear and accumulate riches that will allow you to play as a subscriber without paying real money, thats a perfectly viable playstyle, but there is an ocean of content that you will miss. In this game, it is worthwhile to visit all zones, levels and content during any time and level of your character. The whole world is being put to use, not just a small percentage as you level or when you reach max level.There is a lot of easily available filler content, mostly aimed for fast leveling or casual fast play, but there are also tons of hidden stuff and elaborate quests for the players that are more curious .. for players that can stop dead in their tracks, and just take one moment to look around them. Players who like exploring and investing more effort into straying off quest lines or not simply just power level.More often than not, the rewards for pursuing some of the strange questlines found in remote areas are quite surprising and with such an immense, ambient sprawl of activities to do from the moment you start and all the way up to max level - is to me what an ""MMO"" or ""Open World"" should be.Indeed, not only is the game very lengthy but also, broad. Playing Everquest 2 is like getting lost in a jungle. No matter where you decide to go and what you decide to do, you will find adventure....or adventure will find you as the case may be.This game offers lots of content for every taste.You want to solo from start to finish and still get great gear and do dungeons? No problem, game offers plenty of ways to do just that.You like direction and hand-holding, gps quests and casual stuff? Lots of that in the game.You like to break your head with difficult quests that require some inquisitive thinking, time and dedication? Unforgiving challenges that makes the rewards all the more worthwhile? Hundreds of hours worth of this kind of content.You like crafting? You'll be overwhelmed, crafting is insane in this game, its more content in the EQ2 crafting sphere alone than in the whole worlds of other mmos and depending on your attentiveness while crafting - the quality of the product and outcome will reflect in your performances. For instance, if you fail to flatten a bubble in the iron of a blade or miss out on cooling it in time, the blade may turn out Crude in quality.The character progression and roleplaying features has no equal. Just the alternate achievement skill-trees alone are way and beyond the whole progression system of other games. You decide how you divide the experience gained between the character leveling and the AA (alternate achievement) level, which works like talent points. There are over 400 talents and lots of trees to work out as you go. Personally i like to channel all the exp into AA, that way i get quite overpowered at low levels, which for me is quite satisfying. For instance you can be a very powerful level 20 with lots of talents, who can tackle higher levels simply because your character is much more trained than a higher level might be. There are many parameters to your characters. Skills has to be trained to perfect techniques ect. Speaking of talents though, there are different talent trees in every class too and you can earn talents from all kinds of directions, from solving puzzles to simply exploring.This game was never very appealing to the younger players, nor to the ones that only come to talk random stuff in world chat or expect the game to be like most other mmo out there, as is the case in other mmo that are different from the typical themepark mmo.As a result the game seems quiet and tranquil, which for me is a good thing. I dont need a lot of players jumping around aimlessly in the start areas and talking smack ( i call them cheerleaders because thats what they really do in these games). Sadly there are a lot of players who need these cheerleaders to consider the game as being ""alive"" and not ""dead"", or every mmo game in existence to run the exact same way Wildstar or World of Warcraft does - many whom i assume has rated this video game as Negative on Steam.There is a lot of poison thrown around on the internet regarding this game, many of whom I have opened conversation with only to discover they know not what they talk about or have even played the game to any extent at all.There are a lot of big and hyped features being released in the more popular mmo titles today, that have existed in this game since the very beginning .. it is a shame because many players will miss out one of the most underrated, best mmos ever made, way ahead of it's time and definitely the biggest one yet.- Scrawny old veteran since 2005.

												Played this game since beta my actual playtime sadly is over 400 days.  Clearly I like the game if I've put that much time into it.  Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase some in game currency and was prompted through the steam site.  This was the first time I've tried to add funds via steam and nearly fell out of my desk when they wanted to charge me a $10 tax to my $20 purchase.  Went through the site where I've always gone and it was a $1.65.I've always enjoyed the game some expansion less than others but there is a million things to do and other than equipment and spell restrictions you can experience a great deal of it and not feel burned by free to play.  Not a pay to win game where you can purchase items on the market it's mainly for appearance items and xp boosters.  If you decide to play and end up liking it enough that you put some money in, don't ever go through steam for it.			"

												Daybreak, is like EA, but they are QUICKLY killing all of their IPs. They are the cancer of the gaming industry. They buy one of the greatest game series ever created, and run it into the ground. This game use to be divine, like its parent Everquest 1. When I heard that Everquest Next was cancelled due to it ""Not Being Fun"" I knew that this game had died too. So I decided to come back and try it out. Wow what a money grab, with crap expansions, lack of content, and horrible polish. Dont come back for the memories, you will just sour them. RIP Everquest, you will be missed.			"

												I missed the EQ phase so I decided to start my own adventure and I'm glad I did. Pros ++ Tons of classes.+ Tons of races.+ Tons of things to do! ( And I mean a ton of things. )+ The revamped graphics are nice enough for me to overlook the dated terrain. + Playing with friends is hella fun. + Leveling is rewarding. Cons - - Dated sound. - Playing with friends can be challenging to keep everyone on the same level. - HOLY OVERWHELMING SETTINGS OPTIONS. ( This could be a plus but I found it to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ for me being a new player and trying to learn the game and fight every little setting that normally is just default. )- Cash shop sells classes... also sells a races. ( I can deal with this... )Additional information:They have a try before you buy option to see if you like a class at level 95, this should be in more games but not as a try before you buy but a try before you spend a ♥♥♥♥ ton of your life leveling. Also, the look of the game and the sound of the game are something that I personally can overlook just because they are good enough for me but some people maybe not, I strongly suggest playing f2p first before investing any money in the game also making sure the visual settings are set to extreme will help with the eye sore.

												While the glory days are behind this game. It's still a solid game to take for a spin.Graphics are definitely dated, but this game is a perfect example of why that doesn't always matter. There is content...and after that MORE CONTENT.Difficulty has been scaled back, which some might find appealing while other's will be immediately be turned off. I personally, find it appealing. I grew up in the era of ""sit on a spawn for hours"", but I'm older now. I have other things I can do (either by choice or by necessity).Final Verdict:Game's still fun to hop in and play a bit. But it'll leave you a bit sad if you know the history, knowing you missed out on a truly exciting time in the Gaming Industry with this new genre called 'MMORPG'; now it's a common sight....so, come, come play a bit of history -- In the world of Norrath.

This was the only game I played where the community was nothing but wonderful. I miss my old guild, Riders of The Dawn, of the Everfrost server. If you're contemplating on whether or not you should play this game, do it! Just try it, give it at least 15-20 hours before you make a decision, imo. I don't know what Daybreak Games have done to the game so I have nothing to say about them and the state of the game of this time.			"

												I have been a player of this game for over 6 years, I love it very dearly. I grew up on it and put thousands of hours on it (not on steam) playing. The game has been in decline for the past few years and then Sony gave up SOE to Daybreak so that Sony could go on to their ""mobile"" agenda since their MMO division was no longer a strategic asset for them.

Only problem coming back is that now my level 90 character is virtually unusable since his tier gear is locked for Premium players. While that has personally driven me to try other MMO's, EQ2 remains a fantastic MMO with a rich world and, at least when I played it, solid mechanics. I highly reccomend it.			"

There have been much changes, some good, some not so good, but I really like the nifty features such as mount appearance change, mercenaries etc. As a fan of good lore and storyline, the signature quests also made me glued to my PC just like some Game of Trones or Netflix Fan. The only difference is that, I am an Everquest2 Fan.

												A decent MMORPG. It's pretty much the first RPG I ever played, and I've been playing it since 2006. It's gameplay is kinda like WoW's, although it wasn't always that way. The graphics have a more ""realistic"" look as opposed to WoW's stylization, giving the game a bit more of an aged look. The combat system is what you'd expect from an '04 MMO: button clicking and cooldown timer watching. Population has declined greatly from when I first started playing, but with the ever-improving F2P model numbers are slowly rising again.That being said, what, aside from my nostalgia, makes me like this game? It has a TES-like amount of lore and backstory, interesting world design, great music, an engaging active story, interesting quest timelines (although it also has a lot of ""kill 10 rats"" type stuff), and a large amount of character customization, with 20 races, 32 classes, and an Alternate Advancement tree that allows you to further refine your stats and abilities. To the experienced MMO player this game seems a little generic, but if you've never played an MMO before this one is a pretty good one to begin with.			"

												I used to play this game and loved it.  But time got tight and I could not spend the time on it.  With the new expansion release I thought I would check it out.  I last played when the level cap was 90.  So I figured I would level a little bit before I put the money down an the expansion before I determined I liked it.  They also had a ""winback"" promotion which gave me 15 days of supporter status or whatever they call it.I went to log in, and it said the server could not find my character, even though it was on the character select screen.  I assumed the server just needed time to load.  I tried several times over the course of a few hours and no luck.  I then file a petition for help.It took three and a half days for a response!!!!  20% of the time they were offering to win me back.The response was ""The character has been removed.""My response was (internally) ""Wtf does that mean.  Did they decide to delete my character?""I asked ""What does that mean? And do I get back any of the time lost""They replied ""Response Daybreak Games Support via Email 11/25/2015 03:38 PMThe character was left logged out in Champion's Respite. This is never good idea; especially with a server merge.The character was removed and is now accessible. You do not get any time back.Good to know it is my fault that I could not log back in because I did not crystal ball a server merge and it is my fault I could not log him in therefor I will not get the time back.They have definitely not won me back.  Also someone needs to train the CS team the difference between the words moved and removed.

												I will rate this positive, though not for everyone.Being an old player of a great game I very much enjoyed called: ""Ever Quest Online Adventures"" for the ps2, I wanted to experience what this game had to offer. ""free to play"" is the title's advertisement, so lets get into the review on my free experience. The Pro's:-Character creation, very in-depth, and allows for a near level cap character for ""testing"" what the class can do later, so if you are not sure how the class plays, making a leveled up character first, will allow you to see the abilities the class will get and better evaluate it's role. (for a limited time) the character creation also rivals other MMORPG games of today's standards.-Questing, the quests you will experience are quite fun, and really immerse you into the game quite well. (a few early in the game fail at role play due to a slight hint at tutorial type info). Questing will generally provide useful rewards to keep you out of market place well enough.-Community, a HUGE plus for me was the community. It is full of people who have been a part of Ever Quest for a very long time, as well as people interested in beginning their journey. Veterans are often a pleasure to run into, as well as provide very useful tips or even old bags they don't need, which can help you greatly. especially in free account status.-Parties!, when you hit a certain level you will be able to que for groups with other people seeking, in order to either quest, or farm gear. The people in que, will get put into a pool and level's will be balanced out, and the dungeon run will be made to fit the groups' party, which seems to work...? if anything you might get a crazy tank that can basically solo everything and is just bringing you along..Now for Con's of free membership:-Market place, The biggest problem by FAR on free membership is the auction system. you CANNOT buy or sell items at all as a free member, unless you pay 5 USD for 10 tokens. which means 50 cents per auction or market transaction! ...damn.. that right there will force you to pay the membership fee at some point. -Chat system, in theory, people could do what we used to do in EQOA before the game ever had an auction system.. shout in a main city that you're selling, or buying things! I miss those days... kind of... but here? Nope.. not if you are a free member. The chat channels are only visible to you as a free member.. you cannot use them.. but you can however send tells, or use guild/party etc. but not general, not auction, I failed to attempt the LFG channel, due to the LFG system.-Housing system, while I consider the housing system to be one of the best features of the game, free to play users seem to get shafted pretty hard, but not game breaking. The housing system is great! You can decorate it, get huge houses, or small ones.. multiple ones.. etc. you can even open it to the public and sell things out of it! there is a lot of fun to be had in housing. However, I do not think free players can utilize a lot of the housing system's features. Such as selling from it.-Character limits and limitations, there are 2 races, and 2 classes that are not available until you purchase them. There is also a character limit of 2 characters for free membership these limitations may not effect you much, but is worth noting.Other things to note:I really did enjoy my experience here. I wish the market place was available, but I understand the income side of the game, (doesn't mean I need to agree with it!) and to be fair, you can progress quite far without it. The game is old... 2004 old I believe.. and while our computers have definitely increased in ability, it would seem the game has a very bad graphic coding issue. I have quite a powerful machine, capable of running every game I have on maximum settings at 60+ fps (cept...GTA V.. that one is kind of crazy..) but this game.. suggestion from me to you is to use the preset options. When I set them at their maximum (which I believe said ""No machine can run these settings, experimental.*"" sense 2004) I run smoothest, but I still get stutter issues in heavy areas. Seems like rendering or processing just takes a dump... but if I set things to max on my own, I run into lighting and shading issues.. as well as sum funky effects from weapons.. anyway.. Great fun for an old game, but a temporary game for a free member, and for the size of the game you are about to download, for temporary enjoyment.. well.. YMMV			"

												If you want a true MMO game that's heavy on lore and exploration this game is for you.  Character appearance customization is a bit basic, but your class customization / specializations are insanely detailed.  Crafting is easy to pick up and actually pretty enjoyable as well.While they have dumbed the game down substantially from it's launch years due to WoW making MMOs easy mode, there's still quite a bit of challenge in solo, group, and raid content.

												This is just one of the best MMORPGs out there, but in today's age, she's a hidden gem. Alas, the ole girl' is getting some revival with the Time Locked servers. Enjoy EQ2 in all it's glory as it was on release (for the most part). Yes you're limited unless you P2P, but it's 100% worth it. Steam lists me as having about 120 hours, but my account is over 2,000 days old. If you're looking for a fun, complex and mature MMO...look no further.			"

												The game itself is decent.  I can not speak for the free-to-play portions as my account is automatically silver-level from years ago when I paid to play.  I can say that currently, the silver level account has far less content barriers than it did when they first went free-to-play.  Can now equip Legendary armor and weapons and I can choose from any of the original EQ2 classes/races without paying extra for them.  You can also create one character or upgrade an existing character to level 85.  If you want more automatic level 85's, you'll need to pay for those.Since I've only soloed during this free-to-play era, I will say the combat is functional, but obviously dated.   The housing system is just as good as when it was pay-to-play.  All ground-mounts are now 120% runspeed and you'll get a basic horse mount around level 15-20.  Harvesting components for crafting is easier now as you can now harvest anything you want and the only reason to skill it up is so you can have a chance at harvesting a rare component.So what's the reason I don't recommend this game?  Hardware performance.  It's just as bad as it's ever been and better hardware will barely make a difference at all.  This game is very much CPU intensive as it's engine was originally built with single-core CPU's in mind and was created with the belief that CPU's would just become faster and faster as time went on.   Over the years, they've added multi-core support (a very poorly implemented 2 core utilization only) and GPU shadows (that were never fully optimized in my opinion).While I would recommend it to those who played it years back and want to do some soloing down memory lane, I can not recommend this to anyone new to the game.

												Everquest 2 was an attempt to bring Everquest into the future, it changed alot of things about the series but still kept that Everquest flavor, sadly its release was overshadowed by more popular MMO releases at the time and the changes the game brought where not always welcome by Everquest fans. This fact however takes nothing away from the game, and is an entry into the Everquest series that you should try anyway.Everquest 2 is my favorite Everquest to date, and  there is even hope for the future still that Everquest can be rise back to popularity with the release of Everquest Next (eq3) and Landmark sometime in the near future!Edit: Lots of edits.

												This game is literally virtual crack. If it were a real life drug then it would be cocaine mixed with a climax. I started my addiction with EQ back in 1999. I try to get off of it, I really do. But the game is too alluring for me... it always pulls me back in. I always want more, regardless of how crappy the newest expansion may seem or if the population slowly withers. My Steam hours are not my only logged hours on this game. I have been playing on and off since launch, and can guarantee my overall play time is well over 2,000 hours when the game was stand alone. This is the best time to play if you're wanting to try out a new MMO. As of mid-to-late 2015, they released a progression server for this game. What is that you might ask? Well, they made the game classic again, with no expansions added to the server unless the entire community agrees to add the next one in. How amazing is that?! You get to play the game like it just came out, and get to experience everything fresh with everybody else. Classic EQ2 was unforgiving as ♥♥♥♥, and I encourage that. Give it a try if you like being addicted to things.			"

												One of the greatest MMOs ever created. The only negatives are that it came out alongside WoW and thus didn't get the following it deserved, and more recently that Daybreak has the opportunity to further bury the game more and more.Beyond those issues, you can't go wrong with this game. It is incredibly fun, the lore is so deep and immensely interesting, it's immersive, there are more features, zones, dungeons, quests, collections, achievments, etc than you'll know what to do with, and there isn't a single class of the 26 total that isn't fun.I will play this game for the rest of its life.

												I have many thousands of hours more in this game than is on my Steam record, and I have played a wide variety of other MMORPGs including WoW, Rift, AoC, Eve, LOTRO and TESO.  None of which are a patch on EQ2 (LOTRO does come close though).I have been playing since 2004 (a month after release) and had 3 years out in 2010 due to work, so I have seen the game evolution, the server merges and all the other schizzle that has been going down over the course of its life.You will have read about the gameplay in many other reviews so I wont duplicate what has already been written except to say a few things:- Free to play is ok to try out, but dont judge the game from a F2P perspective.  I agree with other reviewers that to take the game seriously you will need to subscribe.  For the price of a couple of pints a month though, it is worth it in my mind.- Join a guild as soon as you can.  You will not get the same out of the game if you dont.  The guild system is player based, easy to follow and use and can help a new player enormously.  Look for guilds which have a reputation for helping new players. - To compare EQ2 to WoW (and I have played both), EQ2 is a much more grown up world.  The people are friendlier, more helpful and more adult.  The Negatives:- Some of the best zones are in the lower levels which, after this amount of time, are empty.  There are mercenaries available and the levelling system is much quicker than it used to be so getting to level cap is not so much of a slog.  With agnostic dungeons being available now for lower level characters to run with other higher level characters (all player levels are ""normalised"") there is opportunity for lower levels to experience groups and dungeons.- The game, at high end, can be a bit ""rinse and repeat"".  Running the same dungeons over and over to get the good gear.  Raids and levelling new characters mixes things up a bit though.There are many, many more things going on in this game (its HUGE!!!) than any one person can write in a review like this.  This is the game I keep coming back to having tried a lot of the other MMOs that are out there and if you like the genre, you will like this.			"

												Ah Everquest, my first true MMO love; even tho I was a consistent Ultima Online player until 1999 when EQ graced my screen. The EQ universe was my home for the next 6 years, shared only with what I consider another great MMO, Dark Age of Camelot. It wasn't until 2005 and I peeled myself away from those games to embark on a new journey in Everquest 2. I will admit, the first couple of years were very hard on EQ2. The steep computer requirements, the very hard game-play and the rise of a much lighter MMO in World of Warcraft created a challenging future for Everquest 2. Yet, the game persisted; made changes and continued to grow its content until now; it is probably of the largest if not the biggest MMO (content wise) out there today.I view EQ2 as a soler or even duo (couples/friends) MMO dream. All the content below the newest expansion is doable solo or small group; long as you have the superior level. This allows people to go back and see everything the game has to offer without problematic scaling that would prevent such a thing as present in a game like Lord of the Rings Online.Now don't let this fool you, the current content at maximum level is hard; offering a good challenge for players who wish to partake in that field of play.But EQ2 has something for everyone.The best player housing. Bar none. No other game even comes close ... no really, none.Collecting. Love to collect stuff? Well, EQ2 has some of the best collecting available in an MMO. A library worth.Quests? More than I can remember. Thousands. Enough for you to lose much of your remaining years on this Earth playing. Now who doesn't love that in a game.Huge zones, enough that even flying doesn't make em seem overly small unlike a game like World of Warcraft which seems very small once you hit the air.Now, that being said I will stress there are some problems with this game. A big one or two as well.Performance. The game suffers from a very old engine. With that comes unsolvable bouts of lag, crashing, playing in a window you can find your game display just stops working until you ALT-ENTER to set it full screen again. Poor player models. Still using the same models since release and it shows. Half the males in the game look like they are suffering from MONO. The females are not much better. Even the Asian models aren't great, looking more like expressionless dolls than they should.Population. Small ... not that this is a bad or good thing; really depends on what you want out of a game. I happen to like EQ2 being a bit on the small side. Makes gathering, questing and such easier and more relaxing. But to each their own really.Just based on the sheer number of things to do, the amazing housing ... EQ2 is worth the cost of a subscription. Especially if sitting in LFG queues all day isn't your thing.8/10 ...			"

												This MMO remains the king of content. There's just so much to do, from the excellent tradeskilling system - where you actually DO something, to solo questing, solo dungeons, grouping, raiding, the awesome housing system and so on. There's a big assortment of different classes to play, races to differentiate your character through and loads and loads of different zones to adventure through. Still supported with expansions and updates, there's still a huge amount of fun to be had in EQ2. I heartily recommend it.That said, the F2P is a bit limited, and you will at some point need to subscribe in order to get the most out of it. But trust me, it's worth it.If you like MMOs, you owe it to yourself to try EverQuest II.			"

												This game begs you in every possible way to give it money, every 10 minutes or so a rather large screen will pop up asking you to buy membership, this got me killed several times. everytime you exit the game (i had to alt-f4 as there is no in game options menu or quit button that i could find) it will open youre browser to a page to buy membership. As a side note chat is locked to members.It has no tutorial at all and quests givers rarley tell you what you are meant to be doing. for example i was told i go cllose a rift, that was it, how the ♥♥♥♥ can i close a rift if i dont know what it is where it is or waht to do if i find one. combat is almost nonexistent, select enemy stand there mashing number buttons as the cooldown expires. Interacting with objects and people is a pain, you have to right click and use a tiny context menu.Animations are completely out of sync with with abilities and attacks.The servers were compltely dead i only saw 1 other person.The few things the game did well: tonnes of custimisation and character development ( the charcter creation is lacking however).Tonnes of content if u prefer quantity over quality.For over 15 gig download avoid it if you have bad internet or lacking hardrive space, but other than that its free if you want to see for youreself. Rift is a similar and far superior MMORPG.			"

												This is the game of the gods, the music is awesome, the world is yours to explore, there is so much to do, and the gameplay never gets old. I hope that this game never gets deleted. paying for your membership is optional, and worth the price, but at the same time, what you get from your membership isn't all stuff that is vital to playing the game, nor does it make it so the game isn't as fun when the membership runs out, the balance of what membership gets you to what you have without it is very nice in comparison to other games where once your membership runs out, it just doesn't compare because membership gives you such a good gameplay experience. The community of people is great, very willing to help when you need it, and we all congratulate each other on accomplishments. This is an altogether great game that I recommend to anyone who has been playing games for a while and wants to get more hardcore without going to the unforgiving community of world of Warcraft.I also have a growing group dedicated to this game for those who are interested in joining: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EQIIPlayers "

												EQ2 is one of those old MMOs that have stood around and other games have copied bits and pieces from. As one of the originals, there's something to be said for putting effort into it. Sortof how you would feel playing an old playstation one game that had a good story or you felt some nostalgia about. You won't get the same hardcore base as you have with WoW and FFXIV, but it is good to have an MMO that is rather laid back. Not paying means you aren't obligated to play every day, you can go at your own pace.That said, it could be considered too laid back for some people. Alot of group content and no working in game group finder tool can make most playtime solo, or duo if you grab a friend. There's npcs you can hire for in game gold that do decently well too. So you can take on most things by yourself if you have enough gusto to quest around. This game is called everQUEST for a reason, there will forever be quests for you to do. Not just daily ones, but class and profession ones as well. Even as you level there are quests that bring you back to older content to run a dungeon or somesuch and get a sizable reward.The downside to this game is that there isn't really much presence of a fanmade guide to things, and there are so many things to do that keeping track of them all can be really tiresome and just about impossible. There are some old sites around that explain events and tell you where to go, but support has been dropped with the new developer buyout. Of course some things that come with it being old, the player models arent impressive nor is the armor.The upside to this game though, again, you don't need to pay for things. There is player and guild housing, as well as items you can loot from in game objects in dungeons and put on display. Taking the heads of raid bosses and mounting them in your guild hall, making it into a small city. There are plenty of expansions to explore, and there is as much crafting as there is slashing. Crafting everything from ability improvements to house decorations, seasonal ones as well.All in all, the game has alot to offer but takes time to show it. There still is a devout player base around, just have to look.(I play with the download from the actual site, steam cant calculate how many hours I've spent playing this game haha)			"

												I've been playing everquest 2 since 2011. If I could rate the game out of 10 it would be 6. I love Everquest 2 very dearly, it will always be in my heart. Everytime I try to find a different game to play I always come back to Everqeust 2. There are a lot of good and bad things about the game. I gave a 6/10 because there are many issues with Everquest 2 that need to be addressed by the devs and haven't been. I cannot ignore that despite my deep love for this classic game.Some of the bad stuff; Lots of graphical bugs that have yet to be addressed( particularly the GPU shadows and small things like fish appearing above the water because something about the transparecy of the water is wrong.)  Some of the purchasable content seems over priced and definitely money grabbing... ( e.g  The Aerakyn(Dragon) race costs 42 dollars if you want to have cool animations and the ability to fly with your wings. Things I feel that the race should come with by default. ) Poor enforcment of code of conduct. There are few players who consistently cheat other players out of plat, loot and verbally abuse them. There IS an ignore feature but a player like this needs to be penalized accordingly.  Limited variety of flying mounts to choose fromThe Good stuff; The lore is exceptional, creative and the writers are very good at touching your heart and making endings that you'd never expect! There is a LOT of content, as to be expected for a game like this... you will never fun out of stuff to do! There are a lot of friedly players out there You can join a guild and make friends or closer, like family! You can decorate houses! There are heaps of different classes to choose from!  There are so many areas to explore in the world of Norrath and some are breath-takingly beautiful. Everquest 2's art captures fantasy in a realistic way. "

												One of the Best games out there. Its better then world of warcraft. hands down 20/20 id pay to play EQ2 vs WoW. Reasons why.1. Content is much larger and better.2. More classes and roles to choose from3. The game actually involves you in the lore, From learning new languages, helping different races, its never ending.4. it lets you choose your allegiance, and even switch it! so to start off a good hero, you can later switch to the evil side or even be nuetral and not welcomed by either side of the game.5. Tons of dungeons and raids6. Advanced Stat system and Combat( For its time and age)7. it has housing! Thats right, player housing. you can rent rooms in the major cities or pay $ for prestige housing thats rent free and their designs are not basic. Theres sometimes prestige housing on the auctions. So you arent forced to spend $ here.8. Subscription is soley based on how you feel. meaning, if you dont want to sub, YOU CAN STILL PLAY THE GAME! with minor restrictions ofc, being, no free charecter slots above basic ( or if you purchased more slots) subbing gives 5 extra slots. you cant wear top end raid gear, not game changing honestly, restrictions to a member specific area, cant controll your xp gain, in EQ2 there are multiple forms of xp, Charecter, AA ( alternate advancements), Trade skill and Tradeskill AA, you will be stuck at 50 50, meaning you get half of xp as charecter and half as AA. With sub u can go full charecter xp or full AA or how ever feel like leveling.9. Expacs. They come yearly usually the same time of the year, ( fall) basics are 35$ USD, which is content and maybe one or two in game items, depending on if you pre order or not. and As usuall the more you pay the more you get. Which will sometimes be housing, a mount, xp boost, mercanaries , etc.Reasons you may feel turned off.1. it doesent get advertised like WoW ( one reason why kids go gaga over wow)2. Dated, but realistic graphics, meaning, if you see a rock, it actually looks like a rock, and grass looks like grass . ( not that cartoony playdough look of WoW( but in my opinion its better that way))3 Maybe your biggest issue. PvP in most sense has been removed. What remains is dueling. Which most will look at that like its bad, but in return we get more Pve Content, special servers. And pvp would honestly be a mess with the way stats work in the game and how theres SOO many kinds of stats and not just the basic hp mp str agi crap, its got the basics, then it ADDED on to it, to add area auto attacks, weapon damage bonus , etcHope this helps . it really is a good game and franchise, even though its a bit niche, but Its a grandfather mmo.20/20 id let the game play me, its that great.

												Everquest 2 is a standard, serviceable MMO.  There is no lack of contact to play through and the levelling is quite enjoyable, I would rate the levelling as even more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, being that there is a cohesive plot line and flow between the quests as well as a wealth of concisely delivered lore given in readable speach bubbles and not a forgettible quest accept window.  The story is about the world of Norrath, not the player hero.Pros:+EQ2 offers one of the widest selections of playable races and classes with few to no restrictions (2 races and 2 classes are premium only). +The game also looks pretty good for a 2004 title and as you go to higher level areas the art only improves.+Skills are very cool with a wide variety of available playstyles.+Free to play up until the latest expansion (level 95).Cons:-Combat animations are not smooth, but it's a 2004 game so I'll give it a pass.  -Player is not well guided to enter dungeons, I was fairly unaware of their existence during most of my play time.-Game does not seem to encourage co-op for the first 25 levels.

												EVERQUEST 2 REVIEWOk so obviously this game is super old now, But heres why you should spend time on this game then any other. 1. Player economySo This is a big one that counts in MMORPGs to me, The fact you can make money on here simplily by selling stuff from exploreing or just crafting objects to sell for people that need them Instead of just going quest to quest you can make money by selling junk,loot,craftable objects and ect, It just puts a more realistic and fun way to enjoy a mmorpg2. True meaning of freedomSo here i will name some games that defy this title (SWTOR,WOW) In these games you are given missions to level on all classes, That is a main objective pretty much, With this mmorpg, you will be either in combat,Exploreing,Crafting,Fishing,harvesting or just sitting around in a guild hall chatting to people, There is too much to do in this game which will keep you gaming forever, This game does not get stale3.Huge wonderful worldsThe maps on this game are one of the biggest in my opinion, you can buy a house to set up your operations in almost every main city and enjoy the artwork put into this game, Although its dated its still very enjoyableSo in my opinion, and if your looking for a game that will keep your entertained for a long time, then EQ2 is for you, I recommend it for a try atleast			"

If you plan on playing it because its free to play DON'T if anything treat it as a trial and get a membership or quit because if you don't you won't go anywhere in this game. As for the game itself it's a good game. It's huge with plenty of skills ,crafting and fighting for you to enjoy. They have a good balance on fighting and leveling. Also it has a interative crafting system and alot of crafting guilds if that's you thing. All in all i like this game and would recomend it.			"

												Great MMO. A true Classic. Lots of quests to do as well as many other things to keep you busy if you are bored. You can own and decorate a home also or a mansion or a guild hall for that matter.There are Raids too which can be very hard but they also have dungeon difficulties too so you don't always need a full raid group to do them. There really is too much to really talk about in a review. Play the game with a decent computer and you will be happy if you like MMOs. There is like over 20 classes to choose from which are each very customizable with your talent trees. Plenty of races to choose from too. The game is huge. Much bigger than WOW and many more dungeons to go in to. Open and private. Each class has a ton of spells and attacks to use so that you can feel like a real hero. Some people say players have too many abilities but I love blasting off 15 different attacks to defeat my foes. If you don't want to use all your spells you certainly don't have to so that solves that issue if it is an issue for you. The 55 hours shown here is only Steam play. I have well over 10 years of game play in Everquest 2 within multiple accounts. This game does require a good computer to run smooth. A video card with at least 2 gigs of RAM in my experience if you want the game to look good. 4 gigs if you want it to look smashing. You can turn the settings way down if your computer is that deficient but it will look like a 15 year old game.One other note: I only played this game in free-to-play mode while on Steam and I noticed things may be different than if you have a sub. The alt character looks are better than the default looks for sure. If they changed that then that is great. My review is based on subbing not free-to-play but I have played free to play and I had a great time too but with some limitations which they recently may have done away with, hopefully. Try the game out anyhow and give it a good trial. Not 1 hour of play time. The community was always good to me and I suspect that has not changed although with free to play you never know who will play the game. Enjoy.			"

												For me to review this game a person must ask themselves. What makes a good MMO? If you are looking for a large, active, and social community at every level. Well... You might not find it here. What you will find is an older and less shiny MMO than most of the competition. While it really isn't as graphically impressive or polished gameplay wise as games like WOW, the game truly has charm and life to it that I haven't found in other games. It is easy to find MMO that are lifeless attempts to cash in on the success of WOW but have no real identity of their own. I don't feel that Everquest is like that at all. It only takes a minuets of playing the game to see that there was a true attempt and maybe even at one point a duty to stand as its own game and for the most part it does a pretty dang good job. Perhaps this is a biased thing for me to say since I grew up playing this with my dad. But I feel this game is a very good MMO and would recomend it to anyone who is too hipster to play WOW.			"

												If you want a close match to guild wars or the terrible WoW then this is the game. It has basic MMO graphics and controls. The audio is best turned off and listen to music because it can be boring. There is one major problem with the game is that there are many many missions you complete and then to choose your reward you NEED a paid account. In some ways you need very specific items which force you to go and pay to play this game, but you can get kinda far without paying but you are restricted and I mean restricted in massive writing. It is a fun game to play with your friends or family together with a better alternative to WoW. If you can afford Guild Wars then get that. If not then this game will suit you perfectly fine.			"

												I was an avid EQ2 player when the game was first released and spent countless hours playing this game.  I had quite a bit of fun, though that was before the game went ""free to play.""  I recently reinstalled the game and started playing again as a tourist, looking around at various areas I used to hunt, remembering old friends that have long since moved on.The game seems similar, but I haven't played it long enough to see how balanced it is these days, though it was pretty unbalanced after the first major combat update years ago.Anyway... I would recommend giving it a whirl (it's free) if you are interested in MMORPG gaming.  I am still waiting for ""Dark Age of Camelot 2"" to be developed.  DAoC was epic back in the day.  Man, I had fun playing that game... *sigh*			"

Back in its glory days, EverQuest II was such a magnificent and addicting game, and although now the game is still enjoyable, it gets somewhat saddening to see what's become of it. If you've got a large group of close friends all looking for a fun MMO experience, then please, I urge you to play EQII together, because this game is honestly a blast. If it's just you though, be prepared to walk through empty zones and maps for your entire playthrough.			"

												I've spent a good amount of time playing this game (I believe it wasn't through steam when I played). I love everquest 2 for what it is. Is this an MMORPG worth your time? Yes. Absolutely. What makes this game so great is the lore and universe of the game are so immersive and fun. The world feels huge and is constantly being added to. It's very easy to find a guild with friendly people who can show you the ropes. Definately the most fun you can have in an MMORPG without spending a dollar. I will say, when this game first went free to play the restrictions were really harsh. These days they seem to have fixed a lot of those type of issues and the game is really fun, even if you don't spend money. From what I can tell the game isn't pay to win as most of the in store items are cosmetic gear or mounts. Very cool game!			"

This game has a lot of Love for those of us that played the first EQ, but it is also just a darn good game for those that did not play EQ1.With a very large list of classes and races to play, as well as an excellent trade-skill class system that is rare in MMOs, it has great diversity of play. The old ""something for everyone"" saying truly stands the test in EQ2. Combine that with a plethora of amazing locations and interesting monsters to play in and against and you arrive at a very enjoyable MMO experience.			"

												Everquest II is the sequel of an amazing game. Your adventures start in the world of Norrath. You take part in various quests as an adventurer or a tradeskiller, while unveiling mysteries lost in time, exploring places that only myth has referred to, and battling creatures you would never have imagined that you could handle. Filled with rich, extremely inspired lore, Everquest 2 is the among the best for gamers who like to live a game like reading a novel, or watching a movie, and taking part in it. It is a unique mmorpg amongst the thousands of its kind, with not too high pc requirements, simple but beautiful graphics and a vast variety of content, equipment and adventure-wise.The moon has now crushed on Norrath, dividing it into different shattered islands. Sentinel's Fate: Strange events open up portals to the long lost land of Ultera.Age of Discovery: Gnomish pirates sail on their legendary ship, the Icebreaker, and discover Velious, a chuck of the first land (something like the real Pangaia) that existed before the shattering. Chains of Eternity: Inbalance occurs between Ethernere, the land where the dead go before they face judgement from their gods, and Norrath, the land of the living. Tears of Veeshan: A prismatic dragon named Kerafyrm, child of fire and ice, takes advantage of his power to conquer the 2 mightiest strongholds of Norrath: Freeport, head of the evil empire, and Qeynos, throne to the good kings and queens, as he challenges the authority of the dragons and their king Lord Yelinak in Skyshrine, the land of dragonkind. Will you aid the people of this fantasy world to live through these otherwordly challenges or exploit the chaos to your own benefit?			"

												EQII is a great MMO with lots to do, places to go, and is visually stunning. Now that it's free to play, you have little reason not to at least try. Be warned tho, if you want a certain class or race, you might have to buy them. The most basic of classes and races are avaiable to everyone. But if you had a character before the MMO went free to play, then you can use that character regardless if you have the character pack!			"

												This game is an amazing MMO, one of the best I've played. I was to young to play the original when it had came out (which it just got its 20th expansion pack recently) but I was at the right age when this game came out to be able to play it. The game itself is amazing looking for it's age (graphics are not what makes a game a game but is nice). It has an amazing amount of classes and races, the sides you can pick are Good, neutral, and Evil with 6 in Evil and Good and 8 in neutral. Now the Classes are abundant, there are 4 categories with Fighters, Healers, Scouts, and mages. Each but the Scout categories have six classes each while Scouts have 7. Races in EQ 2 have racial attributes; say frogloks are good fighter classes. Also choosing your deity is importing in improving your class effectiveness. I could go on about the amazing features of this game, but there is too much to say. Classes: https://www.everquest2.com/classesRaces: https://www.everquest2.com/races "

I had bought it when it first released but my PC was terrible and couldn't handle the game. I am having a blast. It actually feels like an MMO on these servers where most MMOs these days seem more like single player games with a chatroom integrated into them.

												EverQuest II is Sony Online Entertainment’s second stand alone game that is set in the EverQuest universe. It is not a direct sequel, as the game takes place in a parallel universe rather than after the events of the original EverQuest. The game was originally released back in 2004, but was eventually re-released in July 2010 as a free to play game with a cash shop. The game has incredible graphics and audio and is a vast improvement over its predecessor. Since the game’s release, EverQuest II enjoyed 5+ major expansion packs and many smaller content updates. If you were a fan of the original EverQuest, or just looking for a new game to try, EverQuest II won’t disappoint, especially since it’s a free to play game now. The free to play restrictions have been mostly lifted now, leaving the game’s content vastly open for players to explore.Pros:+Incredible amount of variety+Huge variety of skills and advancements.+Large game world.+Solid interface.Cons:-Some annoying free to play restrictions.

												I just returned to EQ2 after a several year hiatus.I joined as f2p and all of my toons and their inventories were still availalbe (I did have to delete one of them due to character slot limitations...but there are plenty of slots---I just had too many toons).I deleted another, low-level toon, so I could start over and get reacquianted with the game.  I have to say the play is still very engaging and fun. The graphics are a bit dated..but I am not that concerned if the game can grab my attention and stay fun. Also this is one of the few games, out there, that can accomodate my close group of friends in a single group. We normally have 6 players, and most games limit you to 4 (maybe 5) person teams.  EQ2 supports 6 - for us this is a BIG bonus.I was leary of SOEs implementaion of free-to-play (f2p), having been irritated by many titles being f2p (free to PAY AND OFTEN) instead of f2p (free to play). Sony has this one set (imho) perfectly.  I have run into very little restrictions (text chat in game is frustratingly gimped for f2p, but after dealing with the foul-mouth trolls that commonly make the chat useless, I FULLY approve!)I do understand that at the highest tier (I mean 80+ level here) there is money involved if you are f2p, and I am absolutely OK with that.  If I have played on their servers, over their network, and enjoyed their hard work for that long, then they damn good-and-well deserve something from me in return.There are also two races, and classes that you pay to have access to, that is OK too. These are mostly cosmetic and have a fun idea behind them. There are still so many free choices that if I decide I want to play one of those other races or classes I can (again) pay for them and not feel I am having my credit card ransomed. Fianlly you will get pop-ups when you log in for things to purchase, and another shortly to take advantage of the Sony All Access. Again this is a minor annoyance and easily closed. (Also at $10 a month for subscription access to most SOE titles and more coming online it sure beats $15 a month for most paid MMOs)			"

												One of the best games i have ever played. Played it since it came out and sadly had to take a break from it due to school and just not having the time anymore. One of the top Multiplayer games out there right up there with WoW (EQ2 is better). Best raiding experience any game has to offer hands down imo, PvP is a blast at max level, the lore in the game is amazing and still after 11 years it still intrigues me. Community in and out of the game is very strong and even with Everquest Next in the works the Devs still keep the game up to date and listen to the community. Even if you are not the most social person and want to get involved in guilds and raids this is a great solo game too. Easily reach max level all by yourself without any help.If anything download the game and give it a try. Its F2P and a easy game to learn and get into. Also i may not have time played on steam but trust me ive spent way too many years on this game.Heres my profile so you know im not lying.

												Feeling my age here. I was a player of the original EQ, right from the start of the vanilla days and through at least two of the expansions. I've played other MMOs since then, and coming back to Norrath after all this time is a bit of a trip through memory lane. It's held up amazingly well, considering what it's up against in terms of competition, and F2P till 90 is pretty damn good considering so far I haven't run out of things to keep me occupied and interested. The learning curve varies a bit... I'm still figuring out how the AA system works and crafting has taken a bit of banging my proverbial and pixel head into the wall a few times, but the fiance and I are having a terrible lot of fun running around doing quests and tag teaming groups of mobs together, and that's what counts! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of variety in their MMO. There are a LOT of race and class combinations to choose from, several different starter zones, and a lot of options for how to play the game. You can solo for a pretty long time if you so choose, hire a mercenary to accompany you for tougher zones, or just spend hours gathering and crafting for your house. I just wish there were more RP servers in Europe. I'd love to see what the RP community in this game is like.			"

												TL;DR- It's a dated game with a lot of content and a style all it's own.  Absolutely worth a try.I've loved this game for years but had a lot of trouble really getting into it.  It's a lot easier to solo for most classes now and they have made a lot of things easier like skills and such (possibly too easy honestly) but personally I think the game is still a lot of fun even with the funky looking graphics.  EQII has always had a look all it's own and I have always liked it for that fact first and foremost.  Any game can repeat other games (and let's face it, most MMOs do just that now) or try to wow you with lame ""super awesome new combat!"" gimmicks but personally I think this is a huge deal for being a free to play game.  it's incredibly massive, probably too massive now with the player count.  You have tons of classes and races to choose from even allowing for neutral characters that can start on either side of the coin.  There are four different starting places but I feel letting go of the original ones (the two main cities for either side) rather then just upgrading the items and content; was a horribly lazy and stupid thing to do.  Maybe some players were tired of it but I liked the atmosphere with those two originally way more then any of the new ones.Personally, I love the trade skills.  It isn't about buying some item to get a 100% chance of success in crafting, rather it takes time and patience often times making the crafting itself into a mini game that used to actually be lethal at higher levels.  I wish they hadn't made that part vanish either.  Mounts are for everyone all the time.  I really appreciate this.  This honestly is a huge game and being able to get a mount from one of the new starting areas was a good idea all in all.  They range from ordinary, cheap horses to flying disks, gliding rodents and leaping lizzards.  Every type of fascinating mount thought of is used in the game and fits in very well with the art and style in my opinion.And speaking of art and style, the fact that players themselves can craft items such as house furniture, cosmetic outfits and weapons is a really awesome part that I am glad they introduced.  Seeing the different things people are capable of making is extraordinary and fun to me.  Along with the face cam that I don't usually use but it produces more laughable results then anything.  Making your character make a huge ""O"" face is something hilarious to me but the technology is there and it's very fun to use if you have a good enough camera.  It's not a Pay-2-Win game in my opinion, as things pretty much stay cosmetic or help with adventuring, crafting experience, etc.  You are able to play this game just fine without pulling out your wallet every few seconds.  I want to get a monthly sub just because I want a monthly sub, not because I feel it is needed in order to gain more access to the game or any of the content within.  That is a big plus to me personally. "

I have been a fan of everquest and everquest 2 for many many years , and i always end up coming back because no other game can compete with this fun.			"

												Game seemed alright at first (like 5 minutes in), but they kept throwing grasps for cash at me and when I tried to ask in /ooc for a little help I was immediately told that I needed to, again, pay them.Nah. It seems like it'd be fun but it also seems to be heavily monetized.			"

												Interesting, strategic gameplay. you definately need more skills then the basic MMO's out there. the crafting skills are very long to increase and the experience guage is difficult to get used to.  overall, customizability is much higher, but much slower paced then I'm used to.  I've only played a few hours but prefer the D&D online or Neverwinter engines to this one. still worth looking at if you are jonesing for a new MMO to play  though.			"

												After a multi year absence i returned, i couldnt find my account and started a new one then people convinced me to get my old account for veteran rewards. I did it and paid for a character transfer from new to old account. Im still waiting for it to happen. Its probably because EQ2 and Planteside 2 is having login issues and they cant get to my transfer. When i talked to customer service at SOE i was pleasantly suprised that the gentleman i talked to was nice, listened to all my concerns, and made suggestions. The game still has a unique feel and is a pleasure to play. I would recomend this game for everyone.			"

												I started this game at launch, fell in love with it, however, as is usually the case, i would set it aside to go check out the ""latest, newest game"" only to come back to EQ2.   I recently discovered it on Steam (i prefer having all my games in 1 place, and steam lets me do that)   I have paid the subscription fee, and played as F2P ... and in either case i truly enjoyed the game.The World is huge, with many ways to level your character to end game, as opposed to other games that take a more linear approach.  I currently have 4 end-game chars (85+) and several crafters. This is one of the games i actually enjoy crafting in.The Dungeons, instances, and raids are still fun after all these years.  Since launch i have made 20+ chars, and still play with them all. (not all at the same time, as that would be technically impossible lol)  No other game has gotten me to continuosly return nor grabbed my attention as heavily as this one ... I highly recommend giving it a try :)			"

												I would definately give this game a five out of five star rating, a 50/50, a 100/100, whatever measurement displays your world view. The graphics are fantastic, and even at medium graphic quality, the game still looks amazing. Every aspect of this game is epic; over twenty diverse classes to choose from, the abilty to be select good or bad, and the aspect of adventure. Not unlike LOTRO, it is a Mouse-Keyboard based game, with the number keys used for skills. Even though I've played for less than thirty minutes, the leveling is fast, (Seeing as I'm level 8 already) and I believe later you can make your own supplies. The world is amazing, widespread, and overall beautiful. The HUD is crisp, and Video quality, as I said above, is visually rich. Thank you whoever read this, and I hope you consider grabbing hold of this game.			"

												I do like this game I wanted somehting different from the whole WoW stuff. There is some things that are annoying can't send mail as a f2p, can't talk in general chat. Also are not allowed to use the broker (auction house). one thing that is a great deal for this game is if you can afford the 119.99 for a years worth of game time which will take away all the negative things I listed. Though I still think its messed up for anybody who is new the Everquest 2 and wants to learn how to play this game and is not able to get help from other players besides going to a forum and waiting to have someone post back vs the instant answer to the question if everybody was able to use general chat.

												This game is well mostly fair with F2P with some issues here and there nothing too serious, for those worried about the severe pay to win they had before where everything good was locked down that is 99% gone, all races, classes, abilities (up to master), and armor can be used. Mail is still locked to paid members and the Broker is buy only. other than that the game is good but we need more players on Nagafen (PVP) server and less on Antonia Bayle (RP), there is a tun of content all arround the world. Big thing is the sheer load of content open to the public with a mature community that you will not find in games like Wildstar, WoW, FFXIV, and alot of other games.			"

 EverQuest II EverQuest 2 is an MMORPG that has come free to play on Steam in December of 2011. Originally it was a subscription based MMO that released in November of 2004. Before it came onto Steam, you could get a very limited access, free to play account. Now that it's on Steam, the limitations have mostly been lifted. With 21 races and a whopping 26 classes to choose from, you can be just about anything! Well not with out a little bit of effort. There are Good races and Good classes that require a good race, and the same goes for Evil races and Evil classes. Additionally there are neutral races that can pick any of the classes. But what if you want to be an evil race with a good class? Through the process of a lengthy and repititious quest chain (Which can be started once you hit level 10), you can turn your Ogre Shadowknight to an Ogre Paladin!With your Ogre Paladin at your command, you are ready to start adventuring! Don't worry, you can further customize your Paladin with the use of Alternate Advancement (AA)! You have, quite literally, hundreds of AAs to choose from to enhance and shape the way your Paladin plays. What's the catch? In order to get these points, you have to fill an AA experience bar, which siphons regular experience from your character as you kill monsters and complete quests. With the free to play account, you're left having to put 50% of your experience gained to the AA points, which will really slow you down and put you behind other leveling zones. In order to remove this restriction, you have to pay the monthly subscrition fee.Don't want to pay? Well don't worry, you have plenty of areas to level in! There are plenty of quests to do, along with shiny collectable objects lying on the ground for you to acquire and complete collections, which can then be turned in as mini quests. Additionally you can also group up with other people and tackle dungeons to acquire loot and experience, in the typical MMO fassion. If adventuring is not your thing, you can take up a profession, or tradeskill! You have 11 to choose from, from Weaponsmith to Alchemist, Tinkerer and Carpenter. Carpentry? Yes, it's a thing. Carpentry is used to make furniture for your very own house or guild hall in game! How is the customer service? Amazing. For the longest time I had shared an account with my Father, and eventually I had several high level characters. Recently he had pushed me to get my own account. I agreed, but I didn't want to sacrifice my characters. So I contacted customer support and of course, for a fee, I was able to get my characters transfered within a day of submitting in a ticket. I was incredibly happy with the customer support from SOE, as they were very kind and understanding. EverQuest 2 is everything you might expect out of an MMORPG, but with the free to play version, there are a few things I wish they would lighten up on, mainly the Alternative Advancement slider. That's really the biggest turn off from this game for not just myself, but many others as well. It reminds me of a pay-to-win model which is nothing anyone enjoys. You could also argue that it encourages you to go to different zones to quest to get up to level, and it is easy enough to get to one of the zones in question within 5 or 10 minutes, but not everyone wants to leave a quest chain in the middle of it to go half way across the virtual world to level up a little before coming back.One more thing to mention is that not all of the races and classes are available to play with out paying for them. Out of the 21 races, 19 of them are playable for free. Out of the 26 classes, 24 of them are playable. This really doesn't sound too bad but it is $20 dollars per race*, and $25 dollars per class.If you don't want to start off with a level 1 character, you can spend $35 dollars on a level 90 character with 320 AA points, equipped powerful gear. Once again the pay-to-win model comes to mind. Is this game any good? For the amount of content and what you can get out of this game as is, it is definitely worth it. The AA slider issue is something you can work around and can be a blessing. Where some are higher level than you, you may be just as powerful because you have more AAs. Additionally it encourages you to check out other zones. You can be just about anything, you can do just about anything, and yet it all cost next to nothing. Why not give it a try? *Some races come with extra bundles that costs an extra sum of money.			"

												It's a good game, I just started playing again recently after I saw it on Steam. However this game has hit its climax a long while back and has been going downhill for a while simply because nobody plays it anymore. Pretty much all of the servers are scarcely populated and so PVP servers aren't really PVP anymore. This game is really good, it is, way better than ♥♥♥♥ MMOs like WOW (I tried playing it), sadly Sony hasn't really ever marketed their games that well and fantastic games like this one have just faded away. I recommend this game because it is good, but unless you're really into the franchise I advise you to look elsewhere because this Massively Multiplayer Game is no longer ""Massive"".			"

												Eq1 is still the Grand Master. Dont get me wrong EQ2 is pretty fun. With a logical re-vamed of Trade Skills that EQ1 didnt have. But I wish EQ2 would have went Progression based instead of Tier Based, Tier base was implmented for F2p which is Somthing they had plan for a long Time. Progression Based means that you have to do the content before you do the next. It keeps the Older content relivate. Tier Based system you can just skip and be at lvl 100 within 12 hours yes 12 hours, With a enough EXP Pots and a someone Power levling you and doing somthing like Angnogtics Dungans you will even get good gear at what evey LVL your at so it makes the Player market erelavate for most things like gear or even spells. DB needs to break from its Sony Vision and create thier own Image  for any futrue of EQ,1. EQ3 would look like something like This. 1a.Norrath and all Citys are destoryed. The Races dont Trust each other anymore. They Blame the others Races for Gods destorying everything that they Craeted.  Players and esp. Guild would now have to build New citys. (Thier no Qenoys or Freeport) The Players get to build the next Great Citys in EQ.  2. With a PVP sandbox style of Play. 3. All kinds of mechnics and quest. City and Town maintance. Not mercs .

												I have put many hours into this game over the years. This was my first entry into MMORPG's, and it taught me tha I did not need sleep when I would be online with friends on quests for hours on end. We even took shifts to watch for an epic to pop and the poerson on watch would yell into teamspeak and wake everyone up. It has changed quite a bit since launch, but it is still a fun game to play with friends and there is still a large community on the servers.			"

												I don't know why I keep coming back to this game. Been playing it since like 2003. Why. The 160~ hours on steam is just scratching the surface of the amount of hours I've played this game. If you've never played it, it is free to play now and honestly you can completely get a feel of the game without paying anything. I'm really not too sure how much someone with no nostalgia for the game would love it, but I personally always end up coming back. It's a shame about the dwindling, tiny playerbase though. :'(			"

												Hrmmmm... Well, I loved playing EQ2 back in it's early years but the way the game is now, it's no longer truly fun, you can't really do a whole lot without having to spend some money which.. Fortunately, it's not a lot, usually. The older the game got the more it turned into a WoW clone, which was depressing to see because WoW clones are just the worst kind of MMOs, there's too many of them and there's very little MMOs with any creativity anymore. All of them are the same thing these days.But anyways. The Pros to the game is thatYou can get up to level 95 without spending any RL money the community is pretty okay, it's the friendliest community, but it's definitely okay Ratongas.. They're ♥♥♥♥ing adorable. fantastic graphics (even though that doesn't matter) for a game made in 2004, the graphics blew my mind away when it came out plenty of guilds not hard to find a party (at least in my experience) for dungeons and suchPretty LGBTQ+ friendly, I'm bi and knowing that people don't mind that does make me happy.Endless amounts of quests to doQuite a lot of humourous quests and NPCs.Mercenaries, for when you don't like people. lolCons are:Well, past level 95, you definitely need to buy the expansions if you want to do more quests.A LOT of things are restricted for FTP players, which is mainly just inconvience for those players.Lag, lots and lots of lag, no matter how good your computer is, you're going to lag on EQ2.Quite a bit of quests are boringOverwhelming amount of skills you can get as you advance into the game (which if that's good to you, that's fine)Grinding, yes, you have to grind for XP sometimes.A few wonky animations.Ugly normal appearance for most races. Like so ugly that it can break a thousand mirrors at once.Iksars have tiny heads, it's weird and it bothers me greatly, and Sarnaks have tiny hands and scrawny tail, like skinnier than an Argonian's from Skyrim/Oblivion. (I know it's a bit nit-picky but I'm a bit OCD... )Play-doh hair, just no.Some named NPCs do not have voice acting. Some quests are fetch/rinse and repeat quests.You have to pay to unlock things, which is irritating.To be honest, I REALLY prefer the subscription fee version of EQ2 because, at least, back then it was loads of fun back then and there weren't Freebloods or that weird dragon-human hybrid race. God, those two races look like they got hit by the biggest ugly stick on the planet.			"

												I like the TLS servers, they bring back EQ2's original gameplay without all the nonsense of f2p, mercenaries, instance dungeons, and the arsenal of exp bonuses all the time. They recently put a exp bonus on TLS which i wasn't fond of.  So I still recommend the game, however it does feel like its too little too late.  I grinded my characters earned there levels on the regular server, then hero characters and instance dungeons happened....Totally ruined the value of characters, since now its super easy to get up to their level or even pass them by buying your way to the top.  If it wasn't for TLS servers, this game would still be thumbs down for zero gameplay challenge, but i changed it because of TLS.			"

												HIS WILL HAVE TWO PARTS PVE AND PVP.PVEso i got the game. make a toon it has 1,2,3,4, pages of making one. then time to give it a name. name i want is taken ok but... it backs me out to page 1 and i have to repick everything for my toon again. this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is greatPVPok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.

												I can't say that I recommend this game.  Many, many moons ago I played EQ 1 and it was awesome.  Addictive, unique, and always changing.  EQ 2 is a pretty fun game too, enough that I thought I wanted to become a member.  But that's why I had to stop playing.Membership is the standard $15 a month, but it is missing huge pieces of content.  Classes, expansions, game options.  Ok, no problem.  Most games you need to buy the latest expansion to get the great stuff right?  I looked at the expansions.  But after playing for a while, hitting the message boards, and reading various tips and guides I relaized that even if you get the $15 membership, then the $50-80-$130 expansion, you STILL DON""T HAVE THE WHOLE GAME.  Crazy right?  No, you have to buy a couple new races.  Buy a couple new classes.  Oh, and buy mercenary access.  You won't find any explaination of the mercenary stuff easily.  It takes digging and asking questions in game.  But to really give you the idea of the money bleed of this game: The special edition $80ish expansion comes with a very nice mercenary.  BUT NOT THE MERCENARY ACCESS.  I would say they nickle and dime you, but they don't.  They $15 and $25 you, because nothing costs less than that except for the silly appearence stuff.Finally, the items you buy and the access you get really do affect your gameplay.  There are entire sections of character development that can't be accessed without an extra $20, 30, or 40 on top of everthing else.  It's just not worth it.  I hope this gave some other folks a little more information that I had to dig and research pretty hard to find.			"

												Honestly... don't download this pile of junk if you have Windows 10. Some weird things going on with this program. Downloaded, installed, blank screen then program hanged on loading, could not end process. After reboot, would call itself on restart, and then wait for a kernal or driver of some sort. Not killable on process explorer. Not killable on PSKill. Ended up restoring. Can't expect much with an old game but I would at least expect that it doesn't break my windows.			"

												This game is, by far, one of my favorites. I've been playing this game for a few years (though my Steam account would say otherwise xD) and have come to love this game very much in doing so. It is a very large game, with tons of other players. You get a set list of servers to play on, and you do get a limit to how many characters you can have on your account. Character creation&Basic Character Stuff:There is a vast horizon of options to choose from for your character's appearance. I have always found anything besides character height, race, and head/face options a bit unnecessary, since most of the time your armor (appearance and/or actual equipment) will cover it. But, it's still fun to give your character that tattoo that nobody will see, right? ;)Names are also an interesting thing in this game, because once you reach a certain level, you can give your character a last name. I can't list too many games off the top of my head that will let you give your character a last name. There are also two different equipment tabs. One of them is the equpiment that you wear for the item bonuses such as stat boosters and whatnot. If you don't have any appearance equipment, the other equipment tab, then this is the gear you'll see. Appearance equipment is also another interesting aspect of this game; tons of players with different combinations of equipment in their appearance slots mean it's hard to find two players that look the same. Mounts are another wonderful aspect of this game. With tons of different mounts, there really is almost no limit to going places. Gameplay:The gameplay of this game is rather simple, in all reality. You get a ton of spells that you use, and the amount increases with progression through the game, and go into hotbars. A majority of combat in this game is, in most cases, just clicking of the icons in your hotbar. The animations for your spells aren't too impressive in themselves, unless your graphics are cranked up, however, don't let this deter you. The story for each character class is fairly different, being that in the end, each character begins on a story to get their epic weapon, the weapon for each class that will become their signature (though often, becomes replaced in-game due to stats not being impressive enough) weapon of choice. Each expansion adds to the story, too, that goes beyond your epic weapon. Even if you aren't paying attention to the stories you get into in too great detail, this game is just fun to play.			"

												As an adult mmo player, I was dissappointed to find this game seemed to have been coded by 15 year old girls for twelve year old girls. Four hours of flittering fairies and fairy babies convinced me the game wasn't about to man up, (or woman up, in the grown-up sense of gamers). The gui was the clunkiest I've ever encountered, movement was painfully awkward and you could NOT look up! Get this for your young niece so she can get an intro to WOW or POE, but look elsewhere for yourself.			"

												I do not like this game. At all. You move slowly, combat isn't fun or strategic, or even vaugely realistic, environments are bland, quests simply are not fun, menus are annoying, there seems to be little purpose to many items. Maybe this is all because I have played very, very little of this game. I spent weeks forcing this game to download due to horrible internet and was severely disappointed in what I found. I was expecting an immersive, colorful, and enjoyable game from the trailers and such, but I found just a pile of somewhat shiny gravel as opposed to a dragon's stash. Just how did this get so popular? If the combat involves you locking on to an enemy and tapping three buttons until someone falls over, you know you're not going to have fun.On a side note, the walking controls are on par with Bubsy 3D. You walk straight for a bit, adjust trajectory, and try again.And now, a list of pros:The character creation screen. It allows for a lot of customizarion and detail, in a similar manner to Skyrim's, only somehow, slightly less cool. Maybe it's because the way it handles adjusing colors is a bit weird, or how tweaking the face doesn't seem quite accurate. I don't know.EverQuest II gets a 2/10. Would not play again, much less reccomend.			"

												If you're new to the Everquest series like myself, just play Everquest Next when it comes out instead.I say this because a lot of functionality of the game feels very dated, especially the ui the menus are clunky and not fluid whatsoever. For such an old game I'd have expected the developers to improve on this somewhat.Another problem I found is if you're new to this game prepare to overwhelmed, there's so much things you need to learn before you actually get a good concept of everything. I found myself more frustrated having to look things up because something was explained properly.The only things I like about the game, was the areas were vast and expansive and the great variety of different races and classes.

												This game is fun, but highly overrated. Cons:Gets boring fast depending on what your doing.  Quests are boring, and a big waste of timeLack of directions.  So many times have I gotten lost and could not leave an area for an hourVery crappy damage system.  Your player deals damage fine, but if you acidently anger a higher level enemy and try to run from it you will take damage from it if you are like 15 feet away.  A wolf can NOT kill me from 15 feet away.  I say this: wait for landmark to be realesed.  It will be a lot funner than this.  The game was good for what it was, but now it is just getting old.			"

												Sad.  I had heard such good things about this game.  I know it was one of the pioneers of the MMO genre, but it seems to have gotten stuck in the past.  I would still probably recommend it for introducing kids to online gaming.  Simple enough to learn, but complex enough to hold their attention.  For myself, I'm looking for something more.  The run of the mill, click click MMO's have grown stale and boring.  Every new game just rehashes the same old game mechanics, seemingly only being a platform to drain money from the playerbase.  These games are nothing more than high end slot machines and the gaming companies are more like online casinos now.  Somebody needs to step up and take it to a new level.  The software exists.  There are many single player games which have already pushed the boundaries, so it just takes some commmitment to making a quality product instead of a money pit.  I thought Bethesda would be that company, but TESO was just more of the same ol same ol.  I'm a patient man, but I'm starting to wonder if the party is really over.			"

												I enjoyed the hours I played in Everquest II as a free player for the first day but I could not abide the tedious crafting system which has you constantly watching bars and pressing buttons just to make items to gain points or fulfill the daily crafting. And the hourly banner popping up mid screen asking me to spend money became so intrusive and disruptive I began to resent Sony's total disregard for their players/potential customers. If they don't respect my time, they don't deserve my money. I would have liked to see more, but they drove me away...sad.			"

												""Free-To-Play"" is an utter lie, ESPECIALLY if you like PVP. You have to have a gold account (costs money) to have any moves that have any real impact (masters) or any of the better gear. Ontop of that, even if you DO have a gold account you still have to pay for trivial things that boost the hell out of your combat abilities like Mercenaries, or Reforging. This would be okay if anybody had to put any REAL effort into making either of these two things, but plainly it is no big change and took no effort to create but it impacts combat entirely and Sony wants good money for it so if you are hoping to PVP without spending money or even without spending money on gold, you have just signed up to be cannon fodder. If you want to see what the game is like before you spend money, downloading it is alright - but not for any other reason - this is NOT free to play. Also - just a personal assumption so don't take this as absolute - the way things are running it really feels like Sony is just trying to squeeze money out of this game before Everquest Next comes out and have no intention of making anything better.

												Its been about 12hrs and I still havent even been able to play this game, with my terrible internet it took me about 10 hrs to download the 15gb game through steam which I left downloading over night. So the next morning I go to make an account on the Sony online website, tried so many ""Station names"" (usernames) none of them seemed to work. I gave up, played other games. I eventually decided to try again, and was able to receive my desired name. I launch the game through my steam library and then log in with my new log in credentials. So the scans through the files, which I guess is normal. And then it turns out I need to download another 8 gb's of the game. At this point i give up, im not gonna wait another 5 hours-ish for this game to download. I would not recommend this game unless your internet is good enough to download this whole game 20+gb in like 5 mins. Because otherwise you might just invest a bunch of your time into a game  which needs to be installed twice and give up like i did. 0/10 would not waste my time on this game again.			"

												Disappointment is sitting through an installer for over an hour only to find out this game plays like a clunkier version of every other MMORPG out there.Now, let me clear a few things up.  I have no nostalgia coming into this game.  I never played Everquest when it was popular, as I was way more into consoles at that time.  I did get a chance to play Champions of Norrath 1 & 2 (probably still two of my favorite hack & slashers) on PS2.  Lately, I've been playing a lot of free-to-play MMORPGs and this was on my list of things to try out.  I couldn't even make it past the first beach with the crabs.  Combat is clunkier than every title I've played in this genre so far.  I wasn't even sure if I was hitting the crab and who was winning.  The health bars all kept disappearing behind terrain and some fantastic glitches, my swings were choppy and there was no noise to signify connecting, and (without lag, trust me) combat moved so slow that combined with those horrible controls I have to rate this experience as painful.  I have no comment on the epic tiered equipment as I have no desire to get to level 2.If you've never played before, pick up a different MMORPG.  There have to be at least 5 in the fantasy genre on Steam, and you'd be doing yourself a favor not starting with this title.I don't need to recommend this if you've played it before and enjoyed it, so if that's you, keep enjoying it.  This was a top game at one point, and there is a reason for that.  I just don't think it's as fun as some of the other free-to-plays on Steam right now.			"

												I heard this game was different from all the other MMOs.It's not.The biggest unique thing I noticed was that there's an excessive amount of races and classes to choose from. There's like 15 races and 20 classes or something like that. To me that's a downside, I dislike when a game puts limitations on you before the game starts. I highly prefer games where you make no class choices at all, but rather your 'class' is somehow determined by your own choices during the gameplay.Anyway, after the excessive choices pre-game, you're thrown into the same thing that you're thrown into in any other MMO: kill monsters to levelup, move to the next area, rinse and repeat. Quests are just that; kill monsters, collect items from monsters, walk back and forth from NPC to another clicking through uninteresting dialogue. Receive new generic items, sell old ones.Graphics are not very interesting either, everything is large scaled so the world looks vast in scale, but this just equates to a bland unmemorable landscape and more walking in the end. Houses seem to be copy pasted quite a bit, every single door looks the same and you'll run into buildings that are a carbon copy of another building. I suppose that happens when you try to make the world too big.I should disclose though, that I'm not interested of endgame content and therefore did not look into it. I play MMOs for the journey, not for the goal.On a technical note, opening the game resets my monitor calibrations, and closing the game restarts all my tabs on firefox. Really bizzare and obnoxious behavior.			"

Until you grind out 89 levels..  then when you hit 90.. you FINALLY see other people.. only to realize most of them are off soloing and have no interest in grouping with you at ALL.It's become a COMPLETE anti-social single player experience, and it just isnt worth the time or effort to download anymore.

												This game looks good, but unfortunately it is unplayable on my system with framerates varying between 2fps and 15fps even though my latency is ony 400ms and I have an Intel core i5 with a GTX 480 graphics card.  The game is not user friendly in that quests are not highlighted.  Crafting is pathetically over complicated.  You have a huge library of skills ... but all beasts are easily killable just spamming a single skill.  This game is simplistic and unrefined and is VERY substandard compared to Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft.			"

												As Charming as the Everquest world can be, This incarnation didn't really hold up in terms of advancement from it's predecessor. In fact, in many ways it felt completely procedural, and as though I was going through the motions. The quest system is par for the course in todays games, and the combat is extremely lackluster. While this isn't uncommon in MMORPG's currently, the lack of eneemy/self feedback in strikign and gettign struck does little to make you feel like hitting 1-8 on your keyboard is more then a chore. Great race/Class selection and good graphical style for it's time, but the mechanics don't hold up. You spend most of your time going from point A to B, killing 5 Enemies, and Returning. equiptment changes didn't feel very rewarding, and while there is probably a depth of gameplay I didn't touch on, I imagine it to be so drawn out to push more hours into very common mechanics.In short, Everquest 2 doesn't hold up, and borrows abit too much from the painfully overaged WoW.

												In all honesty, knowing Everquest II and World of Warcraft were released less than a month apart, it's tough to say exactly why WoW became the unstoppable juggernaut as opposed to EQ2. They are both extremely similar, with their own pros and cons evening out to make them both equal. At this point in time, though: WoW has a subcription fee, but also has more players, better support, better graphics, and Blizzard behind it. EQ2 has more classes, more races, is more complex, and is free with an optional paid service and a premium shop, but doesn't appear to be pay to win. Pay to have convenience perhaps, but not pay to win. For that reason alone, I'd highly suggest trying it out if you're a WoW fan, or if you're new to the MMO genre. Makes me excited for Everquest: Next!			"

Sony screwed the game as much as it screws everything - SACD as a format, BR music, AV receivers, etc. I have no joy playing the game at all.

												Now, i'm not a stickler for graphics. But this game is ugly, not to mention the entire thing feels like a 1990's pc game made by an indy dev. I looked over the website to see that it was attrociously pay to win, since without spending money, you have NOTHING worth using as spells and abilities become redundant.  If you're looking at this game thinking ""Oh, it's like WoW, but free!"" You are wrong. If anything, it's more expensive in the long run. The 'dlc' that you NEED for anything decent costs an arm and a leg. Long story short, do not play this game, it would be a waste of your time. However you'll most likely think that the positive comments are the gospel truth, however they have played the game far too much to turn on it now. Now, down to why I don't like it.The gameplay is very boring and the starting areas are desolate.The combat system is terrible, who knows how they managed to go wrong with a template MMO combat system.The game is ugly.The characters look terrible and you're often left feeling the ""I'll just randomise my character and see what i get.""Within the first 10 seconds being in game, i was bored. The UI is abhorrent to look at, it looks like a complete and utter mess.The good reviews are so bias it's unreal.			"

												Lags like hell on a fairly new rig... This game plays so bad on my rig that its unbearable. This was in a place with barely anyone nearby, not a clustered populated town, just a newbie area on a medium populated server. Specs:CPU:AMD FX 8120 overclocked to 4.2ghzGPU: GTX 660ti 2GBRAM: 8GB corsair DDR3PSU: 800W Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UDAAs you can see my specs more than definatly meet the requirements of this game, no scratch that. It far surpasses it, if I can play Battlefield 4, Far Cry 3 and Batman Arkham Asylum on max with no problems at all at 60fps then this game should run as smooth as butter, am I right? I don't want no excuses that this game is unoptimized to run on multiple cores blah blah blah. I've heard that so many times. Guild Wars 2 is also unoptimized to run on multiple cores and has little to no multi-core support but yet that game runs better than this and it looks better. That's two advantages right there and a big reason to chose that game over this one. You may think I'm lying and that I just want to talk bad about this game, I don't I was actually suprised when making a character the sheer amount of variaty and options to choose from, so many classes and races that I just thought to myself, WOW but the performance is just not up to scratch. This is a game from 2004, I should never expect the amount of frame rate drops that I have had, my frame rate dropped as much as 80-90% just by turning the camera around. Completly unnaceptable. Word is that the developers won't bother to even optimize the engine for newer computers because its an old engine. Their loss!If you're looking for the evidance to show that this is how my performance really was then here's the video, go ahead and check it out and see for yourself the major stuttering and fps drops:

												This game might be a good game, if Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) would actually let you play it. To play, you need to get a (free) account with SOE. Chances are, however, that when you then try to log in, you'll get a 'Wrong Username or Password' error.Theoretically you'd then submit a support ticket, but to do that you need to log in to their website—which is exactly what you can't do because of the aforementioned error message. SOE's suggestion on their website: create a temporary second account and use that to contact Support. Guess what: you get the same error, so you still can't file a support ticket. Same thing with a third account and the fourth account (for which I pretended to live in the US, in case it might help).SOE Support doesn't have an email address, but if you can't log in, you can either contact them by phone (which adds up quickly if you have to call from abroad), or contact them through Twitter (@SOEHelp). Unfortunately, the help they provide through Twitter is limited to 'contact us through our website.' Yeah, very helpful if being unable to log in is why you try to contact them in the first place.I've spent almost two weeks trying to get some actual help from SOE Support. Then I gave up and removed the game from my computer. I'm sure the higher-ups will be thrilled to hear that their support staff has cost them a customer.So, there's a good chance you won't be able to play EverQuest II at all, and if you're one of the fortunate who do get to play it, don't expect any help from SOE Support.

Thing like your Dogs Name or where where you born if you cant anser this your SOL.Makes it hard trying to work out a prob if you cant chang the Email to see if thats the prob.One last thing I play the game for 18 houer befor thy pull this BS on me and after buying ther in game cash useing my steam wallet.The game its self is a blast to play I can say nothing bad about the game its self and would be player it still.My prob is i been Robbed by DayBrake who are a buch of small time pitty thiffs.If you want to play this game do so but do not put any Money in to it you run the risk of get muged by DayBrake and you go throw Email Comfirm hell and lose your Cash.Up Date 9/2/2016 Time 12:12 PMHer some prof that thy are not sending me a Email to conferm my Acount.To day thy sent me Email but it was not for confirmon but to rell me of a EQ2 saleFrom : 	EverQuest II <daybreak@email.daybreakgames.com>Subject : 	H-U-G-E Savings and Bonus XP Weekend!To : 	Ran Ran <stormbucking@centurylink.net>Reply To : 	EverQuestII 67t3v-mry4 d4cy <EverQuestII.67t3v-mry4.d4cy@email.daybreakgames.com> So thy can Spam me with BUY BUY NOW but cant sent me a Email so i can Confirm  HMmmm.

												I didn't even get to playing the game itself. After making a character the game told me that my character customization was invalid and I'd have to make a complete new different character. Didnt bother trying again. I won't tell anyone not to play this game because the gameplay itself might be great and others might not have this problem, but for me this is a huge letdown.			"

												I really enjoyed this game and felt it had a good selection of races and classes. I never felt the need to use money in the cash shop but because I ended up enjoying it so much I did end up subscribing. In some regards it plays like many mmos these days so I wouldn't really recommend it to those who are bored of mmos. On the other hand I do believe it has a good F2P model (unlike some of the incredibly restrictive games out there) and an interesting setting with some cool classes/races/abilities etc.All in all, for me, I rate it 8/10.

												So for years I have had a dislike of the Everquest series. (It’s a long story and involved and abusive/neglectful father)However, after finding out that this is free on Steam, i decided to give it a shot.First I tried Everquest (The first one) and absolutely hated it. Then i tried this one, and can’t stop playing it. it's very fun, and a great MMORPG.now I’m not a fan of most MMORPG's like WoW and the likes, however i find EverQuest II a very fun game, and a must have for fans of Fantasy, RPG's, MMO's, adventuring.8.5/10			"

												The Everquest Franchise has always been a great experience. I have played Since 2004 - Everquest I and II. Since Everquest II came out around the same time another big MMO name came out, they seemed alot like the same game. But the changes and the hard work that the developers have put into it, listening to players; allowed the game to evolve. The game has become easier to use while still a challenge to play. I am very excited that they decided to go Free-to-Play, it allow us to play it and taste the game before deciding to dedicate ourselves. The key elements that I love about this game is the storyline and the combat system. The monsters and bosses in the game ""learn"" as you fight it , making it harder and harder as time passes. The story and the system make it so realistic and enjoyable no matter what you are doing. You dont only have to fight monsters to enjoy the game either, theres an entire other side to the gameplay. Which involves crafting; creating items for housing and for characters to use. You can specialize in armour making or even just making wood crafted furniture for housing. It has a simular leveling system and somewhat of a mini game to each attempt to making this product. I enjoy the creativity, I enjoy the flexibility, and I enjoy the friendly community.With the constant acceptance of feedback to the GM's and the staff, both players and the employees at SOE create a wonderful game that anyone can enjoy.

												This is truly the most entertaining piece of computer gaming in the modern era.  The success and popularity of this grand-daddy of all MMOs is self-evident; modern MMOs rarely deviate from the pattern laid in stone by this game, and even modern MMOs like Rift and Aeon have ripped features directly from this legendary game.  The screenshots do not do the dazzling, vibrant world justice: the world literally feels alive!  I had to slap myself numerous times and remind myself that I was only playing a game -- it's that immersive!  Whether you want to be a powerful warrior or a devious spellcaster, you'll find a rich world of challenges awaiting you within.  But don't just take my word for it -- jump in!  The world of Azeroth awaits!			"

												its okay, but not great, thats just it. It has so much potential as a free to play game, but you cant play free unless you are in a clan. tradeing is limited, and thus so is your ability to play free. you can not buy krono if youre a free player, and you can not sell things on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono. if you can see past limitations and want a good game to explore, this game is for you.the crafting system is a nice feature, though the sounds may put you to sleep as it is very relaxing.overall, the game is more of a 7/10 for what it has to offer, but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitations if you just want to play free.update: I dont know what the hell happened but the game is now riddled with bugs. you are officially better off playing runescape!

												You shoudnt judge the game by what people say... even if they spent 6 years and so on on the game... The games F2P with years of worth of content for you to explore. I have been looking for an mmo to play thats worth investing my time. Time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking. Believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap. I have 6 hours on record I wont lie to you. Game is good, Try it. It has everything an mmo needs to have and more. The game isnt ruined by what people say. It isnt pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing. If you are looking for that classic feel look no other. This games got history. It has attidute and it will consume you. Just give it a go you can always uninstall. For more information about subscriptions etc here.http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/Membership_Matrix_(EQ2) "

												I won't deny it, this game shows its age.That said, for all the F2P conversions, this game isn't quite that bad. all races/classes unlocked to start save for the ones that were pay to unlock even for subbers, free access to all the content save for the 2 last expansions, a more traditional leveling speed, (no capping in a week like in WoW), this will keep you for a good long time before you feel the need to put money into it.That said, if you stay long enough that you hit a point where you're considering putting money into it, you're probably going to because you've played the game that long and it's holding your interest.One down side? it's going to be a game where you want to network with other people because there's going to be content you just can't solo.    If you're a veteran of older MMOs like the first EQ and UO, this won't bother you.			"

So much content I'll probably never get to all of it. I'm a quester, I've done over 3500 quests on one character.For those that haven't played, it is definately worth a try. I know some people that really like the housing part of the game and create intricate houses.  I strongly suggest joining a guild, but not just any guild, do some research to find a good fit.			"

												started playing this game with nothing but a few youtube videos to get me started. next thing i know i'm betraying a city and crafting tiles for my house with my little pixie on a string. the combat is slow at first so you just mash buttons until they are dead, it is best to have 3 hotbars open and blank so the new skills fill them up themselves. only two downsides i have sadly found with this is 1. the constant popup of the all access members and 2. you cant write a very long Bio :'( i was really getting into crafting a false backstory when it cut me short.

												In the sake of full disclosure Everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life.  With that said, and me having gone deep into EQ2 I thought it time to write a proper review of MY take on the game good, bad, and the so so.I found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly.  The game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.The amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable.  Over 25 classes (only 1 or 2 need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and 21 races (2 of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available).  An let's address that quickly.  Yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, 2 races and 2 classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka ""rent"") and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts.  HOWEVER, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over 100 to 200 hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see 10 years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids.  Now I went sub, ( I choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations I did not want.  However, again I stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like Skyrim and have over 150 to 200 hours of free content to see and experience.An while the style of game is dated after 10 years and the combat again very classic Everquest or World of Warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus.  I do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more ""alive"" like Guild Wars2 or Rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.For people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (75% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience.  You can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo.  Since this game has been out 10 years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.The only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being 10 years old at this point is the dated UI (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd.  Definately advise you find a good community, active player base since I think (I do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on.  However, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.Overall, while this was not Everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the Everquest saga before the next chapter in Everquest starts.  To any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world.			"

												It's changed a surprising amount from when it first came out, to the flop when everyone left to WoW, to now. Complete zone overhauls, and it's a lot more fun now that it's free to play. I liked this game, but other games offered more for the subscription cost. Now I can play for free and still have fun.			"

												You shoudnt judge the game by what people say... even if they spent 6 years and so on on the game... The games F2P with years of worth of content for you to explore. I have been looking for an mmo to play thats worth investing my time. Time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking. Believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap. I have 6 hours on record I wont lie to you. Game is good, Try it. It has everything an mmo needs to have and more. The game isnt ruined by what people say. It isnt pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing. If you are looking for that classic feel look no other. This games got history. It has attidute and it will consume you. Just give it a go you can always uninstall. For more information about subscriptions etc here.http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/Membership_Matrix_(EQ2) "

I'm not saying this is the best of any of the categories, but it is certainly one of the richest in characterization.

It's definitely worth the subscription; However, the graphics are very, VERY out dated- after all, the game came out in 2002 or 2003 (I don't really remember).

												This game is really fun, although it might take awhile to level up and get used to the controls and find a guild etc that's willing to invite you into their guild, I think that the community is pretty awesome, once you join a guild, that is. Some people you encounter are kind of helpful, say your running around and then a higher level guy comes alnog and you party up, theres a mentor option, and that bringgs the higher level player to your own level allowing you to get exp, because if not, you don't get the exp nor does the higher level player, but then they don't get the exp anyway because they out level pretty much whatever area your in anyway... if thats the case. all in all, I feel like its polished and would recomend (and yes, this revew sucks)10/10			"

												Ah Everquest, we meet again. This ♥♥♥♥ing nostalgic timesink is something that I wouldn't really call a videogame, an adventure rather, an experience. A phase. It comes and goes, sometimes it lasts for a long while, sometimes a short burst. A lot of the time you find yourself returning, 'back to basics' and such.This ♥♥♥♥er is very different to the first Everquest, yet still deep and loving. You can explore with friends and go on a mystical journey, or more importantly you can go on your own. The lone warrior, adventurer, explorer. You will fail, you will succeed, you'll dance, laugh, cry, heck you'll even fall asleep. You will gain knowledge of the lore, aquire sets of particular skill, view many landscapes and battles till your eyes tear up.Everquest is now on steam and in the heart it hasn't changed a bit, although the population is now 3, the graphics outdated and I don't recommend it at all.I lied. I do recommend it, the thousands and thousands of ♥♥♥♥ing hours that I've spent, scream at me to recommend it, even though I don't want to. It's Everquest or your life, you choose.You only get one childhood... and one adulthood, Norrath or your ♥♥♥♥ing life.Play it or don't, doesn't really matter to me, the original is deeper and worse for your health, this one is slightly more casual.Just watch where you step.

												I've put quite a bit of time into this game over the years. No it's not WoW, but I see that as a good thing. WoW is a monolith of it's own and deserves a notable step forward in online gaming for the time it was released.  Everquest 2 is geared to a more mature/higher attention span audience.   You won't level from 1 to 92 in a couple weeks, but the leveling can be fun if you mix your play types just right. There is so much content that has been added to this game over it's going-on 8 year run. The graphics still look very nice, and there is a great community to be tapped into (although some of the community has been diluted since free to play). But due to the fact that it is now free to play, and you don't have to spend $250+ just on expansions like I've done as they came out, give this game a go!! There is much to be enjoyed here.			"

No one gives you this level of content without a pay wall. $40 for the top tier expansion, virtually everything else is available for free and isn't behind some insane grind that premium members can skip.

It's 2014 and i wish more people would play this game i am considering buying the expansion. The game has smooth levellng, and nice graphics so far. The only thing i don't like is how needy the graphics are.			"

												My referral link (can use existing account if you haven't played for 6 months): {LINK REMOVED}http://alturl.com/t74ogEverquest II is an open-world MMORPG whose basic controls are similar to World of Warcraft, but whose integral mechanics and interface are quite different (and really, dramatically superior.)As an SOE game, Everquest II shares its Station Cash currency with all other SOE games: Everquest 1, DC Universe Online, PlanetSide 2, and even Free Realms. Because of this, taking advantage of SC-related offers in one game is redeemable in any other game.LORE AND SETTINGEverquest II takes place in a low-mid-fantasy world. Although it has fairies and lizard people and other stuff, they are portrayed relatively realistically. Early locations in particular are quite grounded and not really all that fantastic or colorful.Fortunately, Everquest II doesn't take its seemingly-serious setting very seriously, especially compared to WoW, and much of the setting is self-deprecating (try learning Faerlie.) Despite that, it has a few rules in its lore that limit the player just a smidgen.For instance, the playable classes are aligned good, neutral, or evil... as are the races. If you pick a ""good"" class, you can't pick an ""evil"" race, and vice versa; even though you can Betray your alignment and play as the opposite once you reach level 10. This is a bit of a bummer.On the plus side, you will automatically start with knowledge of your race's language (in addition to ""Common"") and thus not have to do a quest to learn it.COMBATLike World of Warcraft, you have strafe and turn buttons, left-click turns the camera without turning you, and right-click turns the camera while turning you. You must target -before- using a skill and are subject to ""implied target"" (e.g. casting heal on an enemy will heal your friend being attacked by said enemy instead), two things I've never been fond of. However, you don't have to be facing an enemy at the time you choose to attack it - your character will just turn and face them before attacking.Some enemies are linked together in parties called encounters, and attacking one of them will cause -all- of them to retaliate. Encounters can get into the dozens for creatures like herd animals and raiders.Your character's ""auto-attacks"" are a bit slow, especially at the start of the game. Your primary means of sustained damage will therefore be skill spams. Although skills consume Power, it's very rare (at least in the early levels) to run out of it, as it isn't spent very quickly and it renegerates more rapidly when not in combat.The game uses the logically questionable hate / threat system wherein you can force NPC enemies to only ever attack your tank despite any reasonable combatant knowing that your healer or mage would be better to take out first.Developing your character's combat abilities relies on several factors.- Ordinary experience gain and level, which will give you most of your skills and raise their Rank;- Character and Focus traits, earned on level multiples and giving you further boosts to certain skills or stats;- Alternate Advancement (Lv 10+), earned alongside of but separately to level and spent to obtain new skills and power up existing ones; and- Research (Lv 20+), allowing you to increase skill Mastery (separate from Rank but every bit as important.) You can research at any time but it will take hours to days to finish research.- Prestige (much higher than Lv. 20) is basically badder-♥♥♥ AA.Your account status determines how high you can raise your skill Masteries via Research.- Free accounts can only raise up to Adept (3rd level of mastery.)- Silver account (one-time $5.00 charge to keep permanently) can raise up to Expert (4th level of mastery.)- Gold account (subscription) can research up to Grandmaster (6th and final level of mastery.)You don't have to have these account status to USE the skills at that mastery, or to acquire them through non-Research means - you just need that status to Research up to that level.MENTORING & CHRONOMAGEGot a friend to play? Already level 60 when your friend just started at level 1?NO PROBLEM.Party with them and you can temporarily lower yourself to match their level. Your skills and gear will power down too, but it will still be better than a natural of the target level.What's that? You want to go hunt low-level gear for Transmute but you're too high so they don't drop? And you don't have a friend of that level?NO PROBLEM.Go find the Chronomages in Qeynos and temporarily level down to any multiple of 5.CRAFTINGOf all MMO's I have played, Everquest II plays second in its crafting system only to Vanguard. Like Vanguard, crafting level is separate from adventure level and the player participates in a small minigame to craft, but it isn't anywhere near as engaging or strategic - you merely craft in four-second increments and press one of your six skill buttons to counter problems. Unlike Vanguard, crafting of any kind is integrally tied to adventure, or else you won't be able to safely gather ingredients yourself. You will also more or less be unable to mastercraft.Crafting also benefits from its own separate Alternate Advancement, and with Chains of Eternity you can also get Crafting Prestige. However, these AA's are earned with crafting experience and not adventure experience.MOUNTS AND AESTHETICGuess what? You can use mounts in combat. No worries!Everquest II is also smart enough to realize that costume items shouldn't give you any stats, so they don't.Anything you can put in an equipment slot that changes your appearance can be put in the equivalent appearance slot (including mounts.) The only drawback? You can't put ""nothing"" in your appearance slot unless you purchase the invisible costume items during a city festival (e.g. invisible gloves so your hands look bare.) However, you can toggle on and off your headgear, your cape, and your mount (Character window --> Options.)Upon reaching level 20, you can give your character a last name, which can be changed for free once a week. You can also change your prefix and / or suffix title whenever you want, assuming you've earned one.CLOSINGEverquest II is a fine game by modern standards, though it has a few quirks I would change.Remember to Transmute all equipment you no longer need or else you will be gimped in Transmute until you can chronomage at level 20.

												EQ 2 is a cut above with all the tweeks and changes made in response to player feed back.  This game is truely a spectacular MMO that feels similar to the way EQ1 made me feel when I logged in day one in March 1999.  It is to this day the only MMO I go back to if I am in the mood for some multiplayer.  Remember the days when a class had a specific duty and you had to pull your weight in a group?  EQ 2 has a little of this now, I will be honest, but it still feels like if I am a tank I am not a dps.  I am not a shaman/melee dps with dual weilding... I digress.  Give this a shot, you might find yourself lost in Norath, and if you don't want to jump in yet, give a look to Everquest Next.  Sony might not be following Verrants old ideals, but I think they might be remembering why we played in the first place.			"

												recently picked this game up again - not on Steam (over-complicates the installation when having to run a Windows version of Steam and then installing it through that - just easier to get it from the website and run it from WINE there).ANYWAY.  This game is great.  The housing system is actually the best one I've seen in any game - so far, EverQuestNext looks as though it's going to have an even more amazing system.  Questing is fun, but pretty repetitious and remains so for quite a while.  Not sure if it's a low level thing, but it's a barren wasteland of very few players.  I would assume it's just level related, since the server I'm on always has a ""heavy"" load.Just an all around decent F2P MMORPG - check it out.  And message me on Steam if you wanna group up or something, I have 4 toons.			"

												Played this game back in 2004 on release. Saw it on steam under daybreak instead of SOE and gave it a try with it being free to play which it is. Levelup much easier and with dungeon/group finder it is quick to hop in and do something fun. Just working on a character from 1 to max or where you need to buy a pass/subscription which is only actually needed for the end game material. With as much fun as I've had when I get to that point I will get the extra pass. I wish more people would play this because it is the most content and fun filled free to play game I have found on steam. Have a friend to get to level 20 with and then the game really gets going. Still fun, and for someone new like the friends I play this with the game has plenty of tips and shows the new things going on and how to play. If anything this is at least worth a try. It's free for countless hours if you do end up enjoying it.			"

												Nice gameplay, nice storyline, interesting quests and NPCs, BAD optimization and slow support. If the last two problems were handled better this game would go shoulder to shoulder with WoW and some other top MMORPGs, but I think with the coming of Next that the community and support are simply dying. The game itself is worth your time, if you don't get angry over the bad optimization like I did. Still, I'd recommend this game for any classic MMORPG lover out there. 7/10			"

												In the sake of full disclosure Everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life.  With that said, and me having gone deep into EQ2 I thought it time to write a proper review of MY take on the game good, bad, and the so so.I found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly.  The game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.The amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable.  Over 25 classes (only 1 or 2 need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and 21 races (2 of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available).  An let's address that quickly.  Yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, 2 races and 2 classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka ""rent"") and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts.  HOWEVER, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over 100 to 200 hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see 10 years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids.  Now I went sub, ( I choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations I did not want.  However, again I stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like Skyrim and have over 150 to 200 hours of free content to see and experience.An while the style of game is dated after 10 years and the combat again very classic Everquest or World of Warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus.  I do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more ""alive"" like Guild Wars2 or Rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.For people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (75% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience.  You can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo.  Since this game has been out 10 years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.The only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being 10 years old at this point is the dated UI (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd.  Definately advise you find a good community, active player base since I think (I do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on.  However, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.Overall, while this was not Everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the Everquest saga before the next chapter in Everquest starts.  To any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world.			"

												Ive played this game longer outside of steam and all i have to say is that if you want to play this game do it i am always online and will be ready to guide someone around if anyone wants a henchman.			"

												I love the concept of EverQuest 2 all the races and character options, pvp,pve, guilds, houses. its a whole other world. it just sucks hard when you play alone. if anyone would like to play from level one and experience the game together we can play the game the right way and maybe give ourselves reason to pay for more content. just send me a message and we can let our adventure begin.

												i have been playing EQ2 since its inception. decent game for anyone who likes role playing. Crafting has always what i enjoy most, but EQ2 crafting is a really tedious game of whack-a-mole, constantly countering spells and getting whacked if you don't.  What i have found over the years is that mentoring has to be one of the greatest features in the game. Being able to down-level to help a friend or to just do low level quests is fantastic. i would give this game a B+			"

												Honestly i am nuetral about this game. It is great for anyone like me who loves mmorpg's or just anyone new to them. It is a beautiful game for something made years ago. But the combat system is quite wonky to put it lightly. It confuses a guy who loves mmorpg's like me and i cant wrap my head around how weird and broken it is.			"
