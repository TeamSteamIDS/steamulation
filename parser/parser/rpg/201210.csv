												I am going to give you the good the bad and the ugly of this game and let you make up your own minds about whether you are going to enjoy Poxnora or not.  To sum up this game quickly, I would say it's a cross between a collectable trading card game like MtG, a tabletop minatures game like Warhammer Fantasy and turn based tactics games like FF Tactics and Advance Wars.Where to start?  One thing I am going to stress to anyone considering this game is that at it's heart this is NOT a casual game.  Veteran players have learned an encylopedia of knowledge about this game.  Cards are divided into 4 types, Champions, Spells, Relics and Equipment.  There are hundreds of abilities and conditions that can used in this game, from the basics like block, dodge and stealth to the obscure like planarbound and encouraged.  What does this mean?  As a new player you are going to be confused while you slowly learn what all the hundreds of different cards do and how they interact.  What this also means however is that if you enjoy deep strategy there is simply nothing else like Poxnora.  Once you learn the game the sky is the limit as far as how many strategies you can employ.Is this Pay to Win?The short answer is yes, but not in an evil gimmicky cash grab way.  Like I said above this game is very much like MtG or Warhammer.  It is a hobby and a collection you build over time.  Almost everything is available to purchase with in game currency but there is a HUGE library of cards to be had.  This isn't going to appeal to everybody, but the people who it does appeal to will enjoy this game immensely because it is such a deep tactical game.  This is a skill game and a well made deck of low value cards can easily outplay a poorly made mash up of expensive power cards.  So it is certainly possible to find success relatively quickly without dropping any money on this game at all.  You build your collection over time with free cards you earn from playing and then you can bolster your collection by buying cards with real money as you see fit.How do I enjoy this game without spending a lot or any money?I recommend all new players go through the tutorials and the new player guides that were recently added.  These will reward you with free training decks and in game currency that you can use to start building your collection.  You can use in game currency to purchase packs and boxes or individual cards, so you can get the best cards for free.  There is also a PVP format that restricts to pre-made training decks so that you aren't facing opponents with lots of strong rare cards right away.  There is trading in this game so anything you earn with in game currency can be traded away to other players for something different you may want.My final advice would be to get to know the game and seek out help from the community whenever possible.  People will be more than willing to help point new players in the right direction if they ask.  There are community run pools of extra  cards to help new players get started and a lot of resources on the forums and fansites to help you learn the game.I highly recommend this game for it's deep gameplay and rich tactics.

												Edit: Based on the game many years ago, so some of this changed since then.PoxNora has a special place in my heart. I played it for hundreds of hours prior to steam when the game was still young and they had just changed the game to remove all random numbers (no ""hit chance"" or ""dice rolls"" - pure strategy without random numbers). Back then it was a revelation and since then most other strategy games I play ended up being disappointing when I compare them to PoxNora.Why did I quit and don't recommend it?It's a digital trading card game. You needed to invest significant money and trading to get a competitive deck. There were limited edition cards that were being sold for several hundred dollar. Then suddenly previously limited cards were suddenly sold on a ""first come"" basis without a warning, increasing in price the more frequently they were bought. Powerful legacy cards that rarely saw action got picked up for a dollar or two -- yet the price jumped very high within a day and most people missed out making the matches very unbalanced suddenly.Then the new expansions kept adding insane epic cards (powercreep...), while completely devaluing other cards. In the end I had to sell my cards because I had spend significant cash on them and the company kept devaluing them with each update.Moral of the story:There is a reason classic trading card games are being replaced by living card games (fixed expansions instead of booster packs) because people rightfully think trading card games are robbing their wallet. A game where you buy digital cards for insane costs yet the company only changes a database entry and at any point in time can make your investment worthless? Great idea. Thumbs down.			"

												This game is basicly chess on steroids. It has a learning curve that will break your neck and is played over a long run and there are many things to learn about it because it has a lot of tactical depth. But if you do stick around for all that, it is very rewarding in the end. Unfortunately we live in an age where people are used to instant gratification, and games are not perceived as food for brain anymore. Do I recommend it? Yes I do, but not to everyone.			"

												Fantastic game. A new company, Desert Owl Games, have really reinvented the game, in a brilliant way. Its has a very similar ""free to play"" feel akin to Hearthstone imo with its daily income of ingame gold, but without the current ""Arena"" draft system. Drafting wil hopefully be reimplemented in the near future. The game has great depth and variety with thousands of runes to choose from when building your decks or just your collection. The artowrk is excellent and the lore is detailed and tells a very interesting story. 8 factions to choose from all with hundreds and hundreds of runes unique to that faction. Almost all content is able to be purchased in the marketplace with in game gold aswell as real money. A loyal and still active community is nice to see. The game caters for both PvE and PvP players. A really good game that combines elements of TCGs, CCGs, RPGs, F2P games, and turn based strategy games to create an excellent and very addictive experience. Highly recommended. Give it a try and have fun battling the denizens of Poxanthu.			"

												Ah, Poxnora...This game has all the potential in the world and at the same time the potential to fail at any moment. Poxnora is not a game that you will open for the first time and instantly love, but rather after you climb the learning wall you will see a game that rewards real tactical play and creativeness with its own unique features and lore. In pox, you can talk directly with the devs and high ranking members of the community which is great for expressing your opinions and thoughts on the game.  The hearthstone-like system allows you to craft runes, but in the end you will most likely need so spend a small amount of money on the game to get rolling. I love this game, and I hope that many more people will find it and take the time to learn and enjoy it.			"

												Good to see PoxNora back on Steam, download it and get started. My best advice for beginners is not to look at rarity as terms of power, a combination of commons and uncommons can take down a poor group of exos and legs.Poxbase.com is a 3rd party deck building site so you can theorycraft a bg while looking for games (DOGz needs to get a web developer and make a similar module WITHIN their website or buy out poxbase, but for now the system works)Poxbox.net is also a 3rd party trading system, it shouldn't be taken for gospel, but is the best place for pricing and acquiring new runes.Another good suggestion is goin on the forums and reading the combo threads within each faction, you will see a majority of battlegroups focused around these type of gimics so don't cheat yourself by not reading them. This is not a game of who has the more expensive runes (DOGz is making a good effort to make them all obtainable) rather a game of skill (through knowledge/experience) and whoever better knows their own battlegroup.

												If you're into fast action, don't play this game. If you like strategy, in any form at all, play this game. I don't really like how limited the ""free"" of this free-to-play game is, but the mechanics are sound and thoughtful.			"

												Pox Nora struggled through a long and arduous phase of being owned and subsequently undervalued by Sony Online Entertainment. A menagerie of bugs and balancing changes would go unresolved for months, it was extremely difficult to break into the game as a new player, and the the game had a distinct pay-to-win model unless a player was savvy enough to take advantage of third party resources like PoxBox and the like.And then it all changed.No, the fire nation didn't attack, Desert Owl Games came to be, and took over PoxNora for the better (far, far better). With the advent of DOG's game revamp, the entire collection of more than 1,300 cards were redesigned and retuned, the maps were uppdated, mechanics and the engine were retuned, the player rewards system was completely reinvented, and the free-to-play model was resdesigned to eliminate the necessity to spend money.Now, it is extremely easy for new accounts to break into the game, receiving dramatically more gold per day from new challenges in addition to the daily skirmish, a new, highly expanded and more rewarding tutorial system has been implemented, a new skirmish mode has been implemented that dishes out free runes, and now all runes are available for purchase with gold rather than cash with the exception of the most recently released expansion pack.The revamp is still in swing and changes still need to be made, but Desert Owl Games are really putting effort into making PoxNora a good game again, and are very public and open with the changes they make. They have implemented a new player council to aid them in development and provide an officiated voice for the players, and are just generally cool dudes.Whether you're brand new or you long abandoned the game, this shiny new construction is definitely worth giving Pox a chance.

												PoxNora is an old favorite of mine I can't help but play a bit here and there throughout the day. Steam doesn't like the launcher, so my time is certainly up around 1,000 hours, and while I only have a handful of the legendary rarity runes, that's not what this game is about. Anyone who claims PoxNora is pay to win, or pay to play in its current incarnation, clearly missed a lot of updates.It is entirely possible to be competetive in PoxNora with all commons. That's not fair to say when you get matched with anyone whom has amassed every rune in the game to date, and knows the metas, but generally speaking, Desert Owl Games makes every attempt to balance runes to reflect a general value, and metagame viability. There are good commons, there are ""meh"" commons. There are good legendaries, there are ""meh"" legendaries. If you're clever with your battlegroup composition, no PvE campagin should be an issue for you.But if you have some sort of morbid obsession with PvP (which I just don't get), nothing's stopping you from utilizing Steam or the forums to find fellow new players and generally anyone willing to ""scrub up"" and break out their low-tier battlegroups to mentor you a bit. There are seldom a dozen players on these days, but we're overjoyed when we see a new name in the lobby (and we look).As it stands, barring limited edition runes from past events, PoxNora can be play 100% F2P. There is no non-limited edition rune you cannot get from playing F2P, and ALL runes are tradeable. The only immediate limit is that the newest expansion available will always be for premium currency only, but using the rune trader, or PoxBox— the automated, unofficial ""rune pool"" —you can trade for any rarity, including limited edition, from any expansion.So if anyone actually finds this game's listing in the sandpit that is the Steam store, reads this review, and might be interested in the game, let me know. I've been around, I've seen some things. I'm totally willing to do some practice matches, or help you construct your first F2P battlegroup. A lot of the common-only options are actually quite appealing, I find.			"

												In many ways I am and will always be searching for my next Pox Nora. This game to me was what World of Warcraft was to many of my friends. I eventually burnt myself out on this game but it took over 1,000 hours and YEARS of playing many hours every week. In the end the disaster that was and is Sony Online screw it up royally and I finally bowed out. Since SOE lost the license things have been improving. Over the last few years I have checked in here and there and I am happy to see the product is returning to its former glory. I doubt I will ever find another game I loved as much as this one.If you are a stategy, ccg, fantasy, tactical, or gamer period you owe it to yourself to give this a try. The dated UI is not getting better but the game mechanics and depth more than make up for it. The game is now truly free to play and worthy of your time.10/10 suck it objectivity			"

												I have only racked up 156.6 hours on Steam, I have just moved from client to Steam, but I have been playing since 2007 (Playtime is in the 1000's).I would 100% recommend this game.Little Pox History:This game has been through it's times, it was ran by 'Octopi' then bought out by 'SoE'.SoE then left the game for dead for a long time, until the some of the original owners came back (Desert Owl Games). They are currently having to undo so much damage that SoE caused, but you can see real progress, as well as that, their ambition and passion for their game will make it better then ever.The Game:There is quite a big learning curve in this game, and it can get a while to get used to just how many different things there are and just how to play, but again the Owls have been doing a lot to help towards the NUX. But once you've got into the game, you can't escape Poxnora's addictive claws, in a good way!There are over 2,000 different runes (Champions/Spells/Equipment and Relics) spread across 8 factions, oh and each champion has its own upgrade choices! Your BG creativity will never be dulled by the lack of combinations you can create!FREE TO PLAY: This is a huge thing, since the Owls have come, they have made so much more accessible for FREE, with in game gold (earned from doing single player / skirishers / PvP (normal and ranked) you can buy nearly all runes and can buy all avatars and single player campaigns.The Forums are a place not for the feint-hearteded for poxnora, but they are like every game forum, no one is ever happy with everything. If people lose stuff they whine saying its overpowered, or their stuff is underpowered.Don't let this detere you either, as the community is one of the most helpful, as every player that joins is another player to fight against in the future!I hope to see people in-game, and I would glady help in anyway possible! /w BigToastie			"

												I was so excited when I saw that Pox Nora had switched to a new owner! And then I found out that it was available on Steam! (I don't know if this is a new thing, or if PN has been on here a long time, but for me it was new.) I decided to give it a try, despite bad experiences previously, and I was overjoyed to see that the client had gotten major updates; it looks fantastic and is very easy to navigate. and Desert Owl includes various daily challenges to help people new to the game to catch up. There is also a set of activities that all new players must travel before they can jump into an actual multiplayer competition, each of which also adds to the player's bank and allows them to score new ""runes"" (cards.) There is a microtransaction mechanic in which a player can buy rune packs (thus the bank of game coins that I mentioned,) but players can also join a ""training"" match, in which players have balanced starter decks and only player skill counts.The gameplay was just as fun as I remembered, too. Essentially, each player generates ""nora"" (mana) automatically each turn, and they can then play runes from their hand onto the board. Some runes are characters, others are equipment that is played directly onto said characters, and some are spells that have instant effects on the boardstate. The board also has nodes, locations that can be captured by characters that move into their sphere of influence. Nodes give extra nora each turn and act as secondary (or sometimes primary) summoning locations for the characters. Ultimately, each player is trying to destroy their opponent's primary summoning point, a shrine, and receive a revamped animation as the building is destroyed by magical explosions or stone spires that stab upward through the ground, or...But.As the Curators' recommendation explains, this game ""took a trip down the p2w slope under SOE."" I was there, and I saw this happen. I played, and I payed. I have a collection of runes from that time, but when I began playing, I quickly found that, 1.) nobody plays the skill-only training matches, and 2.) everybody's decks are still broken at the bottom of the p2w slope. I thought I might just have been a poor strategist until I hung out in the chat forum and read people's posts; nope, I still believe that I am a poor strategist, but this does not account for the entirety of the current metagame. Pox Nora involves runes of various rarities, from common to rare. Wait, no, then there is Exotic. Oh, also legendary. You get the idea. Further, according to the players talking in the forum, two of whom were in the top 5 players in the current iteration of the game, a player must have no fewer than 5 exotics to be competitive.The curators claim that the game was ""reclaimed by the old devs and revamped."" I believe this is true, but the p2w slope is slippery, and the game has not recovered. It is still crouched at the bottom of the p2w slope, and if you want to be competitive, you will have to descend to its level to do so.			"

												I remember when this game first came out.  Back in the days when you had to launch it from your browser.  It has evolved quite a bit in its accessibility [for the better, of course!].As many reviewers have already said, this game is easy to learn, hard to master.  It is turn-based strategy meets collectible card game, and it is done in a masterful way.  If you like turn-based strategy and/or cc games, give it a try.  It is a quick download, and it will run on a toaster, so you have nothing to lose.  I am so happy to see this game back on Steam.			"

												""So, imagine a TCG except you play your cards into a hex-based battlefield and your units must advance onwards to the opponent's shrine (like their nexus in LoL), positioning themselves near fonts along the way to give you bonus mana. Once you kill your opponent's shrine, you win!""""So, duelyst?""""Well, yeah, except that the battlefield is WAY BIGGER, fonts (mana spring tiles) can be contested by the enemy if the enemy is nearby them, and they provide a mana bonus as long as you control them. Also, cards have more than just attack and health - they have AP, which they gain every turn depending on their speed. They use this AP to do everything - move, attack, use special abilities""""Huh.""""Yeah, and there's stuff like terrain on the battlefield too. Also, cards have plenty of abilities, ranging from stuff like Flight and Damage Shield to things like Boon of the Wind (grant bonus to closest friendly flying unit when played) and Escape (gain stealth after damaged at end of turn)""""Stealth? How would that work?""""It's really cool - basically your opponent just no longer sees the unit. It stays hidden until it is revealed somehow - say, you attack with it, your opponent moves a unit onto the exact same spot, casts an AoE spell which damages the unit. Some units have detection which reveal stealthed units in a radius around it.""""Sounds really complex""""And it is. Takes a lot of time to learn. But it's a really good game. There's no RNG in attacks - no accuracy, no criticals, That intro above? Doesn't even say anything about relics or equipment, deckbuilding rules, faction bonuses, range etc.""That said, the game is really good once you sink your teeth into it. It stopped being p2p when it got acquired from SOE (it used to be that you can only acquire new cards with real cash), there's even a training grounds mode where you can only use preset decks to play with, so in that mode you're not losing out due to a low collection. But that said, you will lose lots and lots of games against experienced players because you just don't know how to play well.			"

It combines CCG and miniatures elements in a fantasy setting with a close-knit player community, and I can't see myself quitting until the game itself has shut down.If you decide to play it, it's technically Free to Play, although you should know that if you want to be a competititve top-ranked player you definitely will need to make some purchases. If you want to just relax and have fun though, you can get MANY of the game pieces via in-game currency and many players have made ""F2P"" accounts and maintained top ranks with them.There's an expansion with 70-80 new game pieces every 3 months or so, along with a ""midterm"" expansion every month and a half with 8 new ""Legendary"" game pieces, so PoxNora is continually expanding the thousands of pieces it features. I recommend this game to anyone who's into M:tG or turn-based strategy, for sure.			"

												Excellent game once you learn and figure things out.  The best TCG out there, tons of awesome artwork and different options to build your deck, plus the satisfaction of seeing your runes (cards) in action on the battlefield.  Nothing else like it that I've found.  The negative reviews I have seen are just people that haven't tried the game for long enough to give it a real chance, or people that simply don't like the genre.  Even those, if given time, would realize how exceptional this game is.  Improvements have been made recently and will continue to be made in the future.			"

												I've been playing Poxnora on and off since 2008/09. You can immagine - that's a long time. And I saw it's good and bad sides. There are a lot of good sides in this game and only a few ( now ) of downsides. Back in 08/09 this game was full ""pay to win"" type of a game. You could only get basic, pathetic, starter decks, that couldn't level up at all and you couldn't buy any packs with virtual money ( gold ) that you get from playing. Basically, gold was non-existent back then.Then SOE ( Sony Online ) took over. They made it ""free to play"" finaly with implementing gold which you could spend on buying individual high value runes. Then, you could trade those high value runes for a bunch of smaller value ones that you need for your decks. And the more you played the game, the more you got ""rich"" and could build a better, more competitive deck.Then DOG ( Desert Owl ) took back the game again. They nerfed 95 % of the runes ( by the way completely destroying all of my high value runes by doing that ), but I think it made the game more balanced now. A lot more balanced actualy. There ARE still some overpowered high value runes ( mostly legendaries ), which are hard to kill on the ""battlefield"", but a lot less of them, than before, when SOE was running the game. You can't buy individual runes anymore with gold, but now you can buy packs and boxes with it. Which I think is even better ( lot better ). Since in those boxes and packs, you have 10% for an exo and 5% for each exo to become a legendary. So, if you are lucky, you can get on a roll and get rich a LOT faster than we used to, when we had to grind gold like madmen, to get the rune which was worth 150 000 gold. ( there were 500 000 gold runes later as well ).This game is unique in so many ways. Strong deck is not the only thing you need. You need to closely put together your deck considering a lot of things ( stealth detection, destroying equipment, anty-spell, anty-heal, boost-heal etc ) all depending on your deck synergy. And then, you also have to play the perfect game once the match starts, with perfect strategy, since every bad move might mean turnover and you losing the game, no matter how good your deck is. I remember beating 10-15 games in a row in ranked matches with only common / uncommon / rare runes, but in a deck which had amazing synergy and me focused on the game 100%. So if you are looking for a CONSTANT challenge, never the same battles, literally MILLIONS of possible deck builds, this IS THE GAME! Elves, Dwarves, Barbarians, Demons, Liches, Undead, Zombies, Witches, Paladins, Warriors, Voils, Dragons, Lizards, Swamp creatures, Frogs, Snakes, Beasts, Fairies, Treefolk, Wizards, Titans, Constructs - they are ALL in this game spread out into 8 unique factions! Don't even look for anything else, there just isn't anything like it out there. This game is amazing!			"

												Here is a ""big picture"" review: not about the game's specifics, but rather about the overall experience of playing it. Despite what Steam's hours display, I've been playing this game off and on since 2008 or 2009; I've sunk at least hundreds of hours into it, and hundreds of dollars. I had never played any collectible trading card games before Pox Nora, but I've always liked turn-based strategy games, everything from Chess to Warhammer to Civilization.So, I'll be writing this review from that sort of perspective ... as well as from the perspective of one of the game's players who's put as much of his playing time into its single-player campaigns (which are numerous by now, to say the least, after many years worth of clockwork expansions) as multiplayer matches.Pox Nora is Chess on steroids.If you've ever played one of the earlier Master of Orion games (I or II), and then played Space Empires IV or V, it's that level of ""next level"" that I'm speaking of. Forget steroids, actually. More like PCP, no, screw it, bath salts, face-eating, madness inducing, streaking down the highway naked, bath salts.Chess is an unforgiving game of skill that involves some luck; while card games can often be unforgivingly about luck, despite all the skill involved.When I was younger, I took a regular 52-card deck of poker cards, and four sets of Chess pieces (16 per player), and helped my nephew construct a Chess variant with fantasy-themed factions and different kinds of ameliorating strategies for each.Hearts were courageous and noble and were aligned with ""good"" magic-using Diamonds; Clubs were cunning and nefarious and were aligned with ""evil"" necromancy-using Spades. Cards drawn and used went on a cool-down pile.All of these cards represented magical abilities or special moves but, in a sense, can all be boiled down to difficulty softeners; they added variety and complexity to Chess, which is fun ... but probably stripped away much of its difficulty, having given each faction 13 ameliorating ""get out of jail"" cards if played halfway decently (52 cards divided by four ""factions"" equals 13 cards per faction). Still, somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose; it's still a game of strategy.Well imagine my delight at discovering Pox Nora, a game that features eight factions (""good and evil"" alignments intact, allowing two versus two multiplayer), hundreds of playing pieces and thousands of cards representing spells, abilities, artifacts, even structures (30 of which can be fielded per faction, per game, including faction-split 15/15 decks) ... as well as playing-boards that turn Chess's flat, 64-square environment on its ear, with elements of terrain, cover, strategic points, magic zones, and so on.Pox Nora's campaigns, many of them free to play, go even further with imaginative scenarios and storylines that will take your playing pieces and decks across scrolling, irregular playing-boards reminiscent of table-top wargaming.In other words, Pox Nora took the 52-card deck, 64-piece bag of steroids I dreamed up, and poured bath salts all over it.If you can't see how flipping cool that is, get out of here, you're fired.

												This game is crack cocaine...It is suprisingly deep.  It is alot like chess only you get to choose what pieces you bring to the board.  I wish they would make a Pox Nora 2 with updated graphics, I would back that for sure.  Very fun and free to play, the cash shop is available to speed up the process, but I have enjoyed the leveling up.  The UI is hard to deal with but in the forums the devs say they are working on it.  Hope this is helpful.			"

												I don't usually bother to review games, but this game deserves a real mention.This is a 2 player chess like fantasy game where you summon champions from your deck each turn and send them to destroy your opponents shrine, equiping them with various weapons, casting spells and deploying relics along the way.Its also a collectable game where you obtain new runes through play gradually building more powerful decks, this is quite addictive in inself as you want to try all the different playstyles but need to invest serious play time in order to get all the runes (or real cash if you prefer, but its NOT Pay To Win!!!).Firstly you have to look past the some would say 10+ year old graphics, and the annoying little quirks (like you have to go into the rune forge twice to be able to view runes) and the fact that you can't play in full screen mode or resize the screen.But if you do there lies a game which is strategically ahead of its time, there is soooo much depth and some brilliant design ideas at play.Some of the real gems amongst the play themes  include:Stitched: which are evil rag dolls come to life, upon death they turn into a pile of rags which you can then reanimate again,Worms: where your deploy zone grows each time you deploy one gradually overwhelming your opponent as you deploy behind his linesWtiches: where using a certain spell can make them incredibly powerful.Zombies: a shambling wall of diseased meat spreading disease as they goSkeletons: boney anahilationLiches: telepoting undead magesSpirits: invisble deathDread: where you use champions which lower your foes damage rendering them near uselessand that's just the 'Forsaken Wastes' faction, there are 7 others with just as much depth and variation to choose from:Savage Tunda: Think snow people, creatures that like cold, Yetis etcForglar swap: Frogmen and other kinds of weird swamp creaturesIronfist Stronghold: Humans, dwarfs, clerics, babarians etcUnderdepths: All kinds of weird and wacky DemonsKithir Forest: Elves & forest creaturesSundered Lands: Dinosaurs, Lizardmen, creatures from a bygone ageShattered peaks: Hill/mountain creatures such as Cyclops, a flying critter race and various goblin type thingsAll these can then be sub divided into various races/play style just like the previously described Forsaken Wastes faction.You are in fact free to combine any champions as you see fit to come up with ingenius combos that wreck face.There are currently over 2000 runes to choose consisting of champions, relics, spells and equipment from which to design your deck (30 runes) with more added every quarter.I could go on, but if you have read this far, what are you waiting for its free so give it a try...I highly recommend this game, its simply genius.

												This game has always been one of the strongest battlefield tactics/strategy card games available. That being said it is not a game for eveyone.History Feel free to TLDR.This game has suffered a mixed history. It began its life small with not nearly enough content and prices comprable to magic cards, which was silly. As a reslt the origonal creator inevitably sold off his partly successfull game to another group who for some reason thought they could do better by doing nothing different. When they realized they were dumb they sold it on merrit of; a now larger card base, how good a game it was, and how established it was to Sony. Sony who proceeded to host the servers and change nothing. When sony realized they were stupd and finally thought to ask the question hey what is this and hy did we buy it again? They decided they would offload the cash hemoraging game on some poor other fellas. And here we are today.The newst owners have introduced some systems which make this game legitimatelly possible to play for free. Between the player to player untaxed card trading, and free pack give aways this game is now a game i reccomend.The game has a depth that no card game or strategy game has ever attained, so far. Your average round will have around 1000 damage smattered across a playing field and the the one who is victorious in a battle of equalls is the one who simply lets 75 of that damage fall to close to home. It's a exciting struggle of wits on a battle field that feels like true magic. With a game as old as this the stock of spells available leaves you guessing the kind of wizard your up against the whole way through, which is exactly as magic should be.Failings.*It's largest failing is the games pace is very slow. However the reason for this is the complexety of the tuns and thought behind them. Average game 40 minutes, 20 personal turns, 40 total.*The second failing is there are very pivitol game mechanics that are not explained anywere.*A HUGE learning curve, thankfully most of it can be done in single player.

												Have been playing since before Steam release. Pox is a tabletop card game. Pox has an awful reputation because of SOE's running it into the ground, but the new owner, Desert Owl Games, has gone an excellent job at reviving the game and lifting the crushing Pay-To-Win model. This is a strategy game and the average game takes 30-45mins. After the tutorial, the player needs to buy card packs, and it can take time to build up a playable deck. Patience is required, but with the lucrative daily challenges and campaigns, it doesn't feel monotonous or grindy at all. I very much enjoy this game and recommend it to players who enjoy these genres.			"

												I've only put a few hours into the game so far, but it is a very enjoyable blend of turn-based strategy and ccg.  Nearly ten years of content can be a bit intimidating, but since there is plenty of single-player stuff to do, you have the chance to learn without being trounced continually by older players.			"

												I love this game. I am an old-time CMG player who has been hankering to fill that same sort of itch. This delivers it in spades. It is complex and deep in a way a lot of strategy games are not these days, with huge amounts of variety in what you can build and play. The game's designers are also very responsive to well thought out criticisms from the fan base and are very active on the game's forums. I admit that there are some challenges for new players, the biggest of which is the fact that there are really a large amount of runes out there and that playing at first can be intimidating. If you are able to get past that, however, you will find that this game is so very worth it. I can easily say that this is my favorite game right now, and the only one that is still able to maintain my interest for any length of time. Highly recommended.			"

												 i recently clocked in at 800 hours on this game with steam alone and i felt i should post a review from the point of view of someone who is way over his head in this game.i started playing this game god knows how many years ago end i rarely completely stopped playing it, but i never binged or dieharded the game either. i feel the game is best enjoyed for an hour or two a day playing the daily's, building decks or playing PvP. The game is not that open at the beginning as you can feel like you miss all the great cards but because all cards that aren't limited or the latest expansion can be crafted you can get great decks without paying a huge amount of money over a good amount of playtime. it sometimes feels like it will take ages to make the deck you want but getting that great core card feels like a great achievement every time and most decks are playable on a PvE level without any legendary's or exotics. the gameplay and difficulty curve is smooth and you can get a real challenge out of the AI matches until you feel ready for PVP. i really enjoy this game for every hour it has given me and i highly encourage everyone to try it out because the gameplay is unlike anything else and it is just damn good.

												I have put a few hours into Pox Nora, and I really want to like it more. After playing several other games similar to it (Cards and Catsles on Android, Hearthstone [minus the tactics] and the amazing Duelyst), I think there are better options out there.Not to say that this game is bad - it's great. The art is incredible. The tactics are deep and have a ton of possibilities. Even choosing from the starter decks, there are so many play styles to choose from.

In 4 hours I got halfway through the introductory missions (admittedly I took some side steps to familiarize with other decks). I did not get to the PvP part of the game, so I cannot comment on the competitive play or community. Alll in all, it is a good game. I would give a 7/10, and encourage anyone to try it - it's free. I just feel like there is too much going on, where as Duelyst is more straightforward, quick, stylish and fun. Hopefully yall will find it fulfilling!			"

												It's a nice turn based strategy game with much, much depth and a lot of cards (runes) to collect.IMO, the best part is the fact that you're able to create your own battlegroup to play, tweaking a little bit your champions to better fit into your strategy; and be lucky and earn those expensive runes that everybody wants into packs. But this takes a good amount of time if you're going 100% free to play. So, or you will invest your time or your money in the game to make the cool stuff, this way, I can only recommend this game for those that like the genre and are willing to do one or another, or for those that are so casual to the point that will be happy playing with premade battlegroups (some are really competitive) until be able to create your own battlegroup.This game is running for a long time now, so, there is a lot of players that can pass over new players as if they are nothing because they have much better runes or because they developed really good strategies.The greater cons of this game for me are the fact that sometimes appears updates that nerfs so much some runes that they become useless and that you may spend a really good amount of time just trying to find a PVP match.If you want to play for free, here is a little list of what you can do in a way that may give you a notion of how much time you will spend to earn cool things in this game:- you can earn common, uncommon and rare runes pretty easy and exotic or legendary if you're lucky;- you can destroy useless runes for points to forge new ones;- you can get old runes by winning certain matches, some of those runes are really good, others, really bad - these runes are worth 1, 2, 10, 40 and 60 points in the forge, according to their rarity, if you wanna to destroy them to earn points. There are newer runes that will give 2, 5, 25, 120, 240 points in the forge when destroyed. While will cost 5, 10, 12, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 720 to be made, according to their rarity;- you can forge and destroy pretty much any rune, except: limited runes and runes from the last expansion;- you can win gold in the end of each match. This game uses a time/difficulty reward system that will give you up to 300 base gold for the match (10 gold per min in the hardest lvl), what is like a 30 min match in expert mode (it's a rewarding system that will not reward your skills, because there are matches that you may spend more than 30 min and will get the limit of 300 gold and others that you will finish in 5 min and will win 50 gold) and some extra small amounts of gold for some achievements during the battle, like playing a match where each side loses 20 champions;- you can earn extra gold with the daily missions, will be more than 1500 gold per day if you complete all missions - and I think that there is a limit of 10k gold that you can earn per day;- you can purchase packs that costs 2100 (not worthy) and 3510 gold (or use real money), but packs from the last expansion only can be purchased using money. Anyway, you can get runes from the last expansion through trading. Packs that you can buy with gold has a 10% chance to come with an exotic rune and 5% chance to come with a legendary rune;- you can purchase boxes with 10 packs that costs 19440 (not worthy, IMO) and 31950 gold (or using real money) - by buying these is guaranteed that one pack will come with an exotic rune;- you can try to trade runes with other players. The ""try"" is there because it's difficult to appear in the trade runes that are below the exotic rarity for you to make an offer and it is even more difficult to get offers for rare, uncommon and common runes that you put, unless they are the top tier of their rarity; and- you can use poxbox.net to trade with an online store. It uses a points balance system and have some limitations towards the amount and rarity of runes you trade in and out. Anyway, it will accept pretty much anything that you send to the store and you can get what they have in stock using the points that you have, but stay aware that in the points proportion, the house will always win - they use a system that gives you a notion of the demand/importance of each rune, so you can use it to see if the trade that you're doing with another player is worth, also is interesting that the points for each runes changes per minute, according to their demand and quantity in stock, so, it is like the stock exchange.

												Click this to see this review in a more properly spaced Fashion http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackDomainSirVain/recommended/201210/(I have no other reviews on steam but this is not my first review. Only my first on steam)First off i want everyone to know i am a gamer and not much else in lifeand i own ""nearly"" every home console on top of that.The reason i am telling you all this is so you know i have plenty of games to compare toand i don't pick favorites.Now the review of Pox Nora.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Early game.Some say the early game is both intimidating and slow. (Like a large portion of similar games)At the time of this review i have 17.3 hours in and my chosen group is composed almost entirly of common units.And although rarerer units can be better their not universally better. (barring a few poor exotic and legendary units)To give an example.There is a Exotic who can change into a dragon and gain 20% damage resistence. (40% in this case due to faction bonus)My 2 melee and 1 range units nearly killed him on his spawning turn without having to save up action points.(i did finish it off before the enemys turn using another range unit. Exotics are the second rarest units)As for the game being slow.I gained a full group i can fight with in 12 hours of gameplay.You need atleast 30 Runes total to fight with a custom group. (Runes are everything. Units. equipment. spells and so on)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Balance.Yes some units are poorly balanced and some are arguably majorly so.But those are vary rare and far between. In most cases one may suspect poor balence it is typically the luck of the drawthat actually is at fault. With such things as the enemy by complete chance having the exact group composition needed to counter most or even your entire group.(At which point it is a battle of pure skill and wits in order to win)In total there are 1388 champions in the game at this moment.(champions are any thing that can walk. Fly and attack)Of course there are many other runes in the game but this number is to show that someone having the exact group composition to counter your own is as rare an far between as the actual balance issues.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Replayability.the A.I. uses group compositions choosen at random from premade groups as well as picking randomly from other player's groups that have won matches recently(This includes player vs player and player vs A.I. matches it selects from)And as with any player versus player related replayability.It is up to you to decide how much time it is worth. (If any)Though compared to A.I. players can present a challenge. Enough to enrage a few i imagine from time to time.However don't quote me on that as i have not done player versus player yetand prefer the A.I.(Games like this tend to attract highly skilled players as it is designed for them and new players alike)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Speed of battle.Depending on a great deal of factors an average battle can last 20 to 40 minutes.Very consistent so not much else to say.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story.In terms of the playable story i sadly have nothing to say really.I have yet to even think about playing the story as fighting the A.I. is fun enough for me.Note.There are multiple campaigns to play and there are relativly cheap campaigns in the market.In my 17.3 hours i have earned enough gold to buy two campaigns. I am half way to a thirdHoweverIn terms of story in general.All runes have story or lore related text to them that you can read and i have greatly enjoyed it so far as it is very fleshed out and thought though. There are even some execptions such as Honest mistake that says ""It wasn't me"" on it and nothing else.As a man who wants to know what he fights for and who is who. This is all very appreciated and i am greatly enjoying it as stated above. One thing you can do to keep the reads fun with out over doing it is to only read runes you currently have in your possession. Which will hopefully make getting new cards even more enjoyable.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final thoughtsThe game is worth a great deal and more to the patient and the strong or quick minded.And is still worth alot although not as much to those who may be lacking the skill and mindsets this game asks forThe easy to learn and near impossible to master gameplay and mechanics make this game perfect for players both brand new and heavily experienced to what is on offer(even if it looks intimidating for the first 5 or 6 hours for most)I recommend anyone reading my review to try the game for 10 to 20 hours and see what they think from thereMy personal rating 98/100(Long live the Draksar and its dragon gods. death to skeezicks.)

												I have played this game since 2007 prior to it ever being on Steam. The game has changed significantly since Octopi had it. The novelty it enjoyed in 2007 was that it took MtG the next step. You collected cards that came to life on a battlefield. It was really cool and I spent close to 100 hours playing it when I was deployed to Afghanistan. I really enjoyed it early on.I have played it very little the past 6 years due to changes Sony has made to the game. I loved using Sundred Lands, but due to constant nerfing they became almost unplayable. You will find the Pox Nora player community are super whiney and constantly demanding for nerfing of any decent cards and races. I stopped reading the forums because the whining was becoming unbearable and drowning out the fun interactions with other players.To adapt my deck to be competitive would cost a significant amount of money through micro transactions. I gave up on competitive play and started working the single player campaign. The campaign is decent, but the fun of the game was playing other people around the world and taking during the match through chat.			"

												An interesting mixture of tactical turn based strategy and cardlike game. Akin to perhaps M:TG Tactics and to a lesser extent Culdcept. I highly recommend this if you can handle the frustration of starting out a tiny spek in a huge universe. It seems there is a lot of content that starts out locked and only becomes available if you invest in the game money-wise or time wise. For example the beginner's campaigns and the starter deck campaigns. These are where you start out and eventually progress by getting better champions, spells and items for your decks with the gold you earn from winning the battles you face.			"

												The Steam version of this software was a buggy and unplayable pile of crap, though I did end up downloading the game off of the Desert Owl website. That works. Let's talk about the game itself.PoxNora is a deliciously complex game that has been made more accessible by the ability to pick up cards from the core sets just for playing. It's easily the crunchiest game I've ever played, and I typically find my turns running out because I'm READING the six or seven abilities each character has.This is a GOOD thing.Currently, however, the game is critically flawed from bad rules language and hard counter design. Here are some examples.1 - There is a race of squid people (think mind flayers) who fling passive psychic damage across the map. Though this psychic damage is ranged, abilities that reduce damage from creatures of a small size do not reduce, abilities that counterattack when an ally is shot at range are not triggered, yet abilities that amplify psychic damage function properly. I spent an hour fighting these ""damage every turn"" pings, ended up beating them, but still understood nothing about them beyond ""they have a range of 6 and do damage to me"". It was frustrating and the 50-60 words about them on the tooltip was nowhere near enough.2 - Block and dodge state one range, but show another. This is seen all over the place.3 - Some maps hard counter certain decks, and map selection is totally random. Do you not have a fast flyer and the other guy does? Awesome, you have a disadvantage on round 0. There are two maps that will utterly crush you in this manner, and it's simply not fun to have to design decks around them because they, like certain OP cards, MIGHT show up. In a game with as little RNG as PoxNora, the fact that the game can be decided before the first card play by the MAP selection is a slap in the face.4 - Hard counters. If something is OP, they're more likely to make an OP response than nerf it. (Summons and summons-killing) This reduces variety and player interaction considerably.5 - Inconsistent rules. Let's say you magic up an enemy to be unable to attack for a turn. If it's an archer with rain of arrows, that works. If it's a pirate tortoise who can call in an AoE artillery barrage, it doesn't. What makes cannonballs so different from arrows? I'm not sure, but the rules certainly treat gunpowder as ""not an attack"".If you can get around these sorts of issues, and the resulting barrier to entry, the game's quite fun. I won two newbie tournaments in a row, and felt I was doing quite well. That being said, the bad design kept coming back to smack me on the head once, maybe twice a day, and it seems every time I ended up losing, it was because the game did something contrary to what the cards said they were going to do, like the aforementioned turtle pirate artillery barrage. As I design games for a living, this really, really upset me, and leads me to believe that there's really not somebody proofreading their work.And, honestly, who wants to support somebody who builds something that complex, then ignores proper documentation?

												Ah PoxNora... You can actually the monster inside your card doing stuff! LMAO! Anyway..Now this game is unlike any other. It's not just another card game you play. No. If you have the imagination and the determination, you can get lost inside the world of PoxNora. You might get to know some of the inhabitants of the swamp, mutated men with scales and claws, fairys in their forest home, and so much more. You will fall inlove with a faction, you will fight for it, and eventually celebrate with it. PoxNora offers endless posibilities for the determined and only cruel and harsh punishment for those who arent prepare to learn. So let me ask you this random dude whos searching for a a worthy game- ""do you have what it takes?""PS. You will get free cards battling A.I. but to get the STUPER STRONG cards, QUICKLY, you ofcourse hafta pay a lil. But hey, i think its worth every penny. devs are always on the lookout on how to improve the game :)			"

												An immersive, fiendishly challenging but rewarding game that caters to a diverse range of play-styles.  Although it's not the kindest on new players (the walkthrough campaign is linear and plodding; for me it only became truly fun when you gained full access to the game's features approx. an hour in), Pox Nora is charming, enjoyable and scratches my RTS itch in a way that is rare to find. :) You start out with a selection of ordinary ""public"" decks that any other player out of walkthrough can use, and the real enjoyment comes from discovering the Faction you like and building your own custom deck. A perfect game to enjoy over the morning coffee or sink hours into maddeningly obsessed with upping your rank! Plus, it's free- win!			"

You can even ""level up"" your cards to get new skills and such just by playing them in games (takes quite a bit of time) or by using coins, which you get through doing the tutorial or through the marketplace I have many more hours then what Steam says I have because I play it mostly on my Mac through the orginal client. I really enjoy this game and the only downside is in multiplayer games, the timer can be a bit short for new players. But the devs have said they are looking into a way to fix that.

												Great game ruined by terrible free-to-play (or should i say pay-to-play) model!The thing is: I can't even effectively grind for gold to buy new cards (runes). Cuz daily quests are just impossible to complete for a newbie without pre-paid deck. Like it says ""play two games with druid unit in ur deck to get 350 gold"". So I went to poxbase.com and poxnora.com/info/publicdecks.do. I was searching hard just to find that there is no public deck with druids in it! I have 17 runes total, and have collected 6000 gold as a newbie for completing tutorials. It is needed at least 30 runes to build a legitimate deck in runes manager. Runes cost 3K gold for every 10 random runes (runes being sold in packs). This means no way to even grind when I can't grind with public deck.So they suggest me to pay for even get a possiblity to grind? And even if you somehow manage to generate 3K gold daily it would take a month to build a playable deck. Not recommended unless you have some sort of solution to grinding problem like if you can boost your beginning with help of a friend or if you pay real money.			"

The pricing is extremely poor when many other games out there offer far superior free to play progression and overall superior content.

												Pox Nora is a fascinating and incredibly fun SRPG-TCG headed by a development team with an eye on balance.  This is a easy-to-play slow-to-master turn-based SRPG with TCG elements in that you deploy cards onto a battlefield littered with obstacles and they attempt to protect your base and destroy that of the opponent's, while capturing objectives.  With something like 2000 cards over the last seven years of expansions, there's a huge element of 'gotta catch em all'.   Fortunately, they've recently been taken over by a development team (Desert Owl Entertainment) interested in sustainable growth; which means BALANCE.  A full-blown rebalance of all 2000 cards has recently been completed; so that the core runes essential to a strong strategy are often inexpensive.In a pleasant change from other F2P games, it's genuinely easy to obtain new cards ('runes'): Play a quick game vs AI?  Here's 100 gold and a free, random rune from the faction you played (Including rares!).  Play a campaign?  Here's 600 gold.  1900 gold buys a weaker 'core set' booster pack, and 3150 buys an 'extended set' booster pack.  They give out around 1000 gold a day through free dailies; and simply playing matches to complete these dailies will net you around 1500-2000 gold a day.  Members on the forums set up 'Rune Pools' where you can trade in a card for a card of equal rarity easily; allowing a new player to set up inexpensive strategies all the time.  As a much older game, this has a level of strategic depth and complexity rarely seen in video games, requiring reading (and reading comprehension!) beyond Hearthstone; which I would consider a successful competitor in the F2P TCG arena.  I would seriously recommend this game; as either the F2P or if you want, as something to sink forty bucks into.			"

												I vaguely remember playing this game, a long, long time ago (like 6-7 years maybe?)  I can tell you that the game has gone through a trouble patch on its way to where it is today. But now on Steam it seems its back in all its former goodness. Pox Nora is  an old game by now, but it is still very much fun. It is simple to learn but hard to *master*. In Pox Nora you play your heroes on a board like map, your goal is too destroy your opponents shrine (there starting point and main base). The game is pretty simple at its core, so simple if taken the time to explain all three tutorials you would have almost covered the entirety of the game. But I digress, The point of my review here today is that I think if you are interested in playing a game like Pox Nora, I think you should go for it. I am finding it hard to describe what genre Pox Nora is, it plays almost like a digital board game, I find it easiest just to call it a turn based strategy game. Pox Nora is free on Steam now.			"

												Poxnora is a game with a steep learning curve but infinite depth of strategy. If you have the patience to learn a challenging game you'll find a very rewarding game with a passionate community and many different ways to play. I would recommend joining a guild relatively soon and try get some tips from more experienced players on what to do because PoxNora has so many options that it can be difficult to figure out what to do first.

												A fantastic game with TONS of content and options for everyone. Ever since Desert Owl Games took over from Sony they have really committed to bringing Pox Nora back to it's roots and have implemented tons of updates and improvements.I've been playing the game since the Savage Tundra update and have been hooked ever since I am very excited to see how the game will grow now that it is on Steam!If you like RPGs or Turn Based Strategy games then you will love Pox Nora.

												Great game, it's a shame more people aren't playing. If you're reading this give it a shot. It seems intimidating at first and heavily pay to win, but it most certainly isn't p2w. They are very generous with free packs, runes, and shards. You can get a competitive deck in a day or two, plus they let you use public themed decks for free which are quite powerful. There is a lot to learn but that's part of the fun.			"

												Pox Nora is a great game if you are interested in complex strategic, turn based game play paired with trading card game mechanics; allowing tremendous freedom both while building your battlegroup (pulling from thousands of unique units) and while playing.Building your collection can be slow but is not too difficult, as playing against the AI rewards you with runes (cards) and gold to buy packs which provide a wider variety of runes. In addition, starter bgs (decks) are available either for free or for very small amounts of gold, and give you access to pre-built bgs  with a pretty decent power level that you can use in any mode. Artwork on the cards is excellent, on par with great tcgs like mtg.Once you hit the competitive ranked play, there is a serious spike in difficulty, as many players have been playing the game for years and will play at a very high level. However, if you enjoy the challenge, it provides the best and most interesting matches, and matches you up against an enormous amount of different strategies. Balance is functional although not perfect, and in a constant state of flux, as relatively regular patches rebalance units and modify the meta.Finally, though not a pay to win game, the wider access to runes players can get by spending cash can sometimes make it feel like it is, especially if you aren't running a strong bg (deck). However, many, if not most, of the strongest runes are in the lower rarities, so if you're willing to test around you will be able to put together something quite powerful.All in all, Pox Nora is a game for a specific kind of gamer, lacking impressive graphics or simplified gameplay, but more than making up for it in strategic depth, great gameplay, style and uniqueness. Try it out, and see what you think.			"

												I will come across as honest as I can be. This game has some strong flaws. You will have to trust me when I say that this game deserves it's mixed review status.It turns out that the game has been the victim of some unfortunate decisions made by other developers in the past. You must accept that if you are playing pox nora; it is likely more for fun than victory. I say this because there are still many balance and even some UI issues that need work. I can make a lot of smart plays, and I'm statistically among the worst players in Pox Nora history. That doesn't stop me from playing it every once in a while, it's because I am willing to trust the developers since they have made updates that benefit the game a lot.I want players to support it. But I still can't say it's a good game though, balance in this game is broken, and I mean *REALLY* broken.			"

												Absolute superb combination of different fantastically varied and unique cards to collect and fight with.  Terrible graphics, sound, and effects but that's what you get from card games.  For the entertainment of collecting a wonderfully diverse amount and type of cards and molding them together to achieve different tactics I do recommend this game.  However, i don't play it anymore, far, FAR too slow paced, even for a card game.  Each map can take an hour +/- 30 min to complete with how slow and methodic unit movement is and the time spent is completely and utterly unrewarded.  If they made teh AI move a hell of a lot faster, and maybe even units in general, i would go back to this game in a second.			"

												Saw this game on steam and was very excited. I had played this game years ago and stopped playing because school and a part time job got in the way. But not that I am out of school and have my nights free again I am happy to play again. It's a very in depth game with a ton of possibilities. Since it has been around for so long the ranked games are full of people with very powerful decks, but the casual room is a place where I have won a few games and only have been playing for about 2 weeks. The campaigns are highly recomended because you can use them to get extra gold and cards. Only downside to this game is it takes a while to get a deck that you like. So I recomend picking a faction after you try all 8 of them and trade away any card that isn't in the one you like to a website like PoxBox so that you can easily trade for the cards you do like. I'm playing a deck right now that I love and was able to get after the first 3 days by trading in 1 exotic rune for a ton of lower level ones.			"

												small community, more work than its worth to find a mentor to learn because you WILL need one.  you cant build your own deck for a very long time and theres no real point in doing so because the community decks are better for what you will be able to build. put about 60$ into and regretting it, most of the player base has been around for a VERY long time so they have some pretty hard core decks and winning isnt some thing you should even keep in your mind. campaigns are a boring repatitive grind.

												I used to play this game religouslyITs ridiculously deep and satisfying despite the fact that victory requires spending money or grinding to get great ""runes""The gameplay is simple and revolves around you spawning champions, destroying enemies, trying to capture Nora Fountains, and trying to destroy your opponents avatar which offer you the ability to spawn champions from the fountains vicinityAny time an opponent enters your font the font becomes neautralized and you no longer generate ""Nora"" which is used to spawn champions and spells.\All opf the cards are so well thought out and hand drawn. The game offers 8 distinctive factions to play from all offering tremendously unique playstyles.This game is a Jem IMO, its been out way longer then 2014 and its unfortunately on its last leg.So many top players no longer play any more and its a shame because it used to have a cool little community that were really competetive. ITs been a while so i forgot my rank, but it was really enjoyable playing against other really skilled players.For me the game seemed to loose its magic along one of the earlier expanions they offeredThere are like 10-15 expansions they put into the game AFTER i left the game in 2011 and after coming back recently it was like a completely different game that lost a lot of the nuances theat were there becuase of the original, and more organic champion and spell designsConsidering how absolutely brilliant the game plays and is, and considering the potential this game had to be something so much more, I think its safe to say the developer of this game are really doing this game a disservice.The Game NEVER needed as many runes as it has now, it really just needed more new players and better marketing/branding. Octopi originally sold poxnora to SOE who later abandoned it only to be later reaqquired by some of the original Octopi employees, and was rebranded as Desert Owl Games. Who knows what happened its just my two cents.The biggest reason I CANT recomend this game is because there are like litteraly 800 people left playing this game at any given time, as well there being no commuinity left in the ranked section, which takes 5-15 minutes for a match and often requires asking people if they wasn to do a ranked match..It used to be around 5-8 thousand back when i was playing.

												As someone with a limited selection of online games due to a bad internet connection I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately I couldn't get into it. Between broken campaign missions (some of them seem to be missing objective critical critical units/relics) the fact nothing in the game is obvious (I had to go online to the forums to modify my battlegroup) and the fact that the game is graphically unappealing and just plain slow (you get 10 minutes per turn all of which you DO need on more complex turns).This, all before the fact it has a learning wall and requires IMMENSE grinding (I'm 8 hours in and have yet to purchase a rune set) to start getting any runes let alone something of good value. I was mid-mission before I realized I was completely bored and wanted to play something else. I can see this appealing to some people, but its a very, very niche game and off the forums the community is non-communative and less helpful than the devs themselves.Its free and if you are into these kinds of games I'd say give it a try - but you'll probably get about as far as I did and realize your bored out of your mind.

Also a perfect example how you can take something that could be so sweet and COMPLETELY f*ck it up.	Each match begins with all players having a castle (if you lose it match is lost), deck and starting hand, plus some Nora - which is the only in-battle resource. You gain Nora every turn from castle and fonts, which are undestructible objectives on map that can be captured. Dead units also drop Nora spheres. For Nora you can cast runes, which can be units, spells, equipment, heroes, altars, traps, flags and God knows what else. Units and ""buildings"" can only be deployed either near your castle or near your font which isn't invaded. 	Each turn player can move and fight with all of his units and cast as many things as he wants to, so closer to end of the game turns get longer and longer as armies grow.	For wins and dailies you get gold, buy boosters and packs, collect rare runes, make decks, find out powerful card combos, and go up rankings. Perfect.	But the game is OVERcomplicated. R*tardedly, ridiculously, unreasonably overcomplicated. Lets see.	You normally deploy 1-3 different units every turn. Each unit has his own stats (attack, hp, defense, movespeed, range, action points), few active and few passive abilities - right now I'm looking at one that has 4 actives and 7 passives - some are simple, other have huge text-wall descriptions, including alot of numbers, conditions and variables. Now, add HUGE amount of buffs/debuffs, faction bonuses, DOTs, auras, equipment bonuses and abilities, terrain effects to that ONE unit. Multiply it by ~30 then (amount of average-size army closer to end of the game), add some Heroes which are more complex and have more skills. Don't forget this are just YOUR units of YOUR faction. Alright now lets place them all on map, and command each and every one of them every turn. We will also have to summon new units, cast spells, setup some buildings and traps and give equipments to units. What strategic and tactical depth are you talking about? For any adequate human this is a complete mess.	This game is an idol of new-user-unfriendliness, and you can't even blame poor tutorial - not a single tutorial in the world could describe THIS to a new player. Also people are reporting that game community (well, bleeding remains of what was the community) is as hostile as one can possibly be.	And what should finish you off is completely unintuitive interface and terrible controls - sometimes I click and click and click and JUST CANT make my ogre hit enemy with his f*cking club - instead he keeps dropping selection, starts moving, doing other abilities or w/e, just everything I didn't ask him to.	Did I mention all factions have HUNDREDS unique runes with unique abilities? Wikia says there are more than 2000 runes in the game. And you have to COLLECT them, as they don't drop on your head from the sky. Slowly, patiently waiting for that lucky booster that will drop you super legendary wonderful card, for your beloved faction which is perfect addition for your deck.	The game has 18 average players online now, and there are reasons for that.Class: II - CrapVerdict: NoReviewed: 8.25.2015Approach: Steam - PCTime: Several HoursDeeds:  - "

An now that it is back to being run by Owl Desert, the game has been getting a lot of new stuff. There is one drawback, the game has a very small community. I have never seen more than 300 people online at one time. This makes having a PVP match difficult. There is plenty of other stuff to do though.			"

												I used to play Pox nora before during and after sony. I love the game. It has so much potential. How ever recently after all those years I decided to play again hoping Desert Owl Gaming made a huge change, While they did make a ""decent"" change to the economy of the game, they left MANY known toxic players. One of witch I had honor of getting harassed by just from talking to a mod about learning the game again. Nothing was noticably done about it and I was even told said person has done it cointless times. If you are new or getting to know the game again you will likely get harassased scrutinized, and much more and no one will openly do anything about it, Its an amazing game, but I have to give it a full thumbs down for all these reasons. p2w and get harassed, no thnak you.

												Score: 4/10I have now testet this game beyond its initial bounds and it is clear that it is a pay to win game, and possibly also a pay to play. Even though I saved enough gold for 2 packages, and played all of the initial walkthroughs etc. I could hardly cope with the campaigns on normal (a few can be taken on hard, but since the campaigns are tweaked towards optimized decks and therefore give the basal AI an extreme ressource advantage around 3x times your ressources in some maps) and against players you would be severely limited by the locked basic decks you could use. It may be a fine game for p2w and p2p players, but for anybody just looking to have a good time it quickly loses its flair as all of the relevant features demands a basic collection of cards you simply do not have within the first couple of weeks to months.If you have a bunch of time to spare or is looking for a p2p game it might be an 8/10 because of its tactical properties, but in that case I would recommend that you test it out before starting to buy packs etc. :) "

												I tried writing a review of this game before, but back then I didn't think I had given this game a fair shake. First off, this game is not a card game, its essentially a strategy board game similar to... well, I don't know of many that are still played in this day and age so I'll just go with classics such as Heroscape and Necromunda. (You don't even know what those are do you)You play by assembling your battlegroup from runes (cards that essentially work as model figures) and supporting them with spells and equipment. As far as these types of games go, Pox Nora is deep, and has had years to develop its rune catalog. There are eight factions, of which a battlegroup can be composed of at most 2. Runes have rarity and differing efficiency values, but all are useful in some way or another. That being said, discovering this usefulness can be tricky as the game is not straightforward and figuring it all out is essentially trial and error. There is a tutorial, but it's terrible, and the steam interface could use some improvement.Is the game P2W? No, not anymore. It used to be, which is when I first started writing this review some time ago when the gold income was paltry and winning battles didn't give out free runes (cards. You know what? I'm just going to call them cards) Now, its possible to get really good cards for free without ever having to play another player, which is a good thing because, quite frankly, I find the community could try a little harder to accomadate newer players. It will still take lots of games and lots of times to put together your own battlegroup, but the game has many free battlegroups you can play while collecting your set, and no, they don't suck.The graphics are a bit dated, but if you don't mind that, then their's no reason to talk about it. If you do mind it, your either going to look past it, or not. Either way, they are what they are.To sum up, if you like card games and board games, and don't mind dated graphics or figuring things out by yourself, give Pox Nora a shot. The game is improving with time now that its under a new developer, but it still has a long way to go to compete with powerhouses such as MTG or Hearthstone.			"

												Bugs, bugs, bugs... The game seemed to have few bugs when it was made by Sony when I first ran it on Steam several years ago. Now parts of it still don't work, work intermittently, or with random lags. The Rune Manager link doesn't show for a while - I still don't know why it suddently appeared after I played for several days. You don't get any public runes after Beginner campaigns even though the game says you get them. Various interface bugs. I only wonder what the developers are thinking/doing??? Same bugs as two-three years ago. At least, the game launches reliably now.			"

												Went through the trials, was alright. Graphics are.... Not modern, but I have never been one to emphasize looks over content. Honestly the AI was more fun then playing against players. First game with a live player, another person my level (Level 3 player in game). Guy ended up throwing out over powered champions I had not seen at all during the trials. I asked him in chat whats up. He tells me he is a smurf and is using a new account to get quick easy games in, he said alot of people do it so they dont have to deal with the top end games. My Second game was the exact same thing, just I didnt even bother chatting with the guy. I saw his first 3 champions he played all with double the HP of my highest champion and close to double the attack of my best units. I just surrendered and called this game quits. Discouraging... The game is clearly P2W. Sure I may be able to get those same champions for free six months down the road with diligent work playing every day. But its not worth it. To be blatant. The game gives no quarter to new players facing p2w players. During my Trials the game bugged out twice and force closed losing my progress forcing me to restart the trial I was on. The game pulls elements from various other games you will almost certainly feel like youve played this before, a decade ago. There are better strategy games available and better tcg's available. Sure I can spend some cash on this to get up to speed and then drop some more every time I want to further my ranking, or I can buy a entire game on steams daily sales. "

												Bugs Bugs and MORE BUGS, This game has a great idea and i can forgive the 1995 command and conquer graphics because this is a fantastic idea for a game. Play Length - 2 tutorial MissionsReason for play length - My first attempt to play was meet with 30 minutes watching what looked like loading screen for the loading screen, or in I.T. world it was pre checking that all conditions for loading a game were met and when failed it looped. My second attempt to to play this game was met with a tutorial (FANTASTIC I GOT IN THE GAME) first mission awesome it was a little easy for myself but as far as a tutorial goes i understood the game. 2nd mission started and i was playing along until 2nd turn and i got myself stuck by reading what i was doing and following the tutorial i miss clicked and then i could not do anything. These issues are a direct sign that this game should not be played at this stage the tutorial should be tested to as many extremes as possible, this is such a important part of the game it should not be in this condition in any release Alpha, Beta or full the tutorial is what makes the relationship between the player and the game.Recommendations for gamers - Do not play this game just yet if this review is over 3 months old feel free to make you own choices.Recommendations for the developer - stop all other work and priorities the tutorial, make the tutorial AI run on local machine (reduces you bot server problems) and make it a story not a this is how you play the relationship built here between player and game is only meant to get worse after this point.

												Avoid this turd.First, this is a game that rewards whoever goes first. If you go first, you control the map. Going second doesn't grant you anything but being behind the entire match. I have played 5 pvp games and every single one, for whatever reason, I went second, and every game was unwinnable.Second, there is no way to buy individual cards to make your own deck. You either grind for weeks or spend hundreds of dollars on packs to maybe get some cards you can use for the faction you want to play.Third, this game just doesn't show any effort at all. There are no art assets for dolls moving/facing up. Every doll is facing down, and even when you move up or attack up, you are walking backwards since there are no animations facing north. That is very cheap of the whoever designed this game. Also, most of the dolls don't even have animations. They are static one frame sprites that slide everywhere.I really did want to enjoy this game, but it's a mess. Unbalanced turn structure, no way to build your own deck and art that was lazily made back in 2008 and never updated. This game is the pinncle of cheap crap designed to drain your wallet. No effort whatsoever.			"

												Downloaded this game because it is a f-t-p game and I thought with the description that it would've been in light to compare with FF Tacticts. But I was so far from wrong. Before I could even start the game up I had to give out my email information,etc and now I am already seeing a boat load of SPAM in my email inbox. Thanks but no thanks. Now I have to mark all this stuff as SPAM that's coming in. To anyone that's into getting a ton of SPAM and enoy a FF Tactics wannabe POS then this game is recommended. However if you want to keep your email inbox free of SPAM Mail and want to fondly remember what a Turn Based Fantasy Game, like FF Tactics, is like to play then do stay away from this one. It's small yes and free to play yes but the headaches that come with it aren't worth it.			"

												Pros -+ Great idea..+ Vast collection...+ Great Avatar n' Leveling.+ Game is intriguing at first...+ Very specific mechanics, and gameplay.Cons -- Then the tutorial hits and it gets boring quite quickly.- The graphics are sub-par in my opinion, you are entitled to yours.- I highly disliked how some maps determined the fate of your match (Varying by unique builds).- Game lacks a bit of drive, collection is Vast, a little too vast in my opinion.- Seperate ""Decks"" Should seperate the ""Vast cards"" To build specific decks.- Some Deck Builds are ridiculous - And cannot be forwarded(Sped-up), and steal up YOUR TIME.- As said above, one match I lost... BECAUSE a guy on the other side had these ""Heads of Osiris"" or something like that, the time was 1 minute and 45 seconds... I lost 55 seconds of my time due to his ""Heads of Osiris"" and let me say... I was using a Waste deck (Which uses the most amount of units).- Clicking in the game sometimes DOES NOT work for some reason. You'd have to use the same movement several times for it to actually ""Register"". I was ""told"" that sometimes it laggs, and just move, ignore, and move another unit, and it'll ""Register them"" at the same time/later. However, I found out, that was not always true (I did that ""Trick""). I had to go back and move my units.- Because of the last two Cons above, the game became frustrating just because I could not ""Attack"" due to not registering, or not move until I clicked two-three times wasting time.- Some turns I could not even move HALF my army. This ruined my experience.			"

												I am a long time player of this game. Since it pretty much started. I would like to first point out. This game is NOT a collecting, as in collectable, game. You pay to unlock or grind to unlock content that is trade able, but not like a trading card game seeing how the runes are always reprinted and nothing is actully rare besides the legendarys which are green boardered, and only purchase able during specific times. Which means people most likely are going buy those runes making them also worthless as well. If you dont under stand what I mean by worthless is. This game used to be pay 2 play only. Which made some runes worth up to $100. Then they made it free and now all the runes are very cheap and it is no longer collectable in that since. So with that being said. DO NOT PAY MONEY TO PLAY THIS GAME. IT IS A RIPE OFF AND IN THE LONG RUN ISNT WORTH IS CAUSE YOU CAN GRIND FOR EVERYTHING YOU NEED. Was a huge fan of this game and a strong supporter for many years. Buying extra boxes during releases at $30 each to help keep them going while they let off site traders, pretty much steal from people. They turned from a underground game to selling out to sony, then sony flopped so they sold it back, and then they sold us out again by making everything free. They are only in if for the money now and really dont care about the community like they make it sound. NEW PLAYERS DONT EQUAL TO DAILY PLAYERS.			"

												Game looks fun and all. Would very much like to try it. However I can't get past the tutorial duo to the problem of my left click not working when the tutorial starts. Sometiems i get the the part where you deploy your unit. I can move the camera on the map, my right click works, just not my left click which obviously is preventing me from moving forward. Not sure if its just a bad download or what (Have tried downloading multiple times) or if it just the game that is part of the problem. Either way I am unable to play the game.			"

												EDIT: after some supplementary games, I change my mind and I recommend it: I think this game need new players to become better. Then, I hope the actual studio project doing something better in the future!POxNora is very Original: using both TCG and Strategy turn peu turn, you ned time to uneerstand the mechanism. ANd actually, I'm just too noob to know everything.But before the end of this betatest, there are a weak point to repair: not enought attractive for noob: in PvP mode, I fight lvl 99 opponent with OP figurines, and we are not enought numerous for a balanced game in ranked or traning mode.+++ Good game mech, with many potential+++ look like rich in strategy and tactics+ Many scenario vs IA .-- Deckbuilding not intuitive: you must go to the website instead of the game, that cost many conection. In add of this, the organization and presentation of cards are not usefull. Why using website?  Why we can't buy and build deck directly from  the game? that sooooo annoying....Please correct it quickly!- All players come to customed games instead of matchmaking, increasing the unbalance games: bettter to suppressit in my opinion for decrease the waiting time in training & ranked PvP games instead.- unbalanced matchmaking in PvP mode :/ .

												Recommended only if you enjoy small stylized fantasy battle-chess type games. I didn't particularly go for the graphics and the  noise effects  sound effects, so there's that. But it's free and if you enjoy card/fantasy/chess-type games, shouldn't you at least try it? As is, I have a backlog, so I'll dig through that, and if I feel like it, I'll be back, but probably not. You might dig deep into this and love it, and you really should try based on the above. If not, there's always Planetside 2 or somesuch other free game that might float you.			"

												This game is undervalued. Feels like the biggest problem is lack of players... at the moment new players or players who didn't have so much luck when buying decks will just get destroyed in multiplayer because there are just not enough players for matchmaking to make equal games.I personally love this game, i've played this since 2010 or something and this game has changed in better direction all the time.

												I have been waiting for a long time before I decided to write a review about this game. The reason behind it is that this game has earned a special place in my heart, but I also understand anyone who says this game is not for everyone. I agree the game has flaws, some explanations of certain game mechanics could be better for example. There is only a low player base right now, there is a steep learning curve and so on. Lots of it has already been mentioned in other reviews before.Still, what makes me come back to this game through years now is not only the spectacular and loving artwork of the cards. But also the fact that the game is unique. There is no other game out there that tickles my need for strategy like this one does. The collectable card game element is only secondary to that in my opinion. The real fun is to create a battlegroup that works, one you know in and out and one you can counter with what other people tend to throw at you. There is a huge amount of content to be creative with and to come up with your own ideas and it is more accessible than ever before.When you're looking for a challenging, tough strategy game where you can spend hours fiddling with the stuff you wish to play. When you are into fantasy, good lore and the right amount of sexiness then I can only encourage you to give this game a try.Yes, I won't deny it will make you scream at times. Yes, it will frustrate the heck out of you sometimes. But, it is so rewarding once things start to work and you know you have earned that success through your own dedication.			"

												I love turn-based games like Civ, Endless legend and Age of Wonders. But this game is my all time favorite turn-based strategy game - period. I have played this game for years, and Ive had several breaks from playing it, but I always return. Simply because no other games has managed to deliver what Pox Nora delivers. A huge game material, numerous game mechanics encouraging intelligent play and an awesome PvP enviroment.Single player campaigns are ok to get to know the game - But the PvP is what really sells this game.Graphics kind of suck, but dont judge the book by its cover. This game really is awesome.It can be a tough start because the game has such a huge material you, but I really really recommend sticking with it.

												One of the best turn based tabletop card games i have ever played. Poxnora is fun and very easy to get into, a few years ago pox was p2w but now you don't need to spend a dime to be competetive. The daily quests give more than enough gold for you to buy a box very quickly. As for the legendary and exotic = power idea it's not the case anymore most exos and legendaries only fit certain themes and can also be crafted through the rune forge. The rune forge allows you to throw away any unwanted runes for those exotics or legendaries you may want. Pox is original and i have looked everywhere their simply isn't anothe rgame like it.			"

												Tactical turn base meets card game.   Tons of tactics... maybe too many.  The amount of abilities, strategies, and runes available is a little scary to consider facing.  If you're new to the game I reccomend you buckle down and get ready to do alot of reading and get facestomped repeatedly as you try to figure out how your opponents little dude just ate all your little dudes.  I reccomend grabbing a theme deck.Once you get the hang of it and have recieved your doctorate in poxnorian, you will be able to customize, assemble, and compete safe and secure in the knowledge that you spent enough money to have good runes that can beat everyone else..  J/k  under the previous guys (SOE) this game was very P2W but with owl taking over its actually easy to get cards for free, including the powerful exotics.  That said you don't really need the op exotic cards to win.  There was a contest for common only battlegroups and I won that, then decided to take my winning common deck into ranked play and it still took me very far up the ladder.TL:DR;  If you like tactical turn based and card games, this one won't dissapoint.

												Get past the fact ur gonna have to spend some money to get at least a starter deck and some good cards, but it is a card game after all. I like the fact u can level up ur individual Champions and customize it how u want. Has a lot of potential and I can already see the sleepless nights...For being free, I can even look past the $50 or so dollars i will spend in the first year. Compared to other online games that have cost me $20 or $30 just for a mount, that's great. Once u have a good start u can then trade for better cards through the player market. I can run it on lower end systems and netbooks as well as being a fast download and install. I was playing in under 15 minutes. So quit reading my over-zealous review and go get it and see for urself!!!			"

Please check out videos or screenshots to see if you would want to invest your time in playing, for this game is very deep in content and does take time to learn, 400 hours in and I am still figuring some factions out.

												Pox Nora is the deepest strategy game I have ever had the joy of playing, it may say that I don't have many hours invested here, but I can assure you that I've been a fan for quite some time. Some of the Classic men behind this game have returned and set this game back on track!! They have fixed many problems that were brought on by SOE ownership and Pox Nora is again pure greatness. This game is about collecting runes, (cards basically) that you can then send out into battle and control yourself in turn based tactical combat. A new addition is the Rune Forge, which allows players the chance to get a hold of rare runes that they would have had to pay for in the past, this makes the game alot more accessible to new players and returners as well. I love this ferkin game because the strategy is seriously endless, there are so many ways to create a deadly army, so many very different factors that go into every battle, (Almost any style of play is Viable). One tactic could work well against one army, but fail miserably against another; the thousands of runes available make for even more combinations of them. Use equipment to buff your champions or debuff your foes, instead of placing down a champion to command on the field, unleash a powerful spell, or place down a stationary relic that emits an aura or alters the ground around it to aid your units or hinder your enemies. I think that is why I love this game so much, There are just so many tricks to shove up your sleeve that at first, it is seriously overwhelming!  You will lose horribly against players that know whats up, but take a little time, play a few single player matches to familiarize yourself with the endless units, spells, items, abilitites and statuses, and you will realize the possibilities that are available to you. Starting the game and checking out the 8 factions with their various races is so awesome, Most of the artwork is excellent and bad-♥♥♥, (although one artist in particular kinda stands out in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lame way *cough* Dixon *cough*) But anyway, forget about the cool runes and units, The strategic gameplay is what makes this game #1 for me, if you want a complex but readily learnable turn based combat game, then Pox Nora is for you.

												I love turn-based games like Civ, Endless legend and Age of Wonders. But this game is my all time favorite turn-based strategy game - period. I have played this game for years, and Ive had several breaks from playing it, but I always return. Simply because no other games has managed to deliver what Pox Nora delivers. A huge game material, numerous game mechanics encouraging intelligent play and an awesome PvP enviroment.Single player campaigns are ok to get to know the game - But the PvP is what really sells this game.Graphics kind of suck, but dont judge the book by its cover. This game really is awesome.It can be a tough start because the game has such a huge material you, but I really really recommend sticking with it. Give it time, and dont worry about losing alot in the begining.			"

												The most advanced TCG game, one TCG combined with chess-like strategy in which one sets to conquer and keep, or at least contest map strategic points named Fonts, that grant one the resources necessary for their warmachine to pump any of the card (Rune) types: Champions, the meatshields, supports, rangers and assassins one needs to vanquish foes and claim territories; Spells that may turn the tides; Relics that grant area bonuses or debuffs or come with tricks of their own and Equipment to be deployed on Champions and rip buffs from, or weaken enemies with. 8 factions to choose from, each with their strenghts and weaknesses, plus different playstyles, Races and lores. Captivating, but seemingly easy. Play at your own peril, since you'll find yourself plunged into a world with poor graphics and sound that may fail from time to time, but with game mechanics unique and bound to this oldie but goldie. Must give a try, but keep playing for at least 1 week/ month before you come up with an opinion.			"

												Under the new developer's the game has went from a pay to win crapshoot to a unique TCG + Turn based strategy. I would reccommend everyone give this game a try. I think if it weren't for the poor buisness model used by sony in this games youth it would be very popular.			"

												Ok so I have played this game for years (over 10) and I have seen it go through a lot of ups and downs. It currently is in a fantastic state of slow growth and improvements. Things consistently get better over time and the developers have done a great job. The game itself is unique and tactical. While it used to be pay-to-win, that is no longer the case. A word of caution, the forum is a highly useful tool but tends to have a few highly toxic individuals (they are particular people who are well known in that community for it). Do not let them turn you off to the game as there are a lot of other much more positive players creating a good gaming experience.			"

												I actually played this way back in the day.One of the very few such titles I would ever say was decent.And it's free.My opinion today might be different (going to load it up and play tomorrow), but for now I'm going to recommend based upon nostalgia. My gods, though, has it ever changed (just from looking at some of the stuff on their website).Would be like finding out that people still play Fuedalism on Armorgames. Or CastleCat on 'Gate.Actually, it's a lot more like finding Warlords Battlecry 3, Fate, and Rogue Trooper, here, on Steam of all places.Until I get hit by the ""Out of memory error"".GG, guys, GG.(Will keep it at a yes, but hopefully the warning that there are errors with the client will prove helpful to others.)

												Great card game that unfortuantly has a low amount of concurrant players, But the solo player content is good enough to carry it.			"

												If you love strategy and not afraid to play a game not in fully stylized 3D, then this is your game.Its original, always getting watched by devs...its just really great.Take some time to check things fully=)Im sure its worth the time.			"
