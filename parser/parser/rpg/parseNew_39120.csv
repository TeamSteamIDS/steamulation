												What have I done with my life?Once upon a time, Rift was a wonderful game, a great 'classic' MMO that had meaningful content, good raids and dungeons and was really worth investing the time into. Then Trion Worlds started bleeding money on failed project after failed project and Rifts Dev team got axed down hard. To try and compensate things went F2P and things were fine at first. Hey we get nifty new costumes and I don't need to pay a sub fee anymore (I still did, even if the original patron perks were pretty bad by recent standards.) The shift was subtle at first, gear became purchasable, either directly or in directly through lotto style loot crates that you can buy for special mounts and get decent gear on the side (A great deal till you realize the currency you get for the mounts is character bound, and the gear you get from the chest is based on your characters class. Meaning that before you'll ever have the currency saved to get that special super shiney mount, you'll have wasted more cash then you will want to think about on what is basically worthless chests and gears as opening them on a different character who could use the gear, means your currency is split. Well played Trion.) Tangent aside. What this gear purchasing did was create a stigma in the ""PuG"" raiding community, as you had to have the achievements to even be able to join the raids, and if you didn't have a guild that did them? You were SoL.Things like that continued to spiral out of control, when you realized how long it would take to grind out the dungeon and raid tokens to get gear, but feel free to buy Patron status and token boosters to cut down on that time by several hundred percent. Turning what used to be a fairly smooth and natural gear progression into something akin to an Asian MMO's level of grinding. Oh and because of course it is, the pvp is entirely based around who out gears who.Throw in the usual batch of awful awful people that come with the F2P crowd, and it's hard to even argue if just playing it for the social aspect is worth it. From an Role Play standpoint it does a few things right and many things wrong. The lore is built out of wet tissue paper, and few people even follow that, open world role play is almost impossible to find and when you do? You're going to wish you hadn't. One of the good and bad things it has, are Dimensions, or just player housing. Easily costumizable zones and area's you can do a great deal of things with. Probably the most positive thing about this game these days, minus the obvious cash shop tie in's to building materials. Of course, player housing is always a double edged sword for role play as it becomes cliquish and impossible for new people to really get involved.In the end the final nail in the coffin that made me write this review, was when they released the new single zone, not an expansion pack, not a new continent. But one area. They wanted to charge one hundred dollars, for the new class that came with it, as well as some relatively worthless in game items. This harkens back to the Ember isle map they added years ago, it was free, it was an amazing area and I still consider it their best zone. And while you can still reach this new zone for free, and the new class can be picked up for the low low cost of about 30 bucks (Without the cyber swag). I can only stop to realize, Rift really isn't the same. And it's just not worth the time anymore.Oh and there's easily another 1-2k hours missing from that playtime. So there goes that entire year of my life! Shoulda put that time into something I could have gone professional instead. Like Solitaire.			"

												RIFT is the perfect World of Warcraft clone. It has everything WoW has:Same interface, mechanics, professions, auction house, instances, raids, BGs, item naming, controls, addons on Curse, talents, etc,It also has the additions that WoW has always needed:- Random Zone Events (constant, running all the time)- Rifts (which appear randomly and massively accros the map)- 1 and 2 players dungeons (Chronicles)- Built-in mechanics that in WoW you need addons (sell grey items, quest guides, etc)- Instant Adventures, which randomly matches you with a bunch of players and then you keep doing infinitely chosen grinding quests in a zone, giving massive EXP and rewards (the best way to level).But mostly important it has AN AWESOME CHARACTER CLASS AND ROLE CUSTOMIZATION. It's something like ""make your own class and roles"":- Caster DPS-Tank-Healer- Pure caster DPS- Caster and Melee DPS- Caster with Pet DPS and Healer (or just DPS)- Melee Tank with Healing habilitiesAnd a LOT MOOOOOOORE.Regarding the Free to Play aspect of it: you can completely play the game without ever spending a penny, but a few restrictions:- You can't sell on the Auction House- Limited bags (very annoying)- You will have to grind a lot in order to buy mountsBut I was so hooked the first day that I bought the Classic Collector's Pack, unlocking a lot of extras, plus giving 1 month of Patron, which means 40% additional exp = faster leveling. Also, I WANTED to pay, because I was willing to help Trion. This game DESERVES money. It's polished, addicting and well crafted.If you want to play WoW but aren't willing for a comeback, RIFT is your game!			"

RIFT: F2P?RIFT is a great game. As of writing this review I have logged almost 4000 hours. Mhmm. Almost four thousand. One hundred and sixty-six days. It's a safe assumption that I'm a veteran player that has been enjoying this game almost since release!After hearing about it, I was worried about Trions Free To Play buisness model. I am happy to report (contrary to other opinions) that there is NOTHING out of reach in game to non patrons (subscribers) or those that don't want to spend hard earned cash for pixels and code, The F2P system in RIFT is created as such to allow people to purchase Credits using in-game currency. It might take a damn sight longer, but you could get everything, including sub time, just by something as simple as selling artifact collections.Combat is pretty fun, and the souls/roles (Calling/Class) system is one of the best i have ever experienced in an MMO. Mage tank? Sure! Cleric bard? Done! A Warrior healer? Go for it! Each class is updated by the devs fairly regularly, so all of them are fairly balanced, there are a few exceptions (looking at you Physician...).The world is huge, and gets bigger with each expansion. It still looks pretty good despite it's three year long run and is still one of my favourite MMOs ever.TL;DR  Great game with a ton of content, entirely free to play, if you don't enjoy it I'll personally refund your free for free.10/04/17 Edit - Don't bother with this game unless you love spending real money to be able to do anything in the late game. I would certainly still recommend this game to anyone and everyone, just as long as they are not going to want to seriously do the most content and expansion packs, and I am very disappointed with the recent paywall mountian climbing challenge that RIFT has become.

												As I have played this game for 2,700 hours I thought I might as well leave my opinion on it. I'll keep it short and simple.Pros ☺+ One of the best PvE experiences I've ever had in any game. The world and the raids are extremely dynamic with       fun and well-designed boss encounters.+ Great community.+ There's always something to do.+ A neat wardrobe system allowing you to change the looks of your gear if you're not satisfied with how it looks or the pieces don't match. Purely cosmetic feature. This has been taken even further after Nightmare Tide, as you can now directly ""transmog"" any gearpiece including weapons directly from your wardrobe tab.+ Many different options when creating your spec due to the soul tree feature.+ Seasonal events in which you unlock items such as mounts, clothing/gear, companions and more.+ F2P. You CAN buy gear with Gems which cost real money, but in order to do so, you must spend a helluva lot of money. It doesn't really have a negative effect on the game. If you're overall bad at the game/your role, gear won't help you. Guilds don't accept people without experience. The game is just as playable F2P as if you paid for stuff.+ Free server transfer every 7 days.Cons ☹- Horrible PvP. It's quite unbalanced and gets repetitive pretty fast.- Bad customer support. Can barely assist you due to all their policies.- Spending a lot of time on farming items such as gear pieces and planar essences is necessary in order to succesfully raid. I do however believe this applies to most MMOs.- Too few gear models. Often you'll see the same model used for several different gear pieces with other stats. Just letting you know if you're into cosmetics and looking cool.- The amount of players seems to be decreasing.So why quit a game you've spent almost 3,000 hours in?It's difficult to give just one reason or explanation. Basically, the fact I had played it for that long might've burnt me out. Other than that, my guild in which we had an awesome community disbanded, and the friends I used to play RIFT with had switched over to other games. Furthermore, I suppose I also just wanted to play other games. I have plenty on Steam and I'm not the type of guy who sticks with just one game forever. I like variation.			"

												Used to be my absolute baby of the MMO world long before it came to Steam, to the point of where I was one of the subscribers who willingly continued to pay a monthly subscription for over two years. I only quit constant play because of real life♥♥♥♥♥♥and becoming a parent. Their ORIGINAL model, when going from subs to free, was a legitimate pay2be lazy/have pretty stuff, plus DLC/extra roles. Now?Now it's nothing but pay2win trash that has broken my heart.Even after you drop over 200$ on DLC content/""essentials"" (without it now, you are so hindered, it's not even funny), you will have to pay over 100$ MORE just to fully unlock the game. This is not even touching the pay2win part! Investing your money is a waste of time, unless you want to pay out the nose to the tune of over 600$ (and this is lowballing) just to be competetive and capable of raiding.Goodbye, RIFT. I shall never redownload you again.			"

												Everything that made World of Warcraft great (minus the world itself), Telara is pretty big on its own. Had some great time tinkering builds in the game, dungeons are pretty challenging when you get into them at first. Progression feels very smooth and any time you spend into the game is rewarding.Polished and neat MMO, very recommended			"

												Pros- Great looking game compared to other MMOs.- Mechanics are solid, though it is action bar/button mashing, which may turn off more action oriented players.- LOTS of content. Zone events, world events, dungeons, chronicles, raids, PvP (if you like that), instant adventures, etc etc.- One of the better housing systems- Really good F2P model, with pretty much all content being free aside from things like bag space, some of the souls etc.- Can be a really casual or hard core game. It's pretty flexible in that regard.- Soul system is one of the better ""talent"" systems in MMOs.Cons- The lore could use some work. It's got the GW2 problem in that the lore is there, just horribly horribly presented, which is sad because it has some pretty cool ideas and concepts.- The shop is sometimes overpriced, and they do sell gear in the shop (albiet incredibly overpriced) which may turn off some people. Also they introduce new ""lockboxes"" all the time which I personally consider a lame version of gambling.- The reputation system is horrible. Almost as bad as WoWs.- The daily system the reputations are tied to get boring VERY fast, however if you want the best enchants for some slots, you need to do it.- If you're a lore junkie, a lot of the world is unfinished. Stories and zones. You'll get disappointed staring at grey blobs on the map that sound cool, but just don't exist, or finishing a story quest chain with far more questions than answers.It makes the world feel unfinished.- The subscription fee is no where near woth paying for. You get some boosters and a weekly gift, along with a discount. It's pretty worthless. If you want to support the game just spend $5 to $15 a month on credits and get something worthwhile.- Because tanking in this game is so unappealing like so many other MMOs, the old problem of tank shortages comes up a lot. It may be a turn off to some people who like to do dungeons.In the end I would recommend the game. I consider it one of the best MMOs out right now. Definitely one of the best F2P ones.			"

												I've been shaking off the urge to write a review for the F2P MMORPG, Rift, for about a week now, purely because I wanted to write one that did it justice. I'm a little under 200 hours into this game at the time of this review, but despite that, I've barely scatched the surface. I'll start negative. Rift isn't original, I mean sure, the Rift aspect is, but other than that it's pretty much filled with the same content you'd expect from an MMO. Quests that are uncreative, grinding to level and lots of walking, for the most part. So at this point you might be asking yourself why would you play Rift?Well, in short, Rift does what other MMOs do, but better. The only exception to this, in my view is the spell effects in game are lacking, they feel a little washed out, but everything else, from killing monsters to presentation is absolutely crisp, responsive and highly polished. The scenery is gorgeous, you'll often find yourself stopping to take screenshots and admire the landscape, and even the monsters. Every area has a totally unique atmosphere and feel to it, each crawling with unique monsters waiting to rip your face off. This brings me to difficulty. Rift isn't easy, at least not compared to other MMOs. The monsters and combat are a lot less forgiving, death comes with a penalty and continous deaths with permantly penalize your stats until you visit a healer. This is a good point though, it makes the grinding aspect of the game more enjoyable, because your attention is focused solely on the game in nail biting moments. Look away for even a few seconds and you could come back to find your body laying on the floor surrounded by dragons. Rift features a huge amount of content. The map is huge, there are several islands to travel, hundreds and hundreds of quests and a huge range of monsters to be killed by. Raids, Chronicles, Rifts, Hunt Rifts, Bounty Hunting, Warfronts, Instant Adventures, Dungeons and so on. To give a perspect on the amount of content, I list eight game types, in just one, for example Dungeons, there is about 40 dungeons in Rift ranging across across levels from 1 - 60. Once you hit 60, it isn't over. You can prestiege and the game introduces a second XP bar for planer attunement, which unlocks new abilities and skills. I was lucky enough to be invited to a guild on my first day of playing Rift, and I've stuck with it ever since. Joining a guild, working together to do guild quests and form raids/events is where I have the best fun, as I think a lot of people do also. You're able to completely customize your guild to represent and battle others, all the while earning points that contribute to the leveling tree in the guild. This too unlocks perks such as bonus xp, better loot drops, faster health regeneration, teleporting to guild members and so on. For those of you who may be collectors, don't worry, Rift has a HUGE amount of collectibles in-game, named ""artifacts"". Artifacts are found around the map, either by exploring or by looting monsters and/or chests. Rift encourages exploration, if you can see it, chances are you can go there. You'll be searching for these hidden artifacts for hours and hours, and when you finally do get the complete set for a particular catagory, you get rewards. Rift always rewards you for your work, and it rewards well. Professions in Rift are quite in-depth, there's enough to keep you digging away for hours, looking for the materials and crafting the items you need to level. The leveling doesn't take too long, there is 375 levels per skill, currently I've managed to achieve this in Fishing, which took about 30 hours or so, just to give a perspective. There is two types of professions; gathering and crafting, both of which tie into one another. You'll be given useful hints and tips as you progress, suggesting which receipes do craft and for what reasons. There is currently about ten professions, give or take, which include: Minning, Butchering, Fishing, Survival, Outfitting, Foraging, Armoursmithing, Weaponsmiths and so on. All the reciepes and materials you craft can either be used, traded or sold either to NPCs are stores or on the player economy driven Auction House.This game is ENTIRELY free to play, from level 1 to collecting every item, every piece of armour and maxing every skill. There is no restrictions and no cut out content. There is a store, you're able to purchase some items through real money. This is more of a boost, the items can be obtained in-game and no real world purchases are neccesary or required in any way. Spending credits earns loyalty points, which the more you spend, the more you earn. These unlocks are only available via the loyalty system, but can still be obtained absolutely free. There is an in-game item called ""Rex"", which you can purchase with game currency, then exchange it for both credits to spend in the store, as well as loyalty points to earn items. This means you can obtain everything in Rift, absolutely free. As far as MMOs go, this one is one of the best. It's free, it's filled with content and it's crisp in every aspect. I highly recommend you give this a go, it's a little slow to start off, but you'll find yourself hooked and playing daily, enjoying every second of it. 9.5/10 - A fantastic MMO that achieves everything it sets out to do in a high quality fashion.           -0.5 for the lacking spell visuals, it's minor, but noticable.

												Ever wondered how other free-to-play projects on Steam got Overwhelmingly Positive or Very Positive reviews, Trion? I can give you a few examples. There's a certain free-to-play MMO game here on Steam where you can get almost *anything* in the game by trading the in-game items with other players for premium currency. Little by little you will accumulate enough premium currency to buy almost *anything*, except for a few cosmetics which are availible only for real currency and for a limited time. Cosmetics, Trion. Not top-tier PvP/PvE equipment, not character classes, unattainable by other means. Cosmetics.That being said, almost every item in that game can be bought and/or crafted using the in-game resources. Is it grindy? Yes. It will take you a while to get somewhere and get the needed resources. The things is, however, you don't need to spend a penny on it to get a viable character, both in PvP and PvE. All you need is time and the will to play and have fun with other people.Now, let's talk about Rift. Not only is it grindy — god-awful grindy, not only do you need the resources/hundred kinds of different currencies, you also need the crafting skill/reputation required to get the things you need — the *only* way for you to get the premium currency without paying real money, is to buy REX, which gives you a portion of premium credits and costs unreasonable amounts of in-game currency. Apparently, god forbid you from making the premium currency and the advantages it gives you — numerous advantages — more accessible to your general public.I suppose you forgot the meaning of the word ""accessible"" at this point.I'm using my friend's account to post this because you banned me without any further notice from the community hub for calling you out on your fraudulent schemes; funny thing, it was me who invited this friend of mine to play Rift in the first place. Needless to say, we both are sceptical about touching Rift ever again considering your business practices and paywall policies.Also, nice moves, Trion, acting like a little kid who sticks his fingers in his ears and starts yelling because he doesn't like what he's hearing. Next you'll start removing negative reviews like some megalomaniac indie developer who can't take criticism. Sure this will make your game better and shift the Recent Review ratings to Overwhelmingly Positive, eventually! Nah, it won't. Just kidding. Watch your player base dwindle as you invent new ways of leeching money out of people. Either that, or show some respect to your player base. Take a look at your forums, reddit, steam hub, you'll find more specific suggestions on how to improve your game from your very players; more than you would like. Make the game more accessible in general, and people will come to support you. Earn their trust and loyalty, and their money, not by building paywalls, but by making the game more accessible.PS: This is a copy of the thread I made on the Community Hub, in case of the thread getting overrun by trolls or deleted for no good reason. This negative review is here to stay, unless Trion does something about their pay-to-win policies.			"

												UPDATED!!!Tried the game myself and I have to say that it is quite addicting or addictive. It has it's ups and downs but course I will say what are cons and pros for this game for YOU to decide if you want to play it or not.Pros : + Very huge open world to explore+ Nature environment is so beautiful and it feels so alive+ Tons of rewardable quests to make you very busy if you're bored+ Detailed tutorials+ Editable and customazible soul tree to make your character explore and test lots of abilities+ Build a house with friends or global players (WoW hasn't done that yet)+ Minnion quests fits nicely + Great mounts and pets (course premium means real cash)+ Rifts to close all over the world with great rewards+ Kill a monster in new area you get automatic quest (it gets confusing if you're overloaded with 5 or more quests)+ Swimming is great with limited breath bar to make underwater quests challenging+ Mentoring your character is great and useful if your friends are lower level + Self buffs that lasts for an hour or more and you can re-buff at any time you like+ Some story quests have a great voice acting and it's worth it to listen if you understand the story+ If I would choose between WoW and/or RIFT, I would pick up RIFT+ Tons of achievements in game (but I prefer STEAM achievement) + Free To Play+ Large player base+ Extensive class customization (some classes and creations are limited see cons below)+ Rifts create dynamic gameplay+ I recommend it for people who don't have annoying wife's ;) + Addicting from every corner or look of the game no matter where you are+ Fishing is so much fun :) + Crafting & Minning is also in the game but I haven't got the chance to try it+ Rewardable events+ Friendly player base (well if you are nice and polite)+ Auto adventure is great (if you're level 10 you can do level 20+ or higher quests with others that level)+ Bonus rifts are unlimited with great rewards if you can beat shown minutes or seconds with tons of players+ Great sound and music+ Server time is confusing to me and/or others so it's good that you click on that clock to keep an eye on your RL clock.+ Weekly updates (thursdays)I didn't forget about the cons as well and these I HOPE will be gone away in the future (with big hopes)cons : - Some class balance issues- Limited races for character creation (you need DLC to unlock limited races for character creation and other premium things)- RIFT: Ultimate Nightmare Edition costs 2 much (139,99€) unless you live a very rich life then go ahead and buy it- Leveling from level 10 or 15 to 65+ gets quite hard as EXP rating slows down unless you want to do repeatable quests and events- Annoying guild requests- There is no actual story because you have quests are all around the huge map - Aggressive mobs are annoying even if you try to avoid them- No falling damage- Too many aggresive mobs makes it harder to focus on your quests (specialy if there is a whole pack when you're on a quest grind)- No autowalk (although map does show where you need to go) P.S. i don't look for key bidnings i take  my time explore yellow area untill i find it- Some players are stealing kills - No steam achievements (game has it's own but tons of it)- 4 downloadable contents costs way to much (324,96€). Why would I or someone else pay that much if I or somebody else can get all that for 139.99€. And even that costs way to much. RIFT DLC editions costs too much specialy if you're planning to spend over 325€. Spend 68€ for Guild Wars 2 Digital Deluxe Edtion with game guide on how to level up ANY of race class + you get great useful premium items.I do recommend this game but be warned that play for free has it's limited restrictions unless you want to buy NIGHTMARE EDITION. I am happy enough that is play for free but at least they could do is lower the prices for nightmare edition if it's worthy of getting it. Some of you may think that some the cons are funny and/or stupid. But that's how I see it.Everyone has it's own taste but I love the game myself so I try and ignore the cons and maybe 1 day i'll buy nightmare edition. I recommend it but many of you won't like it. If you don't, well there's always uninstall button.			"

												RIFT - a great option for MMO players. Great graphics, beautiful and detailed landscapes. You can customize your character the way you want to by using different souls available within your selected class. For example, take a bit of Pyromancer for offense, a lot of Elementalist for some serious pet capability, and some Chloromancer to heal the party. Rift also has several pre-built options for those who like to get in and play quickly. Beyond all of the systems in the game, the standard things about the game are also very well done. The audio is phenomenal, and the controls are pretty intuitive. Glitches are very infrequent, and minor anyway. Besides, the game is still fairly new so such things are to be expected. Leveling up in this game is not grindy at all. The game frequently keeps you on quests (storyline and otherwise) which level you up as you play the game, rarely (if ever) forcing you to pull off to the side for some time to just level up. The solo-play material is well-handled, as is the group-play material. Gameplay is mostly solid, and the freedom to progress however you wish is definitely a bonus. The quests could benefit from more variety – something Trion should keep in mind for future content updates – and the overarching story is easily lost beneath the endless strings of ‘Collect this!’ and ‘Kill those!’ If you go in expecting total originality, immediate disappointment is sure to follow, but spend some time with the game, and you’ll be impressed with what Trion has to offer.  Rift breathes new life into the genre, restoring otherwise tired old concepts and proves success isn’t always built on originality.			"

												Man, memories were had with this once-fantastic game.Years ago, I ran a guild on Laethy's, the Oceanic server, I met lots of friends, some even lifelong, enjoyed countless dungeons and raids, beautiful cosmetics and skins, great classes, fun and definitive PVP, AMAZING dungeons and party system, beautiful home worlds for clans, and I even loved the grind of doing all the quests and how beautiful each area looked. It was honestly one of the best MMO's that rivaled even Gw2 and WOW at its prime.However, that was years ago, and the game has been squandered since, turning into a typical pay2win grindfest, in which the community has dwindled and the game isnt enjoyable, Im sad that Trion killed such a fantastic game (I think it was because of Archeage, which flopped anyway).RIP RIFT, you were my first and only MMO i really ever enjoyed, thanks for all the memories.

												Best MMO out there. ..and I've played a lot of them. Always come back to Rift.It has everything that made old WoW fun plus way better graphics. On max settings this game is insanely beautiful. You have the standard 5 man dungeons and group raids but then you also 1 and 2 person chronicles as well. Add to that random Rift raids that appear anywhere in the world that anyone in the area can join as well. Then you have random area events that occur that anyone in the area can help achieve and defeat. Random world boss encounters.

												Disclamer: even though it says i spent 331 hours on the game, most of my game time was spent outside of Steam. My real game time spans over thousands of hours.I have been playing Rift on and off since the headstart of the original game in 2011. Back then it was my #2 most favorite game (only beaten by WoW because i was addicted to that game) and even though it no longer holds that place, i still really enjoy what the game brings to the table. It is one of the only MMOs still around that allows the player to build their own playstyle by combining skills and talents into a unique class. It's something i always admired about Rift.Unfortunately, it has fallen from its pedestal years ago and Trion hasn't done anything noteworthy to try and put it back in its place. The trouble started when they released their second expansion, Nightmare Tide. It changed a lot of things for the worst. The story was very dull, crafting became incredibly expensive, there was barely any questing content and expert dungeons were so easy that you could complete them without knowing the tactics. However, the thing that probably impacted the game most was the pure focus on Instant Adventures. They were changed in such a way that they gave a lot more experience and currency than normal questing, which lead to a lot of people leveling up doing nothing but these adventures. This didn't just cause players to get bored very quickly (since they never actually bothered to play the real game) but the new players were dropped off as max level without having any knowledge about their class.All of these reasons and more caused the big majority of the playerbase, including all of the raiding guilds, to leave the game in search for greener pastures.Nowadays the game is pretty much deserted. There are no official numbers, but other players are reporting in a playerbase between 6000 to 8000 players. The game automatically merges the players of different servers together in certain areas and made the chat channels cross server, which makes the game look more busy than it really is. It is very easy to play an entire afternoon and only find one other player of your home server walking around. Capital cities are completely empty outside of the seasonal events. The low level pvp queue died long ago. The dungeon queue is dead. The auction house is barely used anymore. There are barely any good guild around anymore. And the list goes on and on.The new expansion didn't do much to try and make the game better. The crafting is cheaper now, but in its stead there is the questing problem. There aren't enough quests to go around to reach max level unless you use exp boosts (which need to be bought with real money) or become a subscriber (subs gain a passive 40% exp boost from all sources). Another problem is the endgame. Right now there are only 2 dungeons (there is a third one, but it can't be classified as a dungeon) and a raid is to be released Soon™, but it has been lowkey confirmed to be a really casual 10 man raid because there will also be a Looking For Raid tool. The reason behind this is probably the lack of dedicated raiders and the very small playerbase still playing.My conclusion? If i am honest, i would love nothing more than to see more people play this game. I really like this game despite its many flaws and i secretly hope that the game will make a comeback one day. However, if i put my bias for the game aside, i'd have to say that it isn't worth playing if you are a new player. The game's golden age has passed ages ago and currently the game is nothing more than a dying horse that is kept on life support. It also doesn't help a lot that there probably won't be a big influx of players any time soon, since the forums are one big wall of negativity and most of the players in the global chats are nothing but doomsayers who like to whine about the flaws of the game. And that's why i can't recommend this game to newer players, as much as it may hurt my soul to do so.			"

												A dying game...I've been gaming for years. I've spent thousands of hours on more MMOs than I'd care to count.In all that time, I've learned to recognize various signs a game on it's last leg has.One of them is the increase of micro-transactions. Rift has recently taken various steps such as removing rested exp for free players, limiting dungeon charge accumulation for free players, etc to make their patron packs seem more attractive. This isn't an added benefit for payers, though; it's taking away what was for months (over a year, if memory serves) given to all just to attempt to extort players.Another is the ramping up of grind. If you aren't planing on paying, then you're missing out on huge increases to your currency gain. One of the most important things for upgrading gear at the time of writing is Abyssal Accelerators, which are bought with Abyssal Crusader Marks. Patrons get an increase of 40% to their marks gain by default, with additional increases being available from ""loyalty"" (AKA pay more than a threshold to gain this buff) as well as consumables, going for more than a 200% increase.A third sign is an increase in premium events. As said before, this is simply an attempt to extort money out of it's remaining playerbase; an event shows up with a mount, pet or other vanity item and demands money out of it's players for it. Usually, it includes a lockbox or some other RNG mechanic to obfuscate just how much money the item actually requires on average.Next, the addition of previously non-existant ""Login each day to win prizes!"" mobile-style coercion systems. They provide no true benefit to the player other than forcing him to loyally login each and every day for the possibility that he will buy something, and only give the smallest benefits in return.The last sign I want to talk about is the increase in NPCs to hide the fact the game world is empty. The carnival of the ascended is runing at the time of runing and I have seen a grand total of three other players taking part in the activities, at prime time.On the other hand, I saw several dozen ""reveler"" NPCs; they have nothing to say, don't serve any purpose, and in a healthy game wouldn't exist.In a healthy MMO, there would be plenty of players to render on screen instead and those NPCs would be considered a waste of valuable resources. Rift, however, is not healthy.So, all in all, while I very much like the game I cannot recommend it due to it's current business practices, the population of the servers, current progression system, monetization model etc.In it's golden days, this was a great MMO. I might even go so far as to say that until recently it was very decent and a reasonable choice for players looking for a fun free experience. But those days are clearly over and as it stands, this is just the desicated remains of what was once a good game.If you choose to disregard this warning, I hope you have either plenty of money or plenty of time, ideally both; because without either, you won't get far.-Sleepy			"

												Edit: My views haven't changed, but I've rewritten the second half to give some clarity to some common complaints I've heard about this review.How about some balance?Well, this isn't the easiest review to write. Rather than a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", this is sort of ""thumbs horizontal"" I guess? There are very strong positive aspects to this game and very negative ones as well.Typically, anything that markets itself as ""discount [game]"", is pretty much going to be ""horrible [game]"". So, Titan Quest is discount Diablo II, Demigod is discount Dota, etc. In this case, Rift is not so much ""discount WoW"", but ""alternative WoW"". Now, I've played WoW for a very extensive amount of time from the vanilla to Cataclysm, so I'm pretty familiar with both by now. From what I've seen, there aren't actually any ""downgrades"".  What WoW players complained about lacking for a very long time were pretty much stocked to begin with, if not pillars of the game itself. These included:Regional events that keep areas changing and make it more interesting to live in, which includes their gimmick, rifts (portals from another realm that launch invasions on nearby towns). 1-2 player dungeons and easier match-making for full five player dungeons. In fact, because of how build classification works (tank, DPS, heals, support), you are assured that every party will be pretty balanced for what you encounter, since every party must have a tank, a healer, a support, and two DPS.Guild quests and better guild management.Mentor level - You can scale your power down to a lower level if, for example, you have a friend join the game and don't want to be grossly overpowered when you play with them.Sidekick (which I don't agree with) - If you are the lowest level in your guild (which is the only explanation I can imagine) and everyone but you is doing some dungeon, you can temporarily raise your level to the party's rather than being left out of the event.Instant Adventure - particularly useful if you are just going to be on for ten minutes and don't want to get into the game too deep.Better UI elements like selling grey items and auction house price trends.Change classification on the fly - Basically, the skill points that you first chose that got you to whatever level you are can be changed, easily. There's a huge amount of flexibility when it comes to how you play your character. A rogue can be played how you expect it to, relying on range or pets, or it can be turned into an assassin, it can be made into a make-shift tank, or it can be a healer.  Even when it comes to a make, which is typically a glass cannon, there's flexibility about whether you want a nuker-pyro or an AoE damage like stormcaller or AoE heal like chloromancer, you can even have a melee mage. The way you play your character has huge amounts of flexibility with both how you play and how you look, I may never see another game with this range of possibilities. Even though this strategy really only works once you've reached level 60 and unlocked all of your skill points, this is where Rift draws a lot of its strength and it's an awesome dynamic.Warfronts (medium scale PvP) used to be broken and not match players up very well based on class and gear, but now they seem to be doing better, a few more tweaks with healing and I think I won't have anything to make note of there. The games are pretty good.Conquest (large scale PvP) is a cluster. And honestly, I don't think a lot people enjoy it because you kinda have to play with your leader holding a gun to your head saying ""move when I say move, ♥♥♥♥♥"". Well, no one enjoys that, but most people do it because the rewards are high enough to justify it. It's more about leader strategy and numbers than anything you do, personally.The theming for the original game is great. It definitely loses it and goes off in strange directions when you get into the first and second expansion pack, and that's mildly disappointing, but hey, don't let it get to you. As has been described elsewhere, the only thing you cannot do without spending money is using the auction house and all of your potential bag slots - and as little as five dollars unlocks those. This is ridiculously cheaper than the $15/mo WoW charges for the privilege of the same service. That said, the devs still need to pay rent, so a real money store is available in-game. 90% of the items are cosmetic; the other 10% are basically broken into two categories: Spend a small amount of money to get a slight boost to gold, exp rates, etc. Spend an exorbitant amount of money to get significant boosts or an item outright. In, literally, all cases, you may not purchase any item in the store that you cannot get some other way in the game. Sounds great, but how can you vote down something you've played for over 400 hours for free? I donno, how can you work at a job for ten years, say you like the work but simultaneously hate working there?The players suck. No really, they honestly do. I would take Dota people over these guys in a heartbeat. I have never in my life seen such a hostile group of folks in a game. It's kinda hard to get immersed in the environment and experience that I just described when there are fifty people at any given time complaining about how much they dislike the latest patch changes or the expansion systems or how their support ticket wasn't answered in the same day they submitted it...every single thing that the devs do is just a life-threatening crisis. Over a period of time, this really starts to affect your mood. But it's an MMO, a platform that is supposed to be around social constructs, communication, and collaboration. It's possible to turn off the chat and play completely alone, but dear god why should I have to do that?On the free hours I'm so ungreatful for: Like I said, I support some sort of substitute for a subscription requirement in order to bring new players in and pay the dev to continuously add new content, since they continuously need food. I've supported substantively in that regard to the tune of about $60, which I find to be reasonably fair for the time I've gotten out of it. To say that I'm shooting down this game without chipping anything in is factually false and irritating to hear.Ultimately? You should NEVER log in out of a sense of duty or sunk-time fallacy. There's a difference between ""logging into relax and have a good time"" to ""logging into a stressful environment of conflict because of your virtual obligations"". It seems like the hostile environment originated by the development team allowing themselves to be treated as punching bags, but changing their mind and punching back. Hard. So, the forums are dev/gamer flame wars, and the in-game world is nothing but passive aggressive condescending tones and internet♥♥♥♥♥kickings to the minority of people who agree with the devs.I think where I differ from most people (unpopularly) is that I'm willing to say that the developers are equally as bad as the consumer.Running a game you've created for a hundreds of thousands of people is challenging and every machine and gaming instance will be different. People will find bugs and as a dev, there's no hintbook or place you can just google that says how to fix it. Problems take time and experimentation and there's no promise of success. However, allowing a hostile and combative atmosphere serves no one and just lets people feed off of each other's hate. But adopting the same combative attitude as a dev? Is simply abhorrent.As a player who has no stake in the matter: I got my 400 hours, the devs got their money, and now it is time for us to part ways. If I had known what I do now, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much originally, which is why I can't enjoy it now. Those two sentences may be the most reasonable justification for a review decision you're going to find.			"

												So I tried getting back into this a while ago but nothing worked to peak my interest. -The pay money to get random crap from chests is still there with the dull looking stuff available for people that just play to earn.-From my experience before FTP and now you now have to be a patron to get the same amount of EXP you once were getting just by playing the game so there is no outstanding benifit, you just pay to get what you once had in the first place.-All of the new hero content with the super powered classes are now pay to own.-It is impossible to get a guild together or find randoms to do any of the new raids. So if you want to raid you have to join one of the huge guilds and hope to get on the D, E, F, or G team and pray that they are able to do more than pick their nose and stand in the red.-The conflict between factions is a crock now, BUT you still get attacked by the other faction's guards when not on a pvp server.-The chats are spammed by rude children tearing out every last ball hair they have managed to grow in a flame war because who knows.-People will kick you out of a random dungeon if you don't know it, so don't expect to pick the game up and play without having at least 4 friends to probe anything new.-No one. And I mean no one. Is around doing the seasonal stuff. Which is mostly recycled.-All except the largest or latest towns are deserted, most likely due to the lack of players advancing through the game.-The game is suffering from copy/paste creatures that might have a different tint and a new name::Please note this is based on personal experience and my views only reflect my feelings and what I had witnessed the last time I logged on, if the game has improved please let me know in the comments so I can take another look at the game, Thanks!::			"

												Free to Play: No Trials. No Tricks. No Traps. That sentence is a complete lie nowadays, playing as f2p became basically a trial, once you get to level cap, surprise, you need to buy Earring Slots and Planewalker to be strong enough for raids. Want to PVP instead? Prepare to get one-shot by wallet warriors with BIS gear that you can't even damage below 10%. If you want to be competitive in either PVP or PVE you simply wont be even close without paying, I bought the planewalker cheapest (20$) package just so I can raid and pvp on “even” ground (earrings and gear which makes huge diffrence, earrings by itself is like 10-15%% of your stats), but even with that purchase it’s impossible to keep up with the people buying monthly sub, as they earn more currency, have higher caps etc. You might think it’s not really pay2win since you can get same stuff for free with time, well technically yes, BUT it takes so long by the time lets say you get tier one set for your class, the game is already in t3, once you are halfway in t2 gear its already t4 out, etc etc. Basically paying players have huge advantage all the time, both pve/pvp they will simply have more stats than someone playing for free. I used to recommend this game as best f2p mmo out, but since last expansion it went completely pay2win, buying rex isnt really viable anymore to keep up, due to rex prices inflating so much it’s close to impossible to farm plat for it to sustain montly sub like that (price tripled on EU during few months i was playing, I assume now it’s way more especially latest move by trion, making earring and planewarlker cash only)Tl;dr Newest Endgame Raids are not possible without spending money, being competitive in pvp either. As f2p you will only be able to do older content tier’s (most likely 2 tier’s behind the current newest), and pvp is not even worth trying without mid-end gear. F2p is only viable if you play super casually, since its basically trial, but then you might as well go play GW2 which does it better for casual play, or Blade and Soul for pvp, Tera etc.			"

												I don't understand Trion...This game was, IS, a very good game. It has tons of content, lots of class build variety, an INCREDIBLE (and I mean near perfect) cosmetic system, great zone/monster/equipment design... It has a lot going for it. Yet, its publisher seems to get a kick out of making it a tedious grind fest. A chore. The classic ""You can buy this item for 100k of this currency (and you only get maybe 50 of said currency from a dungeon) OR you could just buy it for $15 bucks and skip the weeks of grind"". They are CONSTANTLY removing or gimping free content and hiding it behind their patron subscription system (or purchasing of credits).  Of course a company has to make money. That's what all companies are about. But do it by releasing expansions that aren't complete broken garbage for months after release, or by adding more flashy cosmetic content. More races. More classes (that aren't trashy push one button to win classes). Do it by adding QUALITY stuff, not by taking away already free content and hiding it behind paywalls. It's such a complete damn shame to have to downvote this game. It really is great at its core. But it just isn't fun for new/f2p players. Honestly I don't feel it's fun for veterans anymore either. Not when there are other great MMOs out there that don't take every opportunity to screw over their playerbase. On a side note. I can't stand making ranty, negative reviews. This game doesn't deserve it, but Trion absolutely does.			"

												The ""Very Positive"" rating is basically a monument of how great this game once was, sadly most people don't adjust their reviews as the game changes so this cemetery applicant has been able to keep it's good score.The devs slowly turned RIFT into a p2w and when the game died because of it they decided that the best way to save it is by ♥♥♥♥ing everyone who hasn't bought patron status yet. It would have been better to just make it p2p, because if you don't cough dough you're basically playing a demo. The only thing i wished for when i blew out the candles on my birthday cake last year was for this game to be shut down so that it would die gracefully, but obviously this hasn't happened so here i am, writing a negative review for the best game i ever played, because i get sad every time i see RIFT mentioned somewhere and i just want it to be put out of it's misery.

												""Patron Rewards Get Even Better""      So yes,that sentence basically summarizes it all. If this is Trion's way of saying , ""Non-patrons experience with playing Rift gets even worse"",  you could not have done a better job. A better job alienating new potential players that is,along with causing people that supported your game to quit. Your....new choices (for the lack of a more polite and diplomatic term) that you  implemented on the latest patch , have already been commented extensively on the forums and ingame,so I 'm not gonna state something that's not already being stated.      What I am going to say is this : If you expect people to financially support an MMO that advertises itself as free to play,while  all it does is sneak more and more subscriber privileges under the radar, forcing more and more restrictions to free players one ""choice"" at a time,you will be in for a big surprise. Why? The answer is simple.      Because people already have a subscription based MMO out there that they can play and get value for money,and won't waste their time and hard earned cash  on an unoptimised product that uses an archaic graphics engine and won't run properly unless you have a 2 thousand euros worth of gaming rig. People want to make the most of the time they invest on anything ,and the most of the money they spend,and that applies to video games entertainment too.And with the ""choices"" you keep making, Trion,your game will seize to entertain anyone very very soon.       So long story short,game is ""free-to-sample"",or at least that's what it has become.I have no hours played on steam cause I only use the glyph client.Thus,I can state ,fully confidently,that you should stay away from it,at least til Trion make amends for the increasing amount of cash-grabbing changes that they keep implementing into this game. Don't waste your money on it,don't play it.  Edited on the 20th of February , 2016 http://forums.riftgame.com/general-discussions/general-discussion/suggestions/478215-give-us-your-bag-ideas.html       So,there you go ladies and gentlemen,another idea Trion's Rift team will want to charge you money for. And the funniest thing is they present it in a way they think is subtle. In a time where games like Black Desert are about to be released,Trion's Rift development team have the balls to post ""tell us what's the next thing you wanna be charged for"" polls in their forums. Well done gentlemen,well done!			"

												RIFT COSTS MORE AND DELIVERS LESS THAN EVER BEFOREI loved Rift dearly for many years, but the publisher has killed it.  It was a wonderful game, and still is, but I can't recommend it.  Spending money on RIFT now is a bad investment.  Even if 4.1 hits the mark it is already too late and has been for some time.  From heavy-handed community management to stealthy and steady removal of content and features, to say nothing of the pitifully non-functional state of the expansion content, this game is circling the drain and everyone knows it.  I don't recommend this game for a new player as it simply has no future and at this point I don't think that can be changed.  After playing daily for three years and thousands of hours, it's time to call it quits.  Starfall Prophecy is so awful I started making excuses not to log in, and after a few months of that I didn't even feel a pang of regret when I uninstalled what Trion has the nerve to call an 'expansion.'The old content of the original game is still worth playing if you love varied zones, crafting, collecting pets and costumes, and adventuring solo - you can still do all of it for free.  The player housing feature, called Dimensions, is actually the only part of the current game that is both functional and satisfying.  But if you are looking for challenging group content from a trustworthy publisher with a long and healthy future ahead of it, look elsewhere.  RIFT has become a single player game and frankly there are better single player games out there.			"

												First I'll say that rift is a great game, however it has one small flaw which decided whether or not I would recommend this game to others.The game itself is as good I would say as any subscribtion f2p MMORPG out there, better then some actually because the game is actively worked on by devs and lots of bug fixes, I almost never have had a game crash or see visual bugs. The game is clearly a polished and honed mmorpg and is pretty good at its current state effective of 6/13/2014. However, the small flaw, which actually is a huge deal for me personally, made me decide to not recommend and quit the game entirely.This game is free to play in name only, You are not required to, but pretty much have to if you are going to play anywhere past level 50, meaning endgame. And what would be the point of investing time and energy into a game where you hit a pay wall. the pay wall in rift is its loyalty points issue. basically, in rift, you cannot auction. at all. not one item. unless you have spent 10 dollars. and their is a in game currency coin cap. 2500 platinum which is an extremely small amount when people are running around with tens of thousands of platinum.All in all this game is good and i would say probably would suit casual players, but even then the no auction and coin cap rule is foolish IMO on the part of rifts dev team. The rift community is quite tiny and probably not growing due to this one small/large issue depending on how you look at it. But this is the games pay to play wall. Beware.			"

												The best MMO I've played. Really.Only thing I can compare it to is WoW. But there the world is pretty static (or at least was, since I've only played it till WotLK and got bored, so no idea how the things look after the Cataclysm). Here you can get a rift open right above your head if you are (un)lucky enough. There's hardly a way to have nothing to do in this game, since the world changes every minute, bringing forth new challenges.Of things that I like (concerning gameplay):- tons of quests, including daily crafting ones (helps improving crafting skills a lot)- public group option: now you don't have to put the group up yourself, invite each player separately etc; just one click and you're in with all the group bonuses- invasions!!! Those really bring players together (since it takes quite a lot of running around to fend off all the atacking mobs, seal rifts and defend ward stones in different points of the map at the same time)- fishing (holy cow, I love fishing in this game!)- tons of things-to-do-except-for-standard-MMO-stuff: artifacts hunting, minions quests etc.- it's free; like really - everything u can get with real money, you can get with the in-game currency, it just takes time to gather some coin, but it's doableOnly-one-thing-I-don't-like:- Auction House is not available untill you get Loyalty points - and you can get them only by paying real money or buying one terribly expensive stuff in game (called Rift EXchange); but well, I guess that can be forgiven - that's the only inconvenience I met and it's not really a problem - if the AH was available, REX would be even more expensive since the in-game currency would be easier to get or, in worse case, they would make something else not available to provoke ppl to pay; and one can live without AH, especially if u get into some guild where u can trade with your guildmates (or more like ppl just leave stuff they don't need in guild vault and you just come and get what you need, leaving your thing for others).Of non-gameplay matters:- graphic is really great (see screenshots); remember it's an MMO (so u tend to have XX players and mobs on the screen running around, casting spells etc.), and it all runs smoothly even though you can find worse models/animations in single-player games; guys who did the optimization for this game did their job really well- also graphics stuff - landscapes are beautiful and vast; sure the map is divided into zones, but it's done neatly and not hurting ones eyes (like suddenly coming out of dense forest into almost-desert plains)- I like how female models are done; I'm always irritaded when I see the ""very-fantasy"" heroines on high heels, with almost no armor and their boobs bigger than their heads; here the female heroes have quite realistic bodies (like one guy said ""hey, I noticed my XXX doesn't wear a bra!"") and if they're supposed to be warriors, they wear a full plate (even my rogue wears a full leather)So if you like MMOs, this one is definitely worth a shot. It has everything a ""standard"" one should have + some things from itself - and everything done really well.			"

												If you are new I wouldn't play this game. There are way to many microtransactions. If you are worried about the grind, don't worry. The game literally doesn't start until you are lvl 65. Everything before that is pretty much a tutorial.Is the game Pay2Win? Yes.2 Earring slots have to be paid for with real life money to be unlocked. It used to cost voidstone (One of the myriad of in game currencies) they took that away so they could take cash from their dwindling player base.Other features. They sell tier 2 gear on the market. People argue that this isn't p2w since T3 has to be earned. The time it takes to earn T2 is a tedious task. As I mentioned there are numerous currencies and notoriety you have to earn with also a bunch of different factions to even buy or use items. The grind for that is tedious, time consuming. Now that isn't bad, grinding and earning gear. That's what mmo's are about right? Except you spend weeks grinding out currencies because there are caps to upgrade ONE piece of gear. Here is a feel for how many pieces of gear that you can all separately upgrade. Helmet, cape, shoulder, chest, glove, legs, boots, 2 earrings, Neck, Trinket, 2 rings, Synergy Crystal, Seal, Planar Focus and 6 planar essences, two one handed/1 two handed and 1 offhand weapon. All of these require multiple upgrades, cost a VAST amount of in game currencies that is almost impossible to earn unless you have a credit card readily available.And the ongoing insult if cannot perform is “You’re a casual”. Which in itself is dumb. I understand mmo’s require time to get ahead. Yet in this game playing 20 hours a week isn’t enough. You will be left behind in the dust. 40 hours, you better be grinding the whole time. But I suppose non-casuals have played since launch, have been around long enough they already have all the p2w features that Trion has now implemented in their need for greed. So they don’t get the short hand of the stick.PVP… that sums it up honestly. Skill? Non-existent. The maps are neat, the queue times are fast and the idea sounds awesome. Pre-65 pvp doesn’t happen unless you like waiting around for hours for one to pop. The game is heavily, and I mean heavily gear dependent. Forget going into pvp thinking you have a chance. You will just be called a casual because you didn’t swipe your credit card before entering. Since pvp gear caps at about T2 you can buy T2 gear meaning you are good to go for pvp. A fully geared player vs some fresh 65’s could 1 v 5 and not drop below 90% That players skill could be average while the other 5 could be the best players on rift but now are in noob gear. Gear literally makes or breaks everything.Conquest. Don’t bother max gear people just get in premades and walk all over pugs who attempt it. Open world pvp turns into a one sided match. Credit card vs non-credit card. Other factors are people who spent a lot of money on game get awesome boosts like fast mount time, faster mount speed through patron which plays into pvp when someone can cc you and run away and you will never catch up to them. (Very annoying and boring when you actually are winning a fight against team credit card). So if I had to list pro’s and cons.Pros: -	Pve is fun, boss fights are fun.-	Wardrobe is really sweet. All armor collected becomes unlocked as skins for free.-	Traveling around isn’t very expensive using the teleporters.-	Teaming as you level up isn’t bad. Can queue instant adventures, dungeons, and just join adventures who make their party public to share quest mobs.Cons:-	Pay2Win: Buying Earrings.-	Gear grind defines your skill. -	Pvp is not fun unless you have gear. Give a toddler a remote detonator for a 50 megaton nuke, and an Adult who is in the Navy Seals a hammer and a one mile gap between that toddler. That defines pvp. The most skilled can get stomped on by those with better gear. Hammer vs Nuke. Who wins? *sigh*-	Hard to earn currencies, high currency requirements for upgrades, and weekly caps keep you from doing upgrades for weeks on end for one of your 25-26 pieces of gear. -	Cash Grabs, Cash shops. Taking away from players each update to create a paywall that forces you to buy patron. -	Getting a piece of gear and realizing you need Planewalker: Water. Apparently this zone was free which you can go there for free but you can’t even equip half the gear. It also drops in pvp and in dungeons and usually has nice stats for fresh 65’s. -	Game gets buggy, really laggy as well. I had some weird glyphdebugger come up that forced me to reinstall. I have had a few other friends and family also run into this where they couldn’t even play the game for the entire day. Sucks when you actually pay for patron and can’t even use it. Miss out on daily log in rewards and minion quests that you are trying to collect.Indifferent:-	I don’t mind that there is a cash shop. Selling new souls. (Another powerset tree for your class) That’s fine. They worked hard to create that, it’s an addition to the classes and as long as they aren’t some god mode autowin tree I am fine with it. Charging for some school girl outfit, or a katana is also fine. That is cosmetic. A mount, who cares? Other various features like that, that do not make one stronger or better is fine with me.In the end.I don’t mind a company trying to make money. That’s what businesses are designed to do, if it works, sell it. Yet a business is also supposed to try to support its customers, and Trion doesn’t do that. They seem to want to walk all over their player base and then milk them for more money while making them grind for months on end for gear. So if you want to quit your job, stop going to school, leave your kids at the orphanage and become a recluse then this game is for you. Or you can use your credit card daily if you don’t have the time. Either way it’s a cash sink or a time grab. Game is fun, but with all of this…it isn’t. "

												I haven't played rift in quite a while, but it went F2P quite a long time ago and last time I played it, Rift seemed very P2W.The game itself is pretty good. It's basically like WoW but with old style talent trees, more world content and way better mounts. The pve content is pretty good, but the pvp is horribly imbalanced and the character animations are very stiff. It's not a bad game, but it's years old by now and Trion is just trying to milk the playerbase for all they're worth at this point so I'd stay away personally.			"

												Rift was once a great game, back in Storm Legion the f2p model was perfect. It was a bit grindy but you could get anything from the store within a reasonable amount of time. Nightmare Tide lauches and kills all the fun Storm Legion had such as open world pvp and pvp rifts, conquest, pvp stats and gear, and even the raids suffered. Then Starfall Prophecy was announced and people hung on to those small thin threads of hope to see a better game. Starfall Prophecy lauches and just makes things worse. Their planar fragment system is nothing more than platinum sink, our ways of making plat through old content farming was removed, beta testers had quit long before so now we live test for the devs, there is absolutely no balance in pvp, pvp and pve builds are basically 1 button specs now, Some of their paid souls are garbage and the list goes on and on. Here is a video of the best guild and best beta testers RIFT has ever had who were finally fed up with the devs (not game) and decided to leave. I really suggest you watch this video if you are considering whether or not to play this game. EDIT: Guilds like Apotheosys, Coriolis, Critical Hit, Crayons and many hardcore guilds have quit because of the decisions at Try-no (Trion). Therefore, the testing community diminished and the result is a poorly made game.

												4.2k hours in ... I think I'm informed enough about the game to make a reasonable review.Don't play this♥♥♥♥♥♥-Extremely buggy, no fixes or they take forever to patch-Playerbase is non-existent (especially on EU servers)-With the new expasion game is becoming B2P + microtransaction + optional subscription + who knows what new way they introduce in the expasion to milk their customers-If you want to get started, be prepared to spend some serious cash on the game. We talking 100s of dollas, just to get the expasion pack + unlock gear slots + souls-incompetent support (I mean it, they really cant do anything at all to help you with your issues whatever they may be)-heavy censorship and banning-raids are fun (some of them at least) but you will never be able to find enough people to raid with (there's literally 1 or 2 guilds on EU left raiding in 20men raids)-the new expasion is gonna have only 2 dungeons + 1* 10men raid (but that wont even be on release but couple weeks after)-extremely grindy and repetitive-pvp is unbalanced and generally completely brokenIf you are thinking about giving this game a try, don't. Save yourself the time and just trust me on that, the game is dead and you won't be able to get into any end-game content unless you pay some serious cash. I wonder if they'll change the tag of the game from f2p to b2p once the expansion is released. It would be like saying that WoW is free to play because you can get few levels in the starting zone without paying sub ... but I'm pretty sure they won't.			"

												I'm sad.When I started playing this AWSOME game, it stole my heart.The leveling was fun, the community was friendly and the levelcap ( now 65) was easy to reach but hard to do (<- this is a sentence).I got bored when I kept getting some issues with the logging-in. I needed support. The help never arrived.After some time, which was about half a year, i came back. Reinstalled RIFT. Now I know I made a mistake.When i logged in, (the issue disappared) my charcters, all of then gone. Never paid mutch, but i did.Started again, and saw, the community died in the paywalls of the Dev team. They left their community with a game, about microtransactions. The updates come with the word ""Bugfixes"". I did found all of the old bugs, none of them fixed.This AWsome game.....gone AWful. I hate come back and see the recent reviews, went ""Very Positive"" to ""Mixed"".I can't recommend this game. I'm sad about it. But I can't.Nice try Devs. But your luck has ended. The people started to realize what you are doing to this game.			"

												10/10 - The Poor Man’s World Of Warcraft! FREE and Still Good in 2016!This is one of those reviews that you just can't win. Too many have played; too many have developed concrete opinions. This is just my personal take on the game and how it ranks in the genre as of 2016.The graphics and production values are pretty amazing! If you have played WOW this is certainly one of the closest clones. It's not a copy though; this game definitely has its own identity! There are massive worlds, PVP, bosses and absolutely everything you would want in an MMORPG. The member base on games like this is always in flux; currently there is an average of 650 players playing at any one time. Not a ton; but still more than at times in the past! If you look at the graphs from the last 5 years you can really see the trends and the conclusion... This game is far from dead.  A single DLC or major update can bring any game back to life!This is my favorite game in the mmorpg genre; granted my computer isn't amazing so I can't effectively play some of the newest games, but this one still has it going on in 2016! I just got off playing WOW for nostalgia’s sake and honestly I prefer this game much more so. Rift is completely free to play; being a premium member definitely has some serious bonuses like all MMORPGS. The biggest thing patrons receive is more xp, cash and access to the marketplace. The marketplace was a major factor for me in the past; but due to the current member slump it can be difficult to sell on a saturated market anyway. So FREE is still great.So, if you want to play something extremely enjoyable and very similar to WOW without the subscription... I'll see you in Rift! I've played this game on and off over the years and every time I come back I appreciate this game more and more. Please be aware that the member base is smaller than some games, and you will have to work a little harder as a free member. I've never spent a dime on this game and it's given me so much content and hours of enjoyment.Worth $20; my favorite mmorpg by far! It's really free. Fewer players, but still amazing!

												The ultimate pay to win game of all pay to win games. You can buy EVERYTHING for real money. Buying it for anything else takes a long♥♥♥♥♥time. You can buy boosts for everything: experience, money, currency collecting, artifact collecting, crafting experience, mounting speed, mount summoning speed... Getting from 1-60 takes about a few weeks, and getting from 60-65 takes just as long (if not longer).  Unless you buy and use those experience boosts (max time of 2 hrs).Once you finally hit level 65, you find there's NOTHING you can do. You can't do raids, cuz you don't have enough gear. You can't do expert dungeons, cuz you don't have enough gear. The only things you can do are nightmare rifts and events, which net you a certain type of currency.CurrenciesCurrency in this game is a way of saying ""♥♥♥♥ YOU, give us money"" by the designers. Basically, you get so god damned little currency from anything and gear costs so god damned much currency, it takes *literally* 3+ weeks to get a single peice of gear. I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, he's just exaggerating when he says 3+ weeks. I can grind that out in a week."" No. I mean literally 3 weeks. Take for example the chest peice for a cleric at level 65. It costs 21500 of a currency. When you're in the shop page looking at the chest peice, it displays how much of that currency you have in the bottom left of the window. When you mouse over that little currency, it says ""You can gain x of y maximum this week."" That y is 7000 for the chest peice currency. 21500 / 7000 = 3 with a remainder of 500. That's where I get 3+ weeks from. And trust me, it'll take you the ENTIRE damn week of grinding the same thing over and over again to gather the 7000 of that currency because you get so little from anything (~100 at a time). This is without mentioning that there's 40+ different currencies in this game, each currency gets you something different, from vanity items to gear to mounts to minions and so on.However, you can always buy this stuff for real money. That little button to buy things with real money is always directly to the right of the button to buy it for in-game currency. For the level 65 gear, it's ~30-40 dollars PER peice of gear.Yes, MMO's are all about the grind. I don't mind grinding, as long as it's well balanced and takes a reasonable amount of time. For this game, it takes much longer than what I'd call reasonable.Inventory and ProfessionsInventory size becomes a problem within 10 minutes of playing the game. There are about a dozen different crafting ingredients per teir of each crafting profession. You start off with 4 bag slots, but you can buy up to, I think, 9 bag slots (for real money, of course). So, your inventory fills to the brim with just crafting ingredients almost instantly. If you ever plan on doing any profession, as you're leveling up, you want to keep those ingredients, but you don't know which ones to keep for which professions, so you end up keeping them all, and trust me, you'll need them. Unless you want to over-pay for them on the auction house later, or end up having to grind lower level mobs and areas for those ingredients.So, all-in-all, if you plan on doing much without extreme annoyance, you'll end up spending $10+ for extra bag slots. For the bags themselves, you can craft most of them, buy them on the Auction House for an inordinate amount of money, or, of course, buy them for real money in the shop.The bank has the exact same problem as the player's inventory, small amount of bag slots but you can buy more for real money.SkillsSkills in this game are actually a positive. I like them. They're a litte bit complicated and are pretty unique for each class and each soul. Different combos are required to max dps, tanking capability, and healing capacity.The basic rules are: use cheap skills and small cooldowns to power up your more expensive and powerful skills.Each class has a set of different souls. Each soul has a different role: tanking, damaging, healing, or supporting. After buying all the ""soul packs"" for the game, you can perform every role on every class. This is pretty awesome for me, because I like to pour all my time and effort into one character and eff the alts. I also like the freedom to choose any of the roles on my one class. This form of purchasing, I don't have a real problem with (as long as it's a reasonable price). You're buying base game functionality that they worked long and hard on, and it's permenantly unlocked for your account forever, not some peice of gear for 20 bucks that you'll have to replace in a week or a bag slot for a character to hold more useless junk.The prices for the soul packs are reasonable, $20. However, in the most recent update, Into the Wilds, they added a whole new class, the Primalist. To buy JUST the primalist and his six souls, you'll have to shell out ~$45. And they've promised more souls for that class in the future, which I'm sure they'll market for another $20. It never ends with these people.It was this last update that finally pushed me over the edge. Previously, I was defending this game to my friends, but now, I just can't. It's too much. Just damn ridiculous.DungeonsDungeons in this game are pretty fun. They require some know-how and can be pretty challenging. The bosses don't just lie down and die, giving you free loot. Sometimes you have to CC the add, or silience the add, or kite the main boss. It requires actual strategy, not just tank 'n spank.RatingThe only real con I can find with this game is the micro-transactions. However, they mess up EVERYTHING. Like every ""Free to Play"" game ever, they scew the balancing to favor those throwing money at it. The developers make it extremely tedious to do anything without spending real money so that it's more tempting to pay for it. I'd rather buy the game for $60, $40 for each expansion, and pay a $15 monthly for it and have it take a REASONABLE amount of time to gather resources, currencies, and gear with everything unlocked for me (bag slots, classes, souls, areas, etc).Playing this game, you'll end up spending far more money than buying the game out-right with a $15 monthly OR you'll spend 4x as much time doing anything.Overall, I give this game a D-. It *can* be fun, but it just costs either too much money OR too much time to do anything. Neither of which I have in ample amounts. If you're either a teenager without a job giving you plenty of free time, or you're willing to throw hundreds of dollars away, then you'll enjoy this game. Otherwise, stay away from it, it's not worth your time and money.P.S.I did play WoW from the tail end of vanilla all the way to Cataclysm. If you want a comparison from WoW to Rift, this game is most like the Burning Crusade expansion of WoW (the best expansion in my opinion). Skills are semi-complicated, talent points give bonuses to skills, and dungeons require strategy. I could rant on for hours how Blizz ruined WoW, but I won't do that here.I will say, if Rift ever goes from free-to-play to buy the game, removing all micro-transactions and rebalancing currencies, I'd come back to this game in a heart-beat. However, I *seriously* doubt they will. So as it stands, I do not recommend this game.			"

												Had the potential to be the best MMO ever made, vanilla was incredible, then 2.0 expansion Grind Legion came out, then f2p and 3.0 NT brought infinitely more grind. Classes are amazing, as is the raiding but at this point it's not really worth playing anymore. Top tier raiding will require either a lot of money, or a ridiculous amount of time grinding (see Hikos' post on forums about the ridiculous expenses of end game). I quit after clearing T2 NT while being full BiS. T3 is a broken raid and they are now dragging out a fourth tier to put off making an expansion because the game will probably not last much longer. Good job Trion nazi's on killing the only good game you ever made :) RIP APOTHEOSYS			"

												so, rift. my very first MMO. when i started playing i fell in love with it. was such a good game, all the specs and classes were completely somewhat balanced, pvp was fun-ish(not a pvp fan honestly) and pve was the best thing i've ever found. i played a rogue and ended up becoming a world first member of the fires of heaven. sadly the game has declined and declined and declined. plane touch wilds was an ""ok"" ""expansion"" if you were to call it that. and primalist is dumb. 1 button top dps is very very ""pay to win"" as people would say. and then the nerf to mind of madness came. nothing was challenging. nothing was fun. and now there is a expansion that MUST be bought in order to play. rift is officially dead.uninstalled.

												Was a good game when it was pay to play.  I had played this extensively before the game went free to play.  Took a break for a while as they made the free to play transition, when I came back, all of my characters were gone.So I submitted a ticket to support to get my characters restored (You know, the ones I had spent 100+ hours on), and support refused to do anything for me.  Nor did they offer any form of compensation.They basically gave me, someone that had faith in the game, had paid full price as well as a 6 month subscription, the middle finger.  Immediately turned around my view of the game and the developers behind it.Fun game if you can avoid ever having to deal with support.  But I will not recommend it simply because of the attitude of the support team.  100+ hours put into my main character, and they delete it upon the free to play transition and refuse to compensate me in any way for it... Treating a paying player in such a manner is completely unacceptable.			"

												So where to start ? I spent way more hours then those 800 hours that steam recorded since i have been playing directly through glyph now when i started this game i simply couldnt wait to get max level and to see what the game has to offer in terms of raiding / end game content , i must say i was really satisfied and the game had a lot to offer it was pretty polished except for the fact that the performance was chaotic now lets say they ''improved'' that. Anyways i remember you could buy Earring slots / Water plane equipment thingy with void stones and that was a great way for new people that didnt wanna invest real money get into raiding and other activities cause yes no one would take you without earrings unless they were a elite guild/group.Before there was no way you could buy any raid piece with credits , soon you will need credits to even click the '' Play '' button and ofcourse you can buy any Raid Tier gear piece that you are missing to get sooner into raids. You could also freely que for any dungeon/ warfront specificly now that is just a patron thing in other words a pay to grind a dying game thing. There is so much more i could write in this review but i believe this is enough to say DONT WASTE TIME AND MONEY on a dying game where the developers are just trying to squeeze out money !!!When started playing Rift : 8/10At the time of review : 2/10 ( Dont feed them any further they just get greedier )			"

												Best F2P MMORPG I have played so far. Its a fun game with alots of content to explorer in a massive open world with lots of events all day long.The DLC's are very over priced and not really woth the money.The in-game store allows you to buy any gear. If you want the best gear you could raid and get it your self, or just use your parents credit card. Gear is expensive so wouldn't recommand buying it with irl money. And whats the point of playing if you pay to unlock everything?Leveling is alot of fun since you can do alot of content befor max level. You're not stuck with questing untill you reach max level. However, leveling isnt going very fast, ofcourse not, its F2P. They want you to buy experiance potions.This MMO is a great example of what an MMO is all about, teamplay. There are lots of open world events, rifts, dungeons, raids and adventures that requires a group in order to complete.Pros:+F2P+You can scale your level to play with lower level friends. Just adjust your own level and you can play with then without having to create a new character. (Exp will scale to)+Good Graphics+You can have your own house/landscape+Great teamplay/group content (and public groups you can instandly join, no need to create your own)+Big open world with fun events 24/7+Not stuck with questing while leveling up+Tons of events with great rewards+Gear looks awesome+Possible to change appearance+Lots of in-game settings that would normaly requires addons+Addon support+Auto quest system (Kill a mob for the first time gains a quest)+Fun dungeons with bosses that actually require tactics+Your talents can make you either ranged, melee, DPS or healer with different ways. (Example: Cleric has: AoE ranged, single target ranged, AoE melee, single target melee, AoE healing, and so on...)+Some classes/rolls are really hard to play wich adds an extra challange if you find the game to easy.+Auto scale dungeons/adventures. If the dungeon is to high or low level for you, your gear and xp will scale so its woth the run anyway. The drops are still useless though.+Tanking mages+Tanking rogues+Healing rogues+Healing warriors... Sounds all very weird if you played World of Warcraft. ""Ye, I'm a lvl 65 healing warrior"".Cons:-Poor spell effects, I dont really feel powerful as a level up-No story (Well, there is one, but its not really worth it)-Fairly slow leveling-No falling damage. Steel bones?-You can buy the best gear with irl money, if you are willing to pay for it.-Over priced DLC's that you dont need anyway-Some classes/rolls are much more powerfull then others-Not many classes to choose from-Bank got full very fast because of the minion quest system that gives me infinite dimension items for my landscape-Some rare mobs cannot be killed solo because they are to overpowered and require a small group. C'mon, we have world bosses for this.-Support class, of which i dont see the point. You could better have an Extra DPS that focuses on AoE damage then extra heals or buffs/debuffs..-To unlock some class/rolls/race, you need to pay irl money, but then again, its F2P and they need to make money some how.-Tanking mages requires irl money payment-Healing rogues requires irl money payment-Healing warriors requires irl money paymentScore: 8/10It's worth a tryEDIT:This review contains alot of grammar nazi food. I'm not even going to correct them.			"

												It has everything, mounts, a huge open world map, a lot of classes, excellent crafiting system, a lot of subclasses. As a MMORPG it is a deep and imersive history, unfortunatelly the game has turn into a pay to win a year ago or so, the community is dead, and it is impossible to have a decient experience on this game without spending money on it.

												RIFT is a complete and full-featured MMO experience. It gots high-quality graphics and high playerbase with an acceptable file size, which is approximately 19GB.Pros :+Extensive class customization.+Rifts create dynamic gameplay.+Life skills system.+Large playerbase.+High quality graphics.+Detailed mounts.Cons :-Some access locked only to buy-to-play players.-Hard to play for newbies, complex gameplay.-Seems like a World of W**craft copy.

												Its p2win.  Sure, you can technically get the gear for ""free,"" but its ""grind tokens for a month for one piece of gear"" levels of grind.  There are also rare-ish drops in the over-tuned flashpoints that are equivalent to the token purchases.  What this does is encouraging p2win on the left and an obscenely toxic community on the right.  I tried to get back into rift recently, and I had to quit the 5th time I got ♥♥♥♥ed over by a pug for loot.  I'm not so sure how prevalent this was across servers, but the pay-wall and cross-server PUGS (extra-layer of anonymity) encourages it greatly. I'm not just talking about ""but the tank took my dps gear/he already got a piece!"" whining (although that was horrendously common).   My ""favorite"" was when a particularly nice weaopn drops, and the entire group rolls against me for it with the intention of preventing me from winning and having a GM transfer it to their friend, the other rogue.  ♥♥♥♥ me for successfully healing a tough HM dungeon, right? They even told me to stfu because he naturally won the roll (and for the record, he already got loot too). This also ignores the people that demand you be overgeared to do any content, or try to get carried and wipe the group while not even wearing the starter crafting gear for HM's with some reputation items.  No enchants, no enhancements, no effort.  So success rate in even getting the pre-raid gear to drop was low enough.  Then you had to pray your group doesn't stab you in the back for it when it does.So never play it without friends and/or immediately leave a group if you see ~3-4 people from the same guild in there with you.  THey will close ranks and ♥♥♥♥ you over due to the cut-throat P2W formula the game has set up.  Its at least a 50/50, but my experience was a lot worse.That and its basically all just reskinned content.  Oh look, more of the same! just over and over.			"

I used to absolutely love this game, introduced it to many of my friends and we had alot of fun. But recently since a couple of expansions  it has gone to complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ ballant Pay to Win, dead cities and no real sense of community. Instead of spending 100$ on ""totally optional"" expansion packs, I suggest you look at some other better mmo's out there.			"

												I downloaded rift recently, while itching to play an mmo where I could sling spells from a distance and had some nice bredth of classes.Playing as a 'Reaper,' on the both fronts I was not disappointed. Although the information on Rift's website is rather vague and the wiki isn't much better, there's a satisfying depth to each 'calling.' Callings are your basic fantasy classes of Mage, Rogue, Warrior and Cleric. Within these 'callings' there are a variety of skill trees, of which the player may choose three, although there are in-game guides to help the player with recommended combinations which synergise well. You may also change which three 'soul trees' you're using and redistribute points, when not in combat.After your beginning instance, you're let out into the world to do you generic WoW-esque questing. Some small villages centre on teaching you about skills like fishing and survival or crafting professions. One introduces you to 'dimensions,' which are basically small home instances for you to decorate, although figuring out how to get there requires fumbling through various interfaces. W/r dimensions, the ability to rotate and adjust objects on xyz axes is nice and it's pretty smooth too.The negative aspects are however, quite significant. The questing system, graphical style and f2p model feel very reminiscent of various Asian f2p mmorpgs, which are lagging behind in the genre somewhat. In this regard, the game feels very same-y, there's not much I can get from it that I couldn't get from ArchAge or Jade Dynasty, the prior of which has cool things like boats, trans-continental trade and pvp against pirates at sea, to make it stand out some more.Like a f2p Asian mmo, Rift also suffers from the over-zealous use of premium currencies, boosts and other micro-transactions that we're all familiar with by now. As other reviews have pointed out, throwing money at the game gives you the ability to bypass a lot of the levelling(which makes up a lot of the content) and removes a lot of the grind. Not to mention that small cosmetic changes, like changing hair or character's gender costs thousands in this currency. Saving up for your first mount is instead chump change, if you choose to buy premium currency, something which I feel cheapens many aspects of the game. Rift is not shy about advertising patronship to the player either, including a button which is visible on-screen at all times, unless the player deliberately changes the ui layout to conceal it.The dimension home-instances seem like another way to squeeze money out of the player, by encouraging them to purchase furniture using premium currency, as much of the items above-beginner level became substantially more expensive.Lastly, although there's a sustantial effort made to explain how the 'soul tree' skill tree system works, there are other areas of the game which require more explanation. A number of quests required that I craft say a fishing lure, but gave no explanation as to how to do that. Instead, I had to read through the dialogue to find instructions clearly added in after much player confusion and frustration. Granted, I would have seen this had I read the dialogue the first time, but so much of the questing was so very boring and outdated that I had little motivation to really care about why I was collecting 10 Mutated Meat or killing 8 undead. Again, there's little information on either the website or the wiki, regarding this.I don't have anything against the game, nigh pay-to-win features aside, but it's just not very good. If it wasn't f2p I wouldn't have played it at all and I have a hard time believing people once willingly paid a continual subscription to experience Rift. The good features of the game are unfortunately drowned out by the more generic or out-dated aspects and what enjoyment I did get out of it, quickly drew to a close.			"

												After 1k+ hours of playing this game and what I've experienced nowadays as an endgame semi-hardcore player. I can no longer recommend it as the game starts to become downhill and the P2W aspects are rising up lately where it becomes unfair and unbalanced the progression paces with the F2P players simply because most of the powerful gears or BiS can be simply obtained through buying of ""Gambling Lockboxes"" or paying vast amounts of real money for their ""Bundles"". Although it's still possible to get them through working for currencies in order to buy them or raiding should you pursue PVE gearing or PVPing for vice versa. But it takes ages in order for you to get its desired full sets in order to advance on the next tier progressions. In conclusion, F2P's luck will matter more along the way to win their rolls on the dropped gear by the boss when raiding or in PUG PVPing is how competent your team is as long there isn't much bads it'll be better.One absurd thing that I've noticed is that there will be a potion implemented to boost your character's level instantly into 60th, what a smart move Trion has done to let these payers SKIP MAJORITY of the contents of their game and just advance forward to the expansion...Also, one critical aspect comes with ""Expansion"" souls (AKA Subclasses) which requires to be paid tends to be the most useful and becomes a requisition in certain purposes later should you do raiding or PVPing. Which will certainly influence a couple of F2P players to pay these in order to expand their performances of competence in more different ways (Expanding different builds).PVPing is broken at the moment  because each soul isn't completely balanced in its proper scalings. A Mage Pyromancer has the strongest ST DPS than the other callings' similar type of souls, a Rogue's Physician whom is an ST healer tends to be unkillable and can easily save its other teammate no matter how strong their opponent's DPS is. And most of the players doing PVP tend to be casual and cares only to finish their dailies with no intention of taking things seriously granted.The customer service tends to be unsupportive as it takes a very long time depending on how well they'll care answering the players' concerns (Varying from a week to a couple of months), which will also end up having a generic response similar to what we'll hear from other companies. Therefore, you'll most likely find the answers for your concerns through the old threads on the forum.With the new 3.0 expansion. It's even much worse than before. The new currencies have a capacity limit rather than its previous expansion where the currencies have unlimited capacity, and there is no way to remove the cap of new currencies. Also, their new ""Earring"" slots are locked and is beyond paywall which requires the F2Ps to farm tremendous amounts of currencies which takes around one whole month to farm that non-stop without resorting to the usage of boosts or patrons. This kind of business model they're doing is ramping up to tremendously waste your time to achieve this, and I'd say it's not worth it. Let alone paying them up which I think is around $20-25 is better despite you can earn that amount in less than a month.Same goes from the other things they have introduced. Such as the Planewalker: Water is the same way of unlocking the Earring slots. There are several amounts of new gears in the game that requires you to have this attunement, or you cannot equip them. Then the new factions which are extremely tough to level their notoriety when you're unbuffed, it's also the same as leveling up your character in that region. There is a couple of players who have completed everything in the three new zones (Main/Side Quests and Carnage), and they still ended up around the 63 or 64th level which is ridiculous.I'm very disappointed for what they have done in this game. Everything was just fine during Storm Legion. Until they made it much worse to change their business model to cater more in P2Ws than F2Ps. Their motto ""No trials, no tricks, no traps"" is becoming a lie except that the game is still free to play without trial periods.			"

												It's a lot like WoW before Kung Fu Panda and Pokemon took a steaming♥♥♥♥♥♥on it. The visuals are great, supersampling for the higher end computers. Interesting dungeons, with tons of things to distract you from the monotony of questing. Good crafting. Decent community, though every Shard has it's trolls. It just wouldn't be an MMO without them.Only real complaint about the game is slightly sluggish combat. The developers went for style before fluidity, but with any luck that will be improved with the next expansion.Best of all, completely free to play and yes there are features that are held back from you as a free player (eg. limited bag slots, character slots), but that doesn't really harm the experience and the game is completely playable, and enjoyable in it's entirety without spending a penny.

												Back when this game had a subscription fee and decent raiding, it was actually quite a great game.In fact, it was so great, that I played this over World of Warcraft.However since it became free to play, it also became pay to win.The game is now an extremely slow grind, the content updates are mediocre and feel unfinished.I reinstall the game every now and then because I forgot why I stopped playing it.. Only to quickly find out why I uninstalled it. Sad.They should have stuck with the subscription model, it worked out much better.Interesting to see that the game is actually worse when it comes to optimisation than it was at launch though.It's clear where they're putting all their effort.

												Please note the hours I have put into this game. I've been playing for 3 years now, and I am very particular about MMOs. I also don't like to spend money without justification. The only money I spend in RIFT on a regular basis is when I feel like I want to buy a new mount or some kind of consumable. You don't have to pay anything to enjoy this game or have access to the content.I have played most of the content solo, but it is much faster and more fun if you have friends to play with you. One of the new features Trion has implemented is sorting new players into starter guilds (defiants or guardians) on each server (shard). This helps new players find other players, so don't stress about being lost.There are many people in the game, despite other statements in the reviews. Many of the older, larger guilds have died out, but there are lots of smaller, newer ones that are active and growing. Find them and you'll find the happy, thriving player base that makes the game enjoyable.You don't have to buy the Soul packs to play effective character builds. You don't have to be a patron to get things accomplished -- it just expedites some tasks and adds conveniences. You don't have to have full raid gear. Trion has simplified many facets of the game in the time I have played it, mostly for the betterment and greater enjoyment of the game. If you feel like you DO need to buy the soul packs and expansion goodies, wait until there's a sale. You can get everything you want for a fraction of the price if you don't suffer from instant gratification issues.Immerse yourself in the story-rich world of Telara. Explore everywhere. Talk to NPCs. Delve into the Achievements to find fun rewards for doing things that aren't in your quest log. I hope to see you in the game!			"

												So i baught this game long ago before the game was free to play, then came free to play and the game was good. Left the game and only returned recently. Started a new char as i couldnt remember anything about the game and all went fine, in fact i liked the game a lot! Gameplay is solid, questing is good and is a nice alternative if you dont do pay to play. At around lvl20 i thought well i need better gear so let me queue for a dungeon. Hours in the line and no group found... that kinda broke the game for me, a newbe who wants to  see all that there is to see couldnt even do some dungeons. Basically if you are new to the game and you dont have a max lvl char and what to experience the complete game then dont do it. After playing some rift i thought ill give Guild Wars 2 a go again and after 5 mins in GW2 my time spent in rift felt like a complete waste. If you are looking for a good mmorpg my  suggestions will be to leave rift and get either GW2 or WoW. Rift has great potential but at the end of the day there are better games out there. Great potential but i think the free to play move was something that hurt them.			"

												1243 hours of Rift, Thats how long I've lost of the time in my life while grinding raids, and pvp. During pay to play the game was at its absolute peak with players on at all times of day raiding, doing dungeons, with the content for the water plane, the game has changed horribly, gone are the holiday events were you could earn things in game now its pay for achievements. Even with the ability to buy prior raids gear when new content drops I felt as though the game has lost its charm and quit playing. I have not played the recent content but I hear its more of the same but I felt it changed and regained some of its charm of its past. I would recommend this game if you are looking for an MMO to play free, but I beg of you not to pay any money for raid gear simply because it defeats the entire purpose of the game and becomes stagnant very fast otherwise.

												well i agreed with all negative reviews that you can see here.. Rift used to be my fav before and Ive spent a lot of money on it (im obsessed with character customization)..but by time, the in-game currency is not enough for you to enjoy the game, which you HAVE TO pay a bit using real money to keep yourself 'comfortable' along your journey.. so that you wont be the weakest person in that game especially if you are in the PVP zone, and someone who is ""richer"" than you can kill you easily using their more ""expensive"" weapons and stuffhowever i really love this game back on those ol'days.. the gameplay, the way you customize your character, the mounts, the dungeons, good fps and graphic even on my lowest spec pc, the parade (on certain events only)...oh yeah you have to pay a bit to get a good mounts so you can move a bit faster.. the expensive mounts, the faster you can move..TBH, Rift SHOULD NOT be free-to-play game at first place. They should sell the game like ESO or GW2 and we pay to play the game. So that these terrible things can be avoided.p/s: rn im spending my money on TESO (on character of course) :D "

												if you like pvp don't touch this game!1)there is no pvp untill max level do to low population and removal of incentives for f2p'ers2)max level has a huge gear gap so when you 1st start you will lose 90% of your pvp matches do to no fault of yours or your teams since matchmaking will tend to stack the better geared players on 1 team. (lack of players is also at fult here)3)do to to pvp matches consisting of steamrolling your opponent or getting steamrolled, pvp is unfun. there are very few matches this will not happen in. 4)rift has about 10 souls for each of the 5 callings that you can mix and match BUT 1/4th are useless for dungeons/raids and 2/3rd are useless in pvp. a note: the 5th calling is a pay one with about 7 souls, the 7th you need to buy in a soul pack and since it didnt sell well they have not fixed the weapon procs or the resistance bugs it has. 5)you can p2w to top gear and avoid this. (this is good or bad depending how you look at it) end game gear is only $400 if you want to be ""competitive""6)the rift engine is still unstable even with the new fix and you sometimes get dc'ed normally when your winning a pvp match.so what about end game raiding?well do to rushed content most end game raids are bugged for month upon release and sometimes forever after(there are still bad bugs in content made when rift first came out). they are also removing hardcore raids but not to make rift mainstream (like wow did) but do to rushed content people can not beat the bugged content without making it easier also if your a streamer and stream raid content you run the risk of a guild wide ban if you do something the devs don't like or if you have an ""agitator"" in your group. for normal dungeons again do to low population and a change to the que system no ones does these untill end game and at end game people just want a fast run.you can do open world pve untill 60 with little to no issues but at 65 the paywall will smack you in the face. open world pvp is dead and the one pvp server is barren.the game used to be so good with a great f2p model but 6 months back they changed to an aggressive cash shop model and now rush all content before proper testing can be done that will normally crash the server like last week when it was down for 2 day because they didn't test the holiday updates or just leave some things outright broken for months untill they get around to patching it. some holiday events even have the same bug pop up every year that never gets fixed like a Halloween quest that doesn't give defiants the reward. sadly this game was a hallmark for a good f2p model but has now gone the way of the other rippoff f2p games.p.s. there is a item in game that lets you buy credits with in game gold but the amount you need to get is very hard to amass since alot of end game things give little to no cash (about 30% only give 1 silver and thats the lowest amount possible)			"

												a decent MMO marred by horrible support.  my experience with rift was good  it was good enough i decided to buy into the game so i bought a sealed boxed edition of the storm legion off amazon   that had a bonus code for a walmart only preorder cloak for my characters to use (i didnt care about the bonus cloak i only mention it  becasue its relavent to my troubleshooting process.)  once i get said boxed edition i go to try  and register the cd key for the account upgrade  expecting no problems at all  as i researched everything via the  trion worlds faqs about buying boxed edition after it went free 2 play  so according to the website this should have unlocked 4 new talent trees to play with... however in stead i was treated to the error message of ""an unexpected error has occurred please try again later""  so  i tried inputing the key code again double checking to make sure it was 100% correct again ""an unexpected error has occurred please try again later""  at this point i type an invalid key just to see what error message the site gives out and im greated with ""invalid or expired key please check your code and try again""  so its definitely not user error.  so at this point i try the code for the cloak and it works no problem frustrated i file  a ticket with support  checking on it daily  for 3 days straight there is no activity AT ALL  then i post an update askign about the status and stating  that even a notification of  "" we got it we will get to in in X business days"" would be acceptable and within 24hours i get just that a cookie cutter response saying they will get to it within 72 hours..... and that was the last communication i got out of them on the ticket for  the 4 more weeks i left it open  after 4 weeks of no response  i got understandably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and  closed the ticket citing the lack of support  as the main reason i closed my account.  long story short  its a fun game UNLESS you need to deal with customer support as they dont care about  the players  and as a result i will not be supporting this or any other trion worlds product i reccomend other plaers also steer clear of this product due to the lack of customer support			"

												I bought this game, many moons ago when it released. My girlfriend, and a mutual friend of ours decided to play this while we waited for the next wow expansion. Initially, it was quite entertaining. we ran around as the Defiant, murdering the ever living crap out of everything, a warrior, a cleric and a mage, we were quite the happy triplet, killing our way to the ripe old level of 29. (Mind you, this took weeks. Granted, probably because we couldn't play all that much, but it took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever.) Eventually, our little group fell apart, me and my now ex parted ways, and our friend rushed to the level cap and got bored quite soon after. So, fast forward to when this game comes out on steam, and I try to reclaim my old account, thinking I'll give it another go for old times sake, because why not, right? Anywho, long and exceptionally boring story aside, Trion refused to give me back my old account, because I didn't have the CD code, or remember my old as hell password. Despite the fact that I had the name of the account, the credit card, and a bunch of other nonsense. So I tried making a new account, played it, got bored, stopped. And finally, and the last time I'll ever turn on this abortion of a once decent game, I bought the nightmare tide bundle, got the level fifty, and then realized the entire ♥♥♥♥ing expansion was a zone from Cataclysm. Never again rift, Never a♥♥♥♥ingain.			"

												If you are a fan of Wow you will most likely like this game too.Much like World of Warcraft you take quests from quest givers and it is a MMO game. You can design your character and how it looks. Very good graphics and controls for movement. You can team with others to finish quests. Very enjoyable game.			"

												This game has become a major cash hog with pay2use classes and p2w cashshop. During it's former subscribe to play glory, the game wa great.. made a few max level characters and enjoyed every aspect of the game such as the mix and match classes that give you a unique playstyle. I loved this game before, 650 hours will agree, plus the 200 or so hours not logged from using off-steam launcher. But.. now with you having to buy new classes, and being able to buy gear off the cashshop.. this game has gone down the drain with it's free-to-play model and 'loyalty' seem which grants users benefits for spending tons of money on them. I tried playing again, and no.. I just can't. I enjoyed seeing the new stuff, but the Rift I played before is dead and gone. I miss planning raiding, doing end-game high tier dungeons, trying to be the first to finish them! RIP old Rift.			"

												Bought this game initially when it was pay to play and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was, recently returned to discover that the new model for the game is utterly disgusting. 100% pay to win. It isn't just convenience items or cosmetics which have made their way to the store, but even gear. Unless you enjoy regular ganking in PvP or you are happy to shell out a considerable amount of money then I wouldn't touch this with a barge pole.100 euros gets you 24,050 credits, which may sound like a lot until you look at the price of items, horrific!Such a shame the premise was great. Trion you should be ashamed. Would have been a 7.5/10 for me but the scalping store 3/10 and that's a damn sight more generous than Trion is. AVOIDAddendum if you want to buy tier 2 armour and  weapons it would cost in excess of 100,000 credits, there has got to be a sanity check somewhere ......			"

												TL;DR: Cash crab, p2w and most Subscription based games are cheaper.Having played this game THOUSANDS of hours, coming back after each expansion for a while only to realize that the game is becoming more and more of a cash crab.DO NOT be fooled by the ""Free to play"" tag.Another great game ruined by purely corporate greed.Rift is essentially unlimited trial and you will NOT be able to reach max level without paying 40 euros.(f2p limited to 65, max 70)Limited Specialization options for f2p, the most powerfull(interesting) ones being behind ANOTHER paywall. Straight out UGLY in game item models(Probably to make the cash shop seem more tempting)*RIP* 2011-2013			"

												This game is dieing because of the devs, they are killing the game by bring out unfinished updates and being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to the community. There is a lack of players due to this now, when I started playing rift 2 years ago there was 3 times as many players that I would come accross on my adventure but now there aren't too many. This leads to a not very fun experiance and long dungeon ques if you aren't 50+ for SLE que and 65 for normals. I would not recomend spending your time in this game if you have a 9 to 5 job as there are many more games which you will find more fun.			"

												4.5/5 RIFT is a free to play MMO with a familiar (Warcraft) feel to it, that does enough to distinguish itself from all the other f2p MMOs out there.Pros:- The class system has been designed with flexibility in mind. Every class has the ability to switch roles, so you could be tanking in a dungeon one minute and doing solo quests as a DPS the next. MMO newbies can play with preset skill-trees to avoid being overwhelmed, whilst MMO veterans can tinker away with custom builds to their heart's content.- Dynamic zone events. You can be quietly questing in a zone, when suddenly, rifts open up spawning mobs and eventually, the event boss.  This encourages everyone in a zone to band together to close rifts and take down the boss, which is great fun.- How you choose to level up is really flexible. Do quests, instant adventures (kill/fetch quests with other players), zone events or dungeons.- RIFT is still actively being developed. Version 3.0 is due soon (end of Otober 2014)- Once you hit lvl 50, a new skill tree system (planar attunement) opens up, offering more customisation. A special set of dungeons (Chronicles) designed for 1-2 playes also becomes accessible from lvl 50+.- If want to try dungeons (designed for 5 players) but haven't got guild friends to join with, you can join a dungeon queue that will automatically match 5 random players together. (Note: the wait time depends on your role, it seems that tanks are in short supply, followed by healers)Cons: - Quests can get a bit grindy sometimes; many are of the ""collect 20 of ..""  or ""kill 12 of ..."" variety. However, occasionally you do come across more fun/unusual/interesting/innovative quests, lifting the game above your standard MMO.- Some zones are not well optimized and FPS will suddenly drop from a smooth 60fps down to 20fps. - Free players can buy stuff from the auction house but can't sell (although there is a trade chat channel available). It is possible however to use in-game currency (plat) to buy something called REX that another player has paid for using real cash. The REX can be used to unlock the ability to sell in the auction house.Recommendation: If you want to experience the fun and familiarity of an MMO like Warcraft, but don't want to pay a monthly subscription, then RIFT will provide exactly what you are looking for. It is a well-designed, flexible game ... and did I mention it was free?			"

												10/10Playstyle is a bit similiar to WOW, and other mmos, but the more you play the more you will see where it differs. Very good, very good mix of things to do; dimensions (player/guild housing), PVP, IA's (questing in groups, no boring solo grind-- unless you like solo... I sometimes do :D), dungeons, story sagas, and more. Try it out, it's free after all. You do NOT have to pay a dime, they have REX, which is bought on the Auction House for platinum. So, there is a way to get credits with in game currency. Ignore those who cry about how this game sucks you dry, they know NOT what they speak, not understanding business within the game industry and/or want everything and anything for absolutely FREEEE. Of course they have to try and make some RL money off of some players to keep the game afloat, but it doesn't mean it has to be you giving them money (leave that to people like me, who would rather spend money on this game, than a movie.) That being said, yes, yes you can buy gear and awesome things with real money (by spending credits--also available in the very active auction house in the forms of REX)Community is very good, has very minimal trolling. (tip: set your settings to not read low level chat, it's where the few, but funny trolls with god complexes lurk...) XDBuy the wings and dye them pink, dance for money, and watch them sing. They will point fingers at you, but you don't care. They are peasants with dull, dull hair. This is your time to shine.Give it a shot.<3			"

												I'm sitting, currently, at about +1000 hours, with four max level characters, so I feel that I have a sound understanding of the game. I am also a former WoW, GW2, PW, and other MMOs player. That being said lets dive into it. 6.9/10Pros:Leveling to max level is easy.Crafting is really easy to understand.Souls are different and easy to swap between.Your bags are almost never full (unless you have a hording problem)PvP can be enjoyable.Pugs are rather realible.The community is mostly friendly.You don't really need a guild until max level.Everyone can be everything.Cons:Some aspects of the game take a long time and a lot of focus to get. EX: you need 4kish Void Stones to buy an upgrade component to upgrade your gear. It takes a while to get the Void Stones and it becomes rather grindy.It's overall rather grindy. Grind raids, grind pvp, grind dungeons.. That's all max level is..Getting multiple characters geared takes a long time so your better off just having one main and not really playing the other classes.You NEED to raid to get gear at high levels.. You need raid gear to tank the dungeon to get the raid gear.The PvP maps get really stale after the hundreth time you've seen them and the dev's don't really seem to care.There are only two conquest maps, and I really only see one anymore.The dungeons are also very repeative and the low level dungeons become quickly tiresome.They've tried to make instant adventures better but they still make you want to peel your skin off after an hour or two.Also they aren't adding more free hairstyles. :(It's a pretty ok game, just try to ignore how some of the races look when they run with weapons or swing their weapons. I noticed it and now I can't stop watching the way my warrior swings her sword..			"

												Huge F2P MMORPG, if you like an expensive world and lots of choices like different classes that can have multiple specs at the same time, switching on the fly from a tank to a DPS to a support. Huge dynamic open world battles that affect the hole zone and are lots of fun. If you like hundreds of quest and interesting story and dialog this will suit you. You can use addons to tweak the game to your liking even further. Definitely worth a look as its now F2P and not Pay to Win.			"

												This game is basically World of Warcraft with debatably cooler graphics and some tricks (like world events) layered on top.  And no panda bears that I've seen yet. I'm very impressed that it's free to play.  I've only played ~6 hours, but for the first 20 levels (at least) there is plenty for a solo player to do.If you like that style of third person, triggered-action style controls, there is no reason NOT to play Rift.As a criticism, the UI isn't especially intuitive, and it takes a bit of work to figure out how to do things like craft or gather resources, or why things are happening.  The lore doesn't seem particularly polished.Still, I'm having fun running around with a buddy, doing fetch quests, and gearing up.  Give it a shot!  Nothing to lose but time.			"

												If you enjoy non-twitch MMORPGs then this is *THE* MMO for you. It gathers together the best ideas and mechanics from the past decade of the genre, added a unique mechinc with Rifts and the result is a very fun to play MMO packed with so much content that you always have something to do.The F2P system is probably the best you'll find in this genre. It is definitly *NOT* P2W and with being able to buy REX for in game platinum, you can purchase anything in the shop. Even a subscription can be purchased with nothing but in-game currency exchanged for REX other players sell.If you were ever a fan of games like EQ, DAoC, AC, WoW, WAR and the like, you'll love this game. It is the pinnicle of what we all came to know as an MMORPG. Rift doesn't really break new ground. It's not a terribly innovative game.  BUT, what it does do, it does very well. It has scratched my gameplay itch in every possible area for that familiar MMORPG feel I've come to love.			"

												Starfall Prophecy is a a repeat of lots of whats already on the maps in Rift.  Many of the images and scenes look the same.  The game has been up and running for five years now and could've dedicated money to adding more design and much better lore along with more activites.  As it stand right now they are using some of the same mechanics for their lore.  this time they actually have narration going on by what sounds like semi-professional speakers.  Also the playerbase has decreased drastically now.  Before the game was largely composed of its starter palyers.  Seems many of them have left, as the devs have had to start putting all of the populations on acombined shard at log in.  The experience is simply not worth my $40, along with a $15 monthly patron and pay for any additonal souls that just happen to come out.   So I've already uninstalled the game.			"

I feel like when this game launched, it was super fun when it had a huge community, but now that it's died down, it's just not the same. They've tried adding newfeatures and things, but it's just too little too late. I'm still gonna hop on whenever I get the urge to, but the urge will go away sooner than later and it'll just get boring again. Bummer. Great concept/ideas, not so great execution.			"

Posted: December 5, 2016
												This review is current as of 12/5/16.Where do I start? I've had loads of fun playing RIFT (about 5k hours, just over half through Steam) and do not regret a single moment. I started playing during Beta 1 (though I had proximity to the game's development prior), and from the Eye of Regulos to Ashenfell, it's been a wild ride. The rifts are what make the game world different from other MMOs. They're dynamic events that can appear throughout a zone in a number of locations - in 6 different types as well as variations of the rifts within those types. I still have yet to finish all of the planar achievements, and it's been almost 6 years.Then there's the soul system. While some souls are paid for (3 per class/calling), the combinations you can make with them are only limited by your imagination. There is an argument to be made that the cookie-cutter specs you can find on the official forums are currently better, and that does detract from the original ""any spec, any time"" aspect of the game. Some specs are simply not viable in endgame content, like Druid was for clerics for a long time.The community appears at first to be a mixed bag, but the chat is filled with a vocal minority of trolls. Ignore them and carry on, and you'll find that there are plenty of nice and welcoming players in the game. I'd suggest turning off the CrossEvents channel if you don't care for what political rant there is that week.PvE content? There's no shortage of that - between questing, rifts, planar invasions, dungeons, and raids (past, current, or upcoming), I doubt you'd find a way to finish all of it amazingly fast. Even with store experience boosts.PvP - it's always been a bit lacking, but it really took a hard hit after Nightmare Tide (Patch 3.0), when PvP-specific gear was removed. Low-level warfronts (Rift's battleground system) take upwards of an hour or two to get a queue to pop, and Conquest has been dead for a while (until it gets updated with current rewards). However, max-level warfronts are still alive and kicking and have a different meta to them than PvE content as far as specs go.And the big question - is Rift P2W? Nope. Rift, if I had to sum it up, is ""pay-to-progress-faster"", but nothing will ever give you a solid gameplay advantage long-term in Rift other than the loyalty system (extra mount speed is nothing to sniff at). Most of what is in the store is either fluff or used to get alts to max level (currently 70) faster. With Starfall Prophecy, all content after level 65 is locked unless you buy the expansion pack, but a trial to 65 out of 70 levels with nothing to lose on the way is amazing, compared to other MMOs that limit you to level 20.There is, however, a significant time investment required - in the form of reputation grinds (I use the term loosely), gearing up through the various tiers (which reset every expansion pack), and money in general (Planar Fragments in Starfall Prophecy being a particularly hard platinum sink). Don't let that deter you from the game - after all, none of these time-investment-specific requirements apply to the level 1-65 content, which is entirely free with no timegating!If you have more questions about the game, you can find me on the North America region servers: Maladii@Faeblight.

												I used to play this game through the Glyph app instead of through steam, I spent everyday just playing this, I loved it, there was so much meaning and a great story behind everything you did, but unfortunately Trion has done something terrible to Rift after they released 3.0 which completely messed it up and made so much seem so pointless. Everything below level 63 is meaningless unless you farming achievements. You can't queue for specific dungeons and warfronts anymore unless you're a patron. *sigh* , it just seems like it's become a pay to win type of game so yeah... If they ever decide to get better and fix their mistakes, I'd probably go back to this but not right now :/			"

												I really wanted to like this game, the gameplay is extremely fun and the world is amazing to explore. However, the more I played the game the more I realized how much of the game you miss out on unless you use the point shop. There are two gear slots that are locked, as in you cannot equip that type of gear, unless you unlock them by spending atleast $20 in the point shop. Also, there is a ""loyalty"" system, which adds a currency limit and prevents you from listing items on the auction house unless you reach a certain loyalty level, and the only way to get loyalty is, you guessed it, spend money in the point shop.   I've never seen so much desperation from a company before. I would not reccomend this game unless you're willing to spend some money to get the full experience.			"

												This game... I adored RIFT. It was the first MMO I really sank my teeth into. I have at least as many non-Steam hours in RIFT from the independent launcher if not more, but my god. They went from ""Free to play with little restrictions here and there,""  to ""OPEN YOUR WALLET AND DUMP IT ON MY TABLE WHILE I ♥♥♥♥ YOUR♥♥♥♥♥"" in a matter of months.Every single thing I loved about this game has been killed off or stuffed behind some type of paywall or another. Do yourself a favor and don't bother installing. Because in a year or two, you'll look back, miss what the game was, and then realize you need to spend a ton of money for some trash souls and a portrait frame after you've already sunk a few hundred, (if not more,) dollars into it.

												Pros:-It's free. You can't go wrong with free games. Get bored? Leave for as long as you want and come back whenever you want. You don't have to worry about paying for a month or so of game time when you only want to play for a day.-Thanks to Rift Exchanges, which people sell for in game money, you can buy everything including expansions without paying a single penny.-You can transfer characters between shards (servers) for free, but there is a limit to how many you can do in a week.-You can temporarily move the character you're playing to another shard without limit, though you will return once you log out of that character.-If you have no friends who play this that you can quest with, you can just join ""instant adventures"" which will automatically join you to a raid group. You will even be brought up or down to the level of the group's quests temporarily.-If you want to go back and do a certain dungeon but you're too high of a level to normally be in a group, the game will automatically bring you down to the level of that group.-This game is in no way pay to win. Everything you can buy you can earn the equivalent of. No one class is really better than another. Also like I said above, you can buy absolutely everything with in game money.Cons:-Not a lot of people are low level so you might have a hard time finding a group in your level range, and it is very hard to find a group to do dungeons with.-That's about it.

												Rift.New to the game?Want to play a toon that can tank at the forefront and lead your team/raid through dungeon after dungeon defeating hordes of mobs and spectacular bosses? Then go to Youtube and immerse yourself in every video ever posted on the topic of tanking, memorize every dungeon, every mob, boss and tactic before you ever roll your toon or you will be on everyone's ignore list who figures out that you're in a dungeon for the first time as a tank. There is no room for learning anything if it involves being in a team. It's pretty much the same for every class.There is ZERO tolerance for being new to anything in this game. The player community is completely toxic . . . in a nice way.Other than that? The game is terrific.			"

												Y'know, maybe if this game actually LET ME PLAY, I would like it. Ive heard from friends that I was hoping to play with, that this game is pretty good for a F2P MMO. So after about an hour of fidgeting with the account creator, I got in. But alas, right after the character creation and before I could even play the game, I was banned. For what you ask? I dunno, cus they didnt tell me! After emailing them they responded with""Due to heavier traffic than usual, we are to busy to respond. We thank you for your patience.""...Not only did they ban me for NO reason, they also havent responded to my email. Until I get my account re-instated, I am quite upset with this game, and the developers.			"

												Although many MMO's have come out after the rise of WoW and it's slow descent, this one stands out of the crowd.I have tried MANY other MMO's, but not live up to this one in comparison. Although Rift is F2P, do  not be mistaken. It is not pay to win. IS a large game, so I cannot cover it all, but I will cover a good portion. Pros: Introduces rifts, something unique to this MMO.has a very special talent/skill tree system that varies greatly and can be used many different ways and still be effective.Cons:Races aren't extremely different=Poor Machinima abilities.Being inside cities on anything but low or minimum graphics will kill your average computer.Don't get me wrong, I love Rift but it isn't my favorite all time MMO, my favorite is what WoW used to be but Rift is the best MMO around currently.

												Game was great about 3 or so years ago...once it got released onto steam, it slowly started changing scope.  The playerbase is dwindling.  The game suffers the same fate as many MMOs...you release new content and then realize that once you do that, there is zero reason for the playerbase to visit the ""old game areas"" that were fun and populated unless they are grinding a new character.  Worst part about the game is the releasing of new sub-classes or ""souls"" that you need to buy and are often times overpowered.  LIke has been mentioned as well, the game is laggy even with the smaller playerbase and just doesn't feel like the old game at all.  Can't recommend it anymore.			"

												After so much time spent in the game I finally drow the line... The thing that drove me here in the first place was the diversity in class system. It offered so much possibilities and promissed that you'd never run into another player with same skill set as you... but not anymore.Game before:-Huge open world to explore-Many interesting zone events-Many ways to make a skill build-Interesting and challenging dungeons and raidsGame now:-New expansion brought a new piece of land (a comet; even though it doesen't look and feel like one) and you have 4 and a half zones to explore (after 5 months in the expansion 1 zone is still not finished)-Zone events are repetitive and the same in every piece of land (kill 100 invasions, close 6 rifts and kill boss)-The game forces you to make certain builds (hybrid builds unusable anymore; tanks that don't make a build in a certain way get one-shotted by the raid boss)-4 dungeons (2 new, 2 old, rehashed ones), ""expert"" difficulity is too easy to do and one dungeon is still broken with no fix for 5 months, 1 ""raid"" (it is actually a 10 man expert dungeon if you compare how ""hard"" it is with no trash mobs) and one old raid in the making that will come out some day (no one knows when)If you are planing to play this game, DON'T. It's not worth it.The dev team doesen't know what they are doing it seems. Bugs everywhere (bugs discovered on Public Test Server weren't fixed and ended up on live server), skills unbalanced (will probably never be balanced), the game crashes even on high end machines... Simply stay away.P.S. Stay away from the forums for this game as well. Forums are highly moderated in the way that any kind of criticism is severly dealt with (any kind of criticism).			"

												This may have been one of the better MMO's out there.  They took what was good about WOW, and in some cases improved upon it.  Crafting/combat and professions are decent.  The lore and background writing are very good.  Questing isn't too much of a grind.  Graphics are quite good also. The problem?  You can play for free, but it's tough.  Extra bank slots, etc. cost money.  You have to have credits/REX to purchase these things and boy do they make sure that EVERYTHING can be upgraded for a price.  You can buy REX with ingame money, but it takes a lot of platinum and that takes a lot of time to earn.  Now I got the monthly subscription for $15 a month.  Turns out it just gives you some perks that really aren't that helpful.   It does not increase your bank vault, etc.  You STILL have to buy credits to do that.  So the subscription is not really worth it.  Now I could live with the cash shop mentality and just spend the $15 on credits rather than the subscription.  That would be the better choice in my opinion.  You're still getting a high quality game for your money.  The DLC's are another story though.  Drastically overpriced.  $150 for the Ultimate Nightmare edition?  I played a character up to level 35 and was enjoying it, but the fact that nonPVP is not an option turns me off.  Getting constantly griefed by a 60+ over and over is not fun.  Especially since the server was touted as PVE/RP.   Apparently that makes no difference and every server is set up the same, no matter what it says.  I would happily pay for the game if I had the option to actually have a co-op role playing type experience, but sadly that's not available here.  Conclusion.   If you're looking for a mature, role-playing game to enjoy and not be all about who's the biggest imaginary badass, then this is not the game for you. P.S. The coarse and racist language on the chat is pretty bad.  Doesn't seem to be moderated at all.			"

												6/10I started playing RIFT before it was even full release. (Like many I used the executable/patcher to launch outside of steam even after release. Until I had to reinstall when SL patching messed up, so... that piddly 1k is time after SL only.)RIFT 'was' an awesome game with good support and a REALLY awesome community. The game had alot of elements, which were in it, were going to be in it, some of which no other MMO's had at the time. In my eyes it was akin to an attempt at the 'Next Generation' of MMO.The game evolved and grew over the first 2 years, it had it's share of bugs and problems, but they worked hard and got things sorted out quickly and fairly.The problems started, when Trion or the development group decided to do an 'expansion', one huge bundle of content to put them far ahead and allow them to evolving the game without having to struggle so much to keep up (Atleast I thought that's why they did it...).Following this decision there was a major slowing of evolution/updates/content. It was expected, and yet it had bad results.During the 'Lull' in content, alot of players fell away and some guilds either merged or died out.When the 'Storm Legion' expansion finally came out, it did help revitalize the community 'somewhat', but with the 'X was the first to' seekers and the massive hunger resultant from the break in content, alot of new content got chewed through by some in a matter of days.After the initial burst of players, the population went back to, or maybe even more low than before, with even more guilds merging or dissolving.Trion decided then to re-vitalize the player base by going Free-to-play. (*Demise music plays)About 3 days after the game went FTP the general chat went from asking for an extra for a raid or new players asking for help to something akin to trolls vs gold spammers. Sure there was idle chat and such before, but nowhere near the same magnitude....Going into a random when guildies are offline, meant having an overgeared party that doesn't know/use mechanics and ignores when told, won't use interrupts or help skills out of fear of DPS loss or who knows what and then rages at the healer when they die from their stupidity despite being over geared. Sure you get good parties too, but it went from more like 4/5 with 1 of the 4 being a 'learning' party, to 2/3 with 1 undergear, 1 overgear and 1 drop/lame, to like 1/6 with 1 being OP and playing right and 5/6 still being OP, but being macro only players who only do DPS and can't move or insist on having 1 only macro with built in 'dispel magic' type abilities and still stand still, both of which have primary skill called 'rage healer or tank and DC'. Well, PUGS always had atleast a small gamble element, and there were still plenty of 'good community'. A mature player might have to scroll through 50 lines of text to find a question and 'whisper' a new player to help, but the help was still there.I stayed for a while and played in some of the decent guilds, but even some of those had troubles from bad players joining and having to be kicked or just getting freebies then leaving. I know of many large kind/good/fun guilds that ended up moving to Badlands, Star Wars MMO's and who knows what else. (I think one even went back to WOW...)FTP has not wrecked the game. All the higher tier items and things are not buyable, and there is still some good guilds with nice/mature people in them around, so that raiding can still be fun. Sadly, although the FTP element has been implemented reasonably, I can ohonestly say the move has certainty affected the type of in-game community that's there unfavourably. I would not be surprised if the servers ended up reduced to only 1 or 2. Support in the same boat as FTP hasn't wrecked the game or made it unplayable, but has certainly affected the community in a negative way.Trion changed the handling/personnel of the game around the time of the SL expansion (Not long after release I think it was...)The original support was almost instantaneous in-game and up to 48 hrs outside of, and was very fair in checking logs and being strict but properly compensating and helping.The support now seems more like 72hrs in-game and 1-2weeks outside of (I had patron status if that makes any difference -> AVID trader AH user/trader). And the support became more like talking to a telesales/outsourced helpdesk or the like where you couldn't even be sure if they even knew what the game was called, let alone help or not give 'bad robot' responses.The first big event with a death boss was a good example of this. When I tried to get to the boss it was SO chunky and the game crashed about 2 mins after I finally got there. Sounds bad.... but Trion did patches and within a day or two the event was back up and running I got to participate with only minimal lag during the boss fight. Players were also compensated if they attended the initial event just incase they couldn't re-attend on short notice.From what I heard the last time a big crash occured recently in RIFT, they just rolled back the servers 6 days instead of fixing. :O I wasn't on at the time, but well... I can totally understand some of the angst that's there.If your an original player who loved the game for having good support the current level will likely hit you like a truck full of concrete. Having said that, it doesn't wreck the game, but it sure doesn't make you wanna play/pay/support it.New players be sure to try the game, it has lots of story and content to explore especially if you don't skip the lower levels....For old players... RIFT is like any other thing in life that gets broken... it can never go back to the way things were. You either have to put up with the junk that goes with it or just leave it alone...			"

												I played Rift since the beta, I usually play rift without steam so I could've gotten more hours on record but anyway, rift. This game doesn't really have a good first impression but once you get the feel of it, it gets addicting and can be a legitimite replacement for what ever MMO you are playing now. (WoW.. Cough.) It has a unique class system that pulled me right away when I was playing in the beta. The balancing of the classes are mostly turned towards the PvE side of the game. PvP you ask?.. Well, PvP isn't Rift's strong suit... at all. While it can still be fun, the imbalances can make it frustrating and the enormous amount of 'bad' players can really make you bite your lip. I feel as though rift's PvP is more balanced for group play than solo. Also Facerolling is quite common, so it's best to bring a pre-made party. The PvE side of this game though is exellent, it really makes you think what is the best spec for each situation you are in. Actually, the class system makes the game, it is very good. Once you are starting this game, it is wise to not stick to one build; make a TON of them and make the right spec you see fit to your tastes and works in your favor. There is a lot of things going on the map at all times. Rifts, are a key machanic which the name of the game implies. They pop randomly on the map and when you complete one you could get some wonderful goodies in return. An other cool thing are invasions that wonder across the map, making the game feel alive. But during an event, these invasions can get hairy and could literally conquer a whole area. Your quest hubs will be invaded and even main cities. This encourages group play which is very nice as well. You'll usually be grouped up automatically and fight against the baddies is some type of full blown war.Speaking of wars, this game is pretty CPU intensive so big wars might make you lag, a lot. Any good mid ranged GPU will run this game well but don't skimp on the CPU, god help you if you don't. I would love to write more but I am pretty busy at the moment, it was nice to test this steam grading system out.PS: The ingame store is pretty nice, they put a lot of work into it. Also nothing in the store will give you SUPER MAX ENDGAME MEGA GEARZ. It's mostly costumes and funiture for your ingame home. The lockboxes don't have anything worthwhile inside, though it is good for gamblers or whatever.			"

												First off, I've played this game for hundreds of hours outside of Steam. I have 2 max level characters.The people who think the game is P2W haven't looked deep enough. The shop is deceiving at first glance. It shows the highest tier armor for sale for real-world currency only. What you don't see, is how to get that armor in-game for free.The highest tier (raid) armor is achieved by UPGRADING lower tier (dungeon) armor, which you CAN do for free (quite easily in fact) OR from buying it directly in the shop for real-world currency. The game is not pay-2-win, it's pay-2-skip. You can either take the time to get geared yourself or skip past that and go straight to raids.Now that that's out of the way, the game itself is pretty easy to describe. It's a F2P WoW clone. It looks like WoW, it plays like WoW, it feels like WoW. I've never played another ""WoW clone"" that gave me this feeling I never knew I was missing since I stopped playing WoW.That's not to say that it doesn't have it's differences. The class system is amazingly customizable. Put simply, remember the talent trees in WoW, pre-Cataclysm? In Rift you can mix and match the three talent trees from 11 trees per class. Mix Warlock with Stormcaller and Frostkeeper as a mage, or Marksman with Bard and Assassin as a rogue. Make familiar classes like WoW-style Warlock by mixing Warlock (affliction) with Necromancer (demonology) and Pyromancer (destruction).There are other innovations as well, far too many to go into in this review. However, none of them keep the game from playing like WoW.TL;DR: If you're looking for a F2P WoW replacement, this is by far your best option. It is also not P2W though it may appear so at first glance.			"

												Game play, graphics & storyline was great. But since this game is free, there are a lot of restriction in it, unless you are willing to pay. For example, bag slots, armor slots (earrings). I can understand the game need to make money in some way to keep it running but for bag slots or and armor slots? I personally think it went a bit too far. Most MMO now a days are more or less the same but only apply to skins or mounts, for ""want"" item(s) and not a ""need"" item(s). Therefore, sadly I ahve uninstalled the game.			"

												RIFT is a free-to-play MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game. Wow what a mouthful) set in the plane of Telara, a typical Tolkienesque fantasy world with a twist.Both playable factions are arguably good and arguably evil. The Guardians are religious and magic-centred, and despise the technological Defiants, whose machines they see as blasphemy. And this is where you come in; as an Ascended warrior, brought back from the dead to fight the corruption of the Dragons and the sinister Regulos, who want to destroy Telara to save the other planes.You will be sent back in time in a Terminator-esque plot to stop the invasion of Telara when it starts - when the rifts came. Rifts are tears in the dimensional fabric of Telara that spew out monsters from other planes - and fun events where you fight waves of enemies falling from the sky. They're what makes RIFT what it is.With low specs, lack of ""pay to win"" features, interesting story, and fun monster-fighting events, you'd think I'd recommend this game. Well... No. Most of the gameplay (not including rifts of course) is actually pretty dull. I would like to know what an Ascended warrior fighting against the game's equivalent of demons is doing picking mushrooms.I tried out the Autumn Harvest event, as I was bored with the regular gameplay. It was actually a bit of a disappointment - the usual dull grinding, except this time you're given the quests by a devil-like creature in a tiny orange clearing. I was hoping for a Hallowe'en themed rift.In short, the game is for the most part dull grinding with few rewarding areas, although the Devs throw a lot of free stuff at players. I would not recommend using your hard drive space on this game unless you don't mind hours of mindless grinding.			"

Grind Till Ya DropOverviewAfter tapping both the ""Yes"" and ""No"" buttons several times in response to the question ""Do you recommend this game?"" I realized that I'm kind of indecisive about the whole thing. My view on it is completely torn down the middle. In some ways, Rift is incredible. In other ways, it's downright terrible. In the end, I find that ""fifty percent"" isn't enough to recommend the game. I have to say, sorry, but you should pass on this one. But don't leave without reading why I think so. There's a lot of ground to cover.Before you comment on this, I reinstalled the game on the Glyph launcher and stopped playing it through Steam. It might not track my hours correctly, but I have been playing for about 3/4s of a year.What I liked about the game:1) RIFT borrows heavily from WoW, especially early iterations of it. The UI is the same, the cooldown and GCD system is exactly the same, the crafting, the queueing for dungeons and battlegrounds-- I'm sorry, ""warfronts""-- the talent trees (again, this is more like early WoW, not the garbage ""three choice blocks"" WoW has nowadays), the combat, the classes, and even the stats each character needs is strikingly similar to WoW. If you've played WoW, you can pick up RIFT very easily.2) The talent trees are intuitive and creative, because they can be customized. You can have a build-your-own-spec based on three trees you can pick from and place points in. This makes for a very fun experience in creating your own class. Many of the best specs in the game were found by other players just messing around with the custom talent trees.3) There is something in the game called ""Instant Adventures,"" a sort of endless barrage of instanced questing zones that you can enter with 20-something people. It's the dungeon instance 2.0, and works great. Well, while you're leveling, anyway. After you're max level, they're obsolete.4) The graphics are breathtaking and realistic. I definitely prefer it over WoW's cartoonish style.What I didn't like about the game1) At first I thought to say ""This game is well-populated"" but then I forgot that only two servers really are. The rest are deadzones, especially the oceanic server. If you play in the UK... you will be forced to play on a North American server, in timezones opposite of you. That... sucks.1) At 65 (the current max level) the game sort of... halts. You will not be getting into raids very soon, and I can guarantee you that. You know why? Because you need a certain amount of ""hit rating."" This is RIFT's equivalent of ""item level,"" except to an insanely unfair degree. The grind for gear is literally endless, and not at all fun. The methods to obtain gear may also be totally obscure to you when you ding 65, as it was for me. There is no set path to take. You might get gear by either winning warfronts (and no, you can not buy gear with the tokens you obtain from warfronts-- you have to get it from the box), or by doing what is called ""Nightmare Tide Expert Dungeons"" which are exactly that-- a nightmare. Neither of these things are the least bit fun to do, so naturally, it seems even worse when you're doing them just to upgrade gear.Now, when I say you might get gear, that's because gear isn't guaranteed to drop in the box you get for winning a warfront. You have a chance at it. And if you're like me, you will lose so many games that the chance at gear is even lower than average. I have so many unspent favor (""honor"") points because none of it goes toward anything special. Apparently, people tell me that I will use them later to ""upgrade"" my new gear I get from the boxes from winning warfronts. And it takes tens of thousands of these tokens just to do that. And yes... you HAVE to upgrade them, because otherwise you won't have enough hit on your gear to do raids... or anything else. So even after you get the pieces you need, you still have to lose hundreds of warfronts, get tokens, upgrade all the pieces... it's awful. God awful.So, you don't like to PvP? Okay! Do NTEs instead. And wipe constantly on bosses. When you finally do about twenty painful dungeons and get a piece of gear you need, you have to also upgrade THAT with tokens. But not with the PvP tokens. You need ""fragments"". These rare, coveted Fragments of Darkness and Fragments of Madness are mostly obtained through daily dungeons queues and months and months of weekly quests. I say you'll be doing them for months, because that's how long it'll take you just to upgrade a few pieces of your gear. It is the most sluggish, hellish, most boring end-game I've ever played in my life. It isn't even an ""end game"". It's just grinding gear. ""End game"" should imply being able to do things at the end of the game.Because of this boring charade, most guilds are casual, because they're forced to be. There do exist raiding guilds, but progression is so slow that you never hear a thing about them.More than one person in RIFT has explained this to me: ""Trion Worlds made the grind so long because they want you to give up and shell out the dough to buy all of the gear for credits"". At first I thought ""that makes no sense,"" but now... it kind of does. You can buy gear with real money in RIFT-- for hundreds of dollars. No average-income Joe can just buy the gear and P2W because it's so expensive. But over months of time... an impatient person could very well buy the gear they need one piece at a time, and it all adds up. I already know a few people that dumped real money on gear pieces because the grind is so bad. I think what they're saying is true. It's all because of greed.And no... being a patron (""subscriber"") does not help with this. You have to grind it out just as much as the freebies do. Which brings me to my next gripe:2) Patron status sucks. I get nothing for being a patron exect a crappy weekly ""gift"" (usually a trove box with junk in it worth nothing) and something called ""affinity""-- yet another type of currency stacked upon the already massive mountain of currencies in the game. Affinity buys you mostly casual, cosmetic crap, and very few things that improve your character. Yes, patrons get bonuses toward mount speed and experience... but the increase isn't by very much, so it's not worth it. You also get ""loyalty"" for spending real money in the game. Loyalty also gives you mostly-cosmetic junk. No gear, though. Or anything else that might be useful.3) Notoriety (""reputation"") grinds. Because having to grind out a faction's rep on top of grinding for gear and grinding for crafting mats adds to the fun!4) Dream orbs. You remember enchants in WoW? Okay, think of those, but only imagine they once in a while gave you a useless stat on your gear that means nothing to you, so that you're forced to sink hundreds of gold on them to get the stat you need. Sounds like crap, doesn't it? Well, that's because it is.5) Lockboxes and troves. Trion will dangle rare prizes in your face in hopes that you're stupid enough to drop a hundred bucks on these ""limited editions troves"" they release. They do that by showing you this sparkly, awesome mount that can be won inside. The chance at getting these mounts is extremely low. It's been tested a few times by people with even more time on their hands than I. You'd have to buy over a hundred boxes at five bucks a piece. Come to find out, people are stupid enough to buy these, so they keep making them. Keep it up, RIFTers. Keep being part of the problem.6) Plat is hard and slow to earn unless you spend real money on tradeable creditsFinal Thoughts""Gear-grinding"" is used as ""game content"" in place of real game content.

												So I was recommended this game by a friend. Character creation is pretty limited, but the classes/races/sides option sounded pretty cool. I started the game, got maybe 10 minutes into it, was killing mobs, leveling up and all of a sudden I get randomly banned out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere. All I was doing was killing mobs in the starting area, then when I click the link for ban appeal, it takes me to the login screen, well when I try to login to ban appeal, it responds ""The account you're trying to login has been banned"" How the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to appeal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of the blue no reason ban if I can't login? So I had to make up a random email so I could appeal the ban and the little brats never responded. I honestly want money back even though I didn't spend a penny on it. You people can downvote this review and think what you want but it doesn't change the fact that this company is♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ you, and rot in hell Glyph, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

												Rift is by far one of my favorite MMORPG games I have played in many years. It has a great leveling system and a customizable abilities and skill point tree system. The skill points can be placed in one of 3 catagories and most classes have 6 sub classes to choose from. It has your standard experience point leveling system and a good crafting system. The mobs are fairly self explanitory just like most MMO's are. Now the community is a little slow. There isn't a gigantic community like WoW but there are some really good people and great guilds out there. The graphics are good and the gameplay is great also. It has a customizable UI/HUD and many positive points. Now I do have a few problems with the game. But that is with all mmo's. The mob spawn rate is a little fast for the amount of travel for the missions. Also it is now A FtP game and that makes it a little bias cause we as free players are stuck with lower stuff and I understand that but there should be a way for us to get the same stuff without a sub. All in all a fantastic game i recommend to everyone			"

												I dont rly write reviews, but I need to share my thoughts about Rift.A lot of ppl say its a cheap copy of WoW. Well, i can tell you that its not true, at all.A lot of ppl complain that they get ban for no reason. Again its not true at all.Rift is an awesome game. Its free to play and because of that you cant just compare with a game who have Subscription.Rift has a lot of unique system. Like how class system works, how rift sistem works e.t.c ( if you are interesed, you will find more and more in the game ).Here, when you start to play, you will feel that ""Adventure "" . An adventure that in a lot of MMORG is lost.Personaly i rly think that Rift is a good game,i like it, i play it, in the future i will buy from them if  i want something. ( and if you have a little problem with money, worry not, Trion offers REX, a consumable which you can buy DLC with, classes etc. all that with game money!I wish you a great day ! "

The game was fun. fairly simple and intresting to see how different i was to other mmorpg'sComing back and trying it again.... this game is very lackingI check the game is free now pretty cool, micro transaction, uhhhh not a big fan of that but sure but playing this game for a while. i felt like this game is just pay to win or grind really hard i know you would be expected to grind in mmo rpgs but this is like 2X the grinding to the old rift and i just wanna play some dungeons do some rifts meet some new people. Now most of the time its just grind.			"

												Nice alternative to WoW, it really is F2P if you dont want to have extra things like Auction House, but you really can play the game for free and reach max level and get the best gear all for free.  In addition you can farm hard to get enough currency (highest being Platinum or plat for short) and buy an item called a REX thats a $10 item, making you no longer F2P.Its has some features that make it unique like the rifts, and having a dimension (a house basically) which is friendly to RPers, (I just duel people in my dimension to avoid lag or interuptions for anyone)Pretty good.(IMO just spend 10 bucks to get to the point where youre allowed to use the AH, then make millions of in game currency, worth it)			"

												Increased grindwall to wear out playerbase so they end up paying for the gear that would take months to get.Increased microtransacctions.Someone ought to tell Trion that grinding to upgrade gear isn't a form of ""end-game content"".Difference between ""patrons"" and ""free players"" gets wider.It's declining.The fact that even with this Rift stands as one of the ""best"" mmo's out there should show how dark the scenery is at the moment...I can't recommend it unless the player is aware that more often than not, gear will come paying in real cash, not in game currencies, and no amount of time except a lifetime or grinding solitude will ever get near to.

												Game industry is quite big and we have many ""aka"" World of Warcraft games to play. I've spend in WoW too much time and ny now i can tell you that RIFT is in many ways best so far. Nothing personal, I'm respecting WoW, i really do. But RIFT is installed on my PC, not WoW. (Use to play WoW since Europe beta for several years. Im old_school player of 41 years old)You have uniqe and pleasant game play, by uniq i mean - uniq. No more today's MMORPG games can give you so many options in one game at once. I'm dont wanna make any propoganda here who is number 1 and who is not and why is that.What i can advise is just to spend some time on youtube videos comparing RIFT and WoW and I'm sure you'll get the difference.If you love to play MMORPG and in love with kinda WoW game, my advise to you - Just Try RIFT.

												So here i am again... thought ill reinstall and see if things got better, some stuff fixed, optimized.But reading the reviews, that's not the case.Won't reinstall and obviously wouldn't suggest to.Its your typical F2P game, you can (and must if you want to stay fully F2P) sink loads of hours into it, grinding different currencies, daily missions and so on.You can also use the auction house to aquire enough standard currency to buy shop services from other players.Or you can just pay for it in real money.There is nice features, like instant adventures and random groups for instances.The style and design ist bizarre in the nightmare areas, very funny if you like that, i did.The mission system is a bland ""fetch x amount of this"", ""kill x amount of that"", ""talk to person x"".As such the game is nicely done, don't get me wrong.I sank a lot of hours into it and most of them were fun.But much of it wasn't fun and with time that part becomes bigger and bigger.The grinding becomes soo very grindy.And if you don't want to spend hundreds of bucks on this, you will have to farm the daily and weekly missions on a regular basis... soo tedious, like having to go to work every day.The FPS drops in populated areas are ridiculous: 10 FPS for a lot of people... constant complains about it in chat.With the FPS issues come lag spikes and disconnects... lots of them.The anti hack measures regularilly mix things up, many people need to ask for confirmation emails to unlock accounts on a regular basis - many email providers in europe autoflag those mails from this specific company as spam or even won't let them through in any case.These issues have never been openly aknockledged let alone adressed by the devs while i was there.As a result the general mood between players and staff was asinine last time i played.Add to that, the fact it is rather old now... only the starter areas and the endgame areas are populated, in between it feels almost like a single player game.And it is in that stage of an F2P that i'd call the harvesting cycle.Money is made, by offering the same mount like last week - but this time in blue instead of red.... isn't that sweet?Real new content is only reluctantly added, so the long term players won't run away, and this content is implemented in a glitchy manner.Be aware, that after a steam download, you will require a lenghty update download from the games website.

												F2P? Not anymore... While technically you can spend 100s of hours grinding to buy the SP exansion, you can no longer do anything without it. Yes, there are still are still things you can do F2P, mostly solo now as everyone who still plays has moved onto SP.Yes, you can still PVP but you get matched against xpac players so you can't really do anything because the bolstering system is broken. You are probably wondering why I am complaining about the grind when Nightmare Tide was worse? Well everything about Nightmare Tide were small modular grinds that when paced right don't feel like a grind at all. SP is just a straigh up $40 grind to continue having any fun in the game.I don't know if SP is any good but if you are planning on playing this game without paying you have to grind so much that you will get burnt out before getting there.If you are the type that doesn't mind paying for games, I think you are better off with Newer, more populated games at this stage...Sorry if this seems like a rant, I'm sad that a great game has been ruined by being locked behind a paywall.

												I played this game since beta until recently. The optimization is bad, and the cash shop rules all. When the game first went free to play it was great, but they keep moving more and more towards a pay to win model. RIFT started out as a phenomenal game, the first expansion was pretty cool, and the second was good until they started focusing far more on their cash shop than on fixing any bugs (there's a LOT) or on improving optimization (I can run anything else on max with a decent framerate... RIFT needs to be on low or medium to get 30fps in town).Great game that Trion's exceptionally poor management has ruined. (Kinda like they did to Archeage)			"

												RIFT in and of itself is a decent game. However, there's some things about it that make it really hard to recommend.Pros: - Graphics are relatively good (better than Everquest 1/World of Warcraft but not as good as Elder Scrolls Online)- Invasions are a regular thing that can take over a zone and kill quest NPC's. In some cases you have to participate in the invasions to get them out of your way to do other quests.- Content is split up into solo content (open world), group content (mostly instanced things) and raid content (instanced with a few in the open world)- in group or raid content only 1 person has to enter the instanced and it'll offer to pull everybody else in the group or raid into the instanced as well.- Once you ignore somebody it ignores their entire account (the character, any name changes and all present/future characters on the account)- The wardrobe system is awesome. Whenever you achieve a weapon or armor graphic by having an item in your inventory it's added to a permanent account-wide list. From this list you're able to choose what weapon and armor graphics you want your character to have. - Guild quests are an interesting concept that I haven't seen in any other game. The fact that your entire guild can be sent on 1 objective is a cool idea. The perks gained from leveling your guild up through these quests also can increase quality of life greatly in game.Cons:- On the note of invasions they can also be a con because they kill quest NPC camps. Sometimes there can be so many invasion mobs in one camp that it looks like a herd of cattle except their all stacked on top of each other.- The community. A good portion of the community has made it to my ignore list due to how they act in groups, PVP or in general chat. On the bright side, the game seems more pleasant when you get all the bad apples on ignore.- To do random dungeons to get the daily reward bonuses you HAVE to have a full group. Therefore even though it would probably be possible for me and 2 buddies to complete a dungeon we still have to get into queue and gather 2 more people.- Dailys and Weeklys. You find yourself doing the same 10 repetitive quests because that's how you receive currency to achieve new armor/weapons. Somebody once asked me in a group what they missed because they've been gone 7 months from the game. I responded with ""about 7 months worth of dailys"". - The wardrobe system also has some downsides. To get all of the graphics for armor and weapons you, in theory, have to do raids as well. Some of the raids require a number of people to even enter the instanced even though the content itself would otherwise be soloable in future expansions.			"

												As someone with over 500 hours in this game, I think I'm qualified to say it's worth your time. Is there a lot of grinding in the end-game? Yeah, there is. But there's grinding in any MMO with end-game content. It's unavoidable. That being said, end-game will be the only thing you're grinding for. There's no grinding before you hit 65. And the leveling/questing process is one of the best I've ever seen in an MMO. I should also mention that dungeons/raids/pvp aren't the only end-game, either. There's amazing new questing zones once you hit 50, and all the current expansions are free and will remain free (though the new expac will be buy to play).As for earring slots, they ARE pay walled. BUT, you CAN buy them if you grind out 50k voidstones (which, honestly, isn't that hard). Some of the souls are also pay walled, but any extra souls are just fluff. This game is not, and never will be, pay to win.			"

As of 3/1/2016 here is a simple guide to what content is locked and what isn't.Not Behind a Paywall-Main story line-Rifts-Zone Events-All zones and areas-Low level dungeons-Low level PvPBehind a Paywall-Dungeons (or all the fun ones, at least)-PvP warfronts (or all the fun ones)-Gear slots (no, im not kidding)-Raids-Auction houseAsk yourself, would an MMO feel complete with no dungeons, PvP, raids, or auction house? I'd personally say no. Trion has been slowly pushing their fingers into the player's wallet, and as of recent its gotten out of control. I used to love this game, but when I saw that dungeons which I used to be able to participate were locked, and even gear slots which I willingly bought were unavailable to me because I wasn't a 'patron', I had enough of trino's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I very happily spent $60 on this free game on my own terms, and to see that I was locked out of content was laughable. Great stuff trino.			"

												After 3,500+ hours ingame, I can't recommend this to anyone anymore.   There are good points to the game of Rift - all of them deal with the players. There are bad points to the game of Rift - most of them deal with the developers.Buggy game is buggy. Devs slow to, or don't act on many bugs.The state of current Pvp would be a joke, if I could bring myself to laugh about it. It's sad.If you ever plan on raiding for the top tier weapons/gear, give up that hope now. If you're not in one of the top raiding guilds on one of the top tier rotations, you won't ever even see a good portion of the raiding maps.Log in issues (search 2024 or 2025 error) blow. Shouldn't happen.Trion devs are in massive damage control mode on forums - dropping permaban hammers on anyone that dares not agree with everything they feed you.I could go on, but no. If you're going to be a casual player who logs a few days a week to have fun for free, by all means go for Rift - you'll enjoy. If you have plans for anything past that... I doubt the game will be around long enough for you to achieve all you want.			"

												I would definitely reccomend this game, IF  YOU HAVE A FRIEND TO PLAY WITH YOU.Solo is also fun, but in my opinion I think when you have a friend alongside you it makes  the adventure so much more fun, even boss battles/quests feel more awesome, when you both have had the experience and can think of tactics/etc with a friend, In my experience having a friend with you makes you more motivated to play and play against eachother, its almost like a leaderboard between 2, you can brag about who has this and that/etc xD. Playing this game with a friend =10/10 experience.			"

												Rift has been my favorite MMO for a while now.  When I started playing it, I didn't expect much since it's free to play and I was used to WoW.  I think Rift is SO much better!  I love the graphics, UI, quest lines, instances, zones, PVP setup, etc.However, lately it seems Trion is trying too hard to make money off of it.  Also, since reaching the level cap, I've lost a lot of my interest.EDIT: The amount of hours it says I have played are wrong...I have a life, I swear!  If you leave the Rift app open on your phone and the launcher open on your desktop, this is what happens.  >_<			"

												It was really innovative at headstart. With so many Skills and combinations you could go for. Now that there is the possibility to go for everything with every class (Tank, Healer, DD) i feel like it's nothing special anymore to choose between classes. And i think there are better MMORPGs out there that got a fresher look to it. I always got the feeling that the game is a bit clunky, that it's not that fluent, like i felt for example by playing WoW or Guildwars.			"

												In my 63 hours of gameplay, I have come to know RIFT as the best MMORPG I have played so far. With a fun and addictive gameplay, I may not know much about the game, but it truly is amazing. TRION was very creative with this game, and the storyline promises loads of excitement, both with friends and on your own. What impressed me the most hoewver, was actually how they turned the respawn mechanic into part of their storyline. It may seem minor, but that proves their creativity.			"

												This free to play gem is a wonderful addition to anyone's library (hell it's free and worth your time to at minimum check out).  The core mechanics of the game are fine tuned and honed to the point where they deserve to unthrone the other kings in the MMO realm (looking at you World of Warcraft).  The free to play system does not sway into pay to win, and actually overall has improved the quality of the game from when it was subscription based (I played for 4 months at release).  The graphics in the game are of high quality, but not to the point where it takes the rig of God to run it.  The environment is well done and captivating.  The soundscape is something I was very impressed with ...  from the music to the combat sounds to the dialogue (it isn't overloaded with dialogue thank god) it all sounds just right enough to help immerse you in the game.  The combat mechanics and skill trees have been very fine tuned since the initial release.  They have become quite a charm.  The about of talent customization you can have in this game is....jaw dropping and awesome - an MMO theory crafters dream come true (I happen to be one).  Controls are as most 3d MMO's go, and is straight forward.  The UI is good, and there is a fair amount of UI customization mods available on curse.  I recommend this game for anyone seeking a good RPG or MMO that doesn't want to pay a lot of money, or any at all.			"

												RIFT is a solid alternative to World of Warcraft. I've tried other free-to-play MMOs (Tera to name one), but they felt really linear and they wern't structured that well (if that makes any sense). Not RIFT. This game has everything you'd expect from an MMO. Dungeons, various PVP battles, and (my favorite thing about RIFT) RIFT has A LOT of world wide random events that encourages every player to come together and conquor. RIFT is by no means a pay-to-win game either. Everyone has access to everything. The only limitations free-to-players have is only having two character slots, a currency cap of 2500 platinum (which is a lot), and not being allowed to create auctions (which may sound bad to some, but there's trade chats, no player-to-player trading restrictions, plus you can earn that privilage by buying REX from players with in game currency). I highly, hightly encourage you to at least try it.			"

Im sorry but i'm not paying 40 euros for the expansion, even if I did my friends would not so its a waste of time and money... Uninstalling right now... THIS IS A JOKE.

												RIFT is a MMORPG kind of game . As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character. In RIFT, powerful rifts threaten the entire world as they rip into reality and release powerful forces that threaten to devastate all of Telara. New characters, events, treasures, and more are introduced with each breach and rift. The world is consistently changing around you and is dynamic.The rifts have created divisions and schisms among the Telarans. Players are given the option to either seal the rifts forever or to use the power of the rifts in order to create their own power.Thus, it is your choice to follow the one of the two rival factions, that, both want to save the world, but with their own unique way. Guardians are the chosen of Telara's gods, the Vigil. When the tyrant Aedraxis called forth the power of the Plane of Death and devastated Telara, the Vigil chose the most powerful souls taken by the Shade to be the archons of the next age. A golden age awaits, but Telara must first be saved — by deed, by example, or by the sword. Its people must be redeemed, its corruptors cleansed. Only then will the Guardians be imbued with the divine and ascend to a higher level.The Defiant do not care whether the gods abandoned the world or not. To them, this entire planar convergence disaster is the gods' fault in the first place. Indeed, as soon as things went from bad to worse, the gods suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. Instead the defiants worship machines and technology.Enough with the lore, now onto gameplay. RIFT™ has both PvE (Player vs Environment) and PvP (Player vs Player) systems. In each mode, players attempt to uncover the secrets of the planes. The game also features an innovative new class system, called ""The Ascended "" that has limitless possibilities to build and advance your character. The player chooses a soul from one of the four callings: warrior, cleric, rogue or mage. These initial souls begin weak, though as the player progresses so does the soul. As these souls become more specialised, the player will be weaker in for example combat, but will gain magic strength. Players can later choose to augment, or even replace, embraced souls with other souls from within their calling. This is called ""Soul Attunement"".As far as content go, I mentioned PvE And PvP content. PvE content consists of Dungeons, Raids, and - what else - Rifts. Rifts are a main feature in the game ""Rift"". Rifts appear first as tears in the fabric of Telara, and eventually fully open on their own. They can also be opened using a Planar Lure. Dungeons are instanced areas designed for a group of 5 players to complete. Players can create their own groups or find other players through the looking for group tool. Raids are instanced areas designed for groups of 10 or 20 players to complete. All raids are designed for level 65 (At the time of composing this) characters. PvP content consists of battlegrounds called Warfronts that are tiered by level, and conquest, a huge scale battlefront consisting of three factions striving to conquer the zone.			"

												I am very difficult when it comes to MMORPG. Don get me wrong WOW apart from the cartoonist graphics has put the bar way way high when it comes to game play and everything else. Problem is that after 7 years of gaming and a ton of money i decided i won't play games with a monthly subscription. I want either free to play games or just buy to play games. After wow it was so hard to find an MMORPG game and i was looking around for months trying all the free to play games or at least free to try games. I wanted a game with a great content , good community and game play like wow but with different elements and different if not better graphics.I found Rift and i tried it. At first it felt a bit strange compared to wow although very similar. I loved the graphics and the game play so i continued (It is free anyway so nothing to lose apart from some of my free time). The more i played the more i loved it until i fell in love with it. Overall it is a great game and it can be perfect. What i didn't like to the point that i can say i hate about it is   first the macro thing. I was used to play wow with just 3 to 5 keys where i had all my rotations. Here you can't do that . Now about the money. It is a fact that if you want the dlcs or the extra packs you have to pay alot money. This things are overpriced. It is also bad marketing. A gamer that respects himself won't pay that money. For example i see that the DLC is about 30 euro and the packs start from 25. If i am going to pay 30 Euro i am expecting not only few more classes. i am expecting a new race, at least 5 more lvls , and new content with at least 10 new dungeons and raids. a DLC or a PACK the way they are in rift shouldn't cost more than 9.99.To tell you the truth they should be 4.99 . And guess what! The company would make more money like this cause almost everyone could and would buy then. More people would start the game and less people would quit. For 30 to 50 euro i am not expecting a pack or a DLC i am expecting a new game or at least a really good and huge expansion .So as not to get me wrong or cheap .I am 41 and spending 50 or 100 or even more for my hobby is nothing but i am expecting equal value. Today i log in to steam feeling i want to spend  money on a new game or on an old one. This review came from a man that 9 months ago spent 4.000 euro for a new desktop pc and hotas joystick and pedals just to play Star Citizen. I am angry and sad about Rift because i love it and want to continue play it and see more people play it . In order to have that , The company has to start giving value back for the money they want. Content people !!! CONTENT, make the customers happy. Make things cheap so people will be happy to throw some money for value at you. Today as i sead i wanted to really spend some money in to Rift. Call it shopping therapy if you want, so i logged in to the store looking the DLC and the packs, comparing them looking at the price and the value i am gona get and i didn't buy anything because i was disappointed.I appreciate the fact that it is a free game and people especially younger people that don't have money to spend can enjoy the game up to a good point. I was more than happy to spend about 50 euro so far progressively as i was getting to know the game for things like earring slots, extra bug slots, extra char slots and staff. I was happy to give back to you in the form of money the enjoyment i was getting and i want to continue give you money. I mean 750 happy hours for 50 euro is nothing. Plz help me and give me reasons to give you more money. Revive the game, add meaning full contend and price it low so all that can pay will buy it. The rest wont anyway.Maybe i got it all wrong and you are progressively making content and soon more lvls and continents and dungeons and all that and that content will be for free and for everyone and in that case i am sorry cause i got it wrong but still for the 30 euros you could add a new race for example. Anyway Right or wrong i had to take everything out of my chest.Overall it is a great game and you know what ..now that i am thinking about it i feel alot better and will go back in to the steam store and find a way to spend money in Rift . It might be the DLC or a pack or in game currency as a thank you for everything i got for free so far. Maybe we the people with money to spend can help you keep it free for the people without money.			"

												Rift at it's heart feels like a complete and informed reworking of warhammer age of reckoning. The rift system is very similar to the public quests however they spawn randomly, are elementaly based, and tie into larger invasions where swarms of monsters wander around a map and it takes raids of people to clean it up! The class system is extremly open, there being 4 classes with each one having 8 diffrent trees (similar to a single tree in wow) that you can mix and match to have 3 trees at once. Healing mages, tanking rogues/clerics, an amazingly nice looking world, mixed with some top notch content for a new game. Once you reach lvl 20 is where the real pvp and instances begin, expect a new instance every 4 levels, then once you reach max lvl progress in heroic instances and raids, or work on lvling up your pvp rank. Rift is a fresh face in the mmo market and welcomly accepts the old style of plays into it, taking heavily form warhammer and wow but doing so with style and effect.			"

												Excellent MMO as it is, but it's also free?? Yeeeeaaaa buddy! This game exceeds  much more than any other MMO i've played AND it's free.Each class has 3 skill trees that you can spec into. Not only do you earn abilities by picking talents in the tree, you also earn abilities by just putting points into the tree, abilities that are game changers.With SO many choices for each class it makes it hard for you to have a set ONE that everyone follows. Personal favorite is the assassin for the rouge class.With a support role added, it adds a whole new sense to raids and dungeons. They can switch between healing and damage with one button making them very universal for all instances.Over-all a very well made game, esspecially for being F2P.Seems rare now days for a game to be built for the gamers!

												Excellent MMO as it is, but it's also free?? Yeeeeaaaa buddy! This game exceeds  much more than any other MMO i've played AND it's free.Each class has 3 skill trees that you can spec into. Not only do you earn abilities by picking talents in the tree, you also earn abilities by just putting points into the tree, abilities that are game changers.With SO many choices for each class it makes it hard for you to have a set ONE that everyone follows. Personal favorite is the assassin for the rouge class.With a support role added, it adds a whole new sense to raids and dungeons. They can switch between healing and damage with one button making them very universal for all instances.Over-all a very well made game, esspecially for being F2P.Seems rare now days for a game to be built for the gamers!

												I'm a returning player.  Bought the game in 2011 and quickly leveled a rogue soul to 50 back then, maxed crafting to 300.  At some point, got bored and quit and went on to other games as happens in this industry.  And then it surfaced as a ""free to play"" MMO in my Steam queue.  I'm so glad that it did.  I decided to check it out and I'm hooked all over again.  Just a few bullet points for the returning players / original box set purchases on what you'll find:- All my characters were on the trial server.  Easily transferred to a ""real"" server.- If you purchased a box set back in the day, you've already unlocked some of stuff new players have to pay for.  Namely, a few extra character slots, auction house access, extra bag slots.  That was nice to find out.-  Graphics have been much improved.  I logged in once before this and thought, no way, graphics are too dated.  Well, at some point along the line, they did a major overhaul.  It looks nice.  Could still use some optimization, won't lie.  I had to bring my settings down some and my machine is not a slouch.  But neverthless, still looks good.Here's what they have added off the top of my head since I played:-  Instant Adventures:  Think instant raids that level you quickly and give you quick coin.  If you don't relish the thought of leveling all over again, this is the way to level up quickly.  It's also a way to get a ""dungeon group"" of sorts since noone really does the dungeons actually in the game anymore.  Scales to your level starting from level 10.-  Minions.  New collectibles that go out and run adventures for you and bring back loot.  Sort of a card game as well.-  Costumes.  Unlock costume items as you find them and now make your character look how you want no matter what he/she is actually wearing (I love this, won't lie).-  Diminsions - Housing essentially.  You get a personal house and your guild can purchase one.  You can purchase diminsion items to decorate and your minion can go on missions to find items as well.-  Chronicles / Planar attunement - Honestly, no idea yet since this is all stuff you do with your character post level 50 and I actually started a new character to refresh my memory on how to play this game again. :P  I have looked it up and it seems as if it's a way of customizing your character even further however.At any rate, yes, the standard ""pay"" features are in this game as any:- Pay for extra soul walks or wait for a cool down.- Pay for extra bags- Pay for additional soulsAnd so forth.  But they are not as obtrusive as other games.  And frankly, I've already purchased the $24.00 add on pack and might consider others in the future.  I like the game that much again.			"

												I gave this game a go for a few days but couldn't get into it.  Its really hard to understand class wise and each class at the time I was playing had the exact same questline, no group finder past asking in chat and the game itself seemed hardly balanced.  Voice acting is really cheesy as are the quests.  It feels like a bad version of a better MMO.			"

												When this game first came out (before it was on steam) it was an amazing and relatively innovative mmo that I really enjoyed playing. At the time it was similar to WoW in that you had to pay a monthly subscription, which kept income flowing for Trion but I guess some time after I quit playing many others must have aswell because it was then recreated into a free to play format and put on steam. basically what im saying is this game has changed alot from its inception and not for the good.

												One of the best MMORPGs hands-down.I've mainly played this outside of Steam (hence the low playtime), but the depth and level of customization that RIFT gives you for your class is incredible, and blows WoW out of the water. Sure, other things (like the dungeon experience imo) are better in WoW, but RIFT compensates with lots of really cool smaller features that add up quickly. For example, if you outlevel a dungeon/zone, but want to go back and grab the quests, you can set your 'mentored level' down, which essentially allows you to temporarily lower your character's level at will. Player housing is also present, and you can view other player's intricate designs on persistent leaderboards based on user votes.Combat is similar to other ability based RPGs, such as WoW, with the exception on the level of freedom that you get to design your own class. You can manually choose all your abilities from a set of about 10 talent trees (called 'souls') for each class, of which you can have 3 active at once. This means that almost every class can fill almost every role (DPS, tank, support, healer), and you can save your ability sets to allow you to change between roles on the fly (eg DPS → healer), giving each character a lot of versatility. Note that as this game is now free-to-play, some souls are locked behind a paywall, although at £15 if you shop around, it isn't too bad.Moving onto the game's implementation of free-to-play, you can easily complete the game (and the expansions – which are free to access) without paying anything, with all the in-game shop stuff being optional. If you do subscribe (£8.99/month last time I looked), you get the usual XP boosts etc that you would expect from a sub to a free MMO. A nice change however is the fact that the game was originally designed to b pay-to-play, so all the quests and story etc is scaled to those at 100% XP rate – subscribing just allows you to skip out parts as you see fit (and the XP boost can be toggled off). This is a nice change from other games like SWTOR, which feels like it's the subscribers that are getting the 100%, with the free players left at about 75%.Overall, it's a solid offering from Trion, which I feel is equal to, and better than is some cases, WoW.

												Buy an expansion pre free to play also get extra content from other bonus deals... get 3 ... THREE days of their ""premium"" content which INCLUDES the ability to use the auction house to sell crap. Oh boy they sure treat their paid players! (buy more to get this option)Then top it off the majority of the player base at all level ranges are diehards that adore every aspect of the game and will victim blame any new user for this stuff then put the company on a pedestal! Guess I shouldn't be shocked given the companies history. Highly recommend NOT getting this game at this point. Low content, weak player base, and a pay to win structure. With all the other F2P MMOs upcoming and currently out this doesn't offer anything worth giving it the attention.			"

												Rift is a little 'smile because virtually every element of the game was caught by some other MMORPG and proposed in a similar, if not identical, to a group of developers whose creative effort has been, well, decidedly modest. And that does not do well in a market that is now lacking in ideas. Despite everything, however, the MMORPG from Trion Worlds is a bit 'a summary of the best of the genre and if it is true that developers are cloners Kaminoans worthy of Star Wars, it is equally true that the final product came on the market in one It was almost perfect, finished, content rich and free of burrs or technical problems: a job that deserves much praise, considering the disastrous launch and the paucity of the contents that characterized some newer products. In effect, Rift nowadays is the real alternative to the two best MMORPG theme-park market, World of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings Online, and this is not a trivial matter.			"

												I loved all the great potential this game had and I gave it a big try and  put alot of time into it. But recently, Ive been feeling kind of alone while playing it and causes me to fall back on playing it that much. I suggest instead of making all those servers with mid-populations and small servers to just combine them for at least more people to talk and associate with in the game. At this point, just put all your focus into that one server and find a way to get back more players. It has ALL this potential and i could see it making it far, but no one to enjoy it with is a big problem and players like me have gave up playing or just don't play it like that anymore.			"

												I really wanted to love this game. Me and my friend bought it together. We went around questing. Killed a rift. Went to lean on a few bushes to gather something. Go kill a goblin, go kill an enemy across the map for a quest. Run across the map again to collect an item. Kill another rift. The quests were all the same, kill this guy gather this item. Now do it again across the map.We joined a guild to help us out with new content but they said there wasnt really much else to it other than maybe trying PvP.Very repetative game.After it went Free to Play I hopped back in. I wanted to give it an honest try and I gave up after 2 days of bordom.I see the appeal to the game, I feel it has a lot of potential but I do not recomment this game overall. But I do encourage people to try it out since it doesn't have a monthly sub anymore. If they love it, then all the power to them to play the hell out of it.5/10			"

												What is RIFT?  Pretty much a FTP WoW, but without some of the annoying crap.  Like playing the MMOs, but also like to do a lot of soloing?  This is for you.  I personally did not care for WoW's dungeons due to the pettiness.  Here, RIFT forces some group play via randomly (and constantly) spawning Rifts on the main board.  Join group, close Rifts, kill mega-boss, collect loot.  No gripping, whining or trolling. Then go back your soloing.For those enjoying dungeon crawls/raids and are not anti-social, the dungeons are fun and sprawling.  The final bosses have unique game mechanics and good loot drop.  The dividing is based on the roll-need-greed system.Trade-chat.  It is what it is.Is it really FTP?  Yes.  You can buy cosmetics, pets and unique rides, but most of these can also be bought for platinum.  The only thing I am disappointed about is that you need to buy into the Auction House to sell items, or buy REX off the auction house to open it up.  Really though, it's only $5 (USD), ordyou can earn the plat and buy REX, which with some creative mat gathering won't take forever.TL;DR:  Free except auction house.  solo-friendly. "

The customizeable player housing is also a major highlight. I'd recommend this to people who are looking for a free WoW / FFXIV alternative.			"

												It is with a very heavy heart that I write this review.  I first started playing Rift YEARS ago, and actually had left World of Warcraft for it because I felt it was a better game.  The world, story, soul trees (ability trees), and character customization is phenomenal and there was a great diversity on how to play/approach the game and it had lots to do.  Sadly, that game - the game I loved - is not what Rift is anymore.  It has nothing to do with the game, and everything to do with Trion and their team.  I have nothing good to say about them.They ignore their fanbase, the are rude and will shut down anyone who even remotely criticizes them, they refuse to provide answers to their community, and I'm pretty sure they're drunk at work (literally - they're almost always drunk/drinking on their livestreams).  They are very unprofessional and frankly, they make decisions that leave all but their paid fanboys scratching their heads going ""wtf?!""Also, I have to say Rift needs to be removed from this and all ""F2P"" lists. Beyond how denigrating Trion has become to its customer base:1. Almost everything can be bought with cash. Raid gear? Yup. Instant-Level boosts? Yup. Costumes? Yup. Etc, Etc.2. Not all content is ""free"" but because you can grind in-game money to buy credits (or via sellers) to buy the content they consider it ""free-to-play"". Of course then they implement policy changes to make earning in game money harder and nerf in-game revenue streams if they get ""too unbalanced"" (their wording, not the players).3. They have literally taken dyes, gear, etc that people have earned in game, or bought with cash away and will remake the same thing with a different name and lock it behind credits/real cash.4. They constantly nerf quest, daily, kill, etc XP to try to keep people from reaching max level easy (because too many high level alts allows people to grind things easier instead of buying it from their store).5. The newest, and all future, expansions must be bought with cash or you can grind in game cash (which they continually nerf) and hope to find a legitimate seller who isn't going to rip you off.6. Many of their ""world events"" now have aspects locked away behind credits.7. They constantly add craftable/sellable things such as dyes and wardrobes to their store with enhancements making the actual craftable ones crap - i.e. killing in game revenue. One of their last changes made Apothecary almost useless as a revenue stream, etc.Sure, Rift is ""technically"" free, but for all intents and purposes they try to back players into a corner forcing them to spend cash on them which is pragmatically, to most, not ""free-to-play"".In addition, the community resources suck, there are still glitches from YEARS ago, this last expansion which was delayed for months and then ""released"" last November is STILL unfinished, etc.			"

												Rift was somewhat decent in the nightmare tide expansion ( aka lvl 65 cap ), best talent trees ive seen gives nice classes. awesome pve, pvp is♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4.0-> expansions made this game♥♥♥♥♥♥ now u even have to pay for content if u are not a ♥♥♥♥ing half human - half grinding machine. Sry the developers ruined it. Also many players left over time cuz they got tired to pay for more and more vital content. Ive read somewhere on forums that online on EU servers is around 130, aswell as sometimes as low as 60. RIP Rift.			"

												  Great game overall, the community is well behaved, and Trion are some great guys. With the return of Hartsman, I'm sure this game has a bright future ahead. That said, It's been awhile since I've played. I played back at the release of the game and cleared through majority of the content at release in around 100 hours.  If you're looking to go far in this game, like most MMOs you will need a guild to get you through to the end. I'd definitely reccomend something organized, with a website, raid times, DKP, etc. There are a FEW people in the game that will try and spoil things for everyone with trying to ninja loot, or screw up quest lines. Though like most games, the rating changes based on the online play - I would never rate a game based on the community, but rather the support of the game by the developers and the amount of content available. Since I've played they've added a lot to the game. If you're looking for an MMO to spend an ample amount of time on, check this game out! :)			"

												I picked up this game when it first came out and quit about 3 months after (stupid friends stopped playing grrr). I have recently come back to this game to find it is still enjoyable to play. Much of the game is as I remember it which is not bad by any means. I restarted leveling from lv 1 again because friends joined me. The game is easy to pick up and has a bunch of things you can do right out of the gate. There have been some changes since the last time I have played and I think they are nice additions to the game. Ill be here honest when I first saw that I had a house I was kind of meh over it. 2 hours of organizing my house went by and I remember why I shouldn’t play games that let me collect things. It was surprisingly fun to play with the housing and I wonder why wow still doesn’t have something like this. The new rifts and zone events are very cool. I have not yet made it to the 50+ content but so far I’m enjoying being back in the game and look forward to playing more.			"

												Brothers, as a veteran of World of Warcraft, as a person who tasted WoW during its first years, should say that this game is not bad. Sure, it isn't even half of what original WoW used to be. Even the world feels artificial. But on the other hand, if you want MMORPG that's free to play and in general fine way to have fun while wasting time, then that's the game for you. You have professions, some spells, some general idea about rift-fighting, so it's definitely worth trying out. I just don't seem to like the atmosphere(music, terrain, nature) in the game, something that original WoW had.			"

												From launch through the first year of free-to-play, the game was a joy: beautiful scenery, well-executed dynamic content, and lots to do from pvp to dungeons to fun open world to chasing artifacts.In the last year, however, it has steadily gone down hill as the publisher has squeezed the screws to harvest more money from the players and the somewhat old engine has become decidedly creaky with poor frame rate, frequent crashes, and very annoying visual bugs. The latter is probably also money related since it appears they have cut developer staff to the bone and they can't afford or choose not to invest further in the core engine.It is free to play, so you can get a taste of it at little risk but not likely to be a long term game for anyone these days.

The best thing about it is that its more or less a WoW clone that doesn't try any ridiculous stuff like a lot of MMOs out there. It sticks to the tried and true formula and that's what I like about it. Notice how the top ""negative"" review is a kid with 230 hours played. He loved the game. He's just butthurt that after 300 hours the devs would like him to spend at least $10 on it.			"

												Listen to me very carefully before you think all im going to do is praise this game just because i give it a thumb up. This game has a lot of faults, yet at the same time it does a lot of things correctly as well. Not specific enough? Well lets get specific. The good things? It is fun, the grind isn't bad at all - you can literally get to level 50 in 1-2 weeks without even noticing it - and still get good gear provided you know what you're doing. (If you pvp, do warfronts, and you'll get plenty of pvp gear.) PVP is very accessible - it doesn't require you get the best gear on the right away. PvE is very fun as well, and is diverse provided you're progressing at a good rate.Now comes the bad stuff. For me this game got old really fast at level 49. I didnt bother to do quests because, well, i was already outleveling them because i was pvping. (Although you could de-level by mentoring and do them to get a 'challenge.')  Additionally, this game is not rewarding. The loot is terrible most of the time - and if you're pvping you'll never ever use it simply because you'll probably have enough 'favor' (ingame currency) to buy better rift store gear, and as another addition, the auction house is locked down until you've managed to either shell out five bucks, or get a rift-exchange in order to get 1500 credits.Now the AH and pvp doesnt make the game. There's a lot i didn't see, and a lot i didn't get to do. Among more pros, the classes are diverse, and you can play more than one role, making switching 'easy-as-pie' if you want to try something else. But for me, the game got repetetive, and in the end, despite the innovations, still reeked of the deriviative mmo-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t most mmo games tend to smell of nowadays anyway. Not much new. However, still gets a 'recommended' simply because its enjoyable.To sum it up.PROSGood and diverse classes. Easy to play multiple roles.Diverse PvE content.PvP can be fun, and is easy to get into.Something i did not mention - Professions are enjoyable.The grind is barely noticable. (Until 50-60)CONSLoot is a joke, and the rift store reflects on this, making this game absolutely unsatsifying in some instances.Gets repeteive.AH is locked for selling (You can still buy.) down unless you shell out 5 bucks, or save a bunch of ingame currency to buy a rift exchange. (rex)Overall, good mmo, but has its fallbacks.			"

												Way to grindy. Not even to a point where its fun and you feel you accomplished something as you proceed, but it literally wastes your time and you get just about nothing in the end. Once I had to fish for an hour straight just to get a rare type of shark and IT WAS SO FRICKING BORING, and what did I get in the end, 10 xp. The graphics arent even appealing even on max. Plus this game used to have so many active players when I played it on my old steam acc in which i had around 100 plus hours in this game. Now you hardly find any good players to raid camps with... or to search for valuable mounts. Now you cant even take 10 steps withiut being hoarded by hundred of enemies who waste your time and dont reward you with anything. Honestly this game isnt what it used to be and I wont recommend it to anyone. It gets very boring very quickly.			"

												Horribly overpriced for what you get. ALOT of grind for tokens, reputations and such before you even can get into the core of the game. Without paying for that grind you basically have to be unemployed to have the time. Gets small constant update but it's all cosmetics usually like new mounts that you have to play up to 20$ for (and some are just remakes with new colors). New raid gets released a few times a year but all it does is make your gear obsolete so you have to start over from zero again. Community is your standard toxic and elitism, although you can find a new player friend guild and enoy it at your own pace. On the good side I think the core of the game is quite good, I love the classic skill system where you can customize your characther tot the max, eventho there will always be a ""best meta"". The class variation is also good and each class has a different feel for it (Melee, Ranged, Magic, Healer or Tank). The PvE is quite good and if you've played WoW you'll find yourself almost as home. I'd play this game 100% of my spare time if I didnt have to spend almost 100$ / month to stay competetive (this is after the monthly patron payment). In it's current state I'd advice you to stay away until they lower prices, alot, and even remove some of the pay walls.			"

												Having logged 700+ hours on my old account, I installed it on this one simply to write this review. And I can safely say this is the best F2P MMORPG you will ever play.Pros:1) Even though the combat is tab target, it manages to retain aq dynamic feel. All your skills work together in some way so finding the perfect rotation is always interesting. Combat is also incredibly smooth and is really quite enjoyable.2) The Soul Tree system is perfect and will find a way to fit your play style effortlessly. You can even have custom classes unheard of in most any other game. A mage that doubles as a tank? If you want. A warrior with group healing? Go for it. A cleric with insane DpS? Hell yeah!3) PvP is AMAZING. I really can't expand on this any more. Try it for yourself. There is very rarely two players using the same build as there are so many possibilities. Endless fun :D4) The game has a solid storyline that really engages the players. You feel compelled to continue with the main quest line, although that shouldn't deter you from doing as many side quests as you wish. Quests have decent rewards, such as new equipment and a massive pile of cash. 5) Leveling up isn't a huge grind. Granted, there is some grinding to get new equipment or to get PvP gear. But unlike most, it isn't the same quest in the same area over and over again. The quests can be in different areas, and different objectives. Cons:1) Dungeons and monsters can get fairly tricky unless you keep on top of your equipment or have some fairly powerful friends. Join a guild for a group of regular party members.2) You need a hell of a computer to run this game on anything over medium graphics. I currently have an Intel i5, 8 GB of RAM and a Nvidia 640 GT and I can only run it on high at 50-60 FPS. For max you will really need good components. 3) If you don't pay for subscription, it doesn't affect anything a huge amount but you have a few restrictions that are kinda irritating.i) You can't buy or sell at the auction house. ii) Pretty small bag space. Probably most annoying.iii) It will take a LOT of grinding, however, to get a mount.Overall, a very fun, addictive, and engaging game. Definitly one you should get. It's polished and feels like a paid game. The highest praise a free game could have.			"

												I'm not a big MMO player. I just never grew up with them. I've been looking for a while for a MMO that a newbie like me can get in to. Rift is that game. It's fun, accessable, challenging, and you can be nearly anything you want in it. Not only that, but you can change your style whenever you want. It's a very addicting game because you always want to see what's next in this massive world. If you are new to the wide world of Massive Multiplayer Online Games, or a veteren, look to Rift for your next adventure.			"

												Having never played World of Warcraft makes comparing MMO's such as RIFT very difficult to do. As it stands, RIFT delivers an exceptionally well crafted world that's as diverse as it is gorgeous. Lore plays a huge part within RIFT's story, and content is implemented in such a way as to reduce an incessant grinding of monsters to close level gaps, content gaps, and so forth. Expansions are forthcoming and add a fair amount of content at each pass, shoring up the longevity of the title.RIFT's biggest claim to fame currently is the players ability to have near complete control in class building, skill building, and content pathing. Any variety of class is up for grabs, and is subject to change if the player wishes it. The ability to switch between roles and create role-reversal classes is top knotch, and open to imagination. There is absolutely a huge array of variety to be had. The combat system in RIFT is nothing spectacular, but more of the same - such is the case with most products of this type. The PvE content is a blast and is (in my humble opinion), what RIFT is really all about. PvP has its place, but unfortunately in its current state suffers from the ""free to play"" mentality. Trion, in its infinite ""wisom"", has decided to block defined access to most events, and now require Patron status to proactively pick and choose an arena, raid, or dungeon of the users choice. RIFT will undoubtedly continue to develop two flaws for every boon, as its age begins to show. Now, along with Patron changes to the system, RIFT has been charging steadily for certain beneficial upgrades such as extra skill sets, class sets, and availability of equipable traits (such as foraging, mining, etc). While RIFT still maintains its ""free to play"" philosophy, it has also been funneling players into purchasing certain upgrades such as a mounts ability to traverse bodies of water, extra item slots, and generally items and allowances one would imagine to be free or, kindly, earned ingame. Now, generally speaking... these extra touches that cost a bit of money aren't of negative connotation, but if every progressive benefit costs an arm and a leg...In the end, RIFT will continue to be an enjoyable experience tinged ever so slightly with the negativity of a free to play state, and is perhaps only worthwhile to those with ample change in their pockets (ironically), or as extremely casual players. RIFT is at present an entertaining title with slowly developing flaws, comprised of quality content, albiet a flawed ideology.			"

Simple enough.-Sweet, I have a horse! Now I can go ever so slightly faster than normal.-Whoa, those bosses are tough, good thing we can join groups.-What... wtf is that? Wtf IS that?! It's so... shiny. It's an artifact? ...It's beautiful! I have ot find more of these!-Artifacts, artifacts, artifacts, artifacts, artifa- SHINY!!! MINE, MINE, MI- Crap! Fell off the cliff...

												At first, I loved RIFT. The open world, the collectibles and unlockables, the innumberable quests- Plenty to discover and do without ever getting bored, and as a Free-To-Play, no pesky subscription to shell out every month. Unfortunately, in an effort to monetize the game without making it Pay-To-Win, they developed equally innumberable special events for players to complete, to earn prizes- usually in the form of vanity mounts. Who doesn't love those, right? Gotta catch 'em all!The problem: Each event has its own special currency, through which players progressively earn their prize mounts. And. There. Are. No. End. To. These. One is bombarded on a seemingly daily basis with in-game notifications about ""Last Chance!"" this and ""Don't Miss Out!"" that. The stacks of currency actually built up in my inventory, to the point that I was having trouble making room for quest items, let alone all of the crafting materials needed for my three professions. (Seem like a lot to keep track of? It is.) The myriad events and currencies and quests and storylines all start to get so overwhelming that I eventually gave up. It was fun while it lasted, and many players will find this easy to overlook, but I needed a break from the barrage.			"

												Well, I honestly forgot to write a review for a long time because I was having too much fun with the game. It's a pretty good MMO and the story reminds me of an atheist vs theist world. Atheists had the power of science and theists were told by Gods to destroy this blasphemous technology. This severely weakens the fire power the people had, allowing for an evil force who resembles Satan named Regulos to nearly consume all of Telara. So atheists basically travel back in time 20 years to a Telara where the beginning of Rifts (It's like the Oblivion Gates) start appearing. As for guardians side, you're a theist that works under the Gods and dies defeating Regulos's shade. The Gods notice your power and ressurect you 20 years into the future where Regulos and the Rift holes start appearing because of your power. This is all given to you during the tutorial, which is not the main game and world of telara. Even after the tutorial, there is quite a steep learning curve and the game will continue to provide new hints, you can turn them off if you want, but I don't recommend it until you read them all at least once.Naturally, if you're in a PvP server, there is more heat between the guardians and defiants. There will be moments where you'll be thinking, ""Will that guy attack me or not?"" And you're waiting for them to respond and see that they think the same thing as well. Definitely adds more tension into the game. PvE enviroment is a lot more casual, so the game works well for both casual and hardcore players of the MMO genre.You also get to have your own dimension, which acts like a house and can be decorated. Adds a little bit more to the roleplay if that is your thing.			"

												Rift carries a D&D style with not so nicely aesthetic characters, tending to more realistic and practical designs, also bringing a few of the usual races of the popular TTRPG system with your classic ""lots of races that are pretty much human"" like elves, dwarves, humans and similar variations. Even though that's not it's best point (if you don't like it that is), the game truly shines on what really matters for a MMORPG: Gameplay, Customization and Lore.Gameplay-wise Rift doesn't rise above most of the titles of the genre, having at least a proper responsive point-and-click combat that feels just right. It is in Customization that this game sells it's name, mostly in Class customization, since it allows your character to freely choose 3 from 8 or 9 (maybe more) talent trees that will both decide skills and passive abilities of your character. Reseting such skills is free of real money charge, so switching builds freely will be pretty much your joy in this game, and something you will wish to have in any title you come across after playing Rift. Character-looks-customization-wise, the game simply offers an equipment look tab that allows you to equip anything you have on it, disabling the equipment stats but prioritizing its looks over the equipment in the normal tab. Simple, practical, effective: Awesome.Lore-wise this game shines probably just like WoW or D&D, it's deep with all kinds of stories in loading screens, NPCs, quests, books to read through the game that can be collected, collectables with stories that become prizes and other things, the game is huge and clearly RP friendly.If I recommend this game? This is a seriously well built MMORPG, for both a game and for a MMORPG. If you like the genre and don't necessarily want inovation but something just well done, get in just now, it's also free!			"

Sure, this is a free to play game but c'mon...If you ever played WoW and you are looking for good MMORPG game that can offer something cool - you will need to look around a little more, since RIFT isn't a good game. There is nothing new, we had everything this game can offer in many other titles.			"

												Fantastic game but you will need the expansion which is about £20 or you will not see the later levels. (Many areas are underwater, you'll drown without the expansion.) When you do see the later levels it's wonderful... *UNTIL* you hit max level, then there is a huge gap in gear, with no in game solution, that will prevent you from progressing... unless you spend at least £20 on some store gear. These are not huge sums and perhaps this is not a huge issue, but it feels disingenuous for a 'free to play' game that constantly promotes it's products in game. Overall, after many hours of fun, you start to feel that the developers have a hand on your wallet just waiting on your word to remove cash. Despite this I still recommend it, as there's plenty of fun to be had here.			"

												Rift,This game is possibly one of the best MMO's i've played, the game has great graphics, runs smoothly, easy controls and great machanics.The game is free to play, which evidently means that there are some pay to win aspects to the game but nothing major that can ruin the gameplay.Unfortuently the game isn't as popular and only has a small playerbase but the community is great and friendly! I really like the sense of fellowship with Guilds, although the censorship of certain words like♥♥♥♥♥♥ have recieved me being kicked from my pretty elite guild, ♥♥♥♥ you too! btw.Due to the small playerbase, expecting to get into a PvP arena is very rare, as well as raids.The game has amazing seasonal events, and it really brings the playerbase up and allows for new and fun challenging quests to arise that seperate it from the other quests.TL:DR; What have you got to lose? It's FTP.			"

												It's WoW without the subscription. Some content is locked and waiting for your credit card details but the devs gotta make money so don't them for it. The locked content won't subtract from the gameplay, i dare say it actually gives you a bit of a challenge. (except your backpack size, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is crazy small.) It doesn't do the best job of showing you your objective but an hour in and you'll get use to it.Combat is fun and simple, there are world events that help with the XP grind. There is also some form of shared looting so you won't have to que at bosses waiting for your turn to get item #1556841. Don't expect to have an intense story unless your into reading, instead grab a friend and make up your own. It's more fun that way.Bottom line: It's a free to play MMO, what more can I say about it. Download it, play for a couple of hours, if you don't like it then you uninstall it. If you do like it, throw some money at it, grab some DLCs and get back into the fight.			"

A robust character system (not as robust as ArcheAge, but that's totally pay to win) and good crafting system. rift events (mini raids, if you will) are open to everyone in the area and don't require you to queue or to find a group. Just roll in and be rewarded based on your contribution.It's very much like the now dead Warhammer Online in quality and play but, unlike WHO, has the player base to keep it alive and prospering for now.It's no WoW killer, but its pretty damn good.

Then if did not like the game by that point i would stop playing it but at level 10 the game started to grow on me and by level 15 i loved the game. what really got me interested is the PVP(WarFronts mostly).

												The game starts out a little slow but once you hit level 10 it gets really interesting. It has a great storyline and the RIFTS are really fun along with all the other events that happen while you play. Customization of your character is outstanding, you can build it however you want or follow a preset build path which is helpful for new players. There are plenty of things to collect in the game for rewards like pets which is what I really enjoy in mmorpgs. Dungeons are long and bosses are fun as hell. I also really appreciate how the game can run in low render for terrible laptops like mine, I can play the game just fine and even on low settings it's quite beautiful. ;3			"

												Well I don't know where to start... This game is Amazing. Very good graphics, the combat mechanic is great. Rift is the best MMO I have played ever! You are taken to the world of Telera in hopes to start the ultimate evil- Regulos and the dragons. The characters are immersive-because of the character creation setup. There are 4 classes Warrior Rogue Mage and Cleric. When I saw this though, I thought aww thats not enough. But what I didn't know was that there are these subclasses called Souls that can further increase and specify the gameplay that you want. I have played for about 2 days and I am already level 23. Overall this game is AMAZING! And I don't say that about a lot of games.			"

												This is your typical MMORPG, but my favorite thing about it is the rifts.  Monsters from another plane rip into the world and it happens often and all over.  It's easy to find where they are on the world map so you could just hop from rift to rift if you'd like.  When you are at a rift you get the option to ""Join Public Group"" which puts you in a raid group with the other people there while you take down the rift.  Invasions are the most fun.  I've done a lot of leveling this way instead of questing and you don't have to worry about gear because the rifts drop loot, including a currency which you can use to buy gear upgrades.			"

												I spent a lot of time playing WoW and I paid a lot of money to have a toon run around in their substandard world.  I won't say that Rift breaks the mold completely; it is still a toon based grindfest.  But, it is completely free to play and it offers a few things that WoW never did.  Rift has a lot of angles that appeal to the different tastes of different players.  If you want to craft, you can, if you want to quest, you can, dungeons, PvP, instant quests, artifacts... there is a lot to this game.The tl;dr takeaway is that it is free and you'll find it is a pretty good investment of your time.

												I have a pet bunny in this game, Martha, and I have an item (S'mores) that makes me look like a bunny. So on my hotbar I have this macro that casts all my various buffs and armors that I'll hit every so often to make sure they're refreshed and active at all times. First command in the macro - use S'mores. Every time the effect of my S'mores is about to run out I just hit the key for my macro, happens to be 2, and the effect is refreshed. I am a bunny FOREVER. Infinibunny. So I go fight mobs and stuff, blah blah blah, and it's funny because people will actually stop and look and act confused because here's this bunny being followed by another bunny and it's hurling fireballs at people (I'm a Pyromancer/Elementalist thingy and yes, you can use all your abilities WHILE BEING A BUNNY). My character's name is even Bunnychu (it had been just ""Bunny"" but I had to change it when I transferred servers, sad :/) so I think this adds to the effect. The whole thing is marvelous.My human form is cool too because I have purple pigtail braids and I dye all my clothes purple (I'm very particular about my outfits and which clothing I want to be shown wearing) so I look pretty cute but who doesn't want to be an INFINIBUNNY that THROWS FIREBALLS and CONFUSES PEOPLE?This game is fantastic.

												This game is AWESOME. It's just like WoW, except the classing and skill trees are much more in depth. The way it works are that there are 4 classes, and each class has 5 sub set classes(4 without dlc), effectively making 20 classes(16 without dlc). Then the skill trees(soul trees). You can click on the base of any one of the three soul trees and swap it with like, another 5 possibilities, effectively making 8 skill trees available to your class, and endless combinations of 3. One issue I have so far is that I appear not to be able to sell anything to vendors that isn't gray. This is rather annoying and doesn't make sense. I could understand if it was soulbound, but they aren't. There needs to be a sell section.			"

												If you are looking for a solid free-to-play MMORPG, then you need look no further, because RIFT is an amazing game. While some might argue that the combat is more old-school or maybe slower paced than other MMOs (see Neverwinter or DC Universe Online) its method of combat is tried and true (see WoW). And if you can get a group of friends or guildmates together for its many raids, dungeons, random events, and quests it gets even better, however soloing is in many instances a viable option as well.In regards to the game being free-to-play I did not find any pay walls that hindered my ability to continue making progress in-game. Granted you can buy better equipment with real money, but the only time I feel like this would be very necessary is if you were going to do PvP (which the game offers as well). After 20 hours of playing time I did invest 5 dollars towards getting a mount for my character, and was able to get many other things beneficial to my playtime in that investment (equipment, inventory slots, etc.) in regards to F2P probably the most efficient 5 bucks I've ever spent.Overall I have found the game to be incredibly enjoyable, and if you are looking for a decent MMORPG to get into, I suggest that at the very least you give this one a shot.

												If you miss WoW but don't have the time to dedicate to a subscription based game this is a great alternative. The quests are your standard kill these or collect this. However, Rift features many other things to do practically right from the start.Closing rifts - Randomly spawning rifts that have several waves of mobs that must be defeated, each a little stronger. Best done with a group but can be soloed. Some good xp and loot from doing these.Instant Adventures (starting at level 10 I believe) - Go into an instant adventure and get put into a group all working towards completing the different quests culminating in a big boss that is best done with a raid. Great for taking a break from quest grinding and earning some good xp, in-game money, and loot.I have not tried PVP yet but I have heard it is good.The part I appreciated the most is that as soon as you have the coin you can buy a mount. Big relief not to have to run everywhere.The professions are your standard gather/crafting and need to be leveled and new recipes purchased.This is a free to play game and quite honestly one can play and not have to pay anything. However, until a real money purchase is made the Auction House is locked to sales and the amount of coin held on a character is capped. I believe a small purchase of only $5 will unlock these but since I have yet to purchase anything I'm not sure. This is not a pay to win type of game. You can get boosts, open up bag and character slots, purchase vanity items and mounts but nothing looks like it will give you an edge over free players.			"

												Although it is fairly similar to other MMO's, there are some aspects in RIFT that I have yet to see and make it a bit more fun than the rest. It wasn't too hard to get to their max level (currently 60) and start grinding towards the top tier gear. Although, starting as a tank as the first character made it some-what difficult as there is no specific tank gear until the 50-60 range and even then not much until level 60. It made tanking somewhat difficult and (not sure if my fault) I just about wiped nearly EVERY dungeon (just a 5 man dungeon.. not even a raid) even though I did the tank role correctly(kept all aggro, pull adds from heals/dps, etc). You certainly don't feel like a tank until level 60 - or atleast that's how I felt. Other than the slightly slow start as a tank the game was still able to grab my attention and hold it - A feat not many games can do.			"

												I have a pet bunny in this game, Martha, and I have an item (S'mores) that makes me look like a bunny. So on my hotbar I have this macro that casts all my various buffs and armors that I'll hit every so often to make sure they're refreshed and active at all times. First command in the macro - use S'mores. Every time the effect of my S'mores is about to run out I just hit the key for my macro, happens to be 2, and the effect is refreshed. I am a bunny FOREVER. Infinibunny. So I go fight mobs and stuff, blah blah blah, and it's funny because people will actually stop and look and act confused because here's this bunny being followed by another bunny and it's hurling fireballs at people (I'm a Pyromancer/Elementalist thingy and yes, you can use all your abilities WHILE BEING A BUNNY). My character's name is even Bunnychu (it had been just ""Bunny"" but I had to change it when I transferred servers, sad :/) so I think this adds to the effect. The whole thing is marvelous.My human form is cool too because I have purple pigtail braids and I dye all my clothes purple (I'm very particular about my outfits and which clothing I want to be shown wearing) so I look pretty cute but who doesn't want to be an INFINIBUNNY that THROWS FIREBALLS and CONFUSES PEOPLE?This game is fantastic.

												This game is AWESOME. It's just like WoW, except the classing and skill trees are much more in depth. The way it works are that there are 4 classes, and each class has 5 sub set classes(4 without dlc), effectively making 20 classes(16 without dlc). Then the skill trees(soul trees). You can click on the base of any one of the three soul trees and swap it with like, another 5 possibilities, effectively making 8 skill trees available to your class, and endless combinations of 3. One issue I have so far is that I appear not to be able to sell anything to vendors that isn't gray. This is rather annoying and doesn't make sense.

Nice little secrets tucked away in hard to get spots. Generally I just  PVP'd till 60 (max level) and dominated but at 60 they have a pvp grind like no other to get the best gear.

												Gameplay-  While it dosen't re-invent the genre, RIFT's tried and tested formula holds up amongst the ocean of MMO's out there. What you get that is different, is a streamlined, polished experience thoughout all its offerings, with extensive options in general PvE and leveling (with a fanstastic instant adventure feature), Standard MMO fare pvp, and enjoyable crafting and Hobbies ( RIFT has a suprisingly addictive fishing aspect to it)9/10UI's/Menus - RIFT has a sleek UI, But once again dosen't break the mould. Standard MMO fare here.8/10Content - There's plenty to see and do on your way to the level cap, with the Storm Legion expansion adding twice the content of the original game, just for journey from level 50 to 60. You also have an absurd amount of collectables to obtain on your journey, with a lot of artifacts that you simply find in your travels worth a fortune on the AH. When wanting a break from leveling you have PvP, Closing the games signature RIFT's,  Crafting , Artifact Hunting, Achivement hunting and Exploring, and maybe RIFT's best feature, the incredible Dimensions (RIFT's Housing). Dimensions add this amazing element not generally seen in mmo's since SWG. I could write for pages, jump in and experience them for yourself, and the amazing community built dimensions with waterslides, puzzles and bars!.10/10Subscribe or F2P?Personally, This game is beyond worth the subscription. The developers deserve the sub fee, and the Benifits you get from it are worth it. You get the equivelant of 8 hours a day of 200% XP, Currency , and Noriety Gain (if you want) as well as a daily and weekly Gift, which often include hard to gain Artifacts, Potions, and vaulable Currency.On the F2P side the game does feature a robust in game money shop, with decent prices for unlocks. I've never been a massive F2Player and I honestly dont understand why people complain when they don't wanna pay a sub fee but expect the whole game free.If your a fan of Fantasy MMO's , or looking to get started, RIFT is a fantastic choice. The game has a great community and if you get into a great guild your set.Final Score 10/10			"

												Rift is like most MMO's coming out today, a Clone of a Clone, of a clone. It is a hotkey mmo, with grouping elements in it, as well as a ""Rift"" system.  The pvp is bland, and the tri-class make up system makes up for it's overall lack of orgianality.  While i would say avoid this MMO if you're a WoW player, it is simply worth checking out if you have friends to play with or...one of the many times it comes on sale for 5 bucks.			"

												For a free to play MMO, you're simply not going to do better than this. All of it is free with the exception of the new souls added with Storm Legion, so a total of 20 bucks if you want some extra classes to play with essentially. All the actual content that you DO in the game is free. On top of this, most things purchased with real money through the credits system are sold by people in game for the in-game currency if you simply ask. 10/10 considering the price.			"

												I started playing Rift when it was pay-to-play and leveled up quickly. Too quickly, which killed it for me as I was able to try different builds with very little effort. I decided to pursue other games on the market till the free-to-play came on the market, and I came back to give the game another shot. Leveling is still easy, and classes are either pro or gimp, but I still find it amusing to play. Ultimately my favorite aspect of the game is the PvE, and the idea of the rifts bringing people together to play as a team. Really love that community aspect of the game, as it aids in higher level PvP. If you want a free game that you can sink 300+ hours into without feeling drained, make a few friends, and kill a few baddies, then Rift is the game for you!			"

												This game is Riftastic.Gamplay: 8.5 of 10Graphics: 8.5 of 10Sound/Atmosphere:  9 of 10Community: 7 of 10End Game/Replay Value: 9 of 10Don't let my play time fool you, I have 3 characters lvl 60 and 1 with top gear (I just reinstalled my game on steam).I don't know what made me play Rift at first.Warhammer Online was dying and I found myselt not having as much time for MMORPGs. I tried SWTOR my first F2P, it was okay but the end game didn't grab me.So as a last attempt I switched over to RIFT. Tired of leveling up and going through the questing stuff I mainly stuck to the pvp.After a day or so of learning the soul system I realized that you can customize your character in an incredible amout of ways! You get four starting classes: Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Mage. but you can customize them anyway you want, for example: tired of healing on your cleric and want to be a Tank instead? Just once flick of a button and all your skills (plus quickbars) change to reflect your role change.Really refreshing, I use the role change constantly and I see others do so as well.The game is kinda your standard MMORPG with quests and leveling, the story is pretty cool as well as the dungeons and bosses. They are hard, but not too hard.Lots of floating rocks and invading monsters to kill.Twoards the end of the game you join conquest, a massive free for all capture the node type game. The more you play it the more perks you earn, yet if you stop playing you will lose those perks as they degrade overtime.I play on the PVP server and it is active, people tell me that the other servers are doing good as well.The servers allow for cross queuing, which cuts down drastically on wait times for dungeons and pvp warfronts.The games difficulty revolves around mastering the soul system, you get 3 souls to chose from and a limited amount of abilities from each soul. Finding the right combination can be the difference of being OP and average.My advice: Don't just listen to people in-game/forums, test out your own abilities and do your own trial and error.For instance, people told me not to make a rouge/ranger as they are ""useless"" well that just motivated me to make one even more.Granted my ranger isn't powerful one on one, but in a group or duing a Warfront I can easily get top dps and I notice the support my character brings.Cons:After playing Warhammer Online I was spoiled with a good tank class that mattered (in pvp and pve). Since then no other game can seem to get it right.Which mean's RIFT is basically a game of DPS and Healer (maybe support if you know how to do it properly).This makes the game a tad bit bland but never boring.Over Powered (OP) Classes - (happens in every game) but be prepared to see an over abunence of Mage:Pyro, Warrior:Tempest, Rogue:Assassin.F2P - I understand Trion has to make money somehow but they do charge you for extra bag space. Granted I never needed it but if you want to craft or do something which requires lot of bag/vault space be prepared to fork over money.It's not pay to win (P2W), you don't need to pay to be the best in the game. Paying just really helps you get more powerful in a shorter amount of time. Like for a redicilous amount of money you could buy all the top tier armors/weapons but can also earn those items the normal way by grinding.All in all it's a very good game, they update often and I'm glad I found it.Overall Rift gets a 8 out of 10 Talzor/Lafixer PvP server lvl 60 Cleric/Rogue			"

												Rift is like most MMO's coming out today, a Clone of a Clone, of a clone. It is a hotkey mmo, with grouping elements in it, as well as a ""Rift"" system.  The pvp is bland, and the tri-class make up system makes up for it's overall lack of orgianality.  While i would say avoid this MMO if you're a WoW player, it is simply worth checking out if you have friends to play with or...one of the many times it comes on sale for 5 bucks.			"

												This is your typical MMORPG, but my favorite thing about it is the rifts.  Monsters from another plane rip into the world and it happens often and all over.  It's easy to find where they are on the world map so you could just hop from rift to rift if you'd like.  When you are at a rift you get the option to ""Join Public Group"" which puts you in a raid group with the other people there while you take down the rift.  Invasions are the most fun.  I've done a lot of leveling this way instead of questing and you don't have to worry about gear because the rifts drop loot, including a currency which you can use to buy gear upgrades.			"

All of it is free with the exception of the new souls added with Storm Legion, so a total of 20 bucks if you want some extra classes to play with essentially. All the actual content that you DO in the game is free. On top of this, most things purchased with real money through the credits system are sold by people in game for the in-game currency if you simply ask. 10/10 considering the price.			"

												I started playing Rift when it was pay-to-play and leveled up quickly. Too quickly, which killed it for me as I was able to try different builds with very little effort. I decided to pursue other games on the market till the free-to-play came on the market, and I came back to give the game another shot. Leveling is still easy, and classes are either pro or gimp, but I still find it amusing to play. Ultimately my favorite aspect of the game is the PvE, and the idea of the rifts bringing people together to play as a team. Really love that community aspect of the game, as it aids in higher level PvP. If you want a free game that you can sink 300+ hours into without feeling drained, make a few friends, and kill a few baddies, then Rift is the game for you!			"

												Updated 08/2016I first reviewed this game in October 2014. I'm back in 2016 and it has sucked me in again this year for many hours. Rift was a $70M mmo development project, making it still one of the ones mention on the bestmmorpg website. Its Instant Adventure option and mentoring are still some of the most supportive play options ever: helpful leveling and instant access to whomever is running. There is so much complaining lately that Rift is P2W, or Pay 2 Win. I can't really argue with that and the game is brilliant at it. I have definitely hit my credit card hard a few times while playing, but if one is careful (look for the original ultimate edition to get some from free mounts and those all important bag slots), and the expansions are worth the cash if you're putting in hundreds of hours. So many folks just click P2W dis-recommend and are done. But, in truth, if one spends $60 on a front running MMO, gets as many hours out of it as GW2 or TESO, hasn't the time and money invested about worked out? Rift does so very much well: player housing, sidekicking, the full range of cosmetics. The graphics are a little dated now -- we must concede that. But, there's so much to see and the world is huge.It has been a long time since I've burned my time in an MMO. I'm a player of some of the classics: Dark Age of Camelot (remember that one?), a year or so of World of Warcraft, another year of EQ2, and several years of LOTRO. Finally, I couldn't resist the bug anymore and decided to check out Rift since it was F2P. I was not disappointed. The game pushed the art of game designs beyond what I had experienced in some very rewarding ways:1. Design your own player classes. Yes, you have to choose the overall categories of Warrior, Rogue, Cleric or Mage, but out of the 8 skill trees available for each one, you can pick whichever 3 you wish. For very small prices, you can also assign different ""roles"" to your character, meaning that you can have one build set up for solo, another for PvP, and yet another for Raids. Very special! I am an inveterate tinkerer. I love tinkering with Rift class design.2. Free form player homes. In Rift, player homes are called dimensions. Players may have access to many dimesions of their own, and each is a separate instance. Yes, you can invite your friends, and there is one for your guild. But, the degree of customization and construction you can do in each would make a Minecraft afficionado proud. Gone are the hard limits and creativity-stifling ""hooks"" of LOTRO. Now you put your items where you want them, the size, the angle, the stacking of item on item for actual built objects, etc. What a new world! I got to see in a video where one female player had taken one of the smallest dimensions available and built multiple dwellings in it, including a theme house for the three bears. Amazing! and lovely! BTW, some of the plants and trees can blow in the wind. Wonderful.3. Instant Adventures and Rifts: Some of the special things Rifts will offer you is, on 10th level, your character can run off and Instant Adventure. These are happenings that form instant PUGs where basically everyone runs to kill things or manipulate objects from event to event as long as you can stand it. Since players are sharing experience, this is a fast expereince machine, a great way to discover players to make friends with, and -- if you're like me and you're running a lot of characters -- Relieves the boredom of doing the same missions over and over. It at least interrupts them. The Rifts dynamic is fun because you sometimes discover where the next planar rift could occur and you can open it yourself. Then, players will zoom into your area to help you fight the denizens of the rift and close the thing back up. All of the benefits of instant adventures are in the Rifts, plus the granting of mucho neato loot.Finally, it should be mentioned that this is a game where you could easily spend and spend without limit. Many of the bundle packs for sale are quite pricey, although comparable to the price you'd pay for a year of playing a charging MMO. The in-game store can be pricey for some things, but if you are a careful shopper you can also buy things for loose change, including mounts. f you want to break down and completely outfit your character with weapons and armor, you can do the whole package in high quality stuff for a few dollars. That's nice if you've got a character you love, although the balance without purchased stuff -- if you don't make the mistake of accidentally attacking red (elite) enemies by yourself (which I have)  -- the balance is still good with what the game churns out in your quests. I'm hooked. This is a great game. I'll be playing it for a while. Take it on and enjoy!Telp			"

												Fun MMO game to get into and play with mates, PVP is fun aswell as dungeons/raids are awesome and a great implementation to the game. Tones of quests! so if you love doing quests on the based stroy line then trust me you will have a great time playing this at no worries of being bored. always people looking for groups so you are never alone in the world of rift. The rifts that you come across ingame are immaculate, by this I mean there is not a bunch of things surounding you so it's good for battle plus people with not so good computers. Rift will run on a lot of I would say mid way computers, there are ways to boost your FPS like enabling multi-core so it allows RIFT to use all your CPU cores. [RIFT is a F2P but NOT a Pay To Win] I have spent over £100 on this game and the things you get is really for yourself like a new mount,bags,new powers,skip minions and things like that otherwise I would be OP as anything.[Overall: 7/10] Would I recommend this game? Why yes I would!Download it and give it a try.			"

												This is a really great mmo. It has all the trappings of familiar mmos, yet brings its own distinctive flavor to the table. Rift has a wonderful storyline and is great for an RPer, because they'll be able to add their own story easily into the lore. Rift also has a variety of ways to level up characters without become too boring and repetitive. Like many other mmos, yes there is a rep grind to get the better gear, but there are many ways to actually do the grind.Rift recently went free to play and has an honest f2p system. The game isn't p2win at all. F2players are able to play with minimal difference from the subscribers. If you're looking for a challenge, this is definitely something to try.Pros:1. Raids, instances, pvp, instant adventures. Chronicles: 1-2 people instances.2. Collections to search for during the leveling process.3. Dimensions: aka player housing!4. Really robust dimension decorating system.5. Great crafting system.6. Easy to understand leveling system.7. Myriad of classes and class trees.8. Great community9. 6 races to choose from10. Frequent updates11. Fully customizable ui12. Minmal addons required13. The game is geographically HUGE.Cons:1. talent trees are a little tricky at first, but luckily the game comes with premade builds 2. Aoe can be a bit hard to see at first, adjust graphics accordingly.3. Will need a bit of a higher end computer to play at full glorious detail.4. This is one of those games where having a supportive guild can really make or break it for you.5. Instances/heroic instances are accessable to all, however raids are usually ran by guilds.6. It can be a bit much to learn at first.			"

												Pros: Easy to pick up and learn; has many similarities with other popular MMOs. You can change servers and recustomize your character (Excluding gender / race change) without having to pay real money. Changing servers is free, but recustomizing your character is expensive. (In game currency.) -Only 4 classes, but many different souls (Specializations) to choose from, and can have 3 souls active at a time. You can play your character however you want to. -PvP is fun in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of Unreal Tournament / Quake in the sense that it has an announcer that will announce events. ""First Blood"" ""Killing Spree"" ""Unstoppable"" etc. I found that pretty cool. -Has an in-game video recorder, which is a first for MMOs. However, it does not record sound last I checked. Not for me anyway.-UI Customization is good, you aren't too limited in that regard.-Average playerbase is usually friendly and helpful.-Can be played even on very bad computers. (Obviously your experience may not be ideal, but you should generally be able to play the game.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons: Only 6 races. 3 per faction. 4 of which are literally copy, pasted, and reskinned. There are only 2 unique races. Bahmi and Dwarves. -Game is not incredibly populated. -Only a few servers that I know of that have a decent playerbase, the rest are dead. For lack of a better word, the questing is, what I'd call, corridor questing. There aren't multiple same-level zones to choose from, should you decide you don't want to play in a certain. You have to level in a line of questing areas. No choice.(No more cons come to mind at the moment.)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There's more that can be said, but overall I enjoyed the game. It's certainly not bad by any means. It'd be better if it was more popular and had at least 1 more race for each faction that wasn't copy / pasted. If you get this game, it's certainly not a bad idea to bring a friend. I'd give this game a 7/10. It is subscription based. $15 per month. With new accounts, when you subscribe and set up a payment plan, your first month is free. (Your monthly billing will begin on the second month.)			"

												With a little bit over 90 hours into Rift, I have to say that this is actually a worthwhile MMO. With the massive scale of the world map and the activities that you're able to do, solo or with friends, there are still things that I have yet to unlock about the majesty of this world. There are fixes and such usually every wenesday (as far as a holiday schedule I have no idea). Cons: Without proper knowledge of an MMO or its key bindings, mappings, or any of the different attributes that follow, new players may have difficulty with leveling or succeding where they would know should there a technical ""partner"" to be with them. With the recruit a friend deal, that should be fixed though.			"

												At first I thought this game was a cheap WoW knock off, and thought badly of it because of a few people I heard saying it was bad... I tried it not too long ago, and couldn't take my eyes away for 10 more than 10 minutes. There's so much to do: A decent PvP, amazing PvE, Rift Hunts, 3 professions, Quest, Dungeon, Explore and it's all free, with the option to pay for extras, IT'S NOT PAY2WIN!!!! you buy outfits, bonus vials, mounts, and many other things including a way to sell Credits for In-game currency. The only thing I wish was in this game, is flying mounts. But definitely a great game for anyone who enjoys RPG.			"

												An absolute deep MMORPG that will suck every little hour of your life away.Never been this addicted to a MMO since WoW(Which btw,alot of people call this a Poor Man's WoW.WoW seems more like a Poor Man's Rift.)Quests are so fun and great to do,game is optimized well for any pc to run and running max setts sure is a treat to the eyes,There are no lag issues and server worlds seem to be stable as they can be.Classes are extremely diverse and they are adding constant addons and modifications to existing classes,and even making new ones!As for everything else like weapons,mechanics,structure,etc,Game will be very similar to WoW in these aspects,but IMO improves on them.The game IS NOT PAY TO WIN.Let me remind you that.You don't need to spend a single penny to get anything you can't get by investing time[Which will be hella easy for you :)]Only people who want things early or want to support devs usually pony up.Of course,since I love this game so much,I myself have made quite a few purchases just to support,plus indeed I felt temptated to get some equipment early instead of waiting! :P All in all game is fantastic,anybody honestly will love it even people who aren't used to MMOs(FPS players,Racing,Anyone!)Legendary stuff right here,1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10.

There are some things you have to spend buy VIA the game shop, but they are all cosmetic things or increased bag size...however, you can just trade in game money for game shop money :p10/10 Would recommend!Also, some say this is kind of a WoW clone....I wouldn't call it a clone, but if you like WoW, this DEFINETLY will appeal to you.

												What once was a decent game is now terrible, it took them nearly 5 months to release the 1st raid for the latest expansion, 3 months into the year to release their plan for 2017, delay upon delay for releasing content to ""polish"" it but still full of bugs, nerfs to classes that dont even make sense, lets take a middle of the range DPS spec and then nerf it to oblivion, sounds like a good idea. A vast amount of the content the latest expansion was supposed to have still isnt in the game 6 months later, a rather egregious cash grab for a dying game(developer too?). Would not recommend.			"

												The best WoW-style MMO out there.WoW fans looking for something familiar yet refreshing needn't look any further than RIFT.The Instances are challenging, ranging from 1/2-man Chronicles, 5-man Dungeons, and up to 20-man raids, which can get butt-clenchingly difficult for the hardcore crowd at endgame. PvP is great fun, although it could do with more maps and modes to spice things up. Open-world questing is fairly standard, but dynamic zone events like Invasions and the titular Rifts keep you on your toes. For those who want it, there's Crafting and Dimensions (player housing) as well as a well-structured cash shop, with some purchases for freeloaders that want to get serious being well-worth the money. The 'Soul Tree' character builder is the big selling point here. You choose one of 4 Classes (Warrior, Cleric, Rogue or Mage). Inside that Class, you can combine any 3 of the 9 (soon to be 10) availible Souls to create a completely new play style. Mix up the Beastmaster Soul with the Paladin Soul to tank with a pet! Dual spec a Mage to have Elementalist and Necromancer Souls to wield all the elements as well as the power of death! The possibilities are endless. With the forthcoming update, every Class will be able to fulfil any Role in the game (the Roles being tank, dps, healer and support). A Warrior healer? Why not. A Mage tank? Go ahead. Even players new to the genre needn't fear - there are now many audio/visual tutorials added to the starting zones that should be really helpful for easing you into the world of Telara. It could do with more PvP love and some more fantasy elements to heighten the immersion, but Rift is definitely worth your money. Oh, wait - it's free! :)			"

												I used to love Rift when it first came out but I quickly soured on the game because the raids and rotations suck♥♥♥♥♥ I loved playing everquest because it was simple to play where as Rift has horrible complex rotations that take the joy out of raiding. The best part is every three months they hit everyone with the nerf bat and You have to relearn all Your classes. If You like playing a game without stupid rotations then go somehwere else but if You enjoy a complicated click fest then by all means get rift.			"

												Fun MMO game to get into and play with mates, PVP is fun aswell as dungeons/raids are awesome and a great implementation to the game. Tones of quests! so if you love doing quests on the based stroy line then trust me you will have a great time playing this at no worries of being bored. always people looking for groups so you are never alone in the world of rift. The rifts that you come across ingame are immaculate, by this I mean there is not a bunch of things surounding you so it's good for battle plus people with not so good computers. Rift will run on a lot of I would say mid way computers, there are ways to boost your FPS like enabling multi-core so it allows RIFT to use all your CPU cores. [RIFT is a F2P but NOT a Pay To Win] I have spent over £100 on this game and the things you get is really for yourself like a new mount,bags,new powers,skip minions and things like that otherwise I would be OP as anything.[Overall: 7/10] Would I recommend this game? Why yes I would!Download it and give it a try.			"

 Basic InfoRift is a Mega Multiplayer online roleplay Game with a questing system same to swtor and WoW.It has a Invasion system that allows the NPC system to attack player's npc Towns/Outposts/Bases and actual conquer it by placing a foothold to produce buffs and spawn more troops to spread and conquer and so forth and so forth...It also has a Unique skills system where you are allowed to customize your own character's skills. There are 4 classes in the game: Warrior, Mage, Cleric and Rogue. (recently added the primalist class, but i don't know alot of this one)Warrior: although they are unexpectedly nerfed in PVP making them unmatched against spellcasters, although, they perform excellently in PVE, the warrior is meant to survive a good amount of damage or deal great damage with powerfull melee attacks.Mage: 3/4 of the players in Rift have a Mage main. Mages uses non-vigil magic to destroy his targets, some specializations have a Pet to summon in your journeys to tank or deal damage.Cleric: They are quite deficult to understand its skills, since they use Vigilistic magic, they can be all specializes: Tank, DPS and Healer. They can cast light magic or deal death magic by the power of Judgement. They also can use Melee weapons for tanky stuff.Rogue: Is the assassin. It can also summon animals of nature to support you. However, you can choose to be someone with knifes, attacking from the shadows. Or a Bow/gun master shooting from a distance or... you can combo both. FactionsThere are two factions just like in WoW you have the Alliance and the Horde and in swtor you have the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Now in Rift you have the Guardians and Defiants.The Guardians are the chosen of the gods. They serve the vigil's agenda.The Defiants have left the Gods behind them and started using Technology.However they are enemies of each other, while having to deal with other dimensional monstersThe monsters of the other dimensions travel through ""Rifts"" Which is a interdimensional Gap or Gateway or entrance made to go to the Dimension. However the Guardians and Defiants haven't found their own Rifts, they use Ancient teleporting technology to move around.The other dimensional monsters are factions and will attack each other too. Each plane is lead by a Dragon.Plane of Fire: Is the First general enemy for the guardians. MaelForge is the Red Dragon leader of them. Plane of Fire usually are Dragon-kind of humanoids, spawns of Hell and Goblins.Plane of Water: You won't encounter them alot unless you are bored and wnated to do Instant adventures, The plane of Water are monsters of the Depths of water and the Abyss. Fishy monsters.Plane of Air: also like the Plane of Water, their monsters are in overal all kinds of Birds, Harpies and eventually had their own Humanoid Army called ""the storm legion""Plane of Life: The Guardians are close in being allies with the reasonable Plane of Life, but it keeps finding ways to hostility. The plane of Life Focusses on everything that is life itself: Tree ents, Plants and also a hostile elven army that lives in the Plane of Life called ""The AelfWar""Plane of Death: The most common enemy in the game. The plane of Death is everything that is undead: Skeletons, zombies, vicious Possessed wolves, Ghosts, werewolves, Vampires, Demons (however plane of fire has demons too).Plane of Earth: is the most uncommon faction in the game. They are usually made minerals, rock golems, Giant bugs that live underground like ants, sometimes goblins too, but usually treasure hunters. "

												Basically a free version of WoW (looks better too) and surprisingly isn't pay to win. Some extra features need to be bought (like extra bag slots, which bothers me) but otherwise very playable without spending any money.			"

												The best WoW-style MMO out there.WoW fans looking for something familiar yet refreshing needn't look any further than RIFT.The Instances are challenging, ranging from 1/2-man Chronicles, 5-man Dungeons, and up to 20-man raids, which can get butt-clenchingly difficult for the hardcore crowd at endgame. PvP is great fun, although it could do with more maps and modes to spice things up. Open-world questing is fairly standard, but dynamic zone events like Invasions and the titular Rifts keep you on your toes. For those who want it, there's Crafting and Dimensions (player housing) as well as a well-structured cash shop, with some purchases for freeloaders that want to get serious being well-worth the money. The 'Soul Tree' character builder is the big selling point here. You choose one of 4 Classes (Warrior, Cleric, Rogue or Mage). Inside that Class, you can combine any 3 of the 9 (soon to be 10) availible Souls to create a completely new play style. Mix up the Beastmaster Soul with the Paladin Soul to tank with a pet! Dual spec a Mage to have Elementalist and Necromancer Souls to wield all the elements as well as the power of death! The possibilities are endless. With the forthcoming update, every Class will be able to fulfil any Role in the game (the Roles being tank, dps, healer and support). A Warrior healer? Why not. A Mage tank? Go ahead. Even players new to the genre needn't fear - there are now many audio/visual tutorials added to the starting zones that should be really helpful for easing you into the world of Telara. It could do with more PvP love and some more fantasy elements to heighten the immersion, but Rift is definitely worth your money. Oh, wait - it's free! :)			"

Groups seem to avg around 5-8 minutes to form fully for p/u. Lots of crafting to do, if that is your thing.

												This game is pretty awesome. It has many pros, and few cons.First, the fact that any piece of hardware can run it is nice, and even the highest-end PCs get a kick out of the best settings. There are many little things to get sidetracked with, from special events to higher level bosses. If you're anything like me, you'll appreciate the chance to show off on a special boss, or one of the many raids. But the best part for myself were the classes. You choose a side, a race, and one of four basic classes. Depending on the class you choose, from the cleric, the warrior, the wizard, and the (rogue?), you then choose what type of class you are. You could be a rogue tank if you wanted, with no regards to stereotypes, although it definitely changes the playstyle. All of it helps to define you, and determine your soul trees. You can change them later, but the soul trees help to really define you. I'll add that even though most of the abilities seem overpowered in most games, they scale well in this one. Enemies and players have very notable differences in their power between levels. Most MMOs give you the ability to fight enemies many levels higher than you if you're skilled enough. Not this one. Walking near enemies who are even 2 or 3 levels higher spells death for a solo or duo party.As with anything, there are cons. First, scaling is extreme. You can't expect to compete with people 10 levels higher, and enemies that high are out of the question for the casual adventurer. Second, and probably the only thing that made me stop playing, is the quest system. The quests are very repetitive, and if they aren't, the likelihood is that you're running for 10 minutes to where you need to go. Lastly, the story/lore is very long. If you don't like reading, this game is NOT for you. Most quests are on average several pages long of information you don't need unless you want lore.tl;drPros:Very optimized for any hardware, many events to partake in, and lots of character development.Cons:Extreme scaling of enemies and players and very repetitive and semi-boring quests.Give it a try. You can't lose much other than time and memory with this.			"

												Played since the origional release of the game. Having such a long history with the game i can only tell you the negatives since there are only a very few.If you want to pve and raid this game is unforgiving so you will need to always attend and always raid in order to keep up.If you want to pvp and rank up you can do that easily because you only need to pvp on occasion and it will still rank you up.if you expect to get everything for free well you wont because basic access only gives you the basic game. You can only level to max level using basic talents.. the Storm Legion and Nightmare Tide talents will be locked to you unless you buy siad expansions or spend hours grinding for the coin to unlock them ingame.thats about it really... 3 negs 1. without investing some time n money into this game you wont get the best of it... 2. raids take dedication above all else.3. not all talents are availible without paying or grinding for them.totally positive game imo. Slowly over 2 years of gameplay i have the SL talents NTE and a limited time offer that expanded my account to full bag space and 5 characters per server. Even tho i never managed to join a top ranking guild and raid till i drop i got to build my dimensions, pvp all day n nite, raid rift till i drop, enjoyed the seasonal events and geared into full Nightmare tide Expert gear with several upgrades...like what else can i say. The game is amazingly fun even for just casual players. MMO done right imo. =)			"

												I feel like this game has a ton of potential. Its got great graphics for those with the computer for it but no middle man for those who play on the lesser. Why I say this is because when starting up a new game, any gamers first instinct is to go into the settings to allow maximum advantage of the cames aesthetics and play. When I personally went through RIFTs settings I first put them as high as possible and it was lovely albeit, still not as fancy as guild wars2; above par for being f2p. The problem is when lowering the elements it was difficult keeping each portion on a level that would run with a lower end computer without having to pull some farther down than others, thus giving the game not so very fluent appeal. Another issue with the settings were key-bindings. It was a bit constricting since the game itself is supposed to be modded for player appeal. All around the game itself is fun in a slower pace but still well-rounded and would completely recommend for those looking to pass the time until ESO:TU. :)			"

												So,i played a couple of hours and I really enjoyed it.I like it very much because you have A LOT of quests and you level up pretty hard (if you don't watch the world,you will level up pretty fast).You can always do something.If you are bored of quests or training skills or the story of the game ,you can participate in a raid or in a adventure.I'm pretty noob at this game because I just started it but i can't wait to see how awesome it can be in higher levels.I played WoW a lot of time and if I have to choose Rift or World of Warcraft...I would choose Rift.

												First off I just wanna say I've mabye spent around 1000 hours on this game off of steam. Anyways this game used to be really good, it had a large community of players, the pvp was amazing, and many raiding guilds to join. Although as the years went by, Trion has made the game more and more Pay2win. Also pvp has become very unbalanced because they buff powerful classes thinking it helps somehow. Overall they ♥♥♥♥ed up the game in a span of 4 years. Its worth playing to level up all the way to max level, although once at max level there isn't really anything to do.			"

												The population is considered low for an MMO. Possibly due to other Trion projects failing and needing compensation. It used to be a great game and still is of you can afford the perks/DLC.(300-700+ daily population in 2017)Mostly quest grinding and carnage quests through 1-65 levels. The standard edition of the game provides one character boost 1-65. PvP and dungeons/raids are ghost towns until you get to the 65-70 end-game levels. Active monthly events with rare mounts and items/recipes as rewards in the past.If you can afford these perks the game will be more enjoyable. :PStandard Editions $40Starter Pack $5Soul Package $40Patron Benefits $15/30 daysOr you can buy ESO standard for $9.99.(ESO Plus members enjoy all DLC $15/30days)			"

												This game IS free to play to level 65. In  RIFT you have the ability to move thru areas of the game fluidly and have easy interaction with other players. The Soul Tree gives you an interesting way to build a unique character. The rift incounters/invasions are awsome and allow you to form huge open raid groups easily & quickly. There is a real money store to buy from, mostly for cosmetic items and unique mounts and such, and you earn rewards thru the loyalty program. I would recomend spending the $5US to unlock full use of auctionhouse. The most recent DLC does have a charge to unlock but by level 65 you should know if you like the game. Patron membership is $15 per month, which unlocks lots of perks an option. I really recommend checking this game out.			"

												One of the better MMORPG's out on the market currently with undoubtedly the best Free-2-play systems available. You don't need to spend any money to unlock zones, or quests. You can hit level cap without ANY hinderence. Unlike other f2p MMO's they tend to penalize the experience gain, well in Rift everyone earns 100% but subscribers earn even more experience!Rift has a very rich PvE experience, Such as:- A very fleshed out end-game raiding. Multiple 10 and 20 man raids that vary in difficulty and tiers, whether in organized guild runs or Pugs in general chat.- Plenty of dungeons to run with expert mode(heroic) which allows for greater challenge and better loot and badges/emblems/tokens to redeem for epics.- Chronicles, which are single or 2 player story-based instances that drops blues/epics that may be slightly weaker or on par with expert dungeon gear - they are usually pretty quick and can be done once daily to help gear along with dungeons for pre-raiding.- Huge open world content! Giant boss battles that dwarf whatever Guild Wars 2 dynamic event bosses have to offer, As well as huge rifts in which potentially several raids participate in.Pros:- A very classic/BC WoW feel. Very good class building and talent/skill system.- Player housing! Be as creative as you can be! Crazy things can be done here, albeit not as indepth as Everquest II.- Casual and Hardcore friendly. Enjoy exploring the world, doing quests, collecting mini-pets and mounts, and searching for artifacts across the world, collecting titles and achievements, also items for your house! There's also plenty of things to grind for the super hardcore players.Cons:- The grind can get tedious if you're not used to the older style of World of Warcraft, however It's still easier than some of the more hardcore old school MMO's.- Auction house is not usable unless you have spent at least 5 dollars in-game OR have bought the game or subscribed for at least one month.- PvP is kind of lacking, very basic WoW-style battlegrounds is all you're going to get here. PvP ranks are also very long to grind.- While most of the game is completely free, you are not able to play the expansion ""souls"" (classes technically) without buying them seperately or owning Storm Legion. They can be bought in-game for around 20 dollars and it includes 4 souls (classes) Not entirely necessary, but definitely useful to own end-game raiding when multiple roles are needed.Overall it's a great MMO, especially for older WoW veterans and newer MMO players a like. Very accessible but also has a lot of depth in terms of class building and skills.Subscription can also be bought with in-game gold, although it will be very difficult for newer players, if you manage to hit level cap and do a bit of farming you'll be able to afford it without too much of an issue.It's free! Give it a shot, the first few levels might be a bit rough and boring but once you get going it's a wonderful ride!			"

												One of the better free to play MMOs that there is, probably because it didn't start that way.  There's some interesting dynamics and things I don't care for.  The fact that each class has the ability to be dps, tank or healer is convenient but the fact that each one can switch their spec on the fly makes building a dynamic group difficult because everyone can do everything... so you are not needed.  They will constantly change skills and trees in an attempt to balance, but they overdo it to the point where you have trouble keeping up with the changes and sometimes ruin what you had.  Like most MMOs these days, top level and end game has a huge gap, to the point where you feel like you're a level one fighting a top level when you face off against a top geared player.  Lastly, the constant paid DLCs result in paying even more money than if this game weren't f2p... $355 for all of it?  This game has a lot of fun stuff but not worth getting attached to.			"

												'There was once a lone wonderer in RIFT. His name was Tangociss. He dished out justice wherever he went, slaying bandits and killing mobs. With his allies on Skype and in his guild, he would adventure throughout Telera and bring justice to the poor NPCs who would offer him quests. He would avenge the poor corpses of NPCs with quests that they gave and the like. Tangociss was a fine fellow indeed, recruiting members into his guild that he formed with his buddies Gisten, BorisPower, Snatmia and Vrush. Tangociss adventured around, closing Rifts and collecting artefacts while gaining repuatation towards the different factions. With his pet and mount, they were hardly ever still in a town, always out in the world adventuring..'- Extract taken from the offical mind of Tangociss Furrociss himself: 15:43 22/08/2014 ©If you maged to read the story, then yes, you get to do all the stuff I mentioned. You close Rifts for loot and the like, form guilds, adventure around and the like. Trust me, it is indeed a good game. Just so ya know, play it with some buddies so ya don't get bored. As for class wise, there are 4 of 'em. Warrior Cleric, Mage and Rouge. There are some rather nice sub-classes within the actual class, so if you choosse warrior, you can be a warlord, or beastmaster (apologies if I mispelt the names) depending on yer playstyle. There are 2 main factions, the Guardians and the Defiansts. Depending on the faction you choose, the starting location and tutorials area will be different along with quests and NPCs you will encounter, but gameplay wise it will still be the same. As for pets and mounts, you use coins (in game currency) which are silver, gold and platnium. You can also buy credits for real money but it is used mainly for cosmetic items. To buy pets, you can buy 'em with loot gained from turning in artefact sets or use credits. You can get a mount in the 2 factions main citys. The mounts range from horses to pandas to even Hellbugs. Quite fun indeed. If all this sounds enjoyable, go ahead and give this game a go. Oh yeah, our guild is recruiting. Doesn't matter what faction yer in, we take any and all members, if you wanna join us, give this guild 'Righteous Alliance' a look in the guild finder, and just say ya read this review or whatever, so I can invite ya in.

This allmost happen every single patch you are forced to wait for them to fix the graphics bugs. in this case the char select screen does not load properly. This is the only reason i cant recommend this game. The installer you get trough steam does not install microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable that is needed to run the game properly so it has to be installed separetly or if you install dc universe online steam will install it as a first run process but rift installer does not install it.

												ive played this game for ages now (not always on steam) and it was a great game pre nightmare tide. back when the level cap was 50 and there was still vengance an valor on pvp gear is when rift was really considered a ""wow killer"" when storm legion dropped and increased the level cap to 60 it had realeased fun great new content while still keeping that good well balanced mmo rpg. however, as soon as nightmare tide was released and level 65 was the new cap, everything has gone down the♥♥♥♥♥♥hole. i still play rift and i enjoy it but i wish i could still pvp before level 65. unfortunatly since this game is almost dead now you will never find a warfront below level 65. (if youre lucky 60-64) They also made it so pvp gear is no longer available. raid gear and pvp gear have been combined into 1 armor set. and for those that have alot of money youre in luck because as of right now the best tier 3 raid set for level 65 right now is able to be bought with real money... as well as best in slot earrings, trinkets, weapons, etc... Final thought on this game: older is better, newer is pay to win. if you are those few that grind out the currency in game to get the best gear, good luck, you'll be there for a while...			"

												This is a solid MMO. While the gameplay is a bit old school (tab targeting) it is fun. The class system is awesome! You can be anything simply by switching builds/gear which only costs a small amount of gold (the build switch). The F2P model is very fair. The only annoying thing is the auction house lock for completely free players but you can unlock it for 5 dollars and that 5 bucks can buy you a decent bit of stuff.  Some people say making earing slots exclusive to the expansion is Pay to Win, but I disagree. Earings give minimal stats, are obtainable in game, and make zero difference until the very end game.  Farming a bit of in game currency instead of paying for a full expansion seems like a decent tradeoff in my opinion. Overall, fun game.			"

												Was a great MMORPG before it went F2P, then things kind of just went downhill.  I'm not saying that because I'm some bitter P2P guy who just hates all the F2P gamers.  The community really did drastically change when the game went F2P, especially in the lower levels.   It can be a bit frustrating at times rolling a new character.  The chat spam is ultimately what turned me away from the game.  No matter what you do, you can't keep up with it.  You're nearly constantly spammed.  I have spent quite a few of my sessions ignoring spammers a lot more than what I should have to.  Albeit, this was all around 6 months ago, so maybe things have cleared up.  This was an amazing game in it's prime - easily beating out every other MMORPG I have ever played.  But, sadly, I just can't recommend it anymore, which is sad because I made some great friends and had great times in RIFT....			"

												Rift is a nice looking game, with interesting enemies and concepts. The landscape is ok, but gets dull very quick. Also the game is incredibly repetitive with the fighting style that rewards you for smashing your keyboard to attack as quick as you can. Also the quests are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. EVERY SINGLE ONE is either a fetch quest or click on some useless thing that you have no idea what it is, or kill x enemies for x money. Good to start, but you probably will get bored very quickly.

												I got this game back at the ""From the Embers"" update, before it was ""f2p"" or even on steam. Back then, it was my favorite game. Everything about it was great: the graphics, the story line, the unique form of pve, and the amazing soul system. When Trion (damn them) made the game free, it all started going downhill. The became lazy with updates, most lacking any solid story, not to mention the fact that the quests were repetitive. I could tolerate this to an extent. However, the deal breaker for me was the major class changes. Every class could play every role, which got rid of the diversity, and even changed some of the souls completely. My main was a reaver tank, Therefore, my entire character was torn apart and made irrelevant. This game had so much potential, and I enjoyed it even more than WoW. Sadly, Trion took it down the wrong path, and it seemed to become a completely different game. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												First off lets get something straight, you can currently play all content without paying a penny, so many people are complaining its P2W but its not, i've played a small amount of time in rift (currently 1.7k hours) and if i didnt want to i didnt have to pay anything, yes there is a new expansion being released which you are being asked to pay for but you can get it for as little as £30 atm (prob cheaper elsewhere if you know where to look) but then how many wow expansions have you had to pay for ? oh all of them.The game is great imo, plenty of people playing and assuming you get talking in local you can join a decent active guild like i have.  My current guild mates purposly did dungeons they had completed ages ago to get me and others geared (my newest character that is), Yes you can pay cash to open certain things like earrings but you can also use ingame currency for that too (which currently takes no time at all to get).The gfx are great and trion have recently introduced quad core support but only time will tell if it improves my already decent fps or not.Would i recommend this game ? yes, its an mmo so get yourself into an active guild (there are plenty out there) enjoy all the current content (which is free), If you are thinking of spending a bit of real life cash then get the expansion (out on 16 nov).All in all I love rift and will hopefully be playing it for years to come.

												Came back after many years, found a world where everything was teleporting and rubber-banding about.  I'd shoot at enemies and they'd vanish, so I'd try to walk away, only to find a few seconds later I would be zapped over to some new location and locked in melee with that foe - who was still standing fifty feet away in another direction, but we were in melee anyway.Also I discovered that I could now walk through walls.  This seemed awesome at first until I tried to go back into town but realized that I couldn't, because instead of climbing stairs I just kept walking through them instead.  At no point during this experiment did I ever see another actual human player.As for the parts that did still work... well, it was never impressive to begin with.  The entire MMO industry has degraded itself into little more than a machine to produce WoW clones, and this game is no exception.  The graphics may change and maybe, just maybe, some games will add a whole third faction (this one does not), but in the end it's all the same tropes, the same combat, the same classes, the same mounts, the same grind and the same empty, meaningless themepark ride for a world full of ""chosen ones"" that only exists to be a barrier between the new player and the max level guild/clan raiding gang - the ""whales"" of the industry who can always be counted on to trade in their college fund for a one point PvP advantage that only lasts until the next DLC/expansion pack comes out.In other words, if you've played any three other fantasy MMOs in your lifetime then you've already played RIFT, or at least you may as well have.  You've already seen everything that you'd see in this game.  If you still want to put yourself through this year's re-skinning of that same game then have fun with that, but to me it doesn't matter what kind of sauce you put on tofu - it's still just tofu.Now you may not agree with this but again, not one other human player this time around and honestly, I never saw more than half a dozen outside of the towns even when the game was brand new.  So don't just take my word on it - look around.  Forget the zombie survival games, this is your real ""Last Man on Earth"" experience right here.So considering all of this and the general state of the game I'm not the least bit surprised by their new big push to sell an expansion pack (you know, those things that most other MMOs give away for free?).  Well of course they're trying to get everyone to buy a $40DLC.  That last cash influx will make for nice golden little parachute for the company executives  who are probably laughing all the way to their banks in Switzerland before pulling the life support on this vegetable and heading off to the magical realm of comfy retirement.

												the more you get to know about this game, the better it gets.most games gets boring after awhile. However this game has so many features like  dungeons, Instant Advanture, PvP, dimension, and skills like crafting that you will never get bored! Once you are bored at doing dungeons you can simply do PvP instead and if you are bored again, do some dimension!! Especially when i first found out about dimension, I was amazed that I could build my own house and other stuff! It was like minecraft within MMORPG!I really enjoyed playing this game myself and I highly recommend this game to everyone.			"

												Pros:FunNice classes, great skillsMany cool mountsRifts are fun and ppl do do them, well most of them.Cons:""best-in-class Free-to-Play model"" Mmmm wrong. Its not the best nore the worst but they do lie sense it is a trick/trap to lure you in till you are lvl 30ish then you learn the hard way-Cant use the AH unless you pay $$ outright for loyalty to use the AH. To do so you need to grind for a month to buy 1 Rex that will give you the ability to use the AH and it cost 1.3k-p.Cant equip earrings, you need to pay $$ to unlock early on or use Rex to get credits to unlock it, again that is a 30 day quest grind.Servers are dead, you can spend 3 days trying to sell an item in chat at 60% lower then AH and still will not sell a wanted item.ill just thumbs it down sense im at 50/50, it has enough thumbs up.

												Rift was my third true MMO love. I played WoW from launch till BC, I played LOTRO from pre-order to Lorochel and then I played Rift. I loved Rift. Rift isn't what I loved. It's now a microtransaction riddled face-roll spamfest. If RIft ever want back in time Id give it a solid 8/10 but today I'd have to give it a 2/10 because there's no challenege, no fun.For instance, I logged in after not playing since right atfer the first expansion, so that's 2 years? I decided to see how the game was with my wife who always played with me. We logged-in to our lvl 50 characters ahd queed up for a new 'hard mode' dungeon so we could gauge the gameplay. We found a group rather quickly with me queing as a Tank and Her a Healer.  I was unable to locate my shield for whatever reason it was just nowhere to be found. I'm thinking we're going to be screwed, hopefully the group doesn't realize I'm tanking without a shield and kick me. Maybe a shield will drop before anyone notices. :P We're killing everything so ridiculously easily that we're pulling entire rooms and she's barely even playing. SHe goes AFK halfway through the dungeon and we easily complete it without her... Pathetic.			"

												Fun and interesting but hard to get in for a non-mmo sort of player. At early levels, rifts became incredibly challenging...

												Played from closed beta in december 2010 to about the start of 2013. Over 1000 hours clocked on all my characters combined and I can say RIFT is one of the best MMOs out there. I stopped right around the free to play model kicked in, but it arguably has the best F2P model out there for an MMO as well. I can't speak for the current content in the Nightmare Tide expansion, but back in vanilla the raid Hammerknell Fortress really stood out. That is without a doubt my favourite raid, EVER. But that is of course past content I'm praising, so I can only vouch for this game for what it once was ... But that game was easily a 10/10.			"

So if you liked WoW you will like this game. ___They do have a really good F2P model you can buy in game items through micro transactions but not P2W.

												this game is a great F2P that does not lock important content behind pay walls, you can even get the premium curency from trading with other players, allowing you to go 100% F2P if you want. The game suffers the same problems as WoW (this game is preety much a WoW clone, with some small changes) but if you find an interesting guild to join, you don't mind the grinding at all. You need alot of freetime to enjoy this game to its fullest, but if your in the right guild, this game is a great alternative to WoW (no subcription needed to play too)!			"

												The few hours I spent playing this game were painstaking. There was absolutely no redeeming factor to the fact that the combat was bland and there was nothing fun about this game. The first class I picked, some sort of stealthy assassin rogue-like class, was apparently so underpowered that it was completely unplayable. It took me 15 minutes to find a friendly player to tell me that that class is practically unplayable because you can't even kill the beginning monsters. I had thought I was doing something wrong. Apparently, the interesting classes need someone to heal them 24/7 and their attacks are weak. The rest of the classes, as far as I could tell, were the generic Warrior/Mage, etc. classes.  Already off to a rough start, I find out there is a subscription (ugh, what is this, Club Penguin?) and that there are also microtransactions and starter packs between $40 and $150.Quite honestly, this game could easily be worse than most RPGs. It's unbalanced classes, money-eating methods, and absolutely NO exciting things about the game leave it to be just another generic piece of crap designed to eat your money. I know this may sound a bit extreme, but without anything to redeem this game from all the bad stuff, what can be said to be good about it?If you're looking for an RPG, try anything but this. Now that I think about it, I think I found more good things in Bad Rats than I did in this game.2/10, generic RPG, don't waste your time			"

												Graphics are good, game mechanics are good, community is good and the fact that you can puchase extensions/dlc with in game cash is good. I like the Rifts, and in big area events, where dozens to hundreds of people fight together some bigger than life enemy. I've played WoW from vanilla to WoTLK, countless hours. I played Guild Wars 2, 4charcs to 80 and then some. I've tried Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, LoTR Online, Secret World, Perfect World, Rusty Hearts, TERA, etc. But RIFT is still my all time favourite. Thank god there is variety, so if this is not your cup of tea, you can try something else :)			"

												RIFT is good. If you need free, and you have a friend that will play this with you, go for it. And when you do, give it a real try the same way you would a paid game. It's easy to shelf a free game if it doesn't feel amazing within 30 minutes. But if you pay $40+ for a game, you usually give it several hours even if it's mediocre.However, if you haven't played Guild Wars 2, you should try that first. It used to be pay once to play forever, but now it's free to play except the expansion (past level 80). GW2 is a lot better than RIFT.So, I guess even though I'm recommending RIFT, it's for a specific group of people: someone that can only play a free game and has played GW2 and TERA and SWTOR so much that he's tired of them.

												Going to say beforehand that I have a lot more hours on Rift then shown, as I played game through ncsoft launcher for most of the time, and only picked up the steamversion when it was on sale.For me Rift was at one Time on of the best MMORPG's out there, even when they went f2p the Game was awesome. Do not get me wrong the Game had problems, for me foremost the Hero engine as your character just does not look smooth when he performs spells/Actions, but that is just a Problem with the Engine in general.However sadly the good Times are gone now or at least for me, the ingame shop has been getting worse and worse and currently I would classify Rift as Pay2Win (not completly p2w yet as you can get pretty muc heverything by grinding too, but the Advantages of the online Shop are destroying your motivation to play this game actively)What also will turn of new players is that you have to spend a stupid amount of Money just to start with all Classes/Souls, as you not only have to buy the expansion but also essential pack. Which is just stupid beyond belief since it hinders anyone new from coming to Rift without spending around 110€. And now to the bigges Problem, Trion, as a Company just gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about its customer base/players, and will pretty much ignore any Problem and bugs, and then blame testing Guild for not pointing them out even if they did, this caused pretty much all top end Guild to leave Rift, which a MMORPG needs to have, without the active Hard-Core Community a MMO just isn't as fun.Anyway I would not recomment this  Game for New Players or returning Players, as a beginner you will just have so many Problems and will have to spend so much Money to go to a buggy End Game that it is not worth it, while as returning Player you will just be angry for what  Rift has become.Better remember what it once was, then what Greediness has turned it into.

												Edit: I'm not quite sure who the target market for this game is. MOBAs in general have much more lively and balanced pvp matches. And they are f2p as well. Raiding in general is a laggy low-fps jerkfest. My hardware isn't the top of the line, but it handled GTA5 at a decent detail level and framerate. Maybe people who like terrain puzzles and hunting artifacts? Maybe that's the real target market of this game still? Maybe the 5mans? Except that you'll be waiting for a 5man queue to pop maybe once an hour? The scintillating general chat?Edit: The other thing that annoys me is how the expac souls are engineered to be so much better than the vanilla souls, so that you'll be forced to buy and play the new soul packs. So, if you are say, a mage, you will be forced to play harbinger, whether you want to or not, just because it does the required amount of dps needed to pass the content. Just one example of how f2p ruins a game over time. Another gripe would be how pvp rarely ever feels balanced, where almost every match feels like you're stomping the other team or you're getting stomped on. It's rare you see comebacks or even close scores at the end. It wouldn't matter except that they merged pvp and pve gear together, so that any change in pvp now affects pve, and if there's one thing pvp is always lobbying for, it's change, change, change.Edit: The thing that really annoys me about this game is the lag. I'm sure that other MMOs do trickery to mask the underlying network latency, and perhaps Trion should look into that. That and the annoying little bugs related to the UI and display that have been in the game since launch. Their QA isn't nearly up to the level that Blizzard's is. And instead of fixing the bugs, Trion seems more interested in rolling out game after game after game. With probably the same sort of bugs in them too.Edit: Not really pay to win, unless you're willing to shell out $100s. I'm guessing like all freemium models, they're relying on a few big whales to fund the playtime for everyone else. The current level cap 5man experts are decently hard. I can see where they tried to require teamwork, but all it has really done is make the tank shoulder an unequal burden in a PUG. Hence, players willing to tank are rather rare and you will be sitting in an expert queue for quite a while. The entry level raids are also decently hard too and do require even more teamwork to pull off. All in all, if you refrain from being a whale, it's a decent amount of content for not much money. PvP is rather laggy, if you ask me. I asked other people whether this sort of lag was normal and they said yes. So if you like crisp clear PvP, be prepared to be a little bit disappointed.I played this game when it first came out. At the time, it was quite challenging, the 5man experts required quite a bit of teamwork to pull off properly. I left it when it was still hard, and still a subscription game, mainly because the internet I had sucked at the time. Can't really heal when you're lagging 5000ms. Not really fun either.I decided to revisit it again, seeing as it's now f2p and subscriptionless, just to see what it's like these days. Everything is now easy mode, you're only in danger of dying if you get out of range of the healer. Otherwise the mobs just die in front of you and give you that sweet XP. The world is also ridiculously easy too, they've set the aggro radius on most mobs to be quite small, it's fairly easy to saunter in somewhere, hit a quest and then saunter back out.I'm disturbed by the fact that you can now buy purple gear at the level cap. It may be a tier behind and the current tier you may have to play for, but it looks a lot like pay to win. I've no objection to paying for things, and in some ways, f2p makes for a nicer experience. Because nobody's on the clock (either you or the game designers) you don't feel that urgent need to zip through the levels to get to the cap, so you can get on with raiding. And the game designers (who you're really playing against) don't feel that need to slow you down, so they can get more money out of you. Time is money. You want to move fast, they want you to move slow.But paying to win goes a bit too far. I haven't reached 65 yet (only 55 now), so we'll see.Everybody (if you're willing to pay for it) can now do every role. Mages, can literally tank. Yes literally. The mage tank is no longer a joke. Warriors, can heal. No, not with bandages. They really can heal.But if you just want something to kill time with, and all you care about is questing and 5mans, there's a lot of free content they're just giving away. Even if all you do is just dps with one of the original soul combos, it'll probably take you at least a month to get to 65. And then you can just move on to something else :P			"

												This is a pretty good MMO. It's free, but I would totally pay money to have it. There are a few microtransactions in it, but they aren't necessary to have fun in the game. They're actually pretty pointless, but I guess they have to make money some how. The basis of this game is all about rifts (how the title of the game originated). There are MMO-typical quests throughout, but there are also rifts which are tears into other dimensions. These rifts produce monsters, and you must fight them off to seal the rift. There are many types of rifts, from fire to water to earth to air, and many others I didn't mention. Several mobs appear which you have to fight off (sometimes alone, sometimes with friends). There are different stages within a rift. The higher stage you get to, the harder the mobs become to kill. When a rift is finally sealed, you get rewards. Most importantly, you get planarite (how much you get depends on the stage you reach). Planarite can be used to buy planar goods, which can help you with battling more rifts or by improving your armor to make you more OP. So far, I've only gotten to level 21 or 22, but I can tell that I will be playing this for a long time.			"

												Top three F2P MMO's, Lord Of The Rings Online, Tera and Rift.  Now the only problem is having enough time to play them all.This game has changed a lot and it seems a pattern all these MMOs are taking.  Reducing the characters building down to just a few selections or non at all.  I enjoyed picking souls and then fine tuning them with skill points, now this has almost gone.If you want an indepth character/class building game this isn't it.  If your a casual gamer and doesn't want to spend time building characters then this is for you.			"

												rift is a free version of world of warcraft but the major difference is... is not only is it free to play but it has what world of warcraft removed. talent tree system. wow has   a skill bar more than anything anymore... and wow sorta died with blizzard running out of ideas and them ruining pvp with base resilence and making world pvp good. but this is a rift review not wow and me ♥♥♥♥♥ing at blizzard. Rift is great for people with not enough money to afford other mmos (wow) or swtor even though that is also free to play  it includes alot that most mmos have but it brings more to the free to play portion witch i love most games or mmo if its free to play you have to pay or spend tons of hours knowing the pay to play players get it quicker or easier rift allows you to get the items even though you are free to play. i would recamend this game if you're tired of games like world of warcraft or just want something new in your gaming career even though world of wacraft isnt that bad but... i hate it now :c "

Glyph, the scorge of launchers, absolutely ruins the game. Glyph launcher is absolutely riddled with bugs. I personally was unable to log in to my old account so I tried making another account. This was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥as Trion's website barely ever responds and constatly times out. However, when I evenutally created my new account i went to sign in on Glyph's launcher... I was given ""2024 error message"" which currently has no easy fix. I then found a large work around for this god awful bug the game would never patch as I received a plethora of other errors. Searched all night on Trion's unresponsive website to contact customer support and no email has been found to this day... shame was actually one of fun MMOs. Well here I come Neverwinter.			"

												This game is starting to show its age and is only fun if you don't mind playing a game with friends that hasn't innovated beyond WoW, with it's grinding and 1-9 rotation combat system.I feel this game only has so many positive reviews because it was good when it first came out and it has a fair business model. There are many lesser known MMOs out there that are more innovative and engaging, for example, neverwinter, mortal online and defiance.ProsIt's free to play and there's no paywalls or microtransactions to hinder you.Community is generally nice and helpful.Playing with friends casually is good to pass the time but don't expect engaging quests, combat or storyline.ConsCamera movement is tied with character movement. Come on,  it's 2015.Camera is wonky at times, going near a wall makes the camera zoom in so you can't see anything BUT the wall.Combat is not engaging and is a case of rotating spells until the enemy dies.Graphics starting to age.

												Going to say beforehand that I have a lot more hours on Rift then shown, as I played game through ncsoft launcher for most of the time, and only picked up the steamversion when it was on sale.For me Rift was at one Time on of the best MMORPG's out there, even when they went f2p the Game was awesome. Do not get me wrong the Game had problems, for me foremost the Hero engine as your character just does not look smooth when he performs spells/Actions, but that is just a Problem with the Engine in general.However sadly the good Times are gone now or at least for me, the ingame shop has been getting worse and worse and currently I would classify Rift as Pay2Win (not completly p2w yet as you can get pretty muc heverything by grinding too, but the Advantages of the online Shop are destroying your motivation to play this game actively)What also will turn of new players is that you have to spend a stupid amount of Money just to start with all Classes/Souls, as you not only have to buy the expansion but also essential pack. Which is just stupid beyond belief since it hinders anyone new from coming to Rift without spending around 110€. And now to the bigges Problem, Trion, as a Company just gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about its customer base/players, and will pretty much ignore any Problem and bugs, and then blame testing Guild for not pointing them out even if they did, this caused pretty much all top end Guild to leave Rift, which a MMORPG needs to have, without the active Hard-Core Community a MMO just isn't as fun.Anyway I would not recomment this  Game for New Players or returning Players, as a beginner you will just have so many Problems and will have to spend so much Money to go to a buggy End Game that it is not worth it, while as returning Player you will just be angry for what  Rift has become.Better remember what it once was, then what Greediness has turned it into.

												it is a great MMO. the playerbase is high, the world is interesting, and you dont actually have to pay to buy the premium goods. Class Variation here is some of the best i have ever seen in an MMO. if you want to be a spell slinging warrior, you can. if you want to be a tanky rogue that controls the battlefield with stuns, roots, and pulls, you can. one of the best features is that you can actually buy premium currency from other players using in game currency. characters arent sexualized like in most other F2P MMOs. the combat is solid and rifts work perfectly. my only complaint is that they need one or 2 more servers. ever since the flood of F2P members, i have noticed that my laptop doesnt run it nearly as smoothly.

												this game is a great F2P that does not lock important content behind pay walls, you can even get the premium curency from trading with other players, allowing you to go 100% F2P if you want. The game suffers the same problems as WoW (this game is preety much a WoW clone, with some small changes) but if you find an interesting guild to join, you don't mind the grinding at all. You need alot of freetime to enjoy this game to its fullest, but if your in the right guild, this game is a great alternative to WoW (no subcription needed to play too)!			"

												I played this game for a couple of hours and wasn't at all satisfied. The graphics are dated, but the fps is horrible, which doesn't make any sense (very, very bad game optimization). The quests are quite generic and boring. While the game adds something new to the genre with the addition of Rift events it really isn't worth your time in my humbble opinion. This game generated a lot of hype, but I think it's just overrated - people say it's good and feel it's good just because they read on Gamespot or IGN that it's good, and those sites get payed for their reviews.4/10			"

												The few hours I spent playing this game were painstaking. There was absolutely no redeeming factor to the fact that the combat was bland and there was nothing fun about this game. The first class I picked, some sort of stealthy assassin rogue-like class, was apparently so underpowered that it was completely unplayable. It took me 15 minutes to find a friendly player to tell me that that class is practically unplayable because you can't even kill the beginning monsters. I had thought I was doing something wrong. Apparently, the interesting classes need someone to heal them 24/7 and their attacks are weak. The rest of the classes, as far as I could tell, were the generic Warrior/Mage, etc. classes.  Already off to a rough start, I find out there is a subscription (ugh, what is this, Club Penguin?) and that there are also microtransactions and starter packs between $40 and $150.Quite honestly, this game could easily be worse than most RPGs. It's unbalanced classes, money-eating methods, and absolutely NO exciting things about the game leave it to be just another generic piece of crap designed to eat your money. I know this may sound a bit extreme, but without anything to redeem this game from all the bad stuff, what can be said to be good about it?If you're looking for an RPG, try anything but this. Now that I think about it, I think I found more good things in Bad Rats than I did in this game.2/10, generic RPG, don't waste your time			"

												Graphics are good, game mechanics are good, community is good and the fact that you can puchase extensions/dlc with in game cash is good. I like the Rifts, and in big area events, where dozens to hundreds of people fight together some bigger than life enemy. I've played WoW from vanilla to WoTLK, countless hours. I played Guild Wars 2, 4charcs to 80 and then some. I've tried Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, LoTR Online, Secret World, Perfect World, Rusty Hearts, TERA, etc. But RIFT is still my all time favourite. Thank god there is variety, so if this is not your cup of tea, you can try something else :)			"

												I only recently attached Rift to Steam but I have WELL over 1,000 hours into this game, so I guess I can speak on it.  I do think you can play this game as a F2P game but like anything else if you want the extras then you have to pay - the company has to make a living too.  I personally pay to be a patron monthly and think it's very reasonable and worth it for what you can included.  I would recommend trying the game and seeing what you think and then giving patron's a shot if you like it enough.  I like as much or maybe even more than WoW.  Pros:- Dynamic boss battles.- Fun dungeons and quite a few of them- Very nice graphics.- Always something to work towards and quite different than a lot of the other mmo's out there.  This gives you a great variety of ways to go for leveling your character as well.  - TONS of end of world content!- Very good raid content.- You can transfer to other shards for free.  So, if your friend is in another place, that is fine - just transfer over.  There is also an in-game option that allows you to play with other people who are in other shards without any fuss at all.  This is VERY handy.  Cons:- Sometimes a bit glitchy, but Trion always works it out and makes it up to their customers eventually- PVP is decent but not as good as WoW.- Armor design could be a little better - could use more variety.  But still decent.  - They nickle and dime you on the really nice mounts.  However, you can get a normal mount without having to put real money into it, so it comes down to a vanity thing.  - This game might not be the best for a person who wants to play solo.  There are a lot of almost forced situations in which you really need to group up with people to complete a task.  If you are ok with just randomly grouping and then going your seperate way then you'll be fine.			"

You can have 6-7 bags i think, but you can only have 3 slots unlocked w/o paying loyalty. Vendors sell some items for either loyalty or in-game money and you CAN'T EVEN SELL ITEMS USING HE ♥♥♥♥ING AUCTION HOUSE IF YOU DON'T PAY LOYALTY(i didn't get myself to an AH, but that's what i read from other players in forums).So, fine game, but the fact that you can't use all ur item slots and AH for free in a FREE TO PLAY GAME, makes this game 1/10 for me.

First expert dungeon, got kicked by some very busy guys because of my dps (rusty on the rotations and all, but sill good for an expert).Ok. Trying some PvP. nearly one shoted by a pyromancer, the numbers on the health bars and on the dps meter are kinda depressing. Very well. I start to remember why i left this game.Checking my currencies, my reputations and stuff, i realize that im going for the same old repetitive frustrating grind if i stay. ok. Alt F4. Then, i reopen the game, log in on a lvl 35 rogue, and start queing for some pvp. I have always found low level pvp extremely fun, mostly because once you understand what build and what stuff is godlike at certain levels, then you just walk on the maps slaughtering anyone who did not, and have some cool fights against more prepared people.So i wait 30 minutes, get into a match. Ok 20/2 cool will be fun. Queue for another wait 7 hours (really 7 hours), alt f4 another time, unistalling the game this time. Bye rift.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! PVE IS EASY MODE no CHALLANGE you can easily beat it without gear; items you craft dont effect the out come of ANYTHING. i.e. potion buffs or heals potions wether you used them or not doesnt change out come of encounters. PVE further is a ghost town, you will never find anyone doing quests. PVP can be fun, however TRION can care less about balance, they have all the dps k/d data for YEARS and still encourage only ROGUE DPS or Inferno classes, which you will see 75% rogues then kinda a mix of everything else, considering the dozens of class combinations, that is REALLY SAD. Tanks are useless unless you are doing PVE and even then you can do all the dungeons primarily with your eyes closed.  ITS A GAME OF DOING THINGS JUST TO DO THEM, WHAT YOU ACTUALLY END UP DOING IS BASED ON WHAT IS THE LEAST BORING< NOT WHAT IS THE MOST FUN!!!			"

												Pay2Win gear clearance for any gear and appropriate slots have turned me off to this game. You can either pay 900 platinum (a lot) of in game currency for the access, get 100000 void stones for it, (3 weeks worth since theres a weekly cap of 47000 and you gain less than 50 at a time) or you can give Trion 25 dollars for it. (defeating the purpose of F2P)You were supposed to get me, a returning player, back into the game by offering my new features, places to go, and things to do until I hit level 65. By then Id be back into the game enough to where I wouldnt be bothered by something like that. But you cant seriously expect me to instantly dump a bunch of money into something I cant experience at all just on a whim. How am I supposed to get hooked back into the game when the first quest in the game offers me a level 59 quest reward item that REQUIRES THIS CLEARANCE. Right off the effing bat. Im not grinding for 3 weeks for it, nor am I shelling out money for it. And since I dont have that kind of platinum, Im uninstalling this game again for the 3rd time. The first time was before it was even on Steam, the second time was a year ago when I got bored, and this third time is within an hour of playing it again because of the realization that Im instantly behind a money wall as soon as I try to quest in the new area.

People will tell you the game starts at max level 60..for some that may be true. this game is a grinders wet dream. there are similar differences than world of warcraft you will find that in chat all the time comparing this game to WoW but in my personal experience have played WoW and got to lvl 14 and got bored and quit....i've been playing rift since beta 3 and haven't been bored once. The PvP is amazing. the graphics are amazing. i love this game			"

												I gave this game a fair chance, but I must say I disliked it. I played for a hour or so and just got bored. The game was repititive and kind of boring. Charactor creation was donep nicely like with Elder Scrolls Online. The game was strangely configured in my opinion. Enemies didn't really act agressive to me until I stabbed them or there was a prompt to. I just couldn't get a good experience out of this game. I really looked forward to and wanted to play it but it was as good as the sun on a stick.			"

												PVP is kinda dominated by only a few classe & really depends on what gears you have. Mages here are quite useless, not the highest dps & as all classes can have a soul build for healing, not much of an advantage in wars or dungeons. This is actually quite a nice game. Nice scenery. But the mechanics are quite repetitive & boring. Worse, the community is dying.   "

So if you liked WoW you will like this game. ___They do have a really good F2P model you can buy in game items through micro transactions but not P2W.

												RIFT is an amazing game for WoW transitioners or MMORPG gamers alike. It has all the similar elements of raid events, group bosses, and various quests and tasks for you to do so that you're never really bored playing RIFT. The graphics are a bit outdated but by preference it matches the theme of the game itself. The gameplay is smooth and always action packed, although skill and pet effects may be a bit lacking.Overall, I definitely would recommend this game to anyone, first time and veteran MMORPG gamers.

												This is a really good game. The server are filled with very nice people and there are many guilds to choose from. There is a huge welcoming world, well not welcoming. It also has a cool skill changing system. I highly recommend the game. But when there is a good side there is a bad. The quests don't really help you find what you look for. It is easy to lvl but there is always a boss in the fields that you need to go kill. The armies of mosters are endless and will over run you if not careful. Not a lot of dungeons to clear, and the ones that there is are too hard for lvl 15 below. Its a good game but if you want to pull off Kirito, well you need to train hard and get your lvl up. Other then that don't kill the dear. 7/10			"

												""Beauty is only skin deep."" That is how this game felt like.Seeking for a new MMORPG to play, I saw this game's trailer and was attracted to it. I started to download it and was surprised that it was over 18GB and thought that it must be really awesome. After the download, there was a patch that was over 13GB so I became impatient and was like, ""This better be good."" Then after gruesome hours of waiting, I was able to enter the character creation (which was unimpressive), and was finally in-game.So first look, the game is visually good (just visually though). I ran around, explored and quested for several hours and this is what I have observed:1.) The game is too passive and lacking- I can't believe this was released in 2011 and it still plays out like an incomplete game today with little to no scenario and AI. It feels like those custom made warcraft maps in the works where only the terrain and units were layed out and has nothing much else to offer. Mobs are just standing all over the place or roaming all over the place with almost no purpose. There are a lot of things you can see and interact with that seems to have no significance at all.2.) Poor mechanics and balance-Special mobs or bosses, don't seem any different from the regular ones, just higher hp. Character's normal attacks are almost negligible, skills suck, your hp goes down almost the same rate as whatever it is your fighting then you regen everything so quickly after being out of combat for some time. Potions felt so irrelevant, you get mobbed by two enemies of same level, you use one, not so much hp recovered and the cooldown is so slow you just die unless you run, good thing the system is so undeveloped that if you just run with low hp you'll survive somehow because all of the nearby mobs just ignore you. They say dynamic battles in their site, but i don't see anything dynamic at all even in their videos.3.) The interface and controls are not so user friendly- This is the first time in my whole gaming history where it took me quite a lot of time to figure out how to navigate and use the interfaces. Equipping, buying, selling, etc. everything was just ugh.. not so convenient and the game heavily relied on right-clicking for no good reason.4.) Unattractive and unamusing character 3D models- For a game that looks so grandiose with a folder size of 37.5GB, it is just so sad that the character model's designs and movement are so mediocre and generic. Aside from the disappointing character creation options, I went in to battle just to find out how lame these models move. I can't believe that I was already using or chaining skills with what I was seeing, as they were not so far off from looking like a normal attack.5.) Lots of features and game elements- This game has a lot of content: multiclass characters, mounts, fishing, crafting, cooking, alchemy, blacksmithing, rifts, bigass bosses, etc. Aside from the visuals, this was the only other good thing about it. The system was just so bad despite being a non-beta game that I spent most of my gaming hours just fishing instead.In conclusion, this game is such a waste. It has a lot of good concepts thrown into it that you just don't see or feel being projected in-game. If they can rework and improve their system, then it can probably be one of those games with ultra large communities that last for years.			"

												What rift did rightRift when it first came out made WoW fans angry saying its a rip of of wow, And at the base it is but it works in its favor. This is a List of what Rift did right that WoW should of done or did.1. Basing/Ripping off WoW: This might seem like the games bigest weakness but instead its also its greatist thing. They looked at wow and said this work the way the classes are set up and the 2 sides fighting wow fighting a bigger evil. They made this its base, It at the core WoW. but theres more then just that2. improved Graphics: I know this is simple but the game looks good.3. Charter Creation: The Charter Cration makes wow look like♥♥♥♥♥♥ It only needs more races. You can really customize a charter. And there are a lot of class options that break down from 4 simpler classes. And also custom armor, sy you have really good armor but you think it looks ugly, you can put other armor on top of it so you look cool but still kick♥♥♥♥♥3. less over sextualzing women. Instead of less covered up better armor its the other way (atleast from what I seen) at the start your like in a bikini, but as you play more it covers you more still keeping you sexy.4. F2P. ever wonder what WoW would be like F2P this is it, just like wow only no meber ship and the DLC is optional like wow. Member Ship is optional though for bonuses.Keep in Mind Am reviewing this game only from a few hours of game play because it I was really enjoy my self am sure theres more to come. (sorry no spell check) well see you all next time on my next game review!			"

												This truly is what I think MMORPG's Should be, and the fact that everythings free and earnable IN GAME makes it amazing. So many MMO's have forever had a sorta Pay 2 Win System, where most of the things you need you had to pay real money. BUT NOT THIS GAME this game blows that away and truly makes you work for your reward. No player is better than the other because of IRL Money purchases, and anyone can become strong and become a hero. Trion really knows how to make their MMO's And I recommend you get this game because everything is literally in reach for you in this game.			"

												Normally it takes me about 30 minutes to get into a game and really start enjoying it but it has to catch my attention right away. I am an avid RPG player and enjoy the thrill of leveling a charecter to fruition and exploring strange places, meeting new people and trying to be the best there is.What I found with Rift was a horrible user interface coupled with poor AI, poor graphics, and no tutorial on how to play. The developers obviously are attempting to ride the fame of World Of Warcraft with this title and did a tragic job of doing so. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone for any reason and I have promptly uninstalled it never to touch it again.			"

												Best F2P MMO out there feels just as good as WOW but you dont have to pay monthly, alot grinding to be done to get best gear at start but enough to keep you busy. Great little Minion adventures you can use that will reward you loot/artifacts and more.Enjoy the Dimensions aspect where you can Build your own Safe Haven where others can visit and see, loads of variety in items to use and manipulate to make it as you want.Will say this only downfall i see in it as from this point is as a F2P Player you can not Create AUCTIONS, although doesnt look like you have to spend much to gain that ability just a bit annoying.

												I started playing Rift a few years ago when it first was released from Trion as a subscription game and I fell in love with the game right away. It reminded me of World of Warcraft but had a very different feel at the same time.  I enjoyed creating my characters and those first moments into the game when you have to learn the environment and game play. The music... It's nostalgic.  I really don't care for the pvp aspect of this game, but I do enjoy the different environmental changes with rifts and all of the different mobs & bosses you can kill.   ""Transmog & garrisons""  to those familiar with World of Warcraft, were present in Rift first.  Another thing I really liked about Rift was solving puzzles.   Even though its an MMORPG, I pretty much decided to completely go solo with this game. I didn't join any guilds, I don't play with friends. I solo Rifts.  I just like to get lost in the game.   The only thing I do not like is that the game has become FTP-free to play, and basically you have to pay for extras in game.			"

												Most underrated MMO.I played Rift in the beta and into launch, as well as over the course of its life (sis years now!). I can hands down say that it is one of the most in depth and engrossing games I've played. The content is rich and plentiful; the class system is my favourite of any MMO that I've played; the maps are well thought out and exciting; the quests are engaging; the player and guild housing system is INSANE; the crafting is intriguing and worthwhile; and maybe best of all, the community is fantastic. Not only is Rift beautiful, but it's fun as hell and very addicting. Love Rift and definitely recommend it!			"

												So, I'm not a vetran of this game as you can tell by my hours, but I have 2 issues for this game 1 of which will more likely to apply to you, so first of all, the game is pretty well done, has a pretty good concept and has some good lore overall it is a great game, but my 2 issues are, 1. glyph, when I was getting into this game rift updated, no biggie, but the glyph login wanted me to type in a password to logon after the update, it was sent to my email, no biggie, however for about 2 months glyph wouldnt let me type in the code, like then entire program wouldnt let me interact with anything on it, cant type, press any buttons, copy paste etc. and yes I tried relaunching it, closing steam, restarting my comp, most of the things you would do if you had a similar problem, however, it eventually fixed itself, somehow, I don't know how, but it did, so good job, my other issue is you almost need a diverse team to play, at least for the first while, because, during the dungeons, if we didnt have a good tema, then we were ♥♥♥♥ed, however, with a team it's great, honestly though the game is great, I personally didn't like it too much, but I would recommend a friend this game, so, yeah, sorry for rambling on things that might not be relevant anymore			"

												Something that I have to say about this is that it pretty much stands in its own pedistole. It's fun for a while until you realize that almost, if not all, players in the game bought their gear with microtransactions. Therefore making it a bit Pay-2-Win. The game is complete Free-2-Play and releases frequent updates and patches. Pros:- Amazing graphics for an MMORPG- Great PvP- Free-2-play- Frequent Updates- Great community- Best parties/dungeon raidings I've seen in an MMORPG yet- Amazing EnviromentCons:- Pay-2-Win- MicrotransactionsOverall, if you're a fan of the MMORPG genre, then this is a must play game.

												Hello,My system specs are: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2Ghz, 4 Gb of RAM and with an Nvidia GeForce 430 GT @ 1024 Mb of video memory. At this point some might say ""congrats you have the minimum specs""... but in reality that is not the case.Yes, you can play the game with the minimum specs but don`t except it to be a decent game play, lets just call it a bit of crawling with some nice action from the quests. I know i have only 2,1 hours of play, but that was plenty of time to see that sometimes minimum specs just wont cut it.If you don`t have money to spend on WoW, then RIFT is what you need (as others said before me). At this point i recommend this game, but if you want some sort of smooth experience, don`t play it unless you have a PC that is ABOVE the minimum specs required.			"

												If you want a really good review I would head over to mmo-grinder and check out the 40 min episode that goes over in detail the qualities, innovations, and ideologies of the game for better or worse. There is a lot of good in the game and it's faults are nothing dramatic. The bag space issue for f2p accounts can be pretty obnoxious but considering some of the greed machines out there like swotor, and omfg evolve (I know it's not an mmo but freaking for real) they set a pretty good baseline for thier business mod.The games best innovation is really based around their soul system (talents, traits, or whatever) that really allow you to customize your playstyle to where your almost designing your own class. Min-maxer nazi's will abound but the options to work outside a cookie build are really pretty amazing.Please understand that though steam lists me as 40+ hours I am probably closer to 1000 as I only recently began using steam to handle the game.

												Rift is an excellent first mmo for anyone and a nice relief for WoW veterans. the class system is creative and lets you make a ton of different combinations. the rifts are a nice touch and to tell you the truth i didnt think i would care much for them. the rifts add a sense of urgency and unity in the community and offer decent rewards. the graphics in and outside of rifts are just short of top notch. extremely tiny bits of lags but other than that no technical problems to speak of. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants all the good of a traditional mmo with a twist for fun.			"

												Personally, i can't reccomend this game. Atleast not to anyone with an average graphics card, or someone who's played things like Fable 3. I was dissapointed in this game, i think. It took me 3 days to download all the patches, all the updates, EVERYTHING. And then i was excited about the character creator, thinking ""Oh, this looks like a good game! I'll spend 15 minutes creating a really good looking character and then play the game!""Oh if only i knew.First of all, it controls like a tank. Making A and D move your perspective? NO THANK YOU! I'd rather use the mouse for that!Second of all, CAMERA ANGLES. This game is full of awful camera angles, and when i was being attacked, I COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHERE I WAS GOING!And that's another thing. In the beginning of this game, EVERYONE LOOKS THE SAME. Why bother having Humans on the Defiant side if theres Humans on the Guardian's side AS WELL? And maybe that would be fine if there were mostly demons (Or whatever they're called) On the Defiant side, but NOOO! OF COURSE the defiant side is just FULL of humans! I couldn't even get to the second mission, finding some chick named daria or something, without getting lost and ending up on the Guardian's side, and I couldn't even tell they were Guardians before they started ATTACKING ME FROM ALL SIDES.And lastly, the graphics sucked for me. It might just be my graphics card, or maybe the game is just THAT OLD. But you could have atleast tried to fix it.In the end, all i got out of this game was that the character creator was fun.While it lasted.			"

												   Rift is a fun to play MMO. Especially for a title that had made the move to a free to play game. I think Trion has done well with the store integration and the game it still very playable to the level cap even if you don’t pay for a thing. I have played many MMO titles free and paid and have found Rift to be one of the more enjoyable.    I have seen complaints from others of how Rift has become a pay to win game, they have broken the PVP system or the game is full of bugs. I personally have seen nothing in these regards that would cause me to have any complaint. Yes, the store is full of items and such that I would call “stupid expensive.” I remind myself that the people who buy these items are helping to make the game free and I can just work for something for a bit and still get good and powerful items if I have a little patience. However I did buy one of the expansion packs and felt it was well justified as it had many useful items and I have no subscription to worry about. As for people complaining about PVP all I have to say in response is I suck at PVP so it is broken in every game for me, I am missing nothing on this front, lol. As far as bugs go, I have experienced a few crashes and glitches in the game but no more so than many other games I have played. I have not had a glitch or crash that has caused me anything more than the minor annoyance of waiting for about a minute to get back to doing what I was doing.    Over all I find my experience of Rift to be quite enjoyable. Before starting to play Rift when it became a free to play game I had considered going back to WOW, but I am glad I gave Rift the chance. It is just as much fun, has more story, I die just as much in PVP, and I don’t have to pay costly subscription. "

												RIFT is a GREAT free-to-play MMORPG comparable to World of Warcraft but with several advantages, like many more classes (known as Souls) and of course the lack of subscription.RIFT is clunky in some areas such as animations and hotbar bloating, but most of these issues are minor nuisances rather than a game breaker.For a quick overview of the game, including pros and cons, feel free to check out the video below:http://youtu.be/Fdz1wDGorhY?list=PLklrkLw7j3VRjVPlrlF4tNcvFfmNewO6r "

												I came back into the game after a long break, had all classes level 65,  T1 raid gear on all, ready to try to get back into it. First expert dungeon, got kicked by some very busy guys because of my dps (rusty on the rotations and all, but sill good for an expert).Ok. Trying some PvP. nearly one shoted by a pyromancer, the numbers on the health bars and on the dps meter are kinda depressing. Very well. I start to remember why i left this game.Checking my currencies, my reputations and stuff, i realize that im going for the same old repetitive frustrating grind if i stay. ok. Alt F4. Then, i reopen the game, log in on a lvl 35 rogue, and start queing for some pvp. I have always found low level pvp extremely fun, mostly because once you understand what build and what stuff is godlike at certain levels, then you just walk on the maps slaughtering anyone who did not, and have some cool fights against more prepared people.So i wait 30 minutes, get into a match. Ok 20/2 cool will be fun. Queue for another wait 7 hours (really 7 hours), alt f4 another time, unistalling the game this time. Bye rift.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! PVE IS EASY MODE no CHALLANGE you can easily beat it without gear; items you craft dont effect the out come of ANYTHING. i.e. potion buffs or heals potions wether you used them or not doesnt change out come of encounters. PVE further is a ghost town, you will never find anyone doing quests. PVP can be fun, however TRION can care less about balance, they have all the dps k/d data for YEARS and still encourage only ROGUE DPS or Inferno classes, which you will see 75% rogues then kinda a mix of everything else, considering the dozens of class combinations, that is REALLY SAD. Tanks are useless unless you are doing PVE and even then you can do all the dungeons primarily with your eyes closed.  ITS A GAME OF DOING THINGS JUST TO DO THEM, WHAT YOU ACTUALLY END UP DOING IS BASED ON WHAT IS THE LEAST BORING< NOT WHAT IS THE MOST FUN!!!			"

												This game is by far THE BEST mmo experience I have ever had in my life. The client lets you play almost immediately as you start downloading. There is little to no wait at all. The graphics are beautiful. The land is strange and exotic. The characters and classes are cool and less cliche. The map works like a dream. I have absolutely nothing to complain about. The only suggestion I could make is that the user interface allow an option to download the game slowly in the background, about 4KB/sec like Lord of the Rings Online allows in its settings.			"

												This game has changed over the years. Things like p2w, but it still is a great game. You still have all the quest that were there from level 1-50 and some new ones. 51-65 more game play don't complain. Yes somethings you can't get stuff without paying. But i had this game for years I even have it on a disc. And i had fun working for a lot of my stuff. For gods sake people this game was pay mouthly when it came out. Think of it like this. You don't need to by **** this game used to cost money just to play. So i say it is a great game and everyone should try it. Thank you if you read this ;)			"

												This is a very fun game. Me and my friends are always online together. There is so much you can do on the game that it doesn't get old. There are always quests to do, instant adventures, and PVP battles. Only complaints I have is that many of the more useful items to buy from the shops are bought with platinum which takes a while to earn. My tip is to play the instant adventures. It is the quickest way that I have found to earn platinum fast. They also have a different currency on the game dedicated to those who have put their own money into it. There are lots of items and such that you cannot buy from the store unless you pay with money. Bummer but its a free game so I expected it in the first place. It doesn't effect the gameplay any and the game is just as fun and addicting whether you decide to put your own money in it or not. Also it doesn't give certain players an advantage over one another just because they use money and not in game currency, which is nice. I have found that trying to get into a PVP warfront is difficult if you are a lower level and i have had wait times to get in to be extremely long. Overall I love the game and I would highly recommend it.			"

												This game is VERY good. The learning curve is much higher than WoW's with many elements of design to progress your character however the main mechanics and interface is very similar. The free-to-play format is quite good even with that element of pay-to-win staring you in the face, though it is not necessary. You may find many hours spilling into this game based on good quest lines and dungeon/raid designs. The community is quite large and finding people to play with in this huge world is never a problem. Many of the player base has in fact played World of Warcraft at some time or still does. The game is power hungry on cpu/gpu so if you got it, be prepared to enjoy some of the best visuals in this MMORPG. Kudos to the Trion team for support and continued design and expansion of this superb title!			"

Its Graphics are beautiful and the Story is Awesome in my Opinion, The game has 3 Races to choose to! Dwarves, Elves and Of course Humans. Also the choice of choosing the Guardians or Defiants, Both Factions need a hero and that person is you. I would Recommend this to any RPG lovers.Best one i've played so far. 10/10			"

												Okay so I fortunatly played this game awhile ago and had a lot of fun with it. However, I recently tried to play and to no avail. Glyph, the scorge of launchers, absolutely ruins the game. Glyph launcher is absolutely riddled with bugs. I personally was unable to log in to my old account so I tried making another account. This was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥as Trion's website barely ever responds and constatly times out. However, when I evenutally created my new account i went to sign in on Glyph's launcher... I was given ""2024 error message"" which currently has no easy fix. I then found a large work around for this god awful bug the game would never patch as I received a plethora of other errors. Searched all night on Trion's unresponsive website to contact customer support and no email has been found to this day... shame was actually one of fun MMOs. Well here I come Neverwinter.			"

												This game is starting to show its age and is only fun if you don't mind playing a game with friends that hasn't innovated beyond WoW, with it's grinding and 1-9 rotation combat system.I feel this game only has so many positive reviews because it was good when it first came out and it has a fair business model. There are many lesser known MMOs out there that are more innovative and engaging, for example, neverwinter, mortal online and defiance.ProsIt's free to play and there's no paywalls or microtransactions to hinder you.Community is generally nice and helpful.Playing with friends casually is good to pass the time but don't expect engaging quests, combat or storyline.ConsCamera movement is tied with character movement. Come on,  it's 2015.Camera is wonky at times, going near a wall makes the camera zoom in so you can't see anything BUT the wall.Combat is not engaging and is a case of rotating spells until the enemy dies.Graphics starting to age.

												One of the few games I can keep coming back to, which makes it one of the better MMO's out there.There is so much freedom, character creation wise, you can either go with a pre-made skill tree, or you can put one together yourself, I've found myself to do this more frequently, not one character I make is the same, ever, this keeps it interesting, not to mention I can unlock more if I ever find the desire to spend the money to unlock it with, not yet though, there's still much to explore without spending a dime!I've spent about 10 Euro as I'm writing this, and compared to a lot of the games I've played, time/money ratio is excellent,¨(I am an extremely patient player, so this may vary from person to person) So even if this is a F2P game now, don't be afraid of spending a little cash, unlike some games, what  you buy stays with you, so you don't get screwed over and feel like you're being punished with a ""demo"" once you quit paying. I'm looking at you, DDO, LoTRO and you other little ninjas hanging out there.One complaint though, it's way too easy, with the group I frequently play with, not even well geared, we can handle dungeons undermanned, we can solo rifts meant for a standard group, it's actually one of the reasons I never play this game longer than a month or two at a time, before having to take a break again, as there's no real challenge, it can't be right that I can tank an entire boss as a mage without getting hurt. I hear this was very different before it became F2P, why it would change for the worse, I don't really understand, mass appeal for the casual gamers out there perhaps?There's a few features that I'd like to see implemented:- Being able to play music, I was once a very loyal LoTRO player, and there was nothing better than freestyling on a lute for me, in my house.- Lotteries, chance to win ingame cash, mounts, pets, cosmetics as long as you sign up from the marketplace perhaps.- Actual challenges, I hate fighting a boss and suddenly seeing 50+ people taking them down in a matter of minutes when it was supposed to be difficult - force their damage to event related bosses, to be lowered perhaps? Anything?Also, it seems to be headed in the direction of WoW, where you can win by simply rolling your head on the keyboard, please don't do that, it's the reason I quit playing that game (back when you could only be level 40 or so).- I'd love to see more races with more unique traits, it doesn't seem like that anything you pick will ever really be more than a simple convenience for you at times, where most of it only functions out of combat, or makes such a little difference that simple looks wins the battle over practicality, and doesn't even deserve a spot on your hotkey bar after you reach up high in the levels.- Fix the auction, I'm at that point in the game where I don't care if I buy one thing for 2 platimum one day, and 32 for the same thing another day, simply because I make so much that money has lost its value to me entirely. There is no sense of consequence about frivelous spending whatsoever.- Progress is too fast and ""linear"", from the time I started I feel like I could max everything out in no time at all, on top of that, once you've played through the first time, you find yourself rushing things because there's only a few different paths you can take before you've played every single mission and storyline, add a little more factions, areas, rivalry between factions (meaning you won't be loved by everyone in the end, add consequence and critical thinking!!)- Add more variety to the adventures, they stay fun for 5 minutes, then you start seeing the same pattern repeating itself over and over, this makes me quit, repetition is a game killer.All that being said, I enjoy this game more than most, it just needs that little kick to actually keep me in the seat more than what it does, and it's a sure winner in my book.

												summery:is this game pay to win or pay to play? nocan u get everything in game without paying money? yescan u get equipment from the store?yes, but equipment that is mostly uselessis game dead? in old world zones it may look so but once u get to 60-65, nodo i need dlcs? trion doesnt know the real defenation of DLC(downloadable content) anything called dlc is actually either vanity items or things u can buy in game++++++++++++++p2p,p2w:recently there has been changes to patron system which brings up the question wheter the game is p2w/p2p, the answer is no, while some of the perks that made the game a bit easier are gone and are patron only now u can play the game without spending a single penny, in fact u can buy patron in game , u just need to farm a bit, im not talking about heavy grinding but spend 1h a day in game trying to make plat(money) either by collecting mats or by soloing old instances and u will be able to collect enough currency though u might jnot want to spend them on patron early on cause there are other important things like soul packs and earrings to spend them on.well if u consider paying for unlocking some basic things in game like earrrings(that u wont even need before level 65 and then u can easily farm enough plat to get them) p2p, then u r wrong, i havent played GW2 personally but from what ive heard u need to spend money to enter some of the zones and in fact u need to pay in order to level up past some point, now thats called p2p, meanwhile in rift u can access everything and even buy them in game(except for a few vanity items)though i will be honest i hate the fact that u need to spend credit on boxes in order to get some of the cooler mounts, i rly hate thatbuying equipment:well u can get all the equipment in game and the equipment that u can buy is not as good as the gear dropped from the bosses of the same tier,and u can also buy them with in game currencies,but they are only usefull for filling slots, but hey thats not the point,point is the current raid standard is T3 but you can only buy T2 with credit and u need to spend in game currency in order to get T3, another nice thing to point out is, there is only 10~15% bonus currency for patrons or the guys that are using boosts, u cant get more than that for the current max tierraiding:in order to raid u need achivment, is what some ppl thinkif u dont have achivments fear not, just look for progression raids, there are many guilds/groups that want to give raids a try but dont have enough ppl, u can always join them, or alternativly  u can join a guild.there are many perks for joining a guild like bonus currency and your guildmates(depending on the guild u joined) probably wont mind helping u gear up and might even craft u stuff and most of them dont mind helping u with getting into raids.PVP:can be a pain but can be fun at the same time, there are maps for 10to 20 ppl and unlike moba games u r not a hero, if u think u can just go in and kill enemy u r mistaken,yes u might be able to single a few of them out but if u act reclessly u r dead,healing and support are way more important than they are in moba games, and given class system in this game(soul tree) u dont know what u r facing, someone might have enough health to be a tank but might be a tank/healer hybridso does gear mean u r awsome? well i,as a mage, have been killed by too many lower geared assaasins and have also killed many guys that out gear me, i would say the way u play your calss/soul is more important than gears,though due to nerfs some of the souls might not be a good choice for pvp nowadays, like warlock(r.i.p)why do i love this game(pros):+wardrobe: well u can run around naked as a tank and be immortal, or u can wear heavy plate as a rogue+soul system: unlike other games u can switch between healer,tank,support or damage dealer at a moments notice(well at least wwhen u r not fighting) and can do them all with any calling(mage,cleric, warrior and rogue) that u r using, of course each of them is unique in its own way, mage healers need to actually attack their enemies to heal their friends and they can summon undead as a necromancer while rogues have to sumon beasts+macros:dont have enough fingers for pushing all thoes buttons? use a macro, u can find them on net or easily make them yourself+dynamic world+crafting+community+dimensions: well i got lost in alabiranth that our guild master made and took 2h to finish it and then my senpai said that i have only found one ending and i haven found the real ending plus the bonus, spent 1~2 hours more to find the hidden content and damn they were hidden well, u have to give this whole dimension thing a trycons:-well as a non patron u can only quene for random warfronts(pvp maps) and dungeons,though u can ask a friend who is a patron to help u with them-sometimes u wont be able to understand what the quest or story is about-mounts in boxes, i hate thoes			"

												I only started playing MMO's about a year ago.  I have tried out a whole bunch - and while there are many that I like (Guild Wars 2 is great) - RIFT is definitely my favorite.  Like most other MMOs - there is a huge story and world to explore.  Unlike most other MMOs - if I just feel like letting off steam on a Friday night, there is always something to do.  Instant Adventures, Nightmare Rifts and Zone Events always keep me coming back.			"

												If you love fantasy RPG games, RIFT is definitely worth giving a try.Like any online game there are microtransactions it's true, but at the time of this review all the areas of the game can be played for free, which is more than can be said for many online games. Don't let the people crying that it's pay-to-win deter you from giving this one a try. Even though it's a MMORPG and has the expected multiplayer activities, the PvE world is indeed an entire world to explore, far more massive than what you find in any single-player RPG that I've ever seen. The fantasy world is very creatively crafted with interesting areas to explore, some of which even defy the laws of physics. I strongly recommend giving RIFT a try.			"

												My favorite aspects of this game are the achievements and collecting of artifacts and sets. I also like the ability to have costume sets over your actual armor, allowing you to focus on getting the best armor pieces for your character without having to worry about what it actually looks like. I love the different mounts and the events and holiday content. I feel like most mmos are mainly the same with quests basically requiring you to grind, but the little things in this game are what keeps me coming back, that and the graphics and world is beautiful. I also love the realms you can aquire and costumize.			"

												RIFT!!! Everyone then scrambles to get themselves together , mounting and running across maps and get in on the kills of creatures breaking forth from a portal busting/tearing through reality for epic loot and rewards. Thats this game. A RPG MMO with a style and theme that runs with a very in depth fantastic storyline. The world of Telara is pretty much in ruin by a bad guy sorceror evil evil guy. His names Regulas, charismatic with followers and evil evilness. No one can seem to defeat him and the 2 factions Defiant and Guardains are just as much at war with each other as with Regulas. So with crazy ancient technology that is very artistic and themed throughout this game. Kinda reminds me of Stargate SG-1 stuff, create the ascended with souls and this crazy technology steampunk stuff. Thats you, an ascended and off to character creation and off to the story line of grooming yourself to go back in time to kill Regulas for your faction and save Telara. YAY. Factions of Guardians ( chosen of the gods) or Defiants ( we got this bro) is more of race selection. Guardians have humans, elfs and dwarfs. Defiants have humans, elfs and bahmi. Bahmi are the games created race and seem orcish spiritual brutes. So with that there is classes-Warrior, cleric , mage, rogue. SIMPLE? no. this is where RIFT brings more to the custimizable table. True you have a class, but for each class you choose 3 soul trees out of a large list of souls. Each souls tree brings a very specific playing style, abilities, skills. So mix/match what you want to do as your chosen class with 3 soul trees. There are lots of souls, you can change the souls according to role or gear or w/e AT ANY POINT OF THE GAME. You can definantly be so custimizable with your class its nuts. Its fun. Warrior that has a warrior pet? yes. Rogue with a bow that heals? yes. So with the possibilities endless and the freedom to do it. DO IT. Thus then you play the game, like I said going back in time to prep yourself for the coming battle against Regulas for honor of your faction.  Aspects of the game of equipment and class upgrading is typical of RPGMMOs. Points and better gear and abilities and such while leveling doing quests/missions and grinding. Crafting is about the same of choose what fits your class or what you want to do and do as follows to get better. Armorcrafting, runecrafting, outfitting and such. Fishing and survivialism everyone has and starts off with . They are nice ''food eating health buffs'' and time killing crafting. Higher levels is higher rewards, but harder to craft. Fun and rewarding.  This game has 2 neat little aspects of minnions and demensions. Minnions are little creatures that you collect and send off to do quests to gather stuff ( crafting stuff) for you and level up and Dimensions are little homemade houses and areas you collect decor on  and make your own. These have become the new standerd of RPGMMOs, Rift does fill that void and does a good job implementing their own style and theme into it.  oh and yes, .... RIFTS?! are little portal/tears in reality that element specific creatures do spawn out of, and show up randomly, accessable to anybody and when shut down through waves/stages you get epic gear and loot. trust me, you want in on them whenever/whereever possible. its the game. its fun.

												One of the few games I can keep coming back to, which makes it one of the better MMO's out there.There is so much freedom, character creation wise, you can either go with a pre-made skill tree, or you can put one together yourself, I've found myself to do this more frequently, not one character I make is the same, ever, this keeps it interesting, not to mention I can unlock more if I ever find the desire to spend the money to unlock it with, not yet though, there's still much to explore without spending a dime!I've spent about 10 Euro as I'm writing this, and compared to a lot of the games I've played, time/money ratio is excellent,¨(I am an extremely patient player, so this may vary from person to person) So even if this is a F2P game now, don't be afraid of spending a little cash, unlike some games, what  you buy stays with you, so you don't get screwed over and feel like you're being punished with a ""demo"" once you quit paying. I'm looking at you, DDO, LoTRO and you other little ninjas hanging out there.One complaint though, it's way too easy, with the group I frequently play with, not even well geared, we can handle dungeons undermanned, we can solo rifts meant for a standard group, it's actually one of the reasons I never play this game longer than a month or two at a time, before having to take a break again, as there's no real challenge, it can't be right that I can tank an entire boss as a mage without getting hurt. I hear this was very different before it became F2P, why it would change for the worse, I don't really understand, mass appeal for the casual gamers out there perhaps?There's a few features that I'd like to see implemented:- Being able to play music, I was once a very loyal LoTRO player, and there was nothing better than freestyling on a lute for me, in my house.- Lotteries, chance to win ingame cash, mounts, pets, cosmetics as long as you sign up from the marketplace perhaps.- Actual challenges, I hate fighting a boss and suddenly seeing 50+ people taking them down in a matter of minutes when it was supposed to be difficult - force their damage to event related bosses, to be lowered perhaps? Anything?Also, it seems to be headed in the direction of WoW, where you can win by simply rolling your head on the keyboard, please don't do that, it's the reason I quit playing that game (back when you could only be level 40 or so).- I'd love to see more races with more unique traits, it doesn't seem like that anything you pick will ever really be more than a simple convenience for you at times, where most of it only functions out of combat, or makes such a little difference that simple looks wins the battle over practicality, and doesn't even deserve a spot on your hotkey bar after you reach up high in the levels.- Fix the auction, I'm at that point in the game where I don't care if I buy one thing for 2 platimum one day, and 32 for the same thing another day, simply because I make so much that money has lost its value to me entirely. There is no sense of consequence about frivelous spending whatsoever.- Progress is too fast and ""linear"", from the time I started I feel like I could max everything out in no time at all, on top of that, once you've played through the first time, you find yourself rushing things because there's only a few different paths you can take before you've played every single mission and storyline, add a little more factions, areas, rivalry between factions (meaning you won't be loved by everyone in the end, add consequence and critical thinking!!)- Add more variety to the adventures, they stay fun for 5 minutes, then you start seeing the same pattern repeating itself over and over, this makes me quit, repetition is a game killer.All that being said, I enjoy this game more than most, it just needs that little kick to actually keep me in the seat more than what it does, and it's a sure winner in my book.

												summery:is this game pay to win or pay to play? nocan u get everything in game without paying money? yescan u get equipment from the store?yes, but equipment that is mostly uselessis game dead? in old world zones it may look so but once u get to 60-65, nodo i need dlcs? trion doesnt know the real defenation of DLC(downloadable content) anything called dlc is actually either vanity items or things u can buy in game++++++++++++++p2p,p2w:recently there has been changes to patron system which brings up the question wheter the game is p2w/p2p, the answer is no, while some of the perks that made the game a bit easier are gone and are patron only now u can play the game without spending a single penny, in fact u can buy patron in game , u just need to farm a bit, im not talking about heavy grinding but spend 1h a day in game trying to make plat(money) either by collecting mats or by soloing old instances and u will be able to collect enough currency though u might jnot want to spend them on patron early on cause there are other important things like soul packs and earrings to spend them on.well if u consider paying for unlocking some basic things in game like earrrings(that u wont even need before level 65 and then u can easily farm enough plat to get them) p2p, then u r wrong, i havent played GW2 personally but from what ive heard u need to spend money to enter some of the zones and in fact u need to pay in order to level up past some point, now thats called p2p, meanwhile in rift u can access everything and even buy them in game(except for a few vanity items)though i will be honest i hate the fact that u need to spend credit on boxes in order to get some of the cooler mounts, i rly hate thatbuying equipment:well u can get all the equipment in game and the equipment that u can buy is not as good as the gear dropped from the bosses of the same tier,and u can also buy them with in game currencies,but they are only usefull for filling slots, but hey thats not the point,point is the current raid standard is T3 but you can only buy T2 with credit and u need to spend in game currency in order to get T3, another nice thing to point out is, there is only 10~15% bonus currency for patrons or the guys that are using boosts, u cant get more than that for the current max tierraiding:in order to raid u need achivment, is what some ppl thinkif u dont have achivments fear not, just look for progression raids, there are many guilds/groups that want to give raids a try but dont have enough ppl, u can always join them, or alternativly  u can join a guild.there are many perks for joining a guild like bonus currency and your guildmates(depending on the guild u joined) probably wont mind helping u gear up and might even craft u stuff and most of them dont mind helping u with getting into raids.PVP:can be a pain but can be fun at the same time, there are maps for 10to 20 ppl and unlike moba games u r not a hero, if u think u can just go in and kill enemy u r mistaken,yes u might be able to single a few of them out but if u act reclessly u r dead,healing and support are way more important than they are in moba games, and given class system in this game(soul tree) u dont know what u r facing, someone might have enough health to be a tank but might be a tank/healer hybridso does gear mean u r awsome? well i,as a mage, have been killed by too many lower geared assaasins and have also killed many guys that out gear me, i would say the way u play your calss/soul is more important than gears,though due to nerfs some of the souls might not be a good choice for pvp nowadays, like warlock(r.i.p)why do i love this game(pros):+wardrobe: well u can run around naked as a tank and be immortal, or u can wear heavy plate as a rogue+soul system: unlike other games u can switch between healer,tank,support or damage dealer at a moments notice(well at least wwhen u r not fighting) and can do them all with any calling(mage,cleric, warrior and rogue) that u r using, of course each of them is unique in its own way, mage healers need to actually attack their enemies to heal their friends and they can summon undead as a necromancer while rogues have to sumon beasts+macros:dont have enough fingers for pushing all thoes buttons? use a macro, u can find them on net or easily make them yourself+dynamic world+crafting+community+dimensions: well i got lost in alabiranth that our guild master made and took 2h to finish it and then my senpai said that i have only found one ending and i haven found the real ending plus the bonus, spent 1~2 hours more to find the hidden content and damn they were hidden well, u have to give this whole dimension thing a trycons:-well as a non patron u can only quene for random warfronts(pvp maps) and dungeons,though u can ask a friend who is a patron to help u with them-sometimes u wont be able to understand what the quest or story is about-mounts in boxes, i hate thoes			"

Overall, I give this game a 7.5/10.  I'd give better if the armor looked better. Some looks okay if you wear plate armor, but clothies are overall doomed to look pretty scrubbish.			"

												     Top 10 MMO's is where this one fits for me. Its totally Free! and if you want something on the store... get rex! its a perfect system to keep players on the game without feeling that they are underpowered and they still get their cash! I havent payed a Dime and I can get top 50 healers world wide NP. dont believe me look for Jtqunn@hailol. If someone complains about being ubder geared or that this game is pay to win they have no idea how to play... The only issue I have is that you may have 2 toons per shard. BUT the fact that I can play with anybody from different servers at any time fixes that! just add the persons name like so name@(shard name) and then you can warp to their shard once they join ur party!      The class system is legendary in this! because i can make my character exactly how I want! although still keeps some basis to what your starter class is. although this can also be a downfall because most people dont know how to set up a class right. although there are pre sets so dont worry!

												I recommend this game IF, and ONLY IF:1) You bring your own friends. The typical player is 12 years old and the ""community"" is way small.2) You never contact customer support, or require help or moderation of any kind. At all. The customer service is non-existent.3) You are ok spending real money at some point.			"

												Do NOT play this game until they fix the GLYPH launcher issues. Otherwise you will be stuck as I am (and thousands of others apparently) with a high level character in a game you can't even log in to. I've never had a game actively prevent me from playing (or spending money for that matter), but that is what RIFT has become. Great game ruined by the worst launcher in the business.			"

												Another boring MMO created in the style of World of Warcraft. The Rift niche is fun the first 5 times but you soon can't help but recognize the pattern.

												I was a day 1 player, when it was a subscription service.  Actually not a bad game in the beginning.  I realized quickly however, the monotony of repitition.  Once the game went free, in came the sycophants and everything went to hell in a handbasket.  If you truly have absolutely nothing better to do, then by all means, put yourself to sleep playing this.  However, be warned, the reviews in general aren't wrong it is truly now play for free, but Pay To not only just win but even to advance in any decent fashion.  I have returned to the world of reality and left MMO's entirely.  Just not my cup of tea			"

												The game is pretty empty. It's starting to look dated and models are a bit buggy. Selling on the auction house is stuck behind a paywall of spend £5 in microtransactions for ""loyalty"" to be allowed to sell, or buy a 2,500 platinum (a lot of money) item and use that. Therefore the auction house is dead and everything that is there is overpriced to accommodate for the lack of stuff.Trion killed yet another game with their money grabbing			"

												One of the best free to play games out there. You can play the game in it's entirety without spending a dime of real money. There are still plenty of people still playing, and plenty of active highly populated guilds to join. The community is pretty good. I haven't had a negative experience with another player yet. Most folks are fair and helpful.Gameplay is simple standard MMO stuff. There's lots to do though. Each class plays very differently, and are well balanced. Crafting is fun and comprehensive. Public quests are fun and easy to jump right into. Lore junkies will have plenty to read and discover. Quests are well written. I have yet to find a single bug in this game. It feels well polished and will run well on almost any PC.This game is 100% free. You have nothing to lose by trying it out.			"

												While I don't recommend this game, that's not to say that I think it's a bad game. I don't recommend anyone who has ever played World of Warcraft play this game due to the simple fact that this is a huge ripoff of the far superior WoW. The developers of this game made it much harder by over-complicating the skill tree and adding microtransactions under every rock, bush and tree in the game. Want the best items? What? Work for them? No, no no. Just make it easier on everyone and give us 5.99 and we'll call it a deal. Besides the extreme presence of microtransactions and the over complicated perk/skilling system, this game isn't bad for it being free. However, just be prepared for *ALOT* of kill x and collect y quests and spending alot of time trying to figure out the perk system. But hey, the game is free and if you're into playing a ripoff of WoW without having to pay, this is the game for you!			"

												First I'll say that rift is a great game, however it has one small flaw which decided whether or not I would recommend this game to others.The game itself is as good I would say as any subscribtion f2p MMORPG out there, better then some actually because the game is actively worked on by devs and lots of bug fixes, I almost never have had a game crash or see visual bugs. The game is clearly a polished and honed mmorpg and is pretty good at its current state effective of 6/13/2014. However, the small flaw, which actually is a huge deal for me personally, made me decide to not recommend and quit the game entirely.This game is free to play in name only, You are not required to, but pretty much have to if you are going to play anywhere past level 50, meaning endgame. And what would be the point of investing time and energy into a game where you hit a pay wall. the pay wall in rift is its loyalty points issue. basically, in rift, you cannot auction. at all. not one item. unless you have spent 10 dollars. and their is a in game currency coin cap. 2500 platinum which is an extremely small amount when people are running around with tens of thousands of platinum.All in all this game is good and i would say probably would suit casual players, but even then the no auction and coin cap rule is foolish IMO on the part of rifts dev team. The rift community is quite tiny and probably not growing due to this one small/large issue depending on how you look at it. But this is the games pay to play wall. Beware.			"

												I want to say this game is good.  Though I have to be honest I dont know if it is.  A while back i was invited to test this game....and didnt due to lack of time.  It came out so now i decided to give it a try.  The first thing i noticed is that this game is on a free to play model now with a subscription if you want one.  Thats neat...and i suppose some people hate it or like it.  Anywise I downloaded the game and was immediately given the ability to log into the game with an account or as a guest.  I decided to reclaim my old account to do this.  Anywise....i started up the game and was immediately told about a patch and how i could play but had to wait for downloading in game...since the big patch was big.   So i went into the game....and decided to make a character.  A few deceptions became evident.  First off 6 races....there is only 3 per side....you have to choose a side...with each race simply being an analog of the others...with slight changes to looks and some slight different abilities they can get.  Already with this mechanic i can see this game is going to be full of issues and other weirdness.You dont make a game requiring you to play sides...sorry thats an automatic going to make the game lame function.....but maybe i can slog through anywise.So i made a character.....noticed the graphics for some of my choices had not loaded yet.....ok warning sign two.....the red flags with this issue are evident....those pictures should have been loaded a while back but where not....means bad optimization and probably bad other things......if they are too lazy to fix something like that which is a simple fix...then they are probably too lazy for much story or fun gameplay.....ok goign to try to slog through that as well.So i start the game and get a...failed to connect to server and black screen,Been like this for over 15 minutes.......i have a black screen with what i assume is a waiting load icon.At this point with these issues like this......i can say maybe this game is fun....but these red flags show....a huge amount of issues.....if they have this sort of thing happening.....the game is probably fairly bad.but i am going to slog through or try too.....even though this rating says recommend.....i may alter it.....if i can ever play this game.Ok I finaly got into the game....graphicwise it isnt bad...both sides start with similar quests.Flow of the game is typical.....but i can see this is definately is a cash shop game....lots of things locked requiring unlocks and a plethora of things to buy in the cash shop.  Control wise its typical has a power bar....which you can flip pages on and you can add power bars which is a huge plus.  Only draw back for powers is this game uses the archaic and idiot global cool downs.  As in you use one attack and 5 of your other attacks are cooling down....in the real world someone isnt going to stand around waiting so many seconds to use a differing manuever....unrealistic....and annoying.But onthe plus side you can have many powers and use many power bars.You can change your focus of abilities as well...as long as you have not spent souls on powers in a focus....and unfortunatly some of the focus' seam to duplicate each other....only the names and some graphics are different for skills.So the supposed many focus things is a bogus lie....but then it does add to the concept of tailor making your character.I find myself disapointed with this game....with those features in those ways....but i will slog through to see what the rest of the game offers. Ok so following the main storyline...we find we get cutscenes....and a very disjointed storyline.  Storyline is the world you are on has these rifts to other worlds opening and wreaking havoc....possibly this is due to a war with gods.  Each faction side player is a resurrected hero....one side represents some holy divine group .while the other group wants to protect it a different way.  Looking at costumes and things I believe its a matter of one uses technology while the other uses magic.....storywise its not very clear why they are against each other or what the division truly is....as you can see on the side that supposedly uses magic...totems and things are actualy constructs from technology items.At a certain point you fight bad guys who you get told have come from rifts....but for whatever reason at a ceratin point you get sent back in time...to prevent the war and fix the world....not sure why this is done....because the point you get sent too...is just as hosed as the place in time you left....go figure on the logic.  Anywise while running around you will get the usual quests and missions...and also run into rifts that open giving further mini-quests.The cash shop can provide you with everything.....so in essence you can use it for pay to win....yet.....why would you bother when you can most everything in game.There are the usual a few cash shop things you can only get from there...and there is a subscription mechanic you can still use.I have played an assassin like character for a bit now....and after slogging through many things found that indeed the stealth isnt just a buff....as you eventualy can turn it on and off and not have to turn it off....only problem i am having now is deciding where my soul points go....as i dont know my maximum points...so i have to be kind of stingy in what i get.Now i mentioned focuses for each of the 4 class types....it looks like each character can get 3....now the reason you might take duplicating focus types....ie...ones that are similar is for the extra bonus power up you get to fight or do things.  For me right now i looked at the premade focus packages...and chose one...but decide to fit my assassin better i wanted to be able to not only have assassin skills but teleporting and better fighting.  So i altered my focuses to assassin, riftwalker, and blade dancer.....there is no package that uses these three...so i named my build ninja.  I feel strong kind of.....as an assassin strike does not one shot kill....but the ability to eventualy be invisible for as long as I like is a must have for me.ANywise i am digressing in to things you should find out for yourself. Perhaps others will like it or maybe they will hate it.....I do not think this is a bad game....so i recommend this title for those who want something different.  But its not enough different from other games to warrent a huge amount of time to play it to figure out if you like it or not.It is free to play...so far i am playing free....dont know what i am missing for not being a subscriber....but maybe i will find out later.

												A very complete and wide game, many skill and build options you can choose, pvp in almost any part of the map and a pvp arena too. Dimensions (like terrain/house) with many things to place in there, mounts, many different kind of armors/costumes ... etc.You'll understand how much this game has after seeing how much it weights.Negative part:The fighting system. It's realistic and good but if someone goes on your back you can't attack them, and the fact that players can attack while moving..well.. this makes some """"""pro"""""" players run in circles around you so you can't attack them. And THAT looks amazingly ridiculous.----------------------I was so excited to play this game again but then I saw all the bad reviews and remembered that.. they are true, at level 65 you will encounter many players that are just overpowered even if you have a good equipment, must be the pay to win features.All good online games end up dying at some point.Maplestory, Tibia, Dragon Nest, Rift, Awesomenauts... what else?

												Don't look at my steam play time, I've been playing since Open Beta 2, and I have to say, no MMO comes close to touching this one!As a veteran WoW player who was part of many world and server firsts, the whole cookie cutter spec got stale, as did paying a monthly fee. While I had to pay a fee each month to play this, it was soon found that there are hundreds of talent tree combinations that are all viable for everything! It's amazing, and it really shows how much care Trion put into this game. I specialized and generalized and each had its merits in the grand scale of the game.The world is also huge. There is never downtime, unless you make downtime by going into a city and standing there. I was questing once when I was a low level and a rift opened  right above me. As I was fighting for my life, another rift opened up a few meters away. Then, both rift's creatures started fighting eachother, it was amazing how alive the world feels! Finally, the community is amazing. People who are jerks or trolls get black listed by everybody, so they can no longer progress. This means that people don't do those things and everyone is super helpful. Even endgame grindy quests are made fun and easy with good partners. Basically, if you like WoW, or if you want to try a new MMO, play Rift. With the money you save from subscription fees, you can put it to supporting Trion through their store, and the community and world will ensure that you have a good time.			"

It is really fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥around a little but unless you pay a ton of money you will never be able to compete with anyone else. The content is amazing, had such a blast raiding and questing and pvping and doing dungeons and goofing off around Sanctum. Really great raid bosses and mechanics and it looks really good. I seriously had the best time right up until storm legion came out. Luckily I had been a paying member since releae and had a ton of patron status built up but after taking a couple of breaks I just can not get into it. Plus I lost access to my account due to losing my email password and not being able to recover it. IGN was Chumbawumba, good luck to all those I met and played with!			"

												I played Rift for over a year.  Even bought a years worth of gametime at once.  Really enjoyed the leveling, scenarios kept it fresh.  The lore and story are deep, but not well woven in, you have to seek it out.  Wardrobing is fun, and the dimensions are so much fun.  That is where I spend my cash, microtransactions.  Rift was smart.  You can buy clothes, or furniture and buildings and boats and whatever for cash, that way Rift makes it money, but without any pay to win, charging for gear scenarios.Now the bad.  If anything goes wrong, they will NEVER be bothered to fix it.  Error logging in?  uh, clear your cache.  Didn't work, too bad, thread closed.  For six months on and off, I have tried to get a fix for a common log in issue (error 2025) followed troubleshooting to no luck, and kept checking back.  So, now I have moved on to other things.  A shame, and it seems like the worst way to lost customers, because you can't be bothered to fix your game.So bottom line, it's great while youre playing, but keep in mind as you send your money that you must be ok with one day it just no longer being accessible.

												Doesn't matter how good a MMO may be, it's the players that make the game and since the internet infestation with the unwashed masses (fb, reddit, twitter, cancer etc.) they defile every corner of it.I was left asking myself 'why are they even populating online worlds when they don't even like games and they can't even play them to save their lives, evidenced by 95% of guilds failing to beat most of the pve raid content', then it came to me, they aren't here to play they are here to descecrate and ruin real gamers experience!  (I guess they had to go online to pick on people and ruin everything just like they have in real life)By these swarms of staceys, chads and joes inhabiting mmo worlds by their sheer force of numbers is enough to break the contextial format of what used to happen pre-2000.The expectation of difficulty to be encountered in a MMO no longer has anything to do with the laid out pve content / raid progression, but simply the bar is set by how many re_tar_ds you have to play with!Just look how even blizzard's big mmo 'WoW' made the looking for raid option, catering to spa_stics LFR (looking for re_tar_d raid finder).Before it was taken for granted that competant guilds would emerge in short order that could team play well and beat the content, this was a time of legend, a time of high adventure, a time WITHOUT gaming couples, grills, their drama and their sychophant beta-cuck average joes who enable them (and never recieve sex from the said grills).The vermin I speak of has ensured that online co-operative gaming is dead to a lone player that has decided to jump in mmos without a functional, pre-existing gaming community / guild as it's now a massive ocean sized tard-fest of players that should really have been introduced to an all lead diet decades ago but whom instead are online now awaiting to be your 'guildies'.These defunct guilds prey on unguilded new arrivals, their mode of attack is sending a guild invite out to a player and if accepted their deadly venom is then injected into the player paralysing their pve progress and disorientating them into believing the raid schedule is actually real and that it EVER happens (p.s. it doesn't).The sheer amount of honeypot guilds whose purpose is to stifle the pve dreams of new lone mmo players, unironically these fu_ck_ta_rds have created a tard corral for players that haven't PROVEN to them that they are their kind of people!  (like it's high school all over again)  Whereby the popular players who are 'known' and who run in cliques get to govern who gets to play and it's not by gaming ability or punctual raid attendance, look it's like we never even left school, the cool kids are the gate-keepers and you have to emulate them and be able to recite popular culture fads, music tastes and ti_t bits, show your support of some normie professional sports team (be sure to say, 'did you catch the game? as a segway to talk your way into a raid spot with your guild commisars) another must is sounding enthusiastic about it OR ELSE!That's right, either have the intelligence of an average sheeple who can actually sound interested and immersed in popular culture, talmudvision programming and sports, conversing with your flock using utterly pointless, programmed phrases and pretending to have imaginary shared interests and beliefs with your fellow sheep guild officer clique OR NEVER RAID AGAIN!Furthermore the guild you are suckered into may not even by the guild leaders and officer clique's main characters, or indeed their main MMO.  This actually happens more than you'd think, where you'll have your main character in a guild, dreaming of raiding and when raid night comes, no one shows up because they're on their main chars somewhere else in their real guild. (in other words their members are a big joke to them, you have been invited to a kindergarden kresh by aids ridden, NAZI pedos posing as guild leaders/officers and now you are at the mercy of these little HITLERS and they are abusing you like you're a infant, an infant being sodimized and cucked digitally into never being allowed to raid, it isn't that these evil demons passing themselves off as the core of a guild are preventing you from raiding because they don't know you're better than them, they do, they are doing this in spite of you).  Utter scum, don't even bother playing EVER, this counts for all online games that require a team to play.			"

												For a week or two, I enjoyed the nostalgia that RIFT gave me.  It reminded me of the good old days of Everquest. After a while though, the charm wore off and I was left feeling like the game was little more than just another mmorpg with little heart.Pros: Its not hard to play if you just want to be casual about it. Cons: Graphics, spells, skills and overall feel of the game is dated.       Pay to Win AND they still milk you for money up-front with expansions.Try Neverwinter Online.  Yes, its also pay-to-win, but you will enjoy the gameplay much more.			"

												If you're looking for an MMORPG now that the genera is pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥ RIFT is one of your top choices. The expansions are sort of unsettling for free to play players. For example, you have to eiter purchase an expansion or pay tons of in game money for earring slots. Which can end up being a lot of stats. The freedom of your class is really nice though and adds for a new level of casual and competitive play compared to other games. I'd give it a shot if you haven't yet.			"

												The game has nice eviroments, great character models and such... while at that I'm running out of nice things to say.This is just basically your typical boring MMORPG game, it might just be me since I aint exactly into these type of games but I expected something more exciting from RIFT. As far as I saw the skill points are nothing but tiny boosts and the game will not hesitate to tell you how or where you must spend your skill points. Fighting is just mash attack, some special attack and repeat, no dodging or anything (unless there's some dodge skill that I am not aware of).You will have to register seperately. After trying to login I found out that my e-mail is already in use with a forgotten password, tried to reset the password waited for about an hour and.. nothing. So I just decided to use my secondary e-mail, took just around a few minutes to receive the confirmation code. What happened to that password reset mail? I got it when I was ready to sleep..Basically: A good way of getting bored if you actually want to, you will have to register on a different client.4/10DONT FORGET: JUST MY OPNION			"

												For a week or two, I enjoyed the nostalgia that RIFT gave me.  It reminded me of the good old days of Everquest. After a while though, the charm wore off and I was left feeling like the game was little more than just another mmorpg with little heart.Pros: Its not hard to play if you just want to be casual about it. Cons: Graphics, spells, skills and overall feel of the game is dated.       Pay to Win AND they still milk you for money up-front with expansions.Try Neverwinter Online.  Yes, its also pay-to-win, but you will enjoy the gameplay much more.			"

												Don't look at my steam play time, I've been playing since Open Beta 2, and I have to say, no MMO comes close to touching this one!As a veteran WoW player who was part of many world and server firsts, the whole cookie cutter spec got stale, as did paying a monthly fee. While I had to pay a fee each month to play this, it was soon found that there are hundreds of talent tree combinations that are all viable for everything! It's amazing, and it really shows how much care Trion put into this game. I specialized and generalized and each had its merits in the grand scale of the game.The world is also huge. There is never downtime, unless you make downtime by going into a city and standing there. I was questing once when I was a low level and a rift opened  right above me. As I was fighting for my life, another rift opened up a few meters away. Then, both rift's creatures started fighting eachother, it was amazing how alive the world feels! Finally, the community is amazing. People who are jerks or trolls get black listed by everybody, so they can no longer progress. This means that people don't do those things and everyone is super helpful. Even endgame grindy quests are made fun and easy with good partners. Basically, if you like WoW, or if you want to try a new MMO, play Rift. With the money you save from subscription fees, you can put it to supporting Trion through their store, and the community and world will ensure that you have a good time.			"

												Doesn't matter how good a MMO may be, it's the players that make the game and since the internet infestation with the unwashed masses (fb, reddit, twitter, cancer etc.) they defile every corner of it.I was left asking myself 'why are they even populating online worlds when they don't even like games and they can't even play them to save their lives, evidenced by 95% of guilds failing to beat most of the pve raid content', then it came to me, they aren't here to play they are here to descecrate and ruin real gamers experience!  (I guess they had to go online to pick on people and ruin everything just like they have in real life)By these swarms of staceys, chads and joes inhabiting mmo worlds by their sheer force of numbers is enough to break the contextial format of what used to happen pre-2000.The expectation of difficulty to be encountered in a MMO no longer has anything to do with the laid out pve content / raid progression, but simply the bar is set by how many re_tar_ds you have to play with!Just look how even blizzard's big mmo 'WoW' made the looking for raid option, catering to spa_stics LFR (looking for re_tar_d raid finder).Before it was taken for granted that competant guilds would emerge in short order that could team play well and beat the content, this was a time of legend, a time of high adventure, a time WITHOUT gaming couples, grills, their drama and their sychophant beta-cuck average joes who enable them (and never recieve sex from the said grills).The vermin I speak of has ensured that online co-operative gaming is dead to a lone player that has decided to jump in mmos without a functional, pre-existing gaming community / guild as it's now a massive ocean sized tard-fest of players that should really have been introduced to an all lead diet decades ago but whom instead are online now awaiting to be your 'guildies'.These defunct guilds prey on unguilded new arrivals, their mode of attack is sending a guild invite out to a player and if accepted their deadly venom is then injected into the player paralysing their pve progress and disorientating them into believing the raid schedule is actually real and that it EVER happens (p.s. it doesn't).The sheer amount of honeypot guilds whose purpose is to stifle the pve dreams of new lone mmo players, unironically these fu_ck_ta_rds have created a tard corral for players that haven't PROVEN to them that they are their kind of people!  (like it's high school all over again)  Whereby the popular players who are 'known' and who run in cliques get to govern who gets to play and it's not by gaming ability or punctual raid attendance, look it's like we never even left school, the cool kids are the gate-keepers and you have to emulate them and be able to recite popular culture fads, music tastes and ti_t bits, show your support of some normie professional sports team (be sure to say, 'did you catch the game? as a segway to talk your way into a raid spot with your guild commisars) another must is sounding enthusiastic about it OR ELSE!That's right, either have the intelligence of an average sheeple who can actually sound interested and immersed in popular culture, talmudvision programming and sports, conversing with your flock using utterly pointless, programmed phrases and pretending to have imaginary shared interests and beliefs with your fellow sheep guild officer clique OR NEVER RAID AGAIN!Furthermore the guild you are suckered into may not even by the guild leaders and officer clique's main characters, or indeed their main MMO.  This actually happens more than you'd think, where you'll have your main character in a guild, dreaming of raiding and when raid night comes, no one shows up because they're on their main chars somewhere else in their real guild. (in other words their members are a big joke to them, you have been invited to a kindergarden kresh by aids ridden, NAZI pedos posing as guild leaders/officers and now you are at the mercy of these little HITLERS and they are abusing you like you're a infant, an infant being sodimized and cucked digitally into never being allowed to raid, it isn't that these evil demons passing themselves off as the core of a guild are preventing you from raiding because they don't know you're better than them, they do, they are doing this in spite of you).  Utter scum, don't even bother playing EVER, this counts for all online games that require a team to play.			"

It is really fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥around a little but unless you pay a ton of money you will never be able to compete with anyone else. The content is amazing, had such a blast raiding and questing and pvping and doing dungeons and goofing off around Sanctum. Really great raid bosses and mechanics and it looks really good. I seriously had the best time right up until storm legion came out. Luckily I had been a paying member since releae and had a ton of patron status built up but after taking a couple of breaks I just can not get into it. Plus I lost access to my account due to losing my email password and not being able to recover it. IGN was Chumbawumba, good luck to all those I met and played with!			"

												Streamlined and cheaper version of WoW with extremely boring world and lore. Apart from the auction house being locked behind a pay wall (which really hurts player economy) there really isn't bad P2W content and most of the stuff you can buy with real money is just optional cosmetic trash or cuts down the time needed to level up. It feels like the game is still designed with free players in mind first since buying those boosters would just quickly overlevel you out of questing and dungeon areas.The rift opening and other overworld raiding events are fun, bringing random players together and being able to mix different talent trees to make your own class is pretty neat in my opinion. Worth a try if you're looking for a new MMORPG without the risk of shelling money first.			"

Product received for free
												Note: My hours played are misleading. I've played this on and off since its release on Steam, and this review is based on my most recent experience with the game.Rift is a moderately fun - if generic - WoW-style MMO. The combat is solid, there are plenty of quests to do, and the world is fun enough to explore. But what killed it for me is the sheer volume of micro-transactions. I've never played a game so overflowing with them. I'm not exaggerating when I say that nearly every inch of the interface has an obnoxious premium currency symbol on it telling you that you could pay real money to unlock something. It even worms its way into questing - during the handful of hours I played my new character, I looted no less than 30 lockboxes from monsters that required keys bought with real money to open, and every single quest hand-in screen showed me I could be getting more money and XP if I was a subscriber. No matter how enjoyable its gameplay might be, I just can't recommend such a money hungry game to anyone. It's desperate to the point of being gross.			"

												This game is truly amazing, takes a while to get into the good♥♥♥♥♥♥in the game. When you get out of one of the 2 faction spawns (Guardians or Defiants). This game INCOURAGES exploring the world, they have fetch quests but its not as bad as some other MMORPGS. They give you the quest, you finish it and go to a different person, some long distances some small. The skill tree is really good, could use a bit more in my oppinion but decent. The community is very friendly, invite people to guilds so they can help them if they have questions or even be very kind and give you a free mount or such. I was lvl 20-25 (cant remember) but you get a 60% speed increase when on the mount, people in my guild were talking about that mount which is 25plat which is quite a bit for a lvl 20-25 and i said that its very hard to get one, one of the guildies/guild member brought me that mount to be very very kind and they were a high ranking player. PVP is truly amazing and takes alot of skill and time, the most annoying thing in pvp for me is getting your faction swapped to the enemy team to balance it out which is a good thing but you want to be with your faction, either way its fun. The game has a wardrobe feature meaning if you have a piece of armor or something you can but it in your wardrobe slot for example, Helm and it goes into your wardrobe slot and it gives the look but not the stats. Microtransactions are okay... i guess, you dont HAVE to buy them for the game to be good, they are just things like if you play a mage you get 3 BASE things to choose from, example stormcaller, warlock ect and the Microtransactions give you a couple of new ones that dont make a HUGE difference. The Map is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE and each zone like Gloamwood, Silverwood and every other one has their own secret stash like thing, if you open it you get ramdom armor of your class that rounds down to every 5 LEVELS, if you are lvl 20 you will get a lvl 20 item. If you are lvl17 you will get a lvl 15 item. Puzzles are great, they require teamwork like pressing several buttons that open a globe that your break and has a key in it, then it spawns a chest with a dirty bag, the same thing like the secret stashes like i said previously.I would rate this game 7.5/10 but i do recommend this game if you love MMORPGSCons:The start of the game is very very boring and you need to be about lvl 15 for♥♥♥♥♥♥to kick off.Can be very annoying to get the kind of gear you want but its an MMORPG sooo......Microtransactions are ehhh, would be better without it but.....Wish there was gliders and boats like Archeage but mounts are good enough.Pros:Friendly communityCharacter creation is very very good.Fun game after lvl 15Great PVPWardrobeHuge mapGreat secret treasuresGreat puzzles that require teamwork to complete			"

												I enjoyed playing RIFT for a while, but it then I just got sick of it.  I spent a chunk of real life money on bag/bank space and without doing so, the game is quite hard to play.  I didn't feel that I got a return for that investment.  I enjoy exploring and farming.  This game has some nice exploring, with caves that are nice to find and some semi-secret bosses that you can stumble on there.  The dungeons are instance based and I didn't warm to their style.  You can't go in without a party and again, I just didn't see much reward for going there.  It's not that farmable and I didn't really feel crafting with drops gave much reward in game.  My first MMO was Rappelz and until the economy there was tipped too far in favour of cash shop and they got rid of event farming, that was my model for other MMOs.   It seems that there aren't MMOs out there now that will balance their game and the in-game economy to recognise the various player types.  I was a prolific farmer, that spent the occasional bit of money in the cash shop, but prospered through a lot of grinding/farming.  My drops were purchased by others, including people with not as much time or patience, but willing/able to spend a lot of real life cash.  That MMO and it seems most others nowadays don't respect the farming type that feeds the other gamers with items.  In fact, they tend to add a bit of token crafting and fishing to keep people occupied, but the drops from those activities don't have an economic value in game.  It's all about the cash and Rift, with other free to play MMO's is really pay to play.			"

												I enjoyed playing RIFT for a while, but it then I just got sick of it.  I spent a chunk of real life money on bag/bank space and without doing so, the game is quite hard to play.  I didn't feel that I got a return for that investment.  I enjoy exploring and farming.  This game has some nice exploring, with caves that are nice to find and some semi-secret bosses that you can stumble on there.  The dungeons are instance based and I didn't warm to their style.  You can't go in without a party and again, I just didn't see much reward for going there.  It's not that farmable and I didn't really feel crafting with drops gave much reward in game.  My first MMO was Rappelz and until the economy there was tipped too far in favour of cash shop and they got rid of event farming, that was my model for other MMOs.   It seems that there aren't MMOs out there now that will balance their game and the in-game economy to recognise the various player types.  I was a prolific farmer, that spent the occasional bit of money in the cash shop, but prospered through a lot of grinding/farming.  My drops were purchased by others, including people with not as much time or patience, but willing/able to spend a lot of real life cash.  That MMO and it seems most others nowadays don't respect the farming type that feeds the other gamers with items.  In fact, they tend to add a bit of token crafting and fishing to keep people occupied, but the drops from those activities don't have an economic value in game.  It's all about the cash and Rift, with other free to play MMO's is really pay to play.			"

												Warning: NEVER VERIFY THE GAMEThe Glyph launcher sometimes updates every hour or so and then f's up which can result in having to download big sections of the game again. As a result, these days I never play until the game has fully updated even though the game says you can start to play while it downloads content in the background.Do not trust any forum post or article that suggest you use Steam to verify the game as most files will fail the check and it will try to download almost the entire game again. (Apparently I was trolled by a forum post that suggested I verify after re-installing the game... which caused the whole game to be downloaded by steam again, and then Glyph would dowload the game again after the steam verify. At 20GB per ... that's a lot of download.)As a new player I am of course impressed by the sheer anmount of content in the game. But the P2W and Greed of Trion is evident everywhere. Your bag fills up with items that require paid money to open, which wastes time because you have VERY limited bagspace and so have keep discarding these 'Pay to unlock' loot that you get while fighting.The VERY limited bagspace can of course be unlocked and expanded to 8x more space but the real money you have to pay increases exponentialloy with each slot. The last slot requires the most expensive DLC the game has to offer.The P2W is so strong with this one that one post estimates you have to pay 17x the price of a tripple A game and then put in about 1,500 hours to use it all. If you don't pay up... then you can grind till you die, have your kids grind till they die and maybe your grandkids can equal the powers of the players who are playing today.As a result, I am of course not planning to spend a dime, and as such have no way of ever seeing end game because by the time I get to the current 'free' end-game it will probably have been put behind a paywall. That's right folks... stuff that is 'free' right now won't be free in the future.... eg: earrings, auction house, Planar etc. But fear not! Even though the free content is now behind a paywall, you can aim for the new free stuff we have that you can get to with several thousand hours of grinding. But you better hurry up... because in a few thousand hours we might just paywall it because of all the players complaining about how long it takes to get there!			"

												Rift hit the massively multiplayer online scene a few years ago and since it has become one of the largest and most popular games of the genre. Rift is a free, micro-transaction based game set in a high fantasy world. Rift established a few boundaries that other massively multiplayer online games have done well to copy. Some of the most fundamental things that Rift did different – and did right include a free to play structure, the limiting of abilities to a more refined, limited selection and also the addition of an interactive and evolving game-world. These things have established Rift as a pathfinder in the market and make it a sturdy title to contend with.Though originally for a foreign audience, Rift was repackaged for westerners due to demand. The game allows for extensive customization of your avatar as well as plenty of micro-transactions which are purely for aesthetic appeal. This becomes one of the biggest gripes most gamers tend to have, that distinction must be “bought.” Even though by no means does the game require you to purchase anything to play, the cash store and micro-transactions are present to make the game profitable. People complain that micro-transactions destroy the game and make you spend excessive amounts of money on the game – but let's take a step back and examine the situation. Micro-transactions ensure that you only pay for content you're going to use, or at least want and generally a few little purchases dwarfs in comparison to shelling out the full retail price for the game package and a monthly subscription cost. Micro-transactions are good for players and game producers alike.Another are that Rift excels in is the open world environment which invites you to explore and experiment. As the name of the game implies, rifts to other dimensions can be opened in the world – sometimes willingly sometimes spontaneously. Generally rifts are conquered by players to gain rewards, but sometimes if left to its own devices a rift might grow and begin to call in reinforcement troops which will assault towns, players and other rifts. This dynamic creates a totally different feel to the game, because normally titles in this genre have a rule of thumb that the world itself is pretty unchangeable by the players. Though you're not exactly reshaping the world with developer's tools, being able to open and close rifts gives you a sense of mastery of environment not seen elsewhere.Another concept adopted and brought forward by Rift is the reduction of abilities and the simplification of controls. Recently, even big names such as World of Warcraft have taken steps to remove abilities and simplify gameplay. If anyone has ever compared the difference between abilities in older massively multiplayer online games and newer titles, one notices that newer titles only offer a limited selection of active abilities which can be changed but never giving the player an excess of options. For the casual player your head literally could spin trying to remember all of the abilities, commands, keybinds and micros found in more classic massively multiplayer online titles. Streamlined abilities are what make this game great and easy to pick up and play by even casual gamers.The graphics are crisp and inspiring, definitely with the quality level expected for a game of modern times. Of course being on a personal computer engine, largely the graphics will depend on your settings but with maxed out specifications the game itself is stunning. Even on lower settings, the quality and attention to detail brought to the plate are sure to impress. Textures aren't everything though, animations are smooth, monsters are imaginative yet still fitting and the scenery and terrain are world class. Similar detail is also seen in the audio of the game, going into great detail to make sure ever effect has the right sound and that the melodies are peppered with dramatic but suitable overtures serving to further immerse one into the also visually stunning environment.Sometimes the worlds of online multiplayer gaming can be threatening or maybe just a little intimidating. For the casual console gamer of the past, when looking at a massively multiplayer online game one is probably reminded of a dungeons and dragons setup. Without sacrificing depth and the details many online gamers do like, Rift gives casual players an opportunity to enjoy the genre as well. Because it does not require any purchases, its easy for anyone to gain access to the game and try it out. Newer players will be drawn in by the content and ease of play the streamlined abilities offer. Though it is a step into definite nerddom I definitely recommend Rift to anyone interested. It's free after all, give it a try! If you would like a chance to play for free, be sure to check it out!http://www.playerschoicereview.com/2015/03/players-choice-review-rift.html "

												If you have played Wow before and liked it you would like this even more.Pros:-Free to Max Level-Not Really Pay to WIn-Amazing Graphics(Play on high and you'd be impressed)-Endless fun hunting down rifts, just feeling the exileration of cracking open a rift and fighting for your life-Instant Adventure:Just click ""Instant Adventure"" then your area and boom your right in battle-Have your own houses(dimensions) and can buy and find furniture to place in your home-Players are nice most of the time, Example in Scarwood Reach I met a Defiance player, while I was a guardian(enemies), we had a friendly conversation and then we parted our ways.-Great spells-Free daily & weekly gifts-No fall damageCons:-Some items look the exact same just different colors(can dye clothes)-Servers can sometimes be empty-Not alot lore-DLC's are too pricey-Can get boring8/10			"

												Before anyone tell me I don't know what I'm doing, I spent a few hours looking through website forums trying to understand what was going on because the game would not launch. I even deleted and reinstalled 2 additional times but the game would never start. My computer is more than able to handle it (Can run Tomb Raider at Ultimate settings).I kept getting errors on startup telling me that I needed to update, then when i did run the update it downloaded about 150 mb of info and then said it couldn't apply the update successfully and I needed to redownload the entire game again.I really wanted to play, but after 12 hours of downloading it 3 times and reading tons of forum posts I'm giving up. No game should be this ridiculous to install, especially when it has been out for years.			"

You could enter dungeons with many anothers as a lvl 65+ characters as you learned your skills. This helped leveling.  My only peev was that you would level so quickly that your quests would become obselte in value, so you would just grind raids/dungeons for a while and hope you were in an active guid to make it interesting. TLDR: Power-leveling can get excessive yet still fun community.			"

												Rift is a MMORPG (Massive multiplayer online role playing game) with a large game lore, themed in an epic medieval fantasy world.Pros:- There is a lot to do in the game, being it discovering the ever-growing world, crafting for your trade-skills (building equipment or enhancements for your own use, for your friends, guild or anyone in the world), finding dungeons and finishing quests, or simply completing daily or weekly quests in raids.- You can customize your character in a moderate way, but you can unlock a large amount of armors, weapons and mounts to customize your outer appearance.- You can have your own dimensión in which you can place a ot of things, any way you want, in any size you want. Despite there is a limited (but very large) collectión of items you may place in there, your imagination is the limit.- Did I say that there is always something to do? Add to the above constant invasions from other planes, leaded by large bosses who will need a lot of people to take down.- There is a lot of room for addons and macros that you can customize to simplify battles and  other ingame intercations.Cons:- The game is very intensive on system requirements for players who want to see the beauty of the world.- The game is very expensive if you want a little bonus for your character (being it a slightly faster mount for patreons, extra slots for bags or unlocking gear slots), and has the weird statement of blocking basic interactions (you must do an initial payment to use auction houses, the regular method of player trading) instead of awarding in a better way the players who buy stuff from the game (I've bought a few stuff out of need, but the reward felt quite expensive).- Based on the above, if you are not willing to pay the varied prices for some little benefit, the game might look like you can't reach the end-game content because you might be under geared (e.g.: can't do enough damage to a boss because you lack ""firepower""), and sometimes it will look like a lot of work (because you can get game credits from other players, but they are even more expensive).Do I recommend the game? I DO!Despite all the work you may need to get stuff in the game, the game is really fun to play. The player comunity is growing, which makes every event more fun... because aside the quests and the invasions, there are seasonal events and many other things to do. My advice? Give it a try if you like fantasy games. We might end fighting a massive boss together (and I mean massive... check youtube if you do not believe me) ;).			"

Downloaded it on steam, was excited, had to download it again on Glyph. Got a couple of errors, had to download it again. (Keep in mind that i do not have great internet speeds). Tried different stuff to make it work to no end. Please do not use Steam to download and play the game, use Glyph itself!			"

												I enjoyed playing RIFT for a while, but it then I just got sick of it.  I spent a chunk of real life money on bag/bank space and without doing so, the game is quite hard to play.  I didn't feel that I got a return for that investment.  I enjoy exploring and farming.  This game has some nice exploring, with caves that are nice to find and some semi-secret bosses that you can stumble on there.  The dungeons are instance based and I didn't warm to their style.  You can't go in without a party and again, I just didn't see much reward for going there.  It's not that farmable and I didn't really feel crafting with drops gave much reward in game.  My first MMO was Rappelz and until the economy there was tipped too far in favour of cash shop and they got rid of event farming, that was my model for other MMOs.   It seems that there aren't MMOs out there now that will balance their game and the in-game economy to recognise the various player types.  I was a prolific farmer, that spent the occasional bit of money in the cash shop, but prospered through a lot of grinding/farming.  My drops were purchased by others, including people with not as much time or patience, but willing/able to spend a lot of real life cash.  That MMO and it seems most others nowadays don't respect the farming type that feeds the other gamers with items.  In fact, they tend to add a bit of token crafting and fishing to keep people occupied, but the drops from those activities don't have an economic value in game.  It's all about the cash and Rift, with other free to play MMO's is really pay to play.			"

												If you like MMOs and have never played Rift (or stopped playing a long time ago), you should definitely give it a try. Leveling is actually fun and you have different options to chose from: you can level the traditional way - by questing solo, you can level only through PvP, or if you like group play and want to level as a tank or healer, you can just hop into a dungeon or instant adventure (which puts you in a random raid that does scaled quest chains in one of the zones).The biggest issue when you're starting out are the graphics and the slightly outdated feel of the game, but I found that I got used to it quickly.For a free game, Rift is top-notch and certainly worth trying out for everyone but the biggest MMO haters.

												I played this game to level 15 before uninstalling it. I couldn't get into it and here's why. Now, I know graphics aren't everything. I know that at the end of the day content is far more important than graphics. But Rift has some of the worst graphics and animations I've seen in an MMO in a long time. And to make it worse the game isn't that old. This game came out in, what, 2010? Why do the graphics look like they're from a game that was made back in 2004? Also, the content is pretty boring but that's to be expected when it comes to an MMO. At the end of the day, if you want to play a free MMO with friends I'd suggest it. But that's only if you love MMO's enough to endure the boring content and if you could careless about graphics.			"

Tried different stuff to make it work to no end. Please do not use Steam to download and play the game, use Glyph itself!			"

												Rift is a MMORPG (Massive multiplayer online role playing game) with a large game lore, themed in an epic medieval fantasy world.Pros:- There is a lot to do in the game, being it discovering the ever-growing world, crafting for your trade-skills (building equipment or enhancements for your own use, for your friends, guild or anyone in the world), finding dungeons and finishing quests, or simply completing daily or weekly quests in raids.- You can customize your character in a moderate way, but you can unlock a large amount of armors, weapons and mounts to customize your outer appearance.- You can have your own dimensión in which you can place a ot of things, any way you want, in any size you want. Despite there is a limited (but very large) collectión of items you may place in there, your imagination is the limit.- Did I say that there is always something to do? Add to the above constant invasions from other planes, leaded by large bosses who will need a lot of people to take down.- There is a lot of room for addons and macros that you can customize to simplify battles and  other ingame intercations.Cons:- The game is very intensive on system requirements for players who want to see the beauty of the world.- The game is very expensive if you want a little bonus for your character (being it a slightly faster mount for patreons, extra slots for bags or unlocking gear slots), and has the weird statement of blocking basic interactions (you must do an initial payment to use auction houses, the regular method of player trading) instead of awarding in a better way the players who buy stuff from the game (I've bought a few stuff out of need, but the reward felt quite expensive).- Based on the above, if you are not willing to pay the varied prices for some little benefit, the game might look like you can't reach the end-game content because you might be under geared (e.g.: can't do enough damage to a boss because you lack ""firepower""), and sometimes it will look like a lot of work (because you can get game credits from other players, but they are even more expensive).Do I recommend the game? I DO!Despite all the work you may need to get stuff in the game, the game is really fun to play. The player comunity is growing, which makes every event more fun... because aside the quests and the invasions, there are seasonal events and many other things to do. My advice? Give it a try if you like fantasy games. We might end fighting a massive boss together (and I mean massive... check youtube if you do not believe me) ;).			"

												ReviewStarted this good ol game up again 171 hours, got sucked in again, i really like it, a lot the npc and monsters could use some life, but most MMO's are like that. Yes there is a major cash shop, but you get free stuff and a lot can be bought through the Auction House, trading, grinding, getting a job and supporting a free game by buying a little here and there, basicly i never shy away from buying bag/bank space, mounts and pets, and skins, the rest never cared for.Max level is 29 Dwarven Warrior Tank, also have a 20 something Hunter type and a few alts, fun game would keep playing it, games like this to me would be Lord of the Rings online, Dungeon & Dragons online, World of Warcraft.Crafting, Questing, Farming, and Grinding it has it all, what it has that really keeps me are Events, and i don't mean server events, the Rifts, i like how they appear, kept me going.Only two Character slots per shard for free, i am sure you can buy more, Really good Tutoria and the leveling is neat the screen flashes.

												Ok,so I had to rewrite the review as i got more hours in this amazing game.Enjoy the following review.So,to get started,this is an amazing MMORPG game,all the classic things you will find in MMORPG's;mounts,pets,classes.. etc.But it also offers an innovative take on an MMORPG,such as; random rifts erupting everywhere,incredible and huge zone events,incredibly large and detailed lore,and the ability to make your own DIMENSION,yes an entire dimension for yourself...Now,lets talk about these things: Mounts:There's a huge amount of mounts,ranging from a 60% speed boost,to a 100% speed boost.They all look incredible and are available already at lvl 15(approx. 30-35 hours).Pets:There are 2 types of pets: companion and combat.Companion pets can be bought with in-game coins later on.Combat pets are the pets that you can summon with your class.(some classes summon elementals,some summon animals...)Classes:There are 4 classes:Rogue,Cleric,Mage and Warrior.each class has about 6-8 ""souls"".These souls are an incredibly detailed way of making your own class and playstyle.They are kind of a...subclass.Example: A Rogue has these(and more souls): Saboteur,Ranger,Riftwalker,Bladedancer,Bard etc.Rifts:Rifts are holes in dimensions through which monsters from diffrent plains of existence come to invade Telara(more info in the lore).They are tiny events,which yield nice rewards in the end.Zone events:These dont occur so often,possibly once in about 3-4 hours,they are mostly ""invasions"".When rifts stay opened for too long,invasions of monsters attack the nearby places,if they are not stopped in time,a zone event will occur,leading in an all out war for 30 minutes,with an enormous boss in the end,and with massive rewards.Make your dimension:Now this is quite unusual.You can make your dimension(aka your ""home"") anyway you want it to be,you will learn how somewhere around lvl 10(approx 10-15 hours of gameplay).You can place items in there,place statues,buildings and many more.Review in short(for people who dont like to read huge texts):Rift is a classical,yet an innovative game,offering many challenges.I suggest looking up some tutorials before you play it,as it can be quite complicated for a new player.Rift offers non-stop events and action,of course,if you get tired of the action,you can take a rest at your faction's capital or your dimension.You can also invite your friends to hang out in your dimension as well.All in all:Rift is a MMORPG packed with Dungeons,Rifts,Raids and Zone Events.Innovative,yet classical.If you liked this game try out:DefianceThats it,hope you enjoy the game :D			"

												Pretty cool MMO. A little strange to get into at first but once you've settled in the game becomes quite fun. Very WoW-ish in the mechanics and HUD setup, but I assume most MMO's are like that in a way. The music is a little drab, but I'm not going to expect a massive budget on a FTP game. The controls are a bit iffy, but all is good through changing settings and all that. The world looks really vast and I expect to spend quite a fair amount of time playing this game.			"

												A truly amazing experience. This game showed me how good a free to play game can get and how much you can do without paying a dime. The class system was super fun for me because I would always try out crazy combos just to see what I could come up with and how it would do against other players in World PvP. The graphics of this game are something else, they are absolutely fantastic and you truly feel immersed in the epic fantasy world of Telara. The Rifts bring random players together of both factions to take down a common enemy and then after the Rift closes everyone collects rewards and it feels awesome knowing you took down a public event with a large group of people. The zone events are just as awesome and require the whole zone to contribute to taking down a massive boss. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a free to play game to spend some time on, maybe you'll get hooked the way I did.			"

												I've been playing Rift from the get go, and I really did not expect it to be that good. But the moment I stepped into Telara I was amazed at how much of a great game Rift is. Trion Wolrds really succeded at making a great mmo. Trion did not aim to make it original, but to make it simply better. I played WoW but I did not even get to the end game. I'm level 50 in Rift and i do say, I am having a blast. The PvP is a whole lot of OKay but i have never like pvp in anything. All in All Rift is a mmo even WoW fanboys can play. I suggest this game to everyone as it is an easy to play mmo.			"

												Let it be known, that I've actually played this quite a lot on the individual client as well (which if you can go without Steam, is probably the simpler choice). See, I only played through the game with a single character, and I reached around level 50 (I believe there are 60 or 70?) without spending any money, except for maybe an outfit or two for a character.In my opinion, this game is how Free to Play should be done, it's very enjoyable, and while you may not b e able to tackle every single dungeon in the game without paying some money, or grinding, it's still a wonderful time. I got over 250 hours out of a game I didn't pay a dime for, and that's more than I've gotten out of most games!			"

It has its own deal going on, and only takes the base mechanics and structure of the game; WoW is currently about offering a streamlined experience and Rift is about offering a really varied and deep one. Compare the current talent structure of the two games to see what I mean.Cautiously reccommended, go in only with friends like any MMO.			"

												I've been playing Rift from the get go, and I really did not expect it to be that good. But the moment I stepped into Telara I was amazed at how much of a great game Rift is. Trion Wolrds really succeded at making a great mmo. Trion did not aim to make it original, but to make it simply better. I played WoW but I did not even get to the end game. I'm level 50 in Rift and i do say, I am having a blast. The PvP is a whole lot of OKay but i have never like pvp in anything. All in All Rift is a mmo even WoW fanboys can play. I suggest this game to everyone as it is an easy to play mmo.			"

												GOODReally great game if you like online mmo style, ""run round doing quests killing NPCs"" kind of game, leveling up and deveoping your character. BADI don't like the auction system. You cannot just join and use it to sell items you crafted etc, it seems you need ""Loyalty"" whatever that is... This is the one thing I would like to see changed. Otherwise its a good way to kill time.OVERALLGame is playable and has room for improvement, not bad for a free game.  I give it a 7/10 and would encourage others to play. "

												1. Game is extremely similar to World of Warcraft. This is a pro and a con. It's a pro because World of Warcraft is awesome, who wouldn't want to play a similar game. It's also a con as some players are looking for something new. That being said let's cover some points that newer players want to hear. 2. You can play this game for months and still have things left to do. There are thousands of quests and a healthy playerbase.3. Combat system is nothing new for MMOs and will grow stale quickly for veterans. 4. game is advertised as free. is it? NO! if you've ever played tf2 when it went f2p you'll understand this. in rift as a free player you get a couple bag slots, a couple character slots and a couple other restrictions such as not being able to make auctions in the auction house until you spend 5 bucks of real money to make it otherwise. there is no way to get bag slots besides real money or getting to max level and selling a lot of harvested materials for REX (real currency sold by players).technically you can say this game is ""free"" however free in this case would be sadly comparable to slavery as you must act as a slave in order to obtain that amount of currency. this could take you weeks of gameplay which will not be enjoyable.5. the dungeons are fantastic. they are generic at first but eventually you will have a reasonably challenging time. it's an enjoyable way to level up if you are playing as a tank/healer.6. the questing SUCKS. It's the most grinding in an MMO i've ever seen. we're talking 50+ quests to get up 1 level at level 40+ (level cap is 60 holy hell)in conclusion, do i reccomend this game? sort of. i play with my brother in dungeons etc but that's about it. the novely died off fast. for new mmo players this game may be completely overwhelming and without a friend who knows his way around you won't get far fast.for new mmo players, stay away from this game unless you have friends who also play.for people who left wow because it cost too much, here's a cheap alternatiive.

												Let it be known, that I've actually played this quite a lot on the individual client as well (which if you can go without Steam, is probably the simpler choice). See, I only played through the game with a single character, and I reached around level 50 (I believe there are 60 or 70?) without spending any money, except for maybe an outfit or two for a character.In my opinion, this game is how Free to Play should be done, it's very enjoyable, and while you may not b e able to tackle every single dungeon in the game without paying some money, or grinding, it's still a wonderful time. I got over 250 hours out of a game I didn't pay a dime for, and that's more than I've gotten out of most games!			"

												Edit: If you like PvP, and want to choose map/mode, this game might not be for you, if you plan on playing it for free. I myself don't really like PvP, so I'm giving it a positive review.I've been trying out a lot of MMOs, but I keep falling back to this one.For being a F2P game it's really good, and has lots to offer. There are no ""pay to win"" options, except being able to buy out more slots for proffesions (which I love, since then I can be more creative with my Dimensions), and cosmetic stuff/nice looking mounts.This game doesn't push you to pay for gems, but instead they reward you with great gifts if you do :) And alot of the stuff you can buy can also be bought with in-game cash, but you might have to grind some for it :) There are also a way to get gems with in-game cash, you just need to buy it from other players :) This also will require a lot of grinding, though.There aren't many races on each alliance, but the 4 classes in the game can be built almost however you like it, especially if you buy the 2 soul-packs.This game isn't just good with the gameplay, it looks good as well. The gameplay is really similar to World of Warcraft, but Rift has a better look and is F2P. So for those who are looking for a F2P game similar to WoW, this might be your free WoW-clone :) Since it's free, it's worth to at least try once :p9/10 from me!			"

												I've played this game off and on since launch. I have to say is this: The game is great. They consistently add large amounts of content. This is due to the money they are making off of the FTP you all seem to hate. The content flow is greater, larger and more consistent than the sub base. Every time I come back, plenty new to discover. If you're looking for a free to play MMO, there is no questions this is probably the best. By free to play, I mean completely free to start playing. Not buy once, continue playing, puchasing items here and there. Here, you download, play for free, entire game if you want, and put some money in it if you want as well. You can't get everything for free? Get over it. It's a great game. Great content. Solid.I hope it makes enough money to justify a Rift 2, one that isn't over shadowed by a still going strong WoW. When this game was released it was called a WoW clone. As was every other MMO during that time. Guild wars 2 was the only one that managed to drift away, but took a long time to become what it is now. As did Rift. As did WoW.And this is free. Being compared to those games. Skip the reviews. Play it, or don't. Just don't waste your time reading peoples reviews that complain a massive MMORPG, isn't 150% free. Go play SWTOR. Check out those FtP restrictions. Or any other Ftp MMO...			"

												At first I thought it was just another WoW clone. On the surface that is very much what it looks like. In fact its one of the most WoW lookin WoW clones I've ever played. In a way though thats good. Seasoned WoW players can jump right in. For me though the sheer amount of WoW clones is what essentially made me give up on the MMO scene for a long time. I found most MMORPG's lately are just very stale and repetitive with too much grinding for not enough reward However as you play the game more you learn about the rift invasions, soul swapping and many other features that just bring a whole new depth into the game. You can completely customise your characters by combining 3 different classes together. I recently looted some gear that was recommended for a Cleric Rogue Warrior. That pretty much says it all as far as I'm concerned. Not to mention that theres none of this ""Reach level X and pay a ridiculous amount of (game currency) to learn how to ride a boring slow horse"". When I was level 15 (and essentially still learning how to play the game) and on my way to buy my first, reasonably priced, mount I looted a very cool collectable Hellbug mount from a standard Rift event, that starts off at the slowest mounts speed but will increase speed to match my fastest mount when I get one. I thought this was a very nice touch.From my experience so far it pretty much cuts all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you encounter in most other MMO's that make them such  awful grinds and keeps you entertained and engaged the whole time. Highly recommended to any fans of MMORPGs			"

As a free to play player you have can play all content All for free! Alot of people say it is like world of warcraft IT IS NOTHING LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT Just because it has the same combat Of  World of warcraft Does not mean it is a clone WoW does not have rifts And it does not have dimensions This game has nice pvp AKA WARFRONTS Warfronts is a place where you can join to do kinda like open world pvp! It is very fun! You can even go guild vs guild AND YOU CAN RAGE WAR AGENST THE OTHER FACTION! IT IS SO MUCH FUN! This game is so much fun doing rifts and the new nightmare rifts are AMAZING And you get amazing loot you can even earn mounts threw completing rifts I got a giant fire bug mount From doing a fire rift! And the story line is really nice i recommend being a defiant when playing rift because defiants area is alot more open and easyer to find rifts in the defiant area! Just my opinion about the defiant area. I highly recommend this game it is the best mmorpg i have EVER PLAYED!			"

												This is probably my favorite MMORPG. I've only played a few, counting this one. And so far, this one has not failed to impress. Even on the lowered graphics I'm forced to play on, due to my laptop, the game still looks amazing. The gameplay, since I'm used to its controls, is intense but not overwhelming. A lot of the MMORPG elements found in similar games by other companies are still present, but Glyph really outdid themselves in Rift. The socia lsystem is very neat and organized, and gameplay is nice, and I just think this is a fantastic game comepletely. The only thing I think Glyph should add is a chat system. That would really immerse the players even more. But then again, this is just my opinion. I give it 8.5 Platinum/10 Platinum. I recommend this game to anyone who likes MMORPG's that are not too complex.			"

												Edit: If you like PvP, and want to choose map/mode, this game might not be for you, if you plan on playing it for free. I myself don't really like PvP, so I'm giving it a positive review.I've been trying out a lot of MMOs, but I keep falling back to this one.For being a F2P game it's really good, and has lots to offer. There are no ""pay to win"" options, except being able to buy out more slots for proffesions (which I love, since then I can be more creative with my Dimensions), and cosmetic stuff/nice looking mounts.This game doesn't push you to pay for gems, but instead they reward you with great gifts if you do :) And alot of the stuff you can buy can also be bought with in-game cash, but you might have to grind some for it :) There are also a way to get gems with in-game cash, you just need to buy it from other players :) This also will require a lot of grinding, though.There aren't many races on each alliance, but the 4 classes in the game can be built almost however you like it, especially if you buy the 2 soul-packs.This game isn't just good with the gameplay, it looks good as well. The gameplay is really similar to World of Warcraft, but Rift has a better look and is F2P. So for those who are looking for a F2P game similar to WoW, this might be your free WoW-clone :) Since it's free, it's worth to at least try once :p9/10 from me!			"

												As a former World of Warcraft player, I have to say that I enjoy the world of RIFT much better. Aside from the missions you accumulate throughout the game, you get to open and seal Rifts and gain notoriety and other goodies. The story line is interesting and is, so far, fun to live out. You can collect items that offer side missions which garner coins, notoriety and other rewards. The Ascended Carnival is going on at the moment and it also offers new and interesting games and items. Overall, I would give this game a solid 4 1/2 stars out of 5. The only things I don't like are the need to keep purchasing tokens with real money with no way to earn any in-game and the fact that there are only 6 different character types. I'd like to have more character types to choose from, but other than those 2 minor issued, it's an all around grat game.			"

												I always come back and try Rift when a new major update drops just to see what's changed since the first release. Here's my thoughts having played Storm Legion and Nightmare Tide a fair bit (without Starfall Prophecy):The game is absolutely beautiful and much of the content is very creative and isn't ""grindy"" like Aion (flashbacks) or... whatever Tera is. The class system is much like Guild Wars except there's not really a dominant meta because every class (now) can do everything (after you pass a pay wall). The levelling is quite fast now to get you into ""relevant territory"" which, for me, is a shame. D&DO's,  WoW's, and EQ2's vanilla progressions were tight because you had to *work* to get to end game and you felt a sense of satisfaction when you accomplished it.That all being said, RIFT is different now. The LFR and Dungeon system that matches you with people and funnels you around Telara to power-level is... interesting. MMOs have become more bite-sized and if you like that, you might like RIFT. Is it better than, say, Legion? Probably not. The aestethics are there, but the polish and weight to your play isn't.Overall, I'd recommend it with the caveat that it's because it's better than most MMORPGs out there. It's not the best but it's ""free"".			"

												Downvote on game purely on the fact that the gameplay is fairly boring hotkey spam. The interface is messy and takes the player time to get used to. The game also doesen't explain most of the features too well. The game itself is just basicly a quest / grindfest of your typical generic stuff. Items in the game are only +stat, with no special abilities or nothing. Overall the game is decent looking and can appeal to some players, but for anyone looking for something out of the typical box, it will get boring after a few hours.I would also say the game is a good example of the modern day easy playing, that does not appeal to the oldschool hardcore gamers at all.

												TL;DR, Don't waste your time.I waited for this to download. I waited for Glyph to install. I waited for the e-mail from Glyph that told me I had to do it because I was using a different computer. I waited for Glyph to update. I waited for Glyph to tell me the current version of my game needed to be completely re-installed. I waited for it to install it all again. I waited and waited, all so I could play this game and you know what? I have no FREAKIN' idea why I did!I got to the fabled Customization menu. I figured since so many people were saying such great and grand things about it that I'd love it to death. You see I have this problem with loving to customize my characters too much that I spend hours in it. After picking a side and a character type I finally saw the options it gave. Really? That's it? I've seen better customization in Vindictus or APB. It's literally ever so slightly better than SWTOR's customization but it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Oh, wait, you have to buy those improvements... with real money. Great. So I get one set of options and everything else possible is something I have to buy. Nothing I haven't seen before. So I ignored it.My character looked about as generic as a Skyrim character by the end of it. And you know what else? It looked worse In-game than it did in the character creation screen. I figured it was my settings. I noticed that it was set to Custom and that everything looked terrible. I did what any smart gamer would do and put it to Ultra. It looked the exact freakin' same. I put it to Custom and maxed out everything slowly, checking for differences in between. No changes that greatly improved the game's look. Wow, so everything looks like a dated 2000's MMO game. Awesome! -_-So my character's head looked well modeled but the body didn't. I could clearly see a low texture just under the neck line as everything there looked like pixels. Burry, crappy, pixels. This was all with everything on Maximum settings. Sure, the hair looked nice and shinny and never changed but my character's arms looked off, either too long or too pixeled. I blamed the textures.I figured, maybe the gameplay is better than it looks since the menu selecting my class type looked very promising. HA! Big fat nothing there. It's basically a mish-mash of talents used to create a supposed new class. I ended up getting two skills that are almost 100% exactly the same. The ""build guide"" used for the Tanky Tank just placed points into both Tanking trees and gave whatever double ups there were. The talents in general are either meh or interesting but there just so damn many of them. The trees also go in two directions. I hadn't seen split points since Titan Quest and at least there it did it right. Alright, so were the skills at least good? Nope. Basically exactly the same as WoW with possibly better looking icons and Action Bar animations. The XP bar looked great but leveling up was pretty lackluster.So, I played the damn game. I accepted quests and did as they asked. Normal stupid fetch this, or wack that 4 times. None of them were interesting or challenging. I continued, I used my skills like they were intended but I must be too low a level to feel the real greatness of the game because after leveling a few times on the most boring enemies period, It was just tiresome. Enemies that did attack you, didn't pose an actual threat. Enemies you attacked, barely could defend themselves. I stopped attacking to see if one could kill me and it took so long just to get me CLOSE to half health that I killed it. The combat never improved enough to stop me from being bored of it as a whole. My skills weren't interesting to use nor were they fun.The animations looked like a good start but the actual skills were just copy-pastes. The skill effects were as you expected up until the fact that the Tank is basically playing as a Rogue. Instead of Combo Points I have... Attack Points. Like WoW, I get the little icon and improve damage.The areas looked less fantasy like and more generic MMO trying its hardest to be realistic looking. For me, it looked bland, boring and useless. Nothing was unique about it. Nothing I haven't seen a million times in lesser games already.I couldn't get past how worse than WoW it looked and felt. For a WoW clone you'd think they'd get this down.Anyway, I've moaned enough about this game.			"

												8/10My favourite F2P MMO so far, RIFT is a pretty good example of a decent F2P model that doesn't jeopardise playability for money-grubbing. It adds to the now-standard WoW-type gameplay and the rifts themselves add a lot. Crafting is fun, but I haven't touched PvP. Almost 30 hours in and I'm level 24. Good pace and not too easy.Loses points in that it follows the same cookie-cutter MMO stylings throughout (which isn't necessarily a bad thing if done right!)			"

												It's just another MMORPG. There's nothing special about it for me.After trying it again, I couldn't get it to load. Well, I could, but it would take like 30 minutes just to start. Also, I hate the race selection. What race do you want? Oh, well I want to be something animal or lizard or something. Too bad, you get humans and humans with make-up.When a game does that to its race selection, it's already got a 50% chance of being bad. Just automatically in my opinion.I don't like this game and I despize it for being one of the many games with a human superiority complex.			"

												I've used to play rift while it was p2p and I liked it a lot. It was like an ice cream in hot summer day. Any other MMO(you know which one I mean at first) could do nothing in comparison. Soul system, rifts, crafting... Oh man! It's amazing! Well it was amazing even on f2p until nightmare tide expansion. Today it's too dull, stroyline is crapped, it's has a lot of sleepy quests. Crafting and gearing system sucks - item upgrades are not the best solution. All you need to do is searching for another one component for your gear. Or pay.OK.There is no ""OR"", you will pay. Dunno id one have to buy a game at lvl 25 now - I got it for free as p2p player, perhaps it's not required now.  BUT if you don't have special souls, you will suck. In solo, in PvE, PvP... Pros: interesting class-building systemNice graphicsCool PvE dungeon mechanicsCons: Donate.60+ lvl gameplay.Donate.			"

												This game is only ok. It is a run-of-the-mill MMORPG and adds nothing new to the genre. The combat model is old news and boring. The maps are particularly bad when you get into a dungeon. The world map shows the suface not the dungeon; and the mini-map is too small to see the entire dungeon. One of the more troubling aspects of the game is the use of quests triggering one-way portals to areas that are above your level. They should at least give you the chance to refuse portal. Then you could research the quest to determine if you want to do it. As it is you get locked into an area where you can't get out without completing every branch of the quests. If you get stuck and can't get help your best bet is to start a new character. Lots of people have said how helpful everyone is and it is no different from any other MMORPG. I have a ticket open for 24 hours with no response. I asked for help in-game and could not find any players willing to help. If you are considering playing this, don't buy any of the content or subscribe to it until you have played it for several days.			"

												At first I thought it was just another WoW clone. On the surface that is very much what it looks like. In fact its one of the most WoW lookin WoW clones I've ever played. In a way though thats good. Seasoned WoW players can jump right in. For me though the sheer amount of WoW clones is what essentially made me give up on the MMO scene for a long time. I found most MMORPG's lately are just very stale and repetitive with too much grinding for not enough reward However as you play the game more you learn about the rift invasions, soul swapping and many other features that just bring a whole new depth into the game. You can completely customise your characters by combining 3 different classes together. I recently looted some gear that was recommended for a Cleric Rogue Warrior. That pretty much says it all as far as I'm concerned. Not to mention that theres none of this ""Reach level X and pay a ridiculous amount of (game currency) to learn how to ride a boring slow horse"". When I was level 15 (and essentially still learning how to play the game) and on my way to buy my first, reasonably priced, mount I looted a very cool collectable Hellbug mount from a standard Rift event, that starts off at the slowest mounts speed but will increase speed to match my fastest mount when I get one. I thought this was a very nice touch.From my experience so far it pretty much cuts all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you encounter in most other MMO's that make them such  awful grinds and keeps you entertained and engaged the whole time. Highly recommended to any fans of MMORPGs			"

												At first I thought it was just another WoW clone. On the surface that is very much what it looks like. In fact its one of the most WoW lookin WoW clones I've ever played. In a way though thats good. Seasoned WoW players can jump right in. For me though the sheer amount of WoW clones is what essentially made me give up on the MMO scene for a long time. I found most MMORPG's lately are just very stale and repetitive with too much grinding for not enough reward However as you play the game more you learn about the rift invasions, soul swapping and many other features that just bring a whole new depth into the game. You can completely customise your characters by combining 3 different classes together. I recently looted some gear that was recommended for a Cleric Rogue Warrior. That pretty much says it all as far as I'm concerned. Not to mention that theres none of this ""Reach level X and pay a ridiculous amount of (game currency) to learn how to ride a boring slow horse"". When I was level 15 (and essentially still learning how to play the game) and on my way to buy my first, reasonably priced, mount I looted a very cool collectable Hellbug mount from a standard Rift event, that starts off at the slowest mounts speed but will increase speed to match my fastest mount when I get one. I thought this was a very nice touch.From my experience so far it pretty much cuts all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you encounter in most other MMO's that make them such  awful grinds and keeps you entertained and engaged the whole time. Highly recommended to any fans of MMORPGs			"

												8/10My favourite F2P MMO so far, RIFT is a pretty good example of a decent F2P model that doesn't jeopardise playability for money-grubbing. It adds to the now-standard WoW-type gameplay and the rifts themselves add a lot. Crafting is fun, but I haven't touched PvP. Almost 30 hours in and I'm level 24. Good pace and not too easy.Loses points in that it follows the same cookie-cutter MMO stylings throughout (which isn't necessarily a bad thing if done right!)			"

												I started playing this as I got fed up with Guild Wars 2. Don't get me wrong, I love GW2 but wanted a bit more of a challenge.Rift is an excellent MMORPG in an almost identical vein to World of Warcraft (another game I enjoyed but got fed up with the subscription).Lush visuals, exciting battles and quick party gameplay make this a must-play choice for anyone looking for something 'a bit different but familiar'.There are pay to play stuff in here but it is not necessary to still enjoy.8.5/10.

												If you're looking for an MMO (why would you do this?), you could do a hell of a lot worse. Trion knows what they're doing w/r/t game balance, and the flexibility of the soul system gives you a lot of versatility while soloing and in dungeons -- every class is capable of damage-dealing and at least one other role (like tanking or healing), and you can swap roles at any time when you're not in combat. Add in a robust player housing system with dimensions and a bunch of ridiculously awesome, though not particularly necessary, IRL moneysinks and you've got yourself a pretty fun MMO. Trion releases new content at a good clip, too!			"

												I've played this game off and on since launch. I have to say is this: The game is great. They consistently add large amounts of content. This is due to the money they are making off of the FTP you all seem to hate. The content flow is greater, larger and more consistent than the sub base. Every time I come back, plenty new to discover. If you're looking for a free to play MMO, there is no questions this is probably the best. By free to play, I mean completely free to start playing. Not buy once, continue playing, puchasing items here and there. Here, you download, play for free, entire game if you want, and put some money in it if you want as well. You can't get everything for free? Get over it. It's a great game. Great content. Solid.I hope it makes enough money to justify a Rift 2, one that isn't over shadowed by a still going strong WoW. When this game was released it was called a WoW clone. As was every other MMO during that time. Guild wars 2 was the only one that managed to drift away, but took a long time to become what it is now. As did Rift. As did WoW.And this is free. Being compared to those games. Skip the reviews. Play it, or don't. Just don't waste your time reading peoples reviews that complain a massive MMORPG, isn't 150% free. Go play SWTOR. Check out those FtP restrictions. Or any other Ftp MMO...			"

Posted: October 5, 2016
												Alright. This will probably be lengthy.My perspective on the game: I was once a top raider in the game. I have also put hundreds of hours into the game as a casual. The 728 hours that steam has me, is only when I played the game through steam. I have over 1,000 easy. I started playing at the start of Storm Legion, RIFT's 2nd expansion. So that's a bit about me.Game's content: Readily avaiable to you is 3 full expansions worth of content. If you want to play the game solo, you have 3 expansions of achievements, shinies, and whatever else you could want. You will have to drop some cash if you want access to the auction house, or you can save up plat to get it for free by getting a rex from another player in game. Beyond that, there are old world dungeon queues that will take around an hour or longer to pop. You can keep playing the game while you wait for the queue to pop, as in you can continue questing. Due to DPS/health changes that happened during RIFT's 3rd expansion, these dungeons have become very easy. Basically you can level on your own until about lvl 60 before you even see more than 2 or 3 other people in the game. Once you hit the 60-65 zones you might see 4-5 people every couple hours. At end game, which is were most players are, you will  be at the lull while players are waiting for the new expansion. It's a good time to join RIFT because the new level cap means the new BIS gear is going to be available in the 2 new dungeons. how the loot drops will work to cover 5 classes in 2 dungeons is beyond me, but we'll see.Instant Adventures: *INTREPID* For some reason this is one of the games biggest selling points. For reasons beyond me, people actually do this. Basically it takes you through the end game raids in more fun enviroment. The maps are huge and look amazing, but what you actually do is very quest grindy. Kill these, click those, and then finally you do a boss with some basic mechanics that could kill a whole bunch of you. Team work within your group is required. *OTHER THAN INTREPID* Well, that is based in the open world and you will be running around basically questing.PVP: Not so good. The skill cap is pretty low. As in you won't be able to 1 vs 3... and they'd have to be pretty bad for you to 1 vs 2. That would make you feel okay, but this is a game where people make 1 or 2 button macros and ignore the rest of their abilities. If you take the time and research your class and actually read your soul tree, you'll do above average in pvp, but it isn't really what you want to play this game for.Raiding: Not really competitive at the moment. Mostly casual players going through the raids at a steady pace. Once a guild or 2 clears content at a difficult setting, the raid is nerfed to allow more players to clear content, and then nerfed again and again until the most casual players can clear the content. That's not a bad thing. They do look stunning though. And they fit the lore very well. You can go back and solo some of the vanilla raids, and they just look so cool. Hedges constantly moving around like a maze. It really is fun to go into them.The Developers: This topic could be long, but I'll just keep it short. This would be the only valid reason to not play this game. Just check out the MMORift reddit page to see a couple area's where the dev team has screwed the player base.Cash shop: It isn't as bad as most players think. It's worth mentioning that 2 expacs came out before RIFT went F2P. It's very noticeable. You will hit a paywall with the newest expansion to arrive in November, and only slight pay walls before that. Everything up to this point is attainable without spending cash. It helps to reduce time, but isn't required what-so-ever. With the latest expansion you simply pay for it, no choice in skipping time, it's just a hard paywall. I am guessing this will be RIFT's last expansion, so DO NOT RUSH! If there's an option to grind, just take your time and do it. It will be a slow moving game from here on out.Why am I saying you should play it? The timing is great. You can drop $40 on the game and play the newest expansion in a game that is about to turn into a very filtered community. As in the people that you log on and play with everyday are going to be Really good people. They might not be amazing at the game, but they will make you laugh and you will have fun with them. You will slowly progress through content, probably not by choice, but that will be how the pacing will work. RIFT is going to go into a low life-support mode after the expansion and that can be a very good thing for a long term player. You will have a boat load of time to catch up if they ever do release new content, and you will enjoy the time with some of the best players the MMO community has left to offer. As long as the devs leave you alone, play the hell out of this game. "

												I remeber actually pre-ordering this game and enjoying the living hell out of it years ago. It was a familiar game to play but had it's own personality. Like every MMO though it quickly went F2P as soon as the devs realized the players base was dropping, instead of creating interesting new content like raids classes and rewards like mounts and special armors. they made it free to play added an industry standard cash shop and inevitably killed their game.Many may not agree with me on this but this is the game that got me away from World of Warcraft, it showed me there were other options. I have fallen for Trions MMO trap twice now, with this game and again with Defiance (mmostly because my wife and I enjoyed the show at the time). I highly recommend you don't even bother trying this game as a free player now, your time is far more valuable and there are much, much better free to play games available.			"

												Good afternoon,I have passed a long time on Rift when it required a mountly payement. With my friends we enjoyed plenty  hours of playing. The game have it story, very understandible. If I can say that this game is a combination of WoW, Everquest and Rune of Magic, I would not be far. I realy apreciate, the possibility of combinating talents of 3 classes of your choice. You have 4 Maine classes and each one have 9 others. So the combination choice is maximal and evryone can be different than the others. The pvp in very well done, But I think they changed the game a lot since it is Free-to-play, becouse I get killed all the time... I can say Yes to Rift becouse, this MMO is a high quality MMO and the best of all free mmo I have ever seen.Good luck and try it when you can!Bye Rungoza :p "

												Downvote on game purely on the fact that the gameplay is fairly boring hotkey spam. The interface is messy and takes the player time to get used to. The game also doesen't explain most of the features too well. The game itself is just basicly a quest / grindfest of your typical generic stuff. Items in the game are only +stat, with no special abilities or nothing. Overall the game is decent looking and can appeal to some players, but for anyone looking for something out of the typical box, it will get boring after a few hours.I would also say the game is a good example of the modern day easy playing, that does not appeal to the oldschool hardcore gamers at all.

I waited for the e-mail from Glyph that told me I had to do it because I was using a different computer. I waited for Glyph to update. I waited for Glyph to tell me the current version of my game needed to be completely re-installed. I waited for it to install it all again. I waited and waited, all so I could play this game and you know what? I have no FREAKIN' idea why I did!I got to the fabled Customization menu. I figured since so many people were saying such great and grand things about it that I'd love it to death. You see I have this problem with loving to customize my characters too much that I spend hours in it. After picking a side and a character type I finally saw the options it gave. Really? That's it? I've seen better customization in Vindictus or APB. It's literally ever so slightly better than SWTOR's customization but it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Oh, wait, you have to buy those improvements... with real money. Great. So I get one set of options and everything else possible is something I have to buy. Nothing I haven't seen before. So I ignored it.My character looked about as generic as a Skyrim character by the end of it. And you know what else? It looked worse In-game than it did in the character creation screen. I figured it was my settings. I noticed that it was set to Custom and that everything looked terrible. I did what any smart gamer would do and put it to Ultra. It looked the exact freakin' same. I put it to Custom and maxed out everything slowly, checking for differences in between. No changes that greatly improved the game's look. Wow, so everything looks like a dated 2000's MMO game. Awesome! -_-So my character's head looked well modeled but the body didn't. I could clearly see a low texture just under the neck line as everything there looked like pixels. Burry, crappy, pixels. This was all with everything on Maximum settings. Sure, the hair looked nice and shinny and never changed but my character's arms looked off, either too long or too pixeled. I blamed the textures.I figured, maybe the gameplay is better than it looks since the menu selecting my class type looked very promising. HA! Big fat nothing there. It's basically a mish-mash of talents used to create a supposed new class. I ended up getting two skills that are almost 100% exactly the same. The ""build guide"" used for the Tanky Tank just placed points into both Tanking trees and gave whatever double ups there were. The talents in general are either meh or interesting but there just so damn many of them. The trees also go in two directions. I hadn't seen split points since Titan Quest and at least there it did it right. Alright, so were the skills at least good? Nope. Basically exactly the same as WoW with possibly better looking icons and Action Bar animations. The XP bar looked great but leveling up was pretty lackluster.So, I played the damn game. I accepted quests and did as they asked. Normal stupid fetch this, or wack that 4 times. None of them were interesting or challenging. I continued, I used my skills like they were intended but I must be too low a level to feel the real greatness of the game because after leveling a few times on the most boring enemies period, It was just tiresome. Enemies that did attack you, didn't pose an actual threat. Enemies you attacked, barely could defend themselves. I stopped attacking to see if one could kill me and it took so long just to get me CLOSE to half health that I killed it. The combat never improved enough to stop me from being bored of it as a whole. My skills weren't interesting to use nor were they fun.The animations looked like a good start but the actual skills were just copy-pastes. The skill effects were as you expected up until the fact that the Tank is basically playing as a Rogue. Instead of Combo Points I have... Attack Points. Like WoW, I get the little icon and improve damage.The areas looked less fantasy like and more generic MMO trying its hardest to be realistic looking. For me, it looked bland, boring and useless. Nothing was unique about it. Nothing I haven't seen a million times in lesser games already.I couldn't get past how worse than WoW it looked and felt. For a WoW clone you'd think they'd get this down.Anyway, I've moaned enough about this game.			"

												First MMO i really got into before this was even on steam. Probably have about 300 hrs on this game in total. Its a great MMO imo, but for those who have played WOW probably see it as a clone to it. I must say tho if you are new to MMO;s play this one, its farily easy to get into, a lot of fun and quite a bit of people still play it. As well at this point where there are more expantions to the game since i last truely played- the end game content has improved and there is more to do now than ever before.			"

												Rift did quite well when it launched. It sold 2 million units and held a pay to play model of $15/month, competed well with WoW, kept updating content without releasing new games, and went free to play with microtransactions. I purchased into this games early launch beta and played for the first 3 months of it's launch.Rift is a great MMO, encourages exploration and has many puzzle mini games that are quite fun and refreshing after you have been questing and/or closing rifts. The raiding/group system is much like wow with support roles having a magnified and essential role within the group. There are 20 man raids which consist of 4 groups of 5. The 5 man dungeons in Rift consist of a tank, healer, support which heals and does damage at the same time, and two dps classes. The talent trees are fun and innovative, there are 4 classes (mage, rogue, cleric, warrior) and each has 8 talent trees of which you can have 3 active at a time to build your character and dictate what spells and abilities it will have. You can buy many extra talent specs, I know of at least 5 specs being possible. I play a rogue class and it has 1 tank spec, 1 support/heal spec, and 6 dps specs. There is an aoe spec, stealth assasin spec, ranged marksman spec, ranged hunter with animal pet spec, elemental dps spec, and a pvp spec that has high evasion. I can't speak much for the other classes but I know that the mage has 1 support/heal spec and 7 dps specs, summoner, spellcaster builds, etc. The Cleric has a couple tank specs, many heal specs, and pvp dps tank specs. The warrior has 3 tank specs and 5 dps specs. I don't know much about the other classes but that should be a good enough overview, pardon me if there are discrepenciesThere is an intricate player housing system. You can work towards filling your 'dimension' as they are called with tons and tons of items. Items such as beds, chairs, bookshelves, etc. There are More than 200 from what I have seen. Some are purchased through reputation which you have to grind like WoW, some are bought through the microtransactions store, you can trade for things other players have bought, and you can find things in the open world as well as from Group and Raid rifts.The warfront system is the PvP system in Rift and it is quite fun, there are multiple modes, capture the flag, control points for an amount of time, etc. Much like WoW again. I don't PvP much if at all, it's not what I like about MMOs.This game had a lot going for it and still does, it has aged very well, still has an active community, and will run on most rigs. It was a strong competitor of WoW and still continues to provide content updates and a fresh take on the MMO genre. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												Very interesting RPG. Kept my attention but only cured boredom for so long. When I did play it frequently - I absolutely loved it. The visuals are great and I love how you can customize your character as you level up. And it's free. A drawback for me though is having to download different software to play this game. I personally prefer having a game come straight from Steam and not requiring any secondary downloads. That's the only thing for me otherwise, I think this game is pretty great. Rate: 8 out of 10.

												It's like TBC WoW, and it's free, if you have patience to grind resources, then sell them on chat and a helpful guild to give ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bonuses you can and will enjoy this game to its fullest, free of charge, I'm full T1-T2 and only paid for Cosmetics (because I really liked some skins) and I regret it everyday since now you can craft cosmetics in the game with certain proffs. The only reason you would pay is if you are really impatient with grinding marks and stuff , money advances you faster, but with the last Tiers of armor in the game , money doesn't help. Good ol' TBC-level raids, with complex and easy bosses . 7 x T1/20man bosses, 4 x T1/10man bosses, 11xT2/20man bosses and 4xT2/10man bosses. The 10man raids also have Hardmodes for extra drops of the same tier or Easy mode if you just want the marks and dont need drops anymore.I've played WoW, Aion and Dragons Prophet before, this game is the best of them for 0 money.Kids who can't grind daily quests because of ADHD will complain that you need to pay for AH permission and Earring Wearing Permission, but in truth in 2 weeks max of grind you are the same as if you've paid 64.99 Euro.

												I've played a lot of games that were massively multiplayer with open world pvp. This one takes the cake. You can play solo, with friends, or with a guild. Pugs happen almost sporadically as there are several world events or zome events happening at the same time.The crafting is great. The fighting is great. Heck, you can even craft dimensions, which are private or public personal spaces for people to visit with you that are virtually fully customizable.The community is phenomenal. I am sad that I did not get into this game sooner.			"

												RIFT... its like Wow, but with less paywalls. Its f2p through and through, as far as i can tell, with cosmetics that you can buy with real money. It isn't p2w, I'd say... Love it though, its simple, actiony, and all around fun!Pros-Concise-Great graphics-Good community-Everytime you find a new weapon, it saves its appearance as a skin, which you can put on your other weapons. ie, Steel Longsword could look like a rare tier weapon, but still holds the Steel longswords stats.-Decent classes that aren't super limited to their weapon orientationCons-Easily gets boring-PvP is sometimes a bit unfair in the matchmaking department, but I wont complain.-Armor is kind of plain, which makes it realistic, but cmon...-Story kind of falls through after a whileAll in all, 8/10 game.

												After many years of playing World Of Warcraft, for me, RIFT is everything WOW is not. I feel that RIFT is like a better looking younger brother, copying WOW's every move but doing it slightly better. On some forums I would be shot for saying such things but it's true. RIFT is an incredibly immersive experience with a silly amount of stuff to do. Listing the positives would result in a very long review so I'll say this; Play it, level a character and find a decent guild native to your geographial location. It will take you about a year until you start getting bored then you can play around with the custom dimension building after which time a new expansion will be released!My only bad note is that it's free to play with in game purchase options. Personally I'm against this structure but they have kept the good stuff out of reach of fat wallet speed demons!			"

												I played GW2 first and many ways Rift is like that - lot of dynamic events and tons of things what you can do.Economic seems to be fair enough, you can earn game currency (= value of real money) via playing so if you determined enough, you can unlock everything in time without paying.Story is interesting and levelling really fun and rewarding.This isnt perfect game but very nice mmorpg and one of the best F2P for sure.7/10EDITED:After playing this around 200hrs I saw where its going. Potential was there but end game just not for new players since there isnt that much players around anymore. Its common problem for mmorpg`s which been there a long time.Its almost impossible for new player to do daily runs to get goodies which are needed for best items.Anyway, it was fun but as always, its time to move on.

												 This game is interesting, and surprisingly entertaining if playing with a group or friends. That is, ""if"" playing with a group or friends. It's a bit boring when you don't have anyone to adventure with. Although there are guilds and parties, it's a much better experience to play the story with someone you know. To make a general score and idea of this game, it's fun because you try it.. but then it gets boring. Although some people enjoy it a lot, I just find it boring.  It's a good MMO, but I guess I just find MMO's boring in general. Score: 7/10			"

Its a great MMO imo, but for those who have played WOW probably see it as a clone to it. I must say tho if you are new to MMO;s play this one, its farily easy to get into, a lot of fun and quite a bit of people still play it. As well at this point where there are more expantions to the game since i last truely played- the end game content has improved and there is more to do now than ever before.			"

												Rift did quite well when it launched. It sold 2 million units and held a pay to play model of $15/month, competed well with WoW, kept updating content without releasing new games, and went free to play with microtransactions. I purchased into this games early launch beta and played for the first 3 months of it's launch.Rift is a great MMO, encourages exploration and has many puzzle mini games that are quite fun and refreshing after you have been questing and/or closing rifts. The raiding/group system is much like wow with support roles having a magnified and essential role within the group. There are 20 man raids which consist of 4 groups of 5. The 5 man dungeons in Rift consist of a tank, healer, support which heals and does damage at the same time, and two dps classes. The talent trees are fun and innovative, there are 4 classes (mage, rogue, cleric, warrior) and each has 8 talent trees of which you can have 3 active at a time to build your character and dictate what spells and abilities it will have. You can buy many extra talent specs, I know of at least 5 specs being possible. I play a rogue class and it has 1 tank spec, 1 support/heal spec, and 6 dps specs. There is an aoe spec, stealth assasin spec, ranged marksman spec, ranged hunter with animal pet spec, elemental dps spec, and a pvp spec that has high evasion. I can't speak much for the other classes but I know that the mage has 1 support/heal spec and 7 dps specs, summoner, spellcaster builds, etc. The Cleric has a couple tank specs, many heal specs, and pvp dps tank specs. The warrior has 3 tank specs and 5 dps specs. I don't know much about the other classes but that should be a good enough overview, pardon me if there are discrepenciesThere is an intricate player housing system. You can work towards filling your 'dimension' as they are called with tons and tons of items. Items such as beds, chairs, bookshelves, etc. There are More than 200 from what I have seen. Some are purchased through reputation which you have to grind like WoW, some are bought through the microtransactions store, you can trade for things other players have bought, and you can find things in the open world as well as from Group and Raid rifts.The warfront system is the PvP system in Rift and it is quite fun, there are multiple modes, capture the flag, control points for an amount of time, etc. Much like WoW again. I don't PvP much if at all, it's not what I like about MMOs.This game had a lot going for it and still does, it has aged very well, still has an active community, and will run on most rigs. It was a strong competitor of WoW and still continues to provide content updates and a fresh take on the MMO genre. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												Have technically played this game since launch, and have 3 level 50+s.If you are looking for a MMO, I'd definitely give this game a shot, it's pretty old but it has a ton of content for free.With that said, I would never purchase 95% of the things in the store because they are severely overpriced. If you can't see beyond the cash shop (which is pretty much entirely optional outside of primalist and some souls) then don't try this game. If you can see that there is quite a lot of free content available, only barring you from a few souls and one class, all of which are either balanced or weaker than their counterparts, you should definitely try it out. I used to raid in Rift a long time ago, the raiding was actually better than WoW's at the time, I believe it was Post-Ulduar WotLK, which I never found fun (ICC was decent at best). Nowadays the raiding is still pretty great, not quite BC-quality raiding, but it's certainly better than most raiding out right now in any other game.As for the PvP, it's pretty much just like WoW's PvP, what do you expect?Leveling blows, just like in any other MMO, and the story is extremely mediocre, but what MMOs actually do leveling right nowadays? The only one I can think of is FF14.All in all, if you're a raider, then give the game a shot for sure.			"

												I've played many, many MMOs over the years, and this happens to be one out of the five that I keep coming back to. If you are like many people that I have met and have wanted to bring your friends into a game but find that backtracking or making another character is just sooo boring, or sooo painful to do, this is your game. This is the game that ends that. You wanna know how? Simple.You can delevel yourself without it being permanent, so playing with new player friends, guildies, strangers, or experiencing old content you liked is no longer an issue. Pretty damn sick, right? I've only known Guild Wars 2 to do this, and I really didn't like how it was...forced. But that's because I'm one of those pain-in-the-asses that doesn't like the content to pummel the crap out of me just because I wanted to go and help my buddy on his quest to kill an elite monster.I'm also a sucker for dungeons and PVE content, and they seem to always be improving. Solo content is also pretty rewarding, but please remember this is an MMO, so you're going to have a ton of those ""kill some rats and I'll give you some silver, pretty boy"" quests. Not sure why people complain about that when they know what kind of game this is in the first place.Do you like roleplaying? If so, they have a dedicated roleplaying server. This is definitely worth looking into seeing as the community isn't all that horrible to each other LIKE SOME GAMES WE KNOW OF. *Cough cough*I also believe the most hardcore selling point of this entire thing is the customization of your class. You get to mix and match three ""souls"" to change up your abilities and buffs. Purchasing more than one specialization to have more combinations of these specs is done with the in game currency rather than the cash, and few of the other souls are locked by the cash as well. Spending money also is very, very worth it, and this is coming from someone that is very stingy if it's a free to play game. I don't believe in throwing my paycheck at something unless it's a damn good deal, and these guys know how to build their microtransaction shop. Plus, the option of a subscription is even better. Nice buffs to your experience gain and gold gain that you can switch off at any time.If there's anything to hate, it's probably the weird sci-fi fantasy mix of a story they made. I've seen far better. But I'm picky.			"

												If you like WoW when it first started out, you will like this game. The graphics are nice, the story is interesting enough for me to not pay attention to, and I am close to unlocking a pet wolf. The only down side is I want a cat... I guess I can get a cat mount? Or a small cat pet? I am only 2 hours in. Still a lot to discover and a lot of quests to do. The only bad things I have noticed is a but of camera angle issues (nothing major) that can be annoying, and my fiance not wanting to play it with me :( Boooo!!! I'll give it Cat/10 - Not quite good enough for Cats but completely acceptable for Cat.			"

												Been playing since before it was out on Steam, and in all honesty a very great game to play. Graphics are very beautiful, playstyle is very easy to navigate, story is fairly decent, plenty of Raids and Dungeons to do if thats your type of thing. A real generic MMO style like WoW, with a twist, its free. Only thing really bad about the game is the lack of player base unfortunately, its not as populated as it once was which is a real shame, this game had huge potential.			"

												This game is sweet. Gives you a good ol' familiar Wow feeling with some new and exciting elements. If you are familiar with Wow you are gonna enjoy this game. It's not pay to win but you gotta invest atleast 5eu and buy credits with which you automaticlly unlock the option to use sell option in auction house. The rest of the points you can spend on w/e you want. Which isn't much if you consider the fact that it's a FREE game.Only negative thing is that it could use more players but still you can find groups for quests, dungeons and raids.Give it a try if you like mmorpgs!

												Sometimes all you want is a game that feels like WoW but isnt quite WoW, and improves on the WoW class formula in ways that encourage you to experiment on the go. And sometimes you want that game yo have dynamic events where your questing is interrupted by ♥♥♥♥ing portals spewing mobs into your questhubs, thus killing your questgivers. Those are all very specific wishes, buddy. Rift delivers on both accounts.Rift is good. Awesome questing, lovely graphics, a class system that is better than most MMOs although the combat is your standard cooldown roration based system. Endgame... not as good as WoW. But then again, what is?			"

												Rift is a pretty good MMO. I've enjoyed playing it. It plays much like a standard MMO does with action bars and the like. However Rift feels more ""polished"" than other MMO's i've played. The world feels like it's been filled with worthwhile distractions and adventures. I recommend this game to anyone who has some free time and is looking for a new MMO to try out.And it is free to try out, so...go try it and see if you like too.-Dark			"

												Lol I got banned on the character creation screen.  It was literally my first time playing the game, first character creation.  Was in the process of creating the character and got kicked out saying I was permanently banned for cheating.After talking back and forth with multiple people from support for a while, they not only refused to unban me for the nonsense, but they also refused to tell me why I was banned.  I never got any indication for it.  The only thing that I can think of was at the time, I had a Razer Nostromo gamepad plugged in and it has macro support, yet they don't allow macros.  I wasn't using it though.Fast forward several months, I was unbanned for some reason so I gave the game a try.  Although it's a fun game with a lot of class/skill customization, I've since moved on to other games.TL;DR - Fun game, bad support staff.  Don't leave your Razer Nostromo plugged in.			"

												I've played Rift since beta and I have to say teh Gameplay has got since release. Was not a bad game at all but like all games on release there is just so much that can be better and I have to say Trion is pretty good at doing that. People say it's a P2W but that certainly isn't true, on release it used to be SUB only and it went F2P later. Since then you have more problems with the game but that's to be expected. You never HAVE to actually spend any money beyond the inital $5 it takes to make your account a NON FTP account. There are so many rich peopel that buy things in game and you can just pay them in game currecny for ANYTHING you want in the shop. The questing is like most MMO's but I do enjoy the storyline (personal opinion) and there is always something to do. A bit of a grind at end-game but I personally enjoy earning all your gear the hard way it just seems more rewarding. I went from WoW to Rift and nowadays in WoW so much gear is given to you endgame its just no longer a rewarding feeling.  (once again, personal opinion) I feel it's not PTW because you can NEVER buy BiS (Best in slot) gear you have to earn it. You can however buy teh next tier down for example..If the current raids are up to T2 conent then you can only buy T1 in stores with real money until T3 is released. I don't enjoy everything about this game but it is certainly a game that takes up alot of time if you are into raiding, so be prepared and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)			"

												Very interesting RPG. Kept my attention but only cured boredom for so long. When I did play it frequently - I absolutely loved it. The visuals are great and I love how you can customize your character as you level up. And it's free. A drawback for me though is having to download different software to play this game. I personally prefer having a game come straight from Steam and not requiring any secondary downloads. That's the only thing for me otherwise, I think this game is pretty great. Rate: 8 out of 10.

												Have technically played this game since launch, and have 3 level 50+s.If you are looking for a MMO, I'd definitely give this game a shot, it's pretty old but it has a ton of content for free.With that said, I would never purchase 95% of the things in the store because they are severely overpriced. If you can't see beyond the cash shop (which is pretty much entirely optional outside of primalist and some souls) then don't try this game. If you can see that there is quite a lot of free content available, only barring you from a few souls and one class, all of which are either balanced or weaker than their counterparts, you should definitely try it out. I used to raid in Rift a long time ago, the raiding was actually better than WoW's at the time, I believe it was Post-Ulduar WotLK, which I never found fun (ICC was decent at best). Nowadays the raiding is still pretty great, not quite BC-quality raiding, but it's certainly better than most raiding out right now in any other game.As for the PvP, it's pretty much just like WoW's PvP, what do you expect?Leveling blows, just like in any other MMO, and the story is extremely mediocre, but what MMOs actually do leveling right nowadays? The only one I can think of is FF14.All in all, if you're a raider, then give the game a shot for sure.			"

												I have played this game for over 5 years now, off and on. It is well worth my time and investment. People may say that it is a WoW clone, they can, but it doesn't have all of WoW's poor story writing, terrible voice acting, horrifying bad puns and pop culture references, it has actual story and content that is very challenging and requires attention.I have spent over 1000$ on this game during my time played, does that make it Pay to win? No, Everything can be earned in game with a bit of grinding, but the grinding isn't absurd and you can usually get 2-3 pieces of the set armor your looking for with a bit of hard work and a day or two of play time.The game features have been additional as I have played, they added a card collection which you can use on your cellular devices if you cant login.The developers like to keep the playerbase happy with new content and events every week and frequently post updates or changes to balance and modifications to dungeons, but fixes and reports of issues are encouraged by the playerbase.

												This is a pretty fun MMO (and I have played them all).  It does overwhelm you with shop items and can seem pushy when it comes to using RL money to buy credit for the in-game shop.  Almost every MMO I have ever played does this, however. It just seems more intrusive with regards to the F2P system.			"

												Unlike many other mmorpgs available on the market right now...people actually play this. No...I mean they play it like an mmo....as in they play it in groups, raids, events, adventures, dungeons, etc. You could just solo your way to the top, if you wanted, but many people actually group which makes this a whole lot more fun to play. You wont find hackers and dual-boxers galore here...no one needs to hack or dual box because the game is well balanced. Also, you can change roles, no not classes, but roles. Any class can adjust to tank, heal, support, or DPS as needed for any playstyle you desire. This one is worth a sub but its free and not pay to win either. Sure you can get some cosmetic items and buy some exp boosters, but you don't really need all that. Leveling is not a slow boring grind. It's fast...so long as you stay active in all the events. You can quest too, if you want, so much here to do!			"

												Rift may not be as popular as some a MMO such as World Of Warcraft but in my opinion this game is just as good if not better. Yes it's FTP (free to play) and some may be upset when they find out that some features are locked unless you dish out a little money. Their prices are a little expensive in my opinion but that being said if you save up enough ingame money (platinum) you can buy either from the auction house or from the world chat an item called REX which will allow you to buy said features/items that usually you'd have to pay real money for. So yes you can do virtually everything you'd like in this game for free.I love that they mave made this game so that you can custom build your character however you'd like. In games like World of Warcraft you would only be able to choose 3/4 specs/builds per class but in Rift you can use 3 at once as a cominbation to compliment eachother. And there are multiple combinations per class. For example I recently made a damage over time mage with a few healing spells and a tanky pet. You can make whatever kind of character you'd like. There are also guides for those that aren't sure what to take.Overall I really enjoy this game and definately recommend giving it a go. In my opinion it's currently better then World of Warcraft.

												Lol I got banned on the character creation screen.  It was literally my first time playing the game, first character creation.  Was in the process of creating the character and got kicked out saying I was permanently banned for cheating.After talking back and forth with multiple people from support for a while, they not only refused to unban me for the nonsense, but they also refused to tell me why I was banned.  I never got any indication for it.  The only thing that I can think of was at the time, I had a Razer Nostromo gamepad plugged in and it has macro support, yet they don't allow macros.  I wasn't using it though.Fast forward several months, I was unbanned for some reason so I gave the game a try.  Although it's a fun game with a lot of class/skill customization, I've since moved on to other games.TL;DR - Fun game, bad support staff.  Don't leave your Razer Nostromo plugged in.			"

This is the BEST MMO i've played since Vanilla WoW. Hands down. It's also free to play and you get to make your own Dimension. I highly recommend this game!!!!!			"

												For the little amount that I've played, this is not a bad mmorpg at all. Graphics are basically between World of Warcraft and GW2. They are not as refined and artistic as the later but much superior to WW. One thing is certain, it's hard to get bored in RIFT. There's always something to do, kill, run at, explore... In the last few days, I've tried in succession a bunch of F2P mmorpgs and this one hooked me up the most. For what it's worth, give it a try, you might actually love it.			"

												There are 2 types of people that play WoW:  Those with so much invested in it they have no choice and those that are ignorant and don't know any better.  Rift is far superior to WoW in every way and anybody that says it is pay to win doesn't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game.			"

												I played Rift for a long time. Don't let  this 214 hours fool you, I have over 1000 in game time. Rift has done many things right and few of them very wrong, but for a free mmorpg game I must say it is still one of the best out there. At least for serious mmorpg players. I did full Rift review on my blog site, so if you want to see in detail review, check it out here: https://hardlifegaming.wordpress.com/Have a nice day! :)			"

												So I have this game from closed beta.I redownloaded here for the acheivements but I have 1000s of hours invested in RiftIts a 6 outta 10 MMORPGThe base game is very easy (to easy) and that makes it less then what it should beLike most of the post WOW MMORPGs that went for the easy crowd, Rift has gotten easier and easier over the years trying to appeal to the ""casual"" gamer. I personally feel this is a mistake (that they all do it) and hurts the game over all.Trion might be coming around to see that as in their big expansion after release the new lands presented more challenge then original lands did (but still very soloable)I have not tried the most recent expansion yet, so can not say if that more challenge continued or not.But Rift is a GOOD MMORPG.Like most F2P games the crafting is all but non existant now because they look to make money from cash store, so everything sold there.The BIGGEST upside for RIFT  over say Star Wars: The Old Republic, is everything for sale in the cash shop is obtainable in game via playing the game. So the cash shop has not replaced game content like in SW:TOR. Its just made it more accessable for those willing to pay extra.Rift housing is spectacular. Easily the strongest aspect of the gameClass system is interesting though greatly watered downbut ultimately RIFTS ar ewhat make Rift and they are fun to chase and destroyAs I said, Rift is a GOOD gameNot a great gameNot a terrible gamejust a good game that is visually appealing over all			"

												it's wow with a coat of eldritch horrors. it was auctually pretty fun, but yknow... it's just sorta the same thing as wow man i mean thats literally all i can say... also the story is...♥♥♥♥♥♥ like, who exactly am i supposed to root for? neither side is really the bad guys, but they both sort of blame the other. the righteous(or whomever they were) were especially guilty of this, beig all like, ""hey you guys thats all well and good but technology is literally satan and you should die for that."" i think thats rude because what exactly are you fighting for, righteous guys? religion? yea ok. that sort of is the problem with the whole thing. it's a crusade and when have those been anything but the slaughter of someone with a different view point. sure, the... oppsite folks...(can you tell it's been a while since i touched this?) summoned satan after all, but they didnt mean to. and then they tried as hard as they could to defeat him. i dont know if that was ever resolved cause the auctual game lost me after a bit. anyways, sorry...

												This game has alot of content and hours of playtime. I like the lvling scheme as well as the items that one can acquire while questing or participating in raids. The early grind can be a bit daunting but once you reach level 50 you can run most areas quickly while farming. Now there is even chests you are given for reaching specific levels such as 10, 20, 30, etc with mounts, weapons, and other goods. I have over 500 hrs altogether logged mostly off the glyph but I log in through Steam now just to change it up. *A Note* any new players to rift if you can grind out 2000 plus plantinum which is in game currency you can purchase REX from the in house auction which is as good as real money for patron pass and other items.

												So, while I realise that I haven't spent all that long playing this game, this is by far my favourite MMO. The Soul system feels unique, and interesting, enabling me to play any role with any character (if you pay for the extra souls).Yes, some features are behind a paywall, but they aren't necessary features. And the ones that are deemed ""necessary"" can still be bought for in-game currency. I believe that Trion has balanced the pay-wall versus grind really well.I have personally spent quite a lot of money on this, not because I have to, but because I love this game. I recommend it to every MMO-lover I know, as the best free-to-play WoW clone ever made.7/10, the 60-65 grind can be kindof a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"
