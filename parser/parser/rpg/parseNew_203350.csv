												I really love King's Bounty games from Katauri; they are quite good and very funny.  Sadly, I must say that ""Warriors of the North"" is heavily bugged, and this is unacceptable, considering that the game has been released in 2012. This means that in more then 1 year Katauri hasn't fixed all the bugs that afflict this (otherwise) very good game.To help them, I want to report the main issues:1) in Merlassar, when you enter the Pirate cave and win 1 fight, the ""Victory music"" goes crazy and goes on continuesly;2) the Spell ""Avenger Angel"" doesn't work: a lot of times, it makes only 1 POINT damage!3) everytime I cast ""Justice"" spell, the game crashes before performing it;4) there are random crashes to desktop;5) everytime you use the ""Catapult Goblin"", and in particular when you activate its ability with the static bomb, making it explodes, the game crashes to desktop.  So, I really ask to Katauri to correct the game. Once they will do that, it will be a very good game.			"

												The best entry in legendary 'King's Bounty' series - and probably even the best turn-based strategy in Steam!Pros:- Humor! Read all the dialogues, and you will be rewarded.- Length! Expect to spend 50 hours to finish the campaign. Not many games could deliver that.- Balance! Each race features its set of units with both variety to enjoy and optimal tactics to determine. Besides, the game is easy at 'Easy' level and hard at 'hard'. It may sound too obvious, but again, such a level of gameplay comfort could not be seen too often today.Cons:- Bugs! Well, there was an awful lot of them when I played the game for the first time after it was released in 2012. Most bugs are corrected now, of course. Still, some minor issues remain, one achievement is not obtainable without cheating, and - the worst of all - a lot of crashes happens. Save your game often!			"

												I have finished three of the kings bounty games. This is the 3rd in the series. I bought the newest one (Darkside) and have not started it yet. Armored princess is my favorite but warriors of the north is a close 2nd. Just like the previous games I have played through them several times. The kings bounty series are turn-based strategy games with combat very similar to hereos of might and magic. It is also a rpg with leveling up system where you put points into a tech tree. You will find that when you when play the game there is a giant island that you cannot get to. You need the fire and ice expo to do that (I would not recomend the expo) which starts you through the same story as warriors of the north with some minor tweeks and some annoying ones including taking away your pegasus, slowing moving around to a crawl.I paid $20.00 for warriors of the north and have over 200 hours of gameplay with it. If you like armored princess I believe this game is a must.+ Replayability - I find myself coming back to one of the kings bounty frequently+ Graphics+ RPG leveling up system+ interface easy to work with+Love my pegasus+Combat+Great musicGet this game now!!!!

												I sometimes feel like the King's Bounty games were made with me in mind. I will be the first to admit that I am NOT ""the brightest bulb on the tree."" But even I can easily win these games (on easy.) And what fun is it to play a game that you can't win? (Okay. Some people, like ""my brother the genius"" play on impossible just to see what it is like. And seem to enjoy it. But for the rest of us...?)I have read some reviews of WOTN that complain about the reuse of certain maps from TL. (King's Bounty - The Legend. Two games back.) That seems spurious to me. It takes place in the same world, just a few years later in time. And the very few maps that are the same have all been altered by time and the ravages of war.The only complaints I have are: 1- Many of the troops look the same and have the same names that they did in previous games but their powers and abilities are changed. And 2- there are a LOT of side and main-line quests that require sailing or running back and forth between world-map areas. (Most with very minor rewards for completion.)Still, it is an enjoyable game and one that I will replay at least a few times so it is well worth the price - now that most of the glitches have been ironed out. (When buying a game from 1C it is a good idea to wait a year after the initial release.)Update: (Jan 24, 2014) During my second play-through, about 2/3 of the way through the game and one of the manditory fights keeps crashing on me.  This MAY get fixed when the new expansion comes out... BUT... I now say -- Only purchase this if you feel lucky. 1c's support isn't especially good either.Fire and Ice Expansion: F&I adds some new areas and some new enemies, but it is basically more of the same... except more frustrating.The frustration comes in three forms. First, it crashes without warning more often. So..., it's a pain, but it's also a good idea to save after (or before) each battle. Or at least every other one so you don't have so many re-do fights.The second source of frustration is that now you don't get your flying horse until much later in the game. Why is that frustrating? Not because you can't avoid unwanted battles, they are mostly all winable anyway. It is because of ALL those ""traveling quests."" The ones where you have to go back and forth from one side of an island to the other several times for very little reward. (A few bucks and even fewer experience points.) Before you could fly up and go straight... now you either have to wind back and forth through the maze of trails, OR as i did, put them off until after you get the horse. (You pretty much have to revisit most of the islands several times anyway.)The third is the difficulity in finding enough of any one (well 5 actually) troop. This is even worse in F&I than WOTN, because they have added a leveling up system for troops which gives a BIG incentive to keeping the same ones throughout. But is a half full troop at it's maximum level better than a full compliment at lower?.Bottom line: F&I adds a few more hours of play time, and if you liked the game before you will probably like the expansion.  (But I have become bored with all the meaningless back and forth between Islands quests. It feels like most were added just to make the game longer, not better.)So... while I DO like and recommend this game F&I is my least favorite of the King's Bounty games.If you care, they run from favorite to least favorite: 1- Armoured Princess 2- The Legend 3- Crossworlds (the expansion of AP suffers from the same problems as F&I) 4 - WOTN and 5- F&I			"

												Any fan of the modern ""King's Bounty"" series would probably be highly interested in new iterations of the popular franchise. And what's there not to be excited with? Tactical battles of great depth, a vast variety of class skills and spells, cute and comprehensive visual style... But several hours in, you'll inevitably discover that ""Warriors of the North"" made next to none progress since its grand predecessor, ""Crossworlds"".Sure, no one was expecting an overhauled engine, revamped graphics or a lot of completely new assets. But the rest of the series' games already set up a quality plank high enough to raise our expectations to the appropriate level. What did we get in the end? A fairly bland story about vikings fighting undead (tons of undead... gargantuan armies of undead) throughout several isles and continents without any particular variance. Don't hold your breath for amazing plot twists or engaging discoveries, there simply aren't any. You can expect to meet some familiar faces from the previous chapters, but then again, takes time to even get to that point.But the plot never was the reason we love ""King's Bounty"", right? The REAL reason was always the tactical battles - oh, that hex-based warfare, with every unit having his/her own unique capabilities, stats, affinities... And those things are still there - in fact, you can expect a whole new race of vikings with their own synergy and special perks. But this brings us to another problem - there's a certain lack of sources of creatures that belong to any other faction. Good luck finding enough spawn points to raise your own army of vampires or dragons or whatnot. Most likely you'll have to stick with one and the same setup throughout the major portion of ""WotN"".What's even worse, the game is long... in the worst sense of the word. There are games that constantly challenge you, give you new tasks and make you think out of the box. ""WotN"" is not of these games. It's pretty much a grindfest, for the lack of better word. When embarking on the glorious journey to cleanse your land of evil, be prepared to hack and slash your way through 700+ generic enemy armies that only differ in size. Yes, sometimes you'll meet hostile heroes, but don't hope to have a nice chat with them - most of the time it's going to be yet another bleak fight that'll take 10-15 minutes if your life before you can continue to the next pointless skirmish... Of approximately 80 hours of gameplay, 90% is extremely mind-numbing experience. Power your way through if you want, but keep in mind that in the end, it's not your wits that will bring you victory, but only your sheer stubborness to finish the damn thing.Good features include a new utilitarian school of magic with some fairly curious ways of use (refer to guides, there are pretty good ones in the corresponding section at the moment), new artifacts (can never have enough artifacts... right?), new units (the aforementioned viking race, which you'll have to stick with for as long as the game lasts) and a new companions system (different from the previous chapters, which is good in itself, but not very interesting for my personal taste, since it limits your abilities to combine items equipped by your main character and by his current companion).All in all, ""WotN"" is a typical case of ""more of the same"", with a huge accent on ""same"". Only buy if you are sick to death from replaying ""The Legend"" and ""Crossworlds"". Although in that case, I'd rather recommend you to explore a fan mod ""Red Sands"" for ""Crossworlds"", which improves on the original in several ways and provides enough content to warrant a full re-play.

												I absolutely love the King's Bounty series.  This game is no exception.  However, this is the first game in the series that I have played that has been riddled with bugs.  The game crashes frequently so remember to save often!  I actually had the game freeze up in the final battle and had to start over.  Very aggravating!  However, these bugs did not stop me from spending 50 plus hours with the game.  Overall - a very enjoyable experience despite the annoying bugs!			"

												What a nice surprise. A delightful mix of turn based strategic combat, magic, adventure, questing, and rpg elements reminiscent of the HOMM series. Cast spells and/or crush your opponents with brute force or overwhelming numbers. There are tons of options available to aspiring Viking warriors. The game world is very colorful, scenic and alive with monsters, npcs, temples, shrines, caves and resources that you can interact with. All of which make it very easy to immerse yourself into this fantasy world.I'm really looking forward to finishing this one and playing the others in the series as well. Solid title!!!			"

												Since I heard so much good things about this ""king's bounty"" serie I decided to give it a try. From what i heard this is the best one. After I played 2 island though my buddy told me this is actually not the first one in the king's bounty story but the plot and gameplay was able to push me on to complete this. Overall this is a wonderful game. Good graphics, smooth gameplay, nice music, interesting difficulty(I played on impossible and every battle is a struggle until 4-5th island later that it ease up a bit), basic plot and nice quests. Being a viking you don't need to be honest(u lie to get better quest reward all the time.) but you must be brutal and cunning. Always go for the most rewarding quest path. Story was quite good till the very end and I get a feel that developer was thinking about to do more for the game then they realize they already made it too long. As your father and princess show up after you complete the game.Being a good game even have flaws, for this game it's 2. one is length. I was expecting a 50 hour games but at some point it drags on longer and longer and turned into 120+ hours for me and some of the battle takes many many retry just so that I don't lose too much or any troops. The other flaw is bugs. There are some glitch that some soild rock and walls were not properly clicked that your character sprite can actually bump into them and more serie glitch that crush the game. It could happen before and after battle or even when you simply moving around. Change the launch option of removing steam overlay make the crush happen much less often but bugs are still there.8.5/10 for a very enjoyable long game. Try this game If you like heroes of might of magic type of army combat.PS: Please note that if you play this game offline you will get the in game achivement but it will not pop once you come online. I have one achivement missing on the third island that will make me go back and replay until the third island. I also didn't try the extra fire and ice dlc yet but I do need a break from this game and I will come back to it later.			"

												Excellent game.   The entire series is one of my all time favorites.  Essense of the game play is to Gather creatures as an army and fight an opponent with their army in a turn based hex grid.   Has some extra gaming features by the addition of the Valkyries and Runes compared to prior King's bounty games.   Has three skill trees to build your character thereby offering replayability, similar to prior King's bounty games.  Some skills remain, some have changed.     Has numerous achievements to drive towards if you're that way inclined.  Takes about 80-100 hours to play it through to completion doing most quests.   Gold is easy to come by, so buy all equipment/artifacts.  destroy for crystals or feed to the valkyries to raise their level.  Make sure you have the Valkyries all at level 3 before entering Demonis otherwise you have to play again to get that achievement.   Also to get to level 70 you can't allow the Elf troups to become Neutral in the second act (so avoid going to Rezo in Arcania until you've cleaned them out) otherwise even with the skill that gives 15% extra experience you still won't get to it.  (I finished the game at level 66 and quite simply there was nothing left to fight).    "

												In it's current form, I just can't recommend this latest iteration of King's Bounty.  There are too many issues that take away from the enjoyment of the game, and that doesn't include some of the gamebreaking bugs.- Missing sounds during battles- Poor grammar and font spacing- Same music as Crossworlds- Most units are the same as Crossworlds/Armored Princess- Acheivements that don't work- Spells that don't work right- Boring back-and-forth fetching missions that don't really add anything to the game- Very, very little new added to the gameSome of these items seem trivial, I understand that, but they start adding up over time making the game trudgery more than anything.  1C markets this as the next chapter of the series, and I guess that would be accurate as like any book, a chapter is more of the same story adding only a little bit of anything new.  However, I wouldn't pay 2nd edition price for another chapter of a book and shouldn't have had to pay full-price for Crossworlds wrapped up in a different marketing package with bad editing. "

												Well, here's another game of the King's Bounty franchise. I've read some of the reviews before playing it and I had a few doubts if I'd actually enjoy it or not. Anyway, I decided to start the game and play as a warrior. I've seen that most of the complaints concerning the game were because there were glitches or random crashes. To tell you the truth, the only glitch I've came across during my gameplay was this magic rune that I simply couldn't pick it up because I couldn't reach the location. Really, I've tried A LOT and eventually I gave up. Then again, since I was playing as a warrior, I didn't spend much time using a diversity of spells and according to the reviews, most of the bugs were pointed to that area. Anyway, I've experienced a few random crashes, which made me extremely mad because I had to fight a few annoying battles again, so I've developed the habit of saving the game after every battle (autosave, anyone?). I've also missed the diversity of the troops from the previous games (although I confess that the vikings faction wasn't that bad). Last but not least, this game is unnecessarily long. I've finished it without fighting some battles and quests, simply because I wasn't in the mood to keep on grinding anymore. Overall: If you're a fan of the franchise, go for it. If you're not... Well, I believe that you're here just to find some funny reviews.  :)			"

												King's Bounty: Warriors of the North is a fantastic title to anyone interested in turn based strategy games. Much like Heroes, you travel across lands building up an army and then use said army to fight in a grid based system, with many different combinations to swap between. Unlike heroes you don't have a base though, but more tend to visit other castles to do your recruting, where some might greet you warmly whilst others turn around and attack you as you draw closer. The game is very extensive, and has plenty of content for its asking price, doing almost all of the sidemissions (One bugged), I clocked in at about 100 hours, which might seem like a drag to some, but I can honestly say I was never bored.

												I love the King’s Bounty franchise. “Legend” is one of my favorite games of all time. But I really did not like “Warriors”. The main reason is that for a long chunk of the game, you can only chose Viking troops. There may be a few units of the other races, but not really enough to matter in a fight. Having to stick with the Vikings as troops really took away a lot of my enjoyment. One of my favorite things about the KB games is being able to chose what troops you want, from dragons to undead, orcs, elves, plants, etc. I disliked the Vikings, and got bored playing. I never did finish, and I put more than 200 hours into it. But I just didn’t have any incentive to keep playing with Vikings.			"

												Blinded by outstanding success of The Legend and Armoured Princess, people behind King's Bounty decided to push the train forward. Even when main developer, Katauri Interactive, has left the stage and left 1C all by themselves. Can this end well? Warrior of the North says ""Nay"" and becomes the beggining of the end for series of so loved and respected game.First thing you see as you enter, is how drastically the writing changed. Not in a good way. I understand that devs tried to create special viking atmosphere in their game, so they had to move somewhere. Well, it didn't help, because after few dialogs with NPCs I lost the will to read through them. You won't find old witty humour of past games, be it an innocent remark of a child or a feeble rage of captured orc. And protagonist is... let's say he just doesn't deserve my sympathy. Plot of King's Bounty used to be a fairytale, now it's nothing but poorly written fanfic.Then you notice the music, oh god the music. Soothing and magnificient melodies by Lind Erebros has been mixed with cacophony (can't really call it otherwise) by different composer, recorded on different volume levels as well, which makes your speakers (or headphones) explode with loudness from time to time. Also, it seems that devs decided that music in game makes no sense anyway, so now you will hear peaceful themes during the battles. That made me mute in-game sounds and play my own music instead. Because why not, it totally doesn't ruin the atmosphere. If you ignore these major flaws, you can still enjoy the original soundtrack. Lind also made few new tracks for this game and they're amazing too.Overall game feels extremely unoptimized and will lag even if previously you had no problem running The Legend or Armored Princess. The graphics are also somehow worse than before. New effects (especially valkyries) and unit models (for the most part are simply recolored versions of already existing ones) are losing in quality to old ones. It's like 3 years of difference actually made artists go down a degree.To mention the gameplay... Balance suffered an overhaul. Forget everything you knew about the simple units from The Legend. Skeletons can now teleport basically anywhere on the field, magic along with poison and fire can crit(!!!), every units has got a bunch of super complicated abilities, undead's corpses damage your units when you walk past them (kills like 10% of your units)... New units, spells, artifacts - new everything - are boring and make no sense, old ones are weaker, so you either play with ""innovations"" or make the game harded for yourself. Amount of bossfights is underwhelming: only two and the first one is basically the remade version of a boss from the first game. Remember exciting fights that were actually challenging, such as siege of Karador? Forget it, this games makes up in quantity for quality. Instead you'll get dozens boring fights over and over. I tried really hard to give it a chance, but after my game crashed as I won a really long battle few times in a row, I could not take it all anymore. This game overall is a major downgrade from first two games. Even if in some moments game looks slightly better than it was before, it is immideately overshadowed by lower quality of everything else. Not to mention occasional bugs and crashes. Please, stay away from WotN if you never played King's Bounty before. And  if you did, think twice before buying it. This game has barely anything in common with The Legend and Armored Princess.			"

												Excellent turn based game. If you haven't played the Kings's Bounty games before I'd recommend getting to know the game, then playing it on ""Impossible"" difficulty. You'll get >100 hours of gameplay. Even on this setting, the game is quite easy towards the end. Buy it and play it, it's a great game!			"

												It's King's Bounty: The Legend — more of the same, refined, improved, another great escape into the fantasy world. If you are not yet tired of the game after playing ""The Legend"", ""Armored Princess"" and ""Crossworlds"", buy it without hesitation. If you haven't played any games in the series and like RPGs, turn-based combat and fantasy, it's a must play. "

												Beautifully crafted fantasy world that doesnt take itself too seriously. It is nice alternative to HOMAM series, especially since their quality is going down. This sequel to Kings Bounty focuses on new race of Nordic/viking warriors and beasts. Even though Armored princess slightly better I still had decent amount of fun with the game.			"

												Nice Graphics, great combat mechanics and strategy. The overall map movement is real time and the fighting is turn based. I really like this combination overall the most. I like the variety of troops you can have in your army and the strategies you can use with all thier abilities. Lot of fun and I recommend all the games in the series. Warriors of the north gives you the ability of flight to decrease map travel time within the zone and has the boats to world travel like the others.My only con is the length of the game, just a tad too long unless you only do the main quests. However if you do this you may have problems in pacing as you wont be strong enough to beat the mobs you need to in order to advance.For beginner player I suggest viking or skald class, the mage is more difficult.Have fun!

												Kings Bounty Warriors of the North has taken a big chunk of my life. I have played it for several hundred hours.  In fact the whole Kings Bounty series I have played well over a thousand hours. This game holds my attention for the quests and side quests which are very numerous. The in game achievements as well as the Steam achievents are worthy of being called an achievement. However they are not impossible to achieve but simply challenging.  Where it excels the most is in the replay value. Choices to be made are huge in number and variable. The units and items are very interesting and vast in number. The enemy units are colorful.  There are Valkyries to assist you . The Spell book is huge. I could go on and on praising this game but I have to get back to the game soon! ( A valkyrie needs my help)Oh yeah and one more thing...this game and  the whole series is much better than Heroes of might and magic. "

												It is my first Steam game.  Played it a lot but not finished yet. The islands inhabitated by Vikings make this title more interesting than the other games in the King's Bounty series. I regret that you have to travel to the other islands eventually and abandon your warriors from ice&snow covered lands. I like the idea of medals which make the player use more sophisticated tactic in order to win the battle. Sometimes have to spend half an hour to keep my whole army ready foor the other encounter.

												This game really surprised me. I picked it up a bunch of years ago, and quickly became obsessed with. Heck the entire series. It has some bugs, and odd glitches, but somehow the turn by turn building of your forces, the trying to tackle fights, while avoiding fights you just cant win.. the leveling, and finding that just right piece of equipment.. It all lends itself to a fun time that mixes concentration, but also relaxation in an odd sort of way.			"

												Despite looking like a DLC, this full game actually brings some decent new mechanics to the game. Playing as vikings you will be able to use a new rage ability - runes. Also there's new units to match with the whole theme. However it's the same plot as always: kill the undead. I guess King's Bounty is about the strategy and puting a good army together, so it doesn't really botter me that the story is always the same. It's a fun game and it's worth the price, if you're a fan of the series.			"

												A good title of the franchise althought plagued by some bugs, worst of all the annoying crash to desktop that occurs randomly.Warriors of the North has plenty of new quests, monsters and a lengthy campaign.

												It's the latest, shiniest, version of King's Bounty. Light hearted, quest driven, turn based strategy fun. The bugs have been ironed out, so if you're a KB player or it's on sale, I would buy it for some viking fun in the frozen north.If you are new to King's Bounty, pic your flavor. Original is classic. Princess (which comes in two forms, regular and Crossworlds- crossworlds being a larger and more complete version) you can play with your pet dragon and fly your pegasus. WoTN is obviously viking and has all the improvments of the series and some new features incorporated into it.			"

												This game... is frustrating. It is frustrating by design. First off, it's a great game if you like HoMM-style tactical combat in a fantasy setting. The graphics are nice, the setting is okay, there's a story that guides you through the game and the combat mechanics are excellent. On top of that, the game runs very smoothly on my 5y old gaming laptop (aside from a rare crash).That said, it taunts you at every step. With a minimal grasp of the game, you can get far without much trouble [on normal difficulty]. You can beat most yellow or lower difficulty mobs without significant losses. If you combine some of the more interesting spells with a good army setup and decent equipment, you'll be winning most battles with barely any losses at all. However, as you can only bring backups for two unit types, any time you lose another type of unit means running back, or fighting at reduced strength (generally not a good idea). If you level up, you can carry more of each unit type and... you'll be running back. On top of that, the game has a built-in achievemnt-style ""Medal"" system. For several types of actions, you can get a medal if you perform them a number of times, which provides a passive benefit. For example, using 50 defensive spells grants 3% damage reduction for the rest of the game. And, of course, a medal for zero-loss fights. And the reward is great, especially early on. The game doesn't punish casualties, but makes them annoying enough for you to obsess over zero-loss fights. A Very Weak mob with ranged units can still kill a weaker unit. Sometimes you have the option to skip Very Weak mobs, giving you the exp and gold without fighting. However, you're not grinding for your levels this way, so you'll be tempted to fight them anyway. But a Very Weak mob with ranged units can still take out some of your units, possibly forcing you to backtrack. Ultimately, when you spend 5 full minutes thinking ""Should I fight this Very Weak mob?"", you have to wonder whether this game is doing something horribly wrong or horribly right.The game does provide all the tools required for drastically increasing your odds of zero-loss fights, by means of interesting spells and units. However, large portions of the scrolls you find are randomly generated. In all my King's Bounty games, I've never found a Summon scroll at a relevant moment, which are critical spells for the Mage/Soothsayer class. And that gets frustrating.Sometimes I feel like this game is a psychological experiment. It's not about the battles; it's about you facing your fear of losses, accepting imperfections, letting go of your achievement-lust and just playing the game more casually.Or maybe nobody bothered to playtest the game without cheats.

												The Kings Bounty Series is one of my personal favorites. They each have provided hundreds of hours of gameplay, which is a bit of a shock as from the outset it seems a touch repititous and shallow. The games charm lies in its writing and setting, never taking itself too seriously or bothering to hire an offical translator or editor... All around a kind of 'WTF that came out of nowhere' kind of success.			"

												Continuing the King's Bounty series, this one follows the events of Armored Princess. The gameplay is practically the same, with minor changes to classes/skill/magic, companion system and rage use (now it's valkyries not pet dragon or rage spirits). Starts out a bit more restricted, first just one island then a few more, little by little. Also takes more grinding, and sometimes felt a bit tedious. The DLC adds a LOT more content, so I advise choosing the extended campaign. The game itself is super long (about 120 hours for me, that's with killing/solving everything), and is highly entertaining and challenging. At its current price it's already a bargain, if you liked the previous ones you'll probably like this too.			"

												My impressions of the game, after completing the compaign.Positives:1. The graphics are  on par with some turned based fantasy rpgs, though certainly not the best i've seen.  I would rate the graphics as fair.2.  Quests are decent, though most fall into either a.  Go kill something or b.  Go collect something.   Typical fair for the genre, but it could be enhanced a bit.3.   The sound effects are good.4.  The music is fair, but it gets very repetitive after a while.   Some additional sound tracks are needed.5.   The game does not fall into the traps that you get with HOMM.   No ""turns"" per'se, and no penalty for fulling exploring the map.    I hate HOMM's penchant for punishing you for not rushing the map - so at least they dont make the same design mistake.6.   Does not grow enemy stacks as the game progresses, which is good.7.   I enjoy the fact that enemy units move around the map, which makes it feel more dynamic.Negatives:1.   The quest narratives and dialog options are very amatuerishly done.  There are many, many syntax and grammatical errors.  It makes it feel like it was written in a foreign language, then poorly translated into English.2.  Quests sometimes force me into questionable decisions just to advance.  When given a morally ambiguous option,I shouldnt be given a 'quest failed' for choosing what I decide is right.3.  The game tends to crash often.  After 4 years, this should have been fixed.4.  I dont like how the game gives you only so many of a particular unit type to purchase.  If I like a particular unit, I shouldnt be forced to switch to something else simply because the vendor runs out.5.   I should be able to see the map for all underground lairs.6.   The few underground lair maps provided sometimes dont correctly place your heroe's position.7.  Disabling hero powers when fighting major bosses is very lame.  Make the fights harder if necessary, but don't disable my powers.8.  No way to easily clear unwanted items from inventory, which quickly becomes cluttered with 100s of useless items.  There are certain items which can be used to upgrade your Valkyries - but you cant know unless you right click them.   9.  Upgrading certain items require you to go through a major battle - usually not worth it in terms of time and lost units.Overall, a decent game.   I recommend, but definitely not at full price.  It is an unpolished 2nd tier game.  If you do purchase, wait until it is at least half off.			"

												I've been playing King's Bounty ever since the glory days of the Sega Genesis. So I absolutely love this series, and that's why it pains me to see Warriors of the North branded with the K's B name. The game itself is pretty bland -- doesn't really add much to Armored Princess -- but that's not a deal-breaker for me. I mean, hey, it's King's Bounty. Can't expect a AAA masterpiece. What absolutely ruined the experience for me is how *buggy* this game is. Absurdly long load screens, in particular, ruin the flow of the game to the point of unplayability.Not recommended.			"

												While I love King's Bounty in general, this particular extention doesn't bring anything special to the game. Whether this is good or bad, I don't know. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, you'll certainly enjoy another race, another school of rage abilities, more troops, more spells, tweaked skills and artifacts, nice art and continuation of the storyline from previous chapters of the game. In my opinion, however, playtime of 80 hours (I took my time, I admit) is way too much for an extention. Especially given that upon arrival to Arlania (took me 20 hours at most) I've established combination of troops which I used till the end of the game, hardly losing any of them in battles. So, yeah, it was quite boring for me. But, if you're fresh to the game, you'll most likely enjoy this extention a lot.			"

												King's Bounty is great, and that continues here. In a sense, it's more of the same, so if you're new to the series The Legend is a better starting point, but there are new units and areas to explore, and the writers allowed themselves more fun than in Armored Princess at times, which is good. If you like these games, it's worth buying, otherwise go with the earlier installments.			"

												KB:Warriors of North is yet another game in King's Bounty franchise. It has pretty much everyting previous titles had with some added features here and there, like viking faction. But this time it delivers pack of gamebreaking bugs on top of it. For example there is ""0 dmg instadeath"" bug, your troop take 0 dmg from status effect and dies straight away. I also got my spellbook erased near the end of the game. There are some others, but these are the worst. I read that 0 dmg bug does not ocurr if you start new game with the DLC. Sadly for me I didn't and I was way too far in game to start it all over again when I encountered this bug. Oh, and don't forget to save often, ""crash happens"" (Edit: game crashes very often during ""practice"" fight with inkeeper Whistle in Arlania. Seems like it always happens when he cast Dispel).I would advise you to buy a different King's Bounty game. I heard that Crossworlds is good. If you still want to give this game a bash, then do youself a favor and start new game with Fire & Ice dlc, which you actually have to select in main menu. "

												This game has good points and bad points.The good points is that it is a good tactical game set in the norse mythology and that it is fun on normal battles.  The game even gives you a gimmick item that can be used to help against the enemy.There is only one bad point: Boss fighting.  That gimmick item that helps you partway through the game?  It's useless against the boss.  The devs went and disabled it saying that the boss needs a ""Fighting Chance"".  If they wanted to give the boss a fighting chance they should not have given us the gimmick item in the first place.  Either that or they should have at least did some sort of nerfing on the effects of the item when fighting bosses.For the price it's worth and the length of the game it may be worth it.  However, the fact that this happened feels like this game needs to be worth a bit less.  I'd suggest getting it for a discount price.			"

												Combining Roleplay world elements with strategic turn based fights on a hexagonal grid battlefield, this game offers many hours to play. A huge amount of side and main quests keeps the player busy, the story is interesting and some dialogues have a good portion of humour. The variety of Units, spells and items to choose from allow for much diversity, replayability and most importantly: fun.I have played through the main campaign several times already, tried different tactics, units and spells. I've never grown tired of fighting although many fights tend to be very similar and some of them really long. For me, the gameplay of King's Bounty: WotN offers is unique and simply the best I have found so far. However, every game usually has it's downsides and so is it as well with King's Bounty: WotN. The game is quite buggy in means you can encounter crashes to desktop. There are very few game breaking bugs where there is no fix or work around. Worst is, that there is almost no support from official side regarding the gamebreaking bugs. Although I feel this is getting better now as the DLC was released.In the end I can say: If you already played the prequels and liked them, you will not find too much new content in WotN and you might be disappointed. If you are new to the series I'd definitely recommend this game and you should start loving the very unique experience.			"

It reminds me of Final Fantasy tactics.But instead of feeling nostalgic after playing it, the game left me unsatisfied. It's dated, to say the least. The combat is annoying, the story is generic, and it isn't entertaining for much more than 15 minutes at a time.It's not a particularly BAD game, but it's not worth the $30 price tag. Pick it up for $5-$10 if you can. I got it in a bundle, so I don't feel cheated. But you might if you pay full price.			"

												King’s Bounty: Warriors of the North is the next chapter in the cult RPG/adventure saga. The new tale takes place in the familiar world of Endoria featured in the previous games, but begins in the Viking lands, which the celebrated hero Bill Gilbert never visited during his famous quest in King’s Bounty: The Legend. The Mighty Olaf, son of the Konung of Northlings, has dedicated his life to battling the undead who have infested the northern lands of Endoria. He seeks to liberate the snowy wastes, dwarven dungeons, and the very heart of Endoria, the kingdom of Darion itself, from the dark grip of necromancy. On his quest towards immortal glory he will encounter cunning foes and new friends, hard battles and amazing adventures.			"

Horrible graphics, horrible bugs, horrible everything! a total waste of time! if you've played any of the others you will be throwing this in the trash as soon as you start! Its painfully apparent that the original developers didnt make this one. What a crap job these rejects did on this game! The only was people are posting good reviews about this game is either they are in bed with the developers or they havent ever played any other game but this one. Just stop right now and dont even bother, what a waste of time, a complete and utter failure!			"

												Another splendid entry into the King's Bounty series of games - if you liked the previous ones, you'll probably like this one. There's a few different skills and new spells, as well as a new subset of units, new ""runes"" mechanics, and of course new rage-esque things to add into the mix.Essentially think of this as a spiritual successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic style games, save that your 'general' character plays a more active role in battle at times, and it has its own couple little unique-ities. But all in all the gist is there - have a hero, cast magic, gather tons of troops (hundreds of archers vs a couple drags in each slot, the same idea here as in similar games!) - I will say I do enjoy the selection of troops, I'd often be running about with the adorable little plants and a few Queen thorns. The only downside of this game, and those of its type, is they sometimes tend to 'drag' a bit later on when the lengthy battles get somewhat monotanous, but altogether it is a solid game for a great price no less, if you're into the genre.

												Warriors of the north is the third chapter in the king's bounty franchise, this time around you're Olaf a viking from the lands of the north having a rivalry with your soon to be king brother and fighting off the recent menace being the undead.At the start of the game you can choose between being a warrior,skald or soothsayer (mage) each with different leadership values and unique traits to make your playthrough different, even though a warrior can cast magic spells it's not as strong as if you had a mage Olaf, you can also use your viking's rage to unleash some powerful skills upon the enemy to help you win lost battles, and eventually you will be granted the aid of the valkyries who you can use in your favor.The battle system is turn based hexagonal system where you choose where to move your troops and what skill to use, your leadership value affects how many of a given troop you can handle, for example a dragon might cost 1200 leadership per, while archmages just 400 , if you have 2k leadership you can use 1 dragon and 5 archmages.You also can explore the world map choosing when to go to battle and against who examining their current battle strenght, you can also dig for special treasure hidden through the map and eventually be able to fly in order to reach the best loot and hidden boss fights in the game.This game can easily be worth buying at full price 20$ if you a fan of tactical rpgs, otherwise wait for a sale if you want to try it out, beware this is famed for being the hardest in the saga and with good reason.

												This is King's Bounty as expected. Meaning it's basically just yet another expansion on the original.For me, that was a mixed thing. Every couple years I get a craving for exactly this style of game and this time Warriors of the North satisfied that. However the repetition from title to title is starting to become so glaringly obvious that it's difficult to imagine picking up any more games in this series until they take some risks and redesign things. After playing through this one I'm sick of fighting the same giant spider, using the same tactics and strategies, and having the same predictable AI. After fighting enough battles (which you certainly will) the patterns in AI become obvious to pretty much anyone and suddenly winning battles isn't a strategic endeavor anymore so much as a grind.My biggest complaint is that I didn't find it as challenging as Armored Princess. I played both games on Impossible from the start and Armored Princess had me very carefully choosing my battles and managing my troops just to survive for the first half of the game, while the second half became more of an easy grind. Warriors of the North had its challenging moments but for the most part the entire thing felt like the second half of Armored Princess - too easy.My second biggest complaint is the lack of variety - undead enemies over and over for the first half of the game, and then in the last half undead still in excess but every other battle rather than every single battle. In the last half you get out into areas that start tossing demons and dragons and whatever else your way but even then there is almost always a pack of skeleton archers thrown in even when it's entirely out of place (skeleton archers just hanging out with 10,000 devilfish). I fought skeleton archers so many times it started to become instinctive to just take them out with the same strategy at the start of every battle, with a rather ridiculous amount of battles boiling down to waiting for the ""post skeleton archer"" portion so that the real battle can begin.Overall I had fun playing through the game in a grind and progress sort of way, but I'm thinking this is probably the last time I'm going to pick up yet another King's Bounty expansion. This game is way overdue for a complete overhaul in both gameplay mechanics and general game engine, and even though I love this style of game probably way more than most people do I don't think I'll be able to drum up much excitement for yet another stab at the same old thing.

												A really fun Heroes of Might and Magic like game, with a great single player campaign (only) that's very focused on the RPG aspect of developing your hero's abilities.3 different hero classes, tons of units, hundreds of artifacts/equipments/useables, a bajillion quests and lots to explore. The game has a great amount of depth apart from simply amassing large armies and steamrolling.There are some bugs, which results in quests that can't be finished, pathing issues, tons of typos (This is actually mindbogglingly bad at times, with inconsistent spelling of the same name within the same conversation), and poorly scripted dialogues. Quests are sometimes vague in determining the conditions for completion, and the severe lack of location indicator for many quests can be frustrating.			"

												Modelled on the earlier games, this one has a couple of cool features:- 5 Valkyries you can acquire as companions, each with their own unique Rage ability in combat- Flying available above ground in most areas that saves you a lot of running around- Viking songs available to the Skald class which give damage and defense buffs against different types of enemies (my default and favourite was the song of Hellheim, which does increased damage against the Undead)- Runic Power in the Might skill tree (gives an extra chance to cast 2 Rage skills in a turn)Overall, I highly recommend it and say it's the best of the series! *****P.S. I wish I'd known that Ice and Fire adds content to the original game when I started playing, rather than thinking it was a new campaign. If you get the bundle, just play Ice and Fire, it has everything the original does plus its extra content.			"

												Same game and engine as before, but a better than usual story, and the Vikings are an interesting faction to use in combat.  Nice long campaign that ended about when I was ready for it to.			"

												Good as every K&B part. Personally i enjoy it even more than HoM&M but both games have different playstyle.			"

												I usually buy games, mostly RPG, when they are on sale. Recently I went through 10 games that had one problem or another playing on the PC, It was a joy to get this game which funtioned well (quest markers would improve the game), had a good RPG skill tree, and decent combat.			"

												If you liked the other King's Bounty games, play them first/again and give this one a miss.  It's a buggy unfinished pile of crashes, missing text, copy and pasted content from previous games, loot that's impossible to reach and PLACEHOLDER_COMPLAINT.  Instead of actually finishing the game, the developers put out some DLC for it.			"

												More of the same since The Legend, which is fine by me.  The Valkyries system is a lot of fun and all the rage skills have their own uses, which is refreshing compared to other games in the series.			"

												Неплохое продолжение линейки King's Bounty, немного затянутое, но добротное. Больше снега, существ и заклинаний, фанатам героев - брать обязательно. "

												I feel this should be an expansion, rather than an entire seperate game. If you have played borderlands 2 and borderlands pre-sequel, then you understand what i am saying. It is exactly like the first game just the characters are different, and it is a different area. It was a waste of my money.			"

												Fantastic game.  I encounter endless problems with games saved to the steam cloud not appearing in the load menu when I play on different machines, but other than that, this is easily one of my favorite games of all time.  Endlessly replayable, near limitless new content and new armies to experiment with - I have been playing this game for years, and I see no sign that I'm going to burn out on it anytime soon.			"

												Lots of quests to do and lots of stuff to pick up :) I love this kind of game! I grew up spending way too many hours playing Kings Quest 5, 6, 7, 8 and Underworld 1&2 (among others), if you like those kind of game you will enjoy playing Kings Bounty Warriors of the North. Main quest and side quest are entertaining.			"

												I played King's Bounty - The Legend because I was curious about a game that is not on turns and you can move freely, even if the fights are turn based. After finishing the game all I can say is that I liked it quite a lot, since it was a good surprise, even if there were some problems. I've finished also The Armored Princess and Crossworlds, and all I can say is well each is very good game, with a decent story (pretty good thou) and lots of creatures to hire, spells to use and places to visit. There have some problems, since the engine behind the game is not really that good but well I haven't found or encountered a problem that stopped me of playing the game so all is ok with me.Now in regard with Warriors Of The North, all I can say is it continues the story, you start from a different island, but you also get to visit places from the previous games. You also meet some of the heroes encountered from the previous games, which helps you integrate in the story and the atmosphere, while exploring the world.My only problem with the game is... the map and the quest system. The map is confused at time, while the quest system is a little bit confused but I hoped that maybe in the next version of this game, both problems (even if for me it's just one) will be fixed. I think the cloud system has some problems but I think it can be sorted if they integrate the cloud save in the saving system from the design phase. Most people compare this game to the ill fated Heroes Of Might & Magic series but honest... it's not really a good comparison since that series is... troubled with far more than technical problems. So please, don't compare King's Bounty with Heroes Of Might & Magic, since it ruins what both games offer to players!I hope you'll enjoy it :P			"
