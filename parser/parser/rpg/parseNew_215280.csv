												Note: This review was written for ""The Secret World"", not ""Secret World Legends"".It's not a game for everyone. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. That depends on what makes a game good for you.It has quite some flaws. The UI is made with flash, runs badly and doesn't give you all the features you'd want. The shaders aren't very optimized. There are bugs. If you're used to have the whole story presented to you, you'll find the story slow and boring.So why would you like this game, like I do?If you're ready to spend some time in its world. And by that, I don't mean ""to play"", I mean ""to look around, read the lore, and let the immersion build around you"". This game doesn't do everything for you. It expects you to take a certain part in exploring it and make your own conclusions. If you're ready to take that part, by reading, researching, learning, and maybe continuing to think about it when not playing, you will get an immersive experience in a world filled with horror stories, spooky places, interesting people and secrets like few other games have. Sometimes, it's just more like reading a good book than playing a good game.In addition, the character development system is or is not going to make you happy. If you think that wow has what gets you there, you maybe won't become friends with tsw's system. It has no classes, almost no levels and wants you to rethink your whole build and gear every now and then.But that just fits to the whole concept of a story-rich world. Your character won't develop on a given line, you can, at any time, choose the next direction your character goes. This, and the fact that the look of your character is in no way connected to your play stlyle (or class, since there are none), gives you the possibilty to use your toon as a good roleplaying character. Something that Funcom supports in multiple ways, including places in the world that have no use for quests, but for roleplaying only.So when people tell you about the rich story, they don't mean your character's personal story that is told to you, they mean a world filled with lore, tiny details and story pieces that you can explore bit by bit in order to find out more about it.So yes, if you want a story directly thrown at you, an mmo with excellently balanced classes or a completely bugfree AAA experience, you probably won't like this game.But if you sometimes enjoy a good book, have an imagination that you can use, or like a progression system that sometimes takes roleplaying over balancing, you have found a gem here. One that allows you to immerse in an amazing, spooky world - if you are ready to take exploring the story into your own hands.			"

												As a player of this game for almost two years, I feel I should weigh in with a review for any new players looking at TSW as an MMO to jump into. While I highly recommend it, an MMO can be incredibly polarising, and TSW has it's share of polarising features both for better and worse.The game boasts a unique world, you literally will not find another game brimming with the story beats and character that this game has. It's in the environment, incidental dialogue and monsters you come across. It boasts an interesting story about 3 factions, and how each faction is working in their own ways to guard and prepare for the coming filth (and that which is already here). All the while playing off against each other because after all, they have their own agendas.The gameplay is fun an interesting, run and cast system so that you are usually always moving. The range of skills and weaponry means that you can cultivate a character to your whim and the unlimited level cap (none, in theory) means you can essentially have a character that can do whatever you'd like it to do. An area calls for you to be a bit tankier? Done. A dungeon requires you to fulfil a healer role? Done. This hammers home the end-game need to build specialised builds that are constantly trying to improve through either signets, augments, or raid tier upgrades (if that's your thing).If end game content isn't your thing, and you want to see the rich story through the Solomon Islands, to Egypt and then lastly Transylvania. You don't need to grind any end game gear at all. You can enjoy the story alone, or with friends and can decide at any point if you'd like to engage in a dungeon. Thankfully, the tier levelled dungeons means that there are different difficulty levels of each dungeon.The game has a number of well thought out systems that sound brilliant on paper, that sadly are implemented poorly. Which is to be expected of Funcom (Ever the dreamers, never the achievers). The party finder system usually leads to more confusion that it does active parties opting for the tried and true ""LFG"" posts in general chat.The development cycle is notoriously slow, as they are running on a small staff the updates or ""issues"" as they name them, usually take longer than anticipated. Originally, they had a 1 issue a month plan, after falling behind that on numerous occasions, they have abandoned that for a more vague ""when it's ready"". Usually coinciding with a ""State-of-the-game"" update from Joel Bylos (Game Director).The game recently has started to receive a huge boost in player base (no doubt the steam sales having a hand in this). New players I hadn't seen before are now reaching the end-game content, which always helps an MMO to remain fresh and current. The community is, for the most part; friendly, vibrant and willing to assist new players. Whether that's communicating answers for questions, or helping with dungeons so that you learn. Bare in mind though: Like most things, if you want to be carried through the game, expect more stick than carrot with players.Overall, I would suggest this game to players disenfranchised by your typical high fantasy setting we've come to expect from the MMO scene. It a fresh and deserved game in the MMO scene and one that is highly worth trying, who knows, you may just find yourself enjoying it just as much as the rest of us.			"

												Two things I barely ever do: 1.) Play M.M.O. R.P.G.'s.2.) Write reviews on steam.This game has forced me to try both :D. Let's start with pros/cons.----PROS:Storyline-Vast universe filled with dozens of worlds, and thousands of replayable quests.-Constent flow of new players, that way no one world feels too desolate/over-populated. -Quests. Are.. EVERYWHERE. Everything from a NPC's handing them out at your local city to stumbling across a corpse with a treasure-map in the middle of the road. Very non-linear.-H.P. Lovecraft approved, atleast fan-approved :D (To see Kingsmouth in-game made my day)-Bits of scattered ""lore"" throughout the game clue you in about the history of certain landmarks and events that happen through-out The Secret World.-Has a LOT of pop-culture refrences. Eveything for popular movies to new video-games.-Cutscenes actually put your custom character into them!!! Badass. Real badass, bro.-There are plenty of cutscenes compared to MMOs like Guild Wars or World of Warcraft.Gameplay-You can either play the classic mouse-clicking way, or switch to over-the-shoulder 3rd-person aiming-view, OOOOOR zoom your camera all the way in and play in makeshift 1st-person :D.-Doesn't feel like any other RPG out there. Very fast-paced, doesn't have that 'grinding' feel.-Gameplay feels like a upgraded MMO version of ""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"".-Not typical lvling system. In fact, no ""levels"" what-so-ever, mearly distribution of skill points.-Hack-and-slash, killing hoards of monsters hasn't been this fun since Diablo.-Creatures vary from location to location, this game doesn't just color a creature a different color and make him harder, it's like they went through the entire Necronomicon in this game. -Great crafting system, strongest weapons/armor/items are crafted.-Great character customization, seemingly unlimited choices.-Playable alone if the servers ever die. (You'll have to be a high lvl to take on some missions.)-Not completely abandoned by devs.Funcom Points -NOT pay2win, not much stuff to buy with REAL money that you can't get in-game for free.-If for some reason you're lookin' to spend cash, they've got some great vanity stuff -If you want the vanity stuff, but don't have cash, there are promotions that might help.. ;)-If cash is not a issue for you, then take solace in knowing their prices are really cheap c:Performance-While the game IS old, the graphics are pretty decent, and are still being patched.-I has a: Radeon R9 280x GPU. And it runs like warm butter on ultra settings.Misc-Cool cartoony colors.-Friendly community.----CONS:Storyline-Sometimes you get a quest that is impossible to beat alone or at your current level (despite the quest claiming to be ""normal"" difficulty), bit of a buzz kill when you make it half-way then figure that out the hard way... by dying brutally and seriously out level'd :P.-Compared to other MMO games, it doesn't have as many active players as other titles.Gamplay-PVP seriously unbalanced. Like... whacky unbalanced......I would spend atleast 50 hours playing co-op or alone before ever stepping in the PVP zones. (I've got 40 hours under my belt and still haven't even reached the PVP zones lol. Big game.)-Steep-ish learning curve. (Steep because so different from other games.)-Combat animation with some low-rank weapons can be repetative.-Defualt short-cut and keyboard layout can feel a bit cluncky.-Each issue past 8 is expensive... I reached Tokyo and now I need 29.99 to keep playing :/Funcom Points-They should have made their item market on steam. Would have been much easier transaction-wise. Then again, who can blaim them for not wanting to cut steam in? -The Item shop doesn't have good descriptions on some things. They don't mention stuff like: Uniforms don't show stuff like necklaces or gloves, est. Or anything labeled ""effects"" is used to the London Theatrics Company, yet that info is no-where to be found.Performance-40+ GB download.-This game will eat all your free time up. YUMYUMYUMYUM..... gone. XD (This may be a pro.)Misc-No steam achievements? But it has it owe achievements -_-...-At times, the voice acting can be a little corny :P....ONLY AT TIMES! And It fades away with the awesome story.-OVERALL FIRST IMPRESSION:The storyline strokes your ego enough to make you feel individually important in a world with so many players, while at the same moment stressing the importance of teamwork, breaking the ice for interactions between new-comers and vets.Even though you can do the lone-wolf thing and beat the majority of missions alone, it's easier and more fun putting a group together to quest with, even if it's a random passer-by who just happens to be on the same page as you. Many vet players are kind enough to let you tag along on quests if they've got a free space, and you'll always find someone willing to help you whether it be directions, healing, or back-up. -LONG TERM IMPRESSIONWill update the more I play, but in all honesty, not seeing much negative aspects. So, if you're torn between the fence, buy in confidence, tis' a great game :D.P.S. To all new players! Don't forget to renew the free stuff they give you at thesecretworld.com, and check out the promotions they do such as; finish 30 missions get 1200 funcom points free.Recommended Guides for Starters.-http://www.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/the-secret-world-beginner-guide/-http://yokaiblog.wikidot.com/guides:craft-patterns#toc23 "

												When you play this MMO, as you most assuredly should do, it will serve you to remember it is not World of Warcraft. It is not Rift, or Champions Online, neither Age of Conan, nor Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is not for end-gamers or raiders, grinders or power-levelers, PVPers or dungeon runners.Rather, it is The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Broken Sword and Syberia, Gabriel Knight and I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It is for seekers and journeymen, detectives and discoverers; it is for explorers, and it is for adventurers.So is The Secret World a game you will enjoy? Familiar MMORPG trappings are apparent; there are definite systems and mechanics at play that one could use to thusly label this game, but close examination quickly reveals this style of MMO is not one that will appeal to a mass market.Beyond the limited character customisation options, the somewhat hasty justification of your avatar’s situation and subsequent induction to their chosen faction, lies an entire parallel universe to be explored. The scene set is present day, with the twist that here in The Secret World, all conspiracies, myths, and legends are true.The Secret World delivers a definite sensation that there is nothing here that does not exist through explicit design, be it the name of a town or the colour of the flowers planted in someone’s front yard. It feels as though every constituent is grounded and has a weighty history attached, as though understanding the lore is but an Internet-search away.The mission structure is unlike any you will have encountered before. There are several types of mission, and a small limit on the number of each that can be active at any time. The translation of this is that one cannot race wantonly through hub areas, collecting missions with abandon, to turn-in simultaneously for experience rewards broaching hedonistic quantities.Neither can missions be discarded once acquired, and though it is possible to pause them to resume later, it’s not an efficient method of churning through content. Of course Funcom doesn’t actually want you to be churning at all, but to be instead involved in your actions, and to see missions through their multiple tiers and increasing difficulties to their satisfying conclusions.Some missions require a rethink of your entire MMO approach to date, and this time I can provide an example. An escort mission of sorts mandated the continued living status of my accompanying NPC. After failing twice, I resolved to level a bit and come back later, until I remembered there are, in fact, no levels.Experience does still accumulate, but its effect is to unlock more skills and abilities. True, some of these are more powerful, but it doesn’t have the same impact as levelling in other games.Tactical skill-based combat is what's important.The skill wheel takes a while to get your head around, but basically you can choose from melee weapons (sword, hammers, and fists), firearms (pistol, shotgun, and assault rifles) and magic (chaos, blood, and elemental). Each skill has subsequent layers to unlock. You are not tied to any one skill; in fact, you can effectively have two skill ""trees"" selected at one time - a Blood Mage wielding a Shotgun, for instance. You can go heavy on one skill and unlock deeper and more complex skills or you can choose to pick a scattering of each.Visual information in The Secret World is more important than it would be in other MMOs. Clues for quests are scattered about everywhere. Being able to read your environment, not just your powers bar, is a skill to be mastered in this game.Beyond the informational side of things, the general art style and attention to detail just completely suck you in.  Sweeping vistas are easy to find if you go high enough, but it's on the ground that you feel the setting.  Mist-shrouded woods, caves illuminated by phosphorescent mushrooms or the occasional lantern, burning deserts, and seashores all have a heft to them visually, even when they're overrun by nightmarish creatures that by turns are fascinating and repulsive at the same time.As with the visual, so with the audio. Sound cues are always important, particularly if you've drawn aggro from a mob, but it's the use of sound in quests and puzzles that make it a step above the norm for MMOs.  Finding the signal in static, the right tones to unlock a door, even tracing a siren's song back to its origin point, there's all manner of clever uses for sound in this game and some of them will get you killed in short order if you're not on the bounce. Equally impressive is the voice acting in the game. The storyline and main quests all have voice-overs for their introductions.There are a couple things I didn’t get into, such as the dungeons, but I never had the chance to go through a multi-person dungeon.However, I did hit a few single player dungeons and they weren’t all that bad solo.It's a blast to see an massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game that doesn't go straight for the high heroic fantasy genre. Funcom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors, and it's likely going to remain the standard for future games in the horror/supernatural genre.			"

												This post is far too long. I'm very sorry. But I can't keep it short when I'm talking about something I like. And this game I do like definitly. First off: Almost all the negative review statements I read concerning this game are true. Period. This Game is insofar as it concerns the UI, graphical glitches, the inherent logic of development systematics you need to know to advance your character correctly or the combat mechanic in general highly unpolished.It falls very often short in giving you a wholehearted experience of a well thought out contemporary horror story. It is quite cheesy actually. Sometimes it's cheesy, sometimes just boring. Sometimes so confusing and overcomplex that you may sigh and just leave it alone.What are all the different stats for? I mean really for. As an advancing player I read through the forums. I do what veterans say is the best option but I just don't understand the mechanical processes of numbergenerating during combat until now. On the surface the stats are not only overly complicated but behind this not so complicated scenery lies no truely understandable mechanism which would show up after a few hours and let's you fine tune your characterbuild. At least I never got a comprehensive insight in the numerical processes which lead to the different combat outcomes.But: I'm not really into MMO's. Perhaps players who are used to this genre have a much better Intuition for the Interaction of stats in the Secret World. I can't judge this game in terms of being a good or not so good MMO.Because this is the only one I play. And I play it a lot.And I will tell you why:Two main reasons exist for me that make this game standout between a whole bunch of games I played in the last years and MMO's I tried to get into.The first one:A sometimes just amazingly cool feel ambiancewise. I said that the quests often are cheesy. Cheesy like some bad horrorstorypaperback from the trainstation's bookshop. Or sometimes worse actually.But on some ocassions I was really immersed in the dark, a bit - not disturbing - but confusing tone of the narrative which unfold. I could name a few quests I play over and over again. And I am absolutely not bored by playing them again. Somme MMO-Player's could say I am grinding... but if I'm grinding I can't say it feels like grinding. I'm looking forward to the nice cutscene I know to start after this boss battle, the beautifully arranged scenery of the abandoned Fair, or the appearance of a not so cliché character.The fascinating, gritty or disturbing atmosphere this games sometimes - only on rare ocassions - is able to create reminds me of the self forgetting process of reading contemporary psychoanalytical writings.Mark my words: It's definitely not the same, it shares only some strange layer of significance which is hidden behind the structure of the narrative form.There are few games in which I find such a thing. But the ending of the vanishing of Tyler Freeborn quest is such a moment. I'm not quite sure what's it all about, but it's coherent feel makes it worth my time.After I found this feeling in some quests even the shadow of this structural phenomenon reminds me of the cool moments I had in some other quests and makes the less well thought out and arranged levels of this game worthwhile for me.Second one:The Dungeons.I read in one review that this games dungeons have some classic feel to it. Like the old WoW Dungeons.I cannot say if this is true for I never played WoW. But I must admit that after I did my first (very newby stupid and surely - for my patrners - annoying) dungeon run I finally understood what this MMO stuff is all about. The groups which I was joining in this first period of getting known to playing an online game with foreign persons was such a remarkably stressful, chaotic and foremost optimistic experience for me that I instantly got hooked of playing a healer. These persons with which I was running - absolutely unexperienced in building and manouevering the quite responsible position of a healer - were just great, respect- and helpful individuals. I had the feeling they were about my age. Didn't take my constant failing too personally. Let me practice my skills and even gave me helpful advice and comments on how to become a better part of the TSW community. I liked this a lot.And I like it today. Everytime I play this game I look forward to doing a few dungeons with nice and relaxed people from all over the globe, and enjoying a few of my favorit quests. That's just a really good way for me to sometimes relax after work. I like this game and I hope you will like it too and I'm really sorry that I couldn't help and wrote such an enormous blah-blah post but it seems as if it had to be said.Thx for reading.			"

												UPDATE: I would Recommend getting Ultimate Edition from the store, which is significantly cheaper for the amount of DLC included. The DLC is just as great if not better than the main game.  I have also updated my Tips.Don't buy this game IF:Your gaming computer is more than a few years oldYou don't have over 40GB to spare for a single gameYou dislike MMOs that stray a bit far from World of Warcraft's now standardized blueprintYou prefer a more traditional fantasy setting (or to a lesser extent sci-fi) settingYou hate not having access to all of your skills simultaneouslyYou hate the idea of an MMO that doesn't constantly require player cooperationYou hate sitting through cutscenesYou love open world PvPDo buy this game IF: You want an MMO with a genuinely unique settingYou want an MMO with a wide variety of gameplay in its missionsYou want a deep skill building system (think closer to Guild Wars 1)You love to dive into the lore and backstory of a gameYou want an MMO with a cohesive, well-executed storylineYou want a solo-friendly MMOYou want a game that doesn't pressure you to play itYou don't want to pay a subscription feeBeginner TipsChoose a pair of weapons early and stick to it, preferably working towards a faction specific deckWhen talking to characters, keep clicking on a dialogue selection until it has a green checkmarkKeep an eye on the mission difficulty; you will want to avoid things marked Very Hard or DevastatingDon't pick fights with mobs in Lair areas by yourself, they are meant for experienced groups to tackleUPDATE:  Use the Group Finder (Shift+C) to help find people to do dungeons withUPDATE:  The custom chat communities Sanctuary and Noobmares can be helpful for learning the game and finding people to do group content with (use /chat join <channel> to join)UPDATE: Join the Event custom chat to keep an eye out for people starting world bosses and also holiday events.  ConclusionLooking for a game that would properly scratch the same itch that GW1 did (but its sequel did not), I took a chance on this game when it was on sale, and am glad that I did.  This is a game that shows a great deal of thoughtfulness, even if it was overshadowed by the three big MMOs that came out the same year.  If this is a game that sounds at all like something you would like to try, take the chance.			"

												I am going try to avoid saying what has already been said about the game and just share my experience.  Currently, I am undecided on whether I love the game or hate it.  There is so much potential and so many problems.  If the price is right for you, do try the game.  I suggest holding back on purchasing DLC (issues) and spending real-world money in the store until you have played in Transylvania and complete at least 10 matches in the PvP mini games.  If you still enjoy the game at the end of Transylvania then you will likely continue to enjoy it.On live chat, most players are polite and helpful.  Be aware, however, that The Secret World game can be very stressful and frustrating: even nice players are going to rant and rage on occasion.  There is a filter to keep the bad words at bay if one chooses.  A few nice words to someone having a bad day might help them feel less nasty.Simple graphic issues:  The recommended System Requirements are not set high enough.  One can play the game while meeting the requirements but there will be system lag that will make some missions difficult to complete.  Platforming within missions can challenge low graphic systems.  The graphics are beautifully done but they are demanding.Nearly all the missions, story missions, and side missions are good.  If you get stuck there is usually someone on the live chat that will help you out.  The greatest issue I discovered with missions is that some involve platforming or jumping from object to object.  This can be a problem if one has system lag or just isn’t good at jumping.  Sabotage missions have a greater instance of platforming and also involve jumping over traps.  The investigative missions have issues of their own if you want to just play a game.  There is an in-game browser for a reason.  One could spend hours researching for answers to puzzles on the internet rather than just playing the game.  (This can be resolved by asking for help or researching walkthroughs for the answers.)  The lock-out time for missions in Transylvania is about 60 hours, which leaves a player looking for something to do until the missions are cooled down.  There are issues (DLC) to keep end-gamers busy for a time.Issues 1 – 4 are included in the purchase.Issue 5 is a mystery story, someone went suspiciously missing.  Issue 6 is an adventure story, like Indiana Jones movies in a fashion.Issue 7 is a horror story where children are the victims.  This is not for everyone.Issue 8 is a grind…no real story.  In this issue one gains Augments that improves abilities. (AP costs are very high)Issue 9 is a back to where it all started story.  The AEGIS system is introduced and a story of chaos in Tokyo has begun. PvP has a few issues that make it difficult to enjoy every time.  There will be lag even on the best of hardware.  Sometimes the lag is show-stopping; sometimes it is more like an unexpected hiccough.  Sometimes the teams are not full; a faction can start with only one or two players rather than the total allowed.  If your faction does not have a full team at the start, winning a match is more difficult.  The PvP mini-games are often unbalanced: a team of high-end players can be matched against teams of new/lower level players.  There is an issue where players stand AFK in a match and don’t fight at all.  If you are a tolerant, even-tempered soul, PvP is still playable as even the losing team is rewarded for playing.  Funcom is working to resolve the issues in PvP but we might have to be tolerant for a time before it materializes.  Maybe a very long time.The concept of playing the way you want to play falls into the dirt on the second map (Egypt) and dies on the third map (Transylvania).  Some missions and dungeons, if you do not have the right build, cannot be completed.  Away from the dungeons and PvP, one can play with whatever build suits them in most PvE missions.  Even though most days I find something to dislike, I recommend trying this game.  Just hold back on spending too much real-world money until you get more past Egypt.			"

												Hands down THE most unique MMO on the market.  Once out of the starter area, the game grabs you and takes you on a wild ride thru the mysterious ""Secret World"".  With a terrifying atmosphere, this game pushes your brain to the limits with the quests and offers different ways to complete them.  (ie. Hacking computers, searching for solutions on the Internet, etc.)  With no levels to worry about and access to every facet of the power system to create your own playstyle, The Secret World offers a gaming experience that truely breaks the traditional mold.

												If Morrowind and WoW had a baby, and then if an Epic Lovecraftian horror story had a baby with conspiracy theory, and then those two babies met and banged and shot out a Horror MMO with amazing playability, that would be this game. Simply put, it's brilliant. I'm disappointed that it took so long for me to get it.  The only thing that could possibly be better are the controls on a keyboard, other than that every single part is so NOT anything you would get in any other MMO. The Community is GREAT! There's always some one willing to help you out, and the population seems steady and dedicated. You'll either love it or hate it, but you'll FEEL something and that's always great! Either way you can get a 72 hour trial to try this game out, if you go and ask anyone in the discussion board. Then you can decide if you really like it, and that's pretty cool!			"

												there should be a complete edition soon including everything up to issue 15 - its already avail on Funcom site-not yet  on steam howeveri wouldnt recommend vanlla at this point unless one only wants to solo main quest -- which is several hundred hours btw. it lacks most of the current endgame,and upgrading  is not a cost effective option, so most end up rebuying the big version after a while.all in all game surely has some issues but overall content is huge and of great quality.I could easily say its one of  the best RPGs ever made.I won't go into a detailed review.I think the game is at least good enough to give the 10 day trial a go and shape your own opinion about TSW---see forums how to get it.Only thing i ll say about tsw content,is that before buying I was very sceptical about the setting - i mean illuminati, templars, starsigns and mumbo jumbo....seriously? not my cup of tea.But after playing, i realized the fact that TSW doesnt take that stuff  entirely seriously either and actually it balances satire with seriousness really really well.Anyway long story short and after playing for a while, I can now safely say its  my favorite RPG setting by far and away.

												Ate a bee. Became magical. Said ""screw magic."" Grabbed a shotgun. Went to hell. Got a hell shotgun. Found a boss, thought I killed it. Found out I didn't. It killed me. Turned into a ghost, and discovered a couple secrets. Fought octo-nipples. Fought Chtulu. Died fighting Chtulu. A lot. Fought my mother in law. Fought your mother in law. Got tired of my shotgun, and tried magic. Learned how to shoot fireballs. Become a fire weilding maniac. As a DPS, tanked through a dungeon. Got loot. Broke it, and made better loot. Got cussed out by some old Seoul lady. Spit on a Templar. Went to hell. (Again.) Found out the Illuminati is super powerful because it has a robot that learns from the internet. Had all powerful being ask for a high five, before realizing it had no hands, and then threatened to kill me like a 12 year playing COD. And I haven't even gotten to the good parts.			"

												It's the only MMO I've ever played, so I can't speak to its mechanics in comparison to genre standards. But, it's also the only MMO I've ever wanted to play. I'm mostly a solitary single-player game type of girl and TSW is real good for that.			"

												The Secret World so far has been an amazing immersive experiance, As you may have seen in other reviews this MMORPG isnt about combat or becoming the strongest character you can be. The games best features come from storytelling and immersion in a dark twisted modern-day world while letting the player go at their own pace and play how they want to.Combat: The combat itself is pretty generic tab-target, but using cone attacks (aka shotgun blasts) free this up a bit and make it more about kiting and dodging.Levelling/skills: As advertised the game has no character levels or class restrictions but you can only have up to 7 active and 7 passive skills set at any one time, aswell as a max of 2 weapons.Questing/Missions: The game only lets you hold up to 6 missions at any one given time, 1 story mission, 1 dungeon mission, 1 main mission and 3 side missions but these arent the old ""go kill x monster or gather x thing"" quests which take under a minute to accomplish, Every quest be it side quest, story or main mission i've picked up and finished has provied pieces of information towards the events happening in the area, making everything alot more immersive and larger in scale. (Note:  Investigation missions are quite tricky puzzle solvers that will make you pull your hair out trying to complete!)Storytelling: As stated above this game is more focused on immersion and storytelling, but how good of a job does it do? Overall the voice acting from each new npc character you meet is extreemly well done and sets the mood, Quite like watching a dramatic horror/thriller film, This also adds depth to the areas you explore and try to pass through bit by bit.Overall: If you're looking for a game thats big on action, easy questing, quick levelling or combat focused this game wont be for you, If however you want a game that racks your brain, makes you think, pulls you into its world and does a damn good job at keeping you there, Then i'd suggest picking up The Secret World.

												When we hear the term ‘MMORPG’ we tend to think of Elves, Dragons, and grinding out levels. The Secret World seeks to subvert this trend by not being set in a high fantasy world and doing away with levels, skill trees and the class system entirely. Set in the present day and in this universe, The Secret World has players assume the role of a regular person who has been granted fantastic abilities, and uses them to do battle against dark forces on behalf of The Illuminati, The Templar or the mysterious and chaotic Dragon.The biggest thing that sets The Secret World apart from other MMOs is its setting. Events take place in our present day world, and reference real world culture. For instance, the Templar make a point of telling the player that they are nothing like what one might see in a Dan Brown novel. Early locations pay homage to the likes of HP Lovecraft and Stephen King, and mission-giving NPCs feel like they’ve stepped out of film and literature as they go off on their pre-quest monologues. Enemies are taken from myth and legend, and include the likes of Draugh, Wendigo, Zombies, Vampires, Demons and The Bogeyman. I’ve even seen a tribe of Sasquatch.Zones are large and varied. In the early stages of the game, players explore haunted carnivals, sleepy towns plagued by the undead, occult institutions, and forests inhabited by vicious beasts. I’ve been putting many hours into the game since I got it, and still haven’t left the early zones as there is plenty to do in each of the game’s large, open areas.Most of the time, like in other MMOs, I’m doing missions for NPCs. Upon accepting a mission, the player is treated to a cutscene where the quest-giver tells you (sometimes in a rambling, roundabout way) what they need done. I really like these cutscenes. Despite the player’s character not having any dialogue, the quest-giver monologues are entertaining, as the NPCs have a lot of character and the voice talent has done a good job of bringing them to life.While still maintaining the “Kill 10 X” style of quest, The Secret World expands on the formula by introducing a couple of new quest types. Investigation missions are probably the most enjoyable of these new types, as they deviate most from the standard MMO fare. In investigations, players have to employ detective skills, along with logic, problem solving, and perhaps a little research (made easier by the games handy built in web browser) to uncover clues that lead to other clues, that eventually lead to uncovering some important knowledge. Some of the investigations are absolutely devilish, requiring a substantial degree of effort on the part of the player. One such mission presents the player with a message encrypted in Morse Code. To advance to the next stage of the investigation, the player must decipher the coded message (or give in to temptation and google up a guide using the games handy built in web browser). Investigations may also task players with cracking a computer password or following a series of cryptic clues in a treasure hunt across the zone. The investigation missions are a lot of fun, provided you’re the kind of person who is into cracking clues and codes, otherwise they can just be infuriating and force the player to follow a walkthrough to get it over with.The other main type of mission introduced in The Secret World is Sabotage. These involve sneaking into an area, avoiding laser tripwires, security cameras and enemies who are capable of quickly dismembering the player if their attention is accidentally attracted. Sabotage quests are not as common as investigations or “Kill X” quests, possibly because they can be a little repetitive. Most Sabotage missions require the player to navigate an area where the price for failure is almost instant death.This wouldn’t be a problem, but at times, jumping over a low tripwire is complicated by sloppy jumping mechanics, often ending in something exploding and severely damaging your character, if not killing it outright and forcing you to attempt the section again.Another interesting aspect of The Secret World is the way in which it does away with the traditional class and levelling systems that appear in other MMOs. The Secret World employs a system that allows the player to create their own class, or ‘deck’ as it is called, by equipping two weapons, and up to seven active and seven passive abilities. Decks are built by spending a combination of Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP), which are gained through accumulation of experience. Abilities are split into categories based on the weapon a character a character needs to use them. Currently, the weapons available consist of Swords, Hammers, Fists, Blood Magic, Elementalism, Chaos Magic, Pistols, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles.If one were to play the game for long enough, one could obtain all the available abilities, as there is no limit to the amount of experience a character can accrue. For this reason there is no way to refund spent Ability Points, nor does there need to be.If someone was to do what I did, and create a character build they weren’t happy with, remedying the situation simply requires picking up a new weapon and buying some new abilities to go along with it. I was genuinely surprised with how easy it was to alter the developmental direction of my character. I just stopped, equipped a hammer I had lying about, used my spare AP and SP to grab some abilities and weapon skill, and off I went.The limitations imposed on the number of abilities a character can equip may be jarring to MMO veterans who are used to loading up their half a dozen action bars with dozens of abilities. I too felt somewhat strategically hindered at first. Eventually I came to see the restrictions as a deeper level of character customisation, intended to force the player to design their deck of abilities around the situation at hand. There’s still times where I really, really want an eighth ability slot, just so I can squeeze in one more attack or passive ability, but I’ve come to appreciate the strategy behind customising my build within the constraints of the system.Combat is probably where The Secret World is closest to other MMOs. The player still has an ability bar, and the abilities on that bar still have cooldowns. Resources like mana have been done away with however, and each of the two weapons a player is carrying uses its own resource pool. During combat, players use abilities to build weapon resources, then spend those resources to unleash their more powerful abilities, then resources are built up again and the cycle continues. The Secret World seeks to break up the repetition of combat by letting the player perform a dodge roll, which allows the character to get out of the way of incoming area of effect attacks some enemy types like to use.Engaging enemies must be done with some degree of strategy, as for each unintended enemy entering combat, the player’s chances of survival decrease quite a bit. The enemies that inhabit the outside environments tend to boast roughly the same, if not a larger, amount of health as the player and are capable of taking a bit of punishment, so engaging with too many enemies at once is not in the players best interests. There is no PVP, as each faction has called a truce in order to fight the dark forces.No MMO is without bugs, and The Secret World is no exception to this. During my time with the game, I have encountered a few bugged quests, and have even fallen through the world on one occasion. The GMs were amazingly helpful with the bugged quests, rectifying the situation within 15 minutes of me sending off a petition. Other than these isolated incidents, my time in The Secret World has been essentially bug free.AbstractStory 9Gameplay 9Graphics 9.5Sound 9.5Replayability 9Controls 9Overall Score9.25/10			"

												I've been playing MMOs since everquest in 1999, and MUDs on BBSs before that.  I've beta tested and played more MMOs then I can count without sitting down and taking the time to think about it, but at least a few dozen.  So take it as a massive compliment for TSW when I tell you that this game has some of the greatest features in any MMO I've ever played.  Is TSW a perfect game?  No, the game play can get a little rough at times, and the character builder feels quite flat.  But it has by far the best story of any MMO I've ever played, rivaling many triple A solo games stories.  The atmosphere of modern horror is perfect without resorting to cheap scares, but instead weaving a tale of Lovecraftian horror and survival, all with the backdrop of major political forces moving in the background.  The 'leveling' system is by far one of the best and most original that I've ever seen in an MMO, eschewing traditional 'levels' and 'classes' in favor of a more free form system of upgrading skills and items to build a unique character.  In addition this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, and by far the best looking MMO of anything I've ever seen.  Top all of this off with the fact that you buy the game once and play it for free, no subscription fee, and this game is a no brainer.I'd reccomend springing for the ultimate edition for the extra few bucks, you'll get a TON more content, and odds are once you start playing, you'll fall in love with it the same way I did.

												So, this game is good, its really good. I have never played a MMO before where such care has been taken into the writing of the game, all quests are fully dialoged and cut sceaned and this greatly helps with immersion and makes you actually start to care about the world around you. The quests range from your standard MMO grind collect fest to some of the MOST FUN and CHALLANGING puzzle quests i have played. EVER, Yes in any game. These ""Investigation"" quests will have you searching google, wiki pages, local town info boards, forums, and sometimes real world peripherals. It requires some extreame thinking outside the box. THERE AMAZING more games should do things like this.The combat is ok, you have the choice between tab targetting and action targetting, the real fun comes in the form of the combat wheel where you will use points to purchase abilitys and passives to experiment with endless possible builds. There is no lvling in the secret world, instead you upgrade weapons and gear which is either dropped by mobs or crafted, the crafting is very simaliar to minecraft where you make the item shape to produse the gear you want.The atmosphere in this game is incredible, alot of this has to do with some really nice art and sound design, It trully makes you feel alone in this game, Only seeing a fellow person on occasion going about there business really adds to the helplesness that this world has fallen into.This isnt your standard MMO. You wont find hundreds of players rushing from mob to mob with there flashy mounts, What you will find tho is a amazing story and some really intresting quests that i have never seen done before, So if youre looking for something a little bit different, You owe it to yourself to TRY this game!

												90% of people who like MMORPGs shouldnt play this game. For the rest of us, this is the best MMORPG on the market, hands down, no questions, end of story. Would you like an MMO to have a serious story and real, actually challenging missions that don't constantly mean you have to ""kill X of Y"" or ""collect X of Z""? Then you play this. In this game, you actually solve real problems. It is above and beyond what MMORPG means to me. It's like a single player adventure/rpg with multiplayer elements strongly included. My only complaint is the store is filled with ludicrously priced items. They aren't neccessary, but after already paying for the game itself, the prices are outrageous.			"

												Played nearly 200 hours, don't think I've been in an actual party the entire time. That said, this is easily the best MMO on Steam if you're interested in a solo experience. I'm a huge fan of the insane build flexibility the game allows, as well. There are no set classes. Instead you pick two weapons and grab skills as you see fit, with the ability to switch at basically any time. You can also grab passives from weapons you don't even use to make your build better. The quest system is also a little different. You can only have 5 quests at a time: the main story quest, which will tell the overarching story in the long term as you traverse the different zones; a normal quest, which will usually have voice acted cutscenes and multiple stages to go through; and up to three side quests, which are more like the shorter quests you're used to from other MMOs.  It sounds odd, but it works very well with the way the game world is set up, with normal quests leading you to sidequests which lead you to new areas, etc. There are also investigation quests which give you very little to go on, often requiring you to solve puzzles or research outside of the game in order to progress.Highly recommended.

												Funny that I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I'm only now getting around to write the review. But, well, I've been distracted. By this game.The Secret World is an MMORPG set in modern times. Your character awakens with magic powers in a world where all of the conspiracy theories are true, and you're quickly recruited into one of the ancient secret societies. They send you to several supernatural hotspots arouns the world in order to protect your society's interests and stop the impending end of days.You get to channel your magic through two different weapons, and you have three guns, three magic focuses, and three melee weapons to choose from (not to mention auxiliary weapons you'll find later on, such as the Rocket Launcher or Whip). Most of the chocies are viable for a player simply looking to do damage. If you want to tank or heal, you'll need to include one of the ""tank weapons"" or ""healer weapons"".I enjoy playing this genre of game, but I could never get into World of Warcraft or its many clones. This game really is something special. The first reason is that the story and mission dialogue is not only worth reading, but it's compelling at times. Some of the characters really are very lovable, and there are some really fun mysteries to unravel. The second reason is that the quest structure is really good. Sure, there are a few ""kill 10 wolves"" quests, but there's also an ""unlock the Illuminati vault by solving a riddle"" quest, and a ""sneak around the laser system"" quest. Each quest really felt like I was doing something meaningful. The third is that, in this game, you're never locked out of certain paths. You spend points to upgrade certain weapons or get new weapon skills, but you can always level up other weapons in the future in case you want to fill a different role.I should also clear up one thing about this game: no subscription. You pay once, and you get access to the vast majority of the game's content. You can choose to pay a little more for content packs... most of them are worth spending some money on.I got this on sale, and it's some fo the best money I've ever spent on Steam. If you enjoy playing MMOs, then this game is absolutely worth trying. If not, it's probably worth trying anyway.			"

												This game comes highly recommended by yours-truly. If you're into MMO's, then this game has it all. Modern RPG-style MMO where you play the role of one of the 3 secret societies across the world - the Illuminati is an example of one.The cutscenes are worth watching.Every piece of literature is worth reading. Every NPC is worth talking to.The puzzles are VERY HARD to the point the game includes a built-in browser so you can Google up a walk-through. For example; some missions have you looking up old books on Amazon and decyphering a code from the ISBN. The voice-acting is hit-or-miss. Some of the actors are very recognizable (Tim Russ!) with outstanding delivery, inside jokes, actor allusions and Memes everywhere!Hundreds of class combinations that you can switch on-the-fly. You're not limited to anything. What weapon combinations you want to use, your skills; all of them become open to you and you can mix/match whatever you like to create your own unique build that works for you. There is no one true build for any particular role.The maps are huge without any big chunks of nothing in between. There's something to find everywhere. A good chunk of the game is solo, but the best loot is found in the multi-player dungeons.No level system. Your gear is your level and you decide what your character is best at first, then branch out from there.PVP is available and successful PVP ventures unlock buffs for everyone in the region! Keep at it, because it's not something that locks in for a week. One minute your secret society may control everything and it can be taken away the next!There's something for everyone in The Secret World, so pick up a copy and join Onyx Gaming on the Arcaida Server!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just read a post from someone named Zakennayo and I got a little angry and came back here to revise my review because I didn't want my rant to get buried.  People need hear this.Some people have played WoW for SO LONG it's forever colored their perspective of MMO's.  World of Warcraft revolutionized the MMORP gaming genre back when all they had to compete with was Everquest and Ultima Online.  Now WoW is boring, dated and severely lacking in concepts and when anyone from WoW sees an MMO they instantly try to compare it to WoW and only disappoint themselves.You'll never recapture the magic of the early days of that game and I don't know why these 30-somethings still try.  Just like Call of War 9: Modern Duty Ops 4 will never recapture the magic of Quake or the first Halo.The genre won't change until technology changes and technology may seem like it's leaping forward with every new iPhone # or Samsung Galaxy #, but it's not.  This year, the phone has 3.5Gigs of Ram instead of 3 and can both make AND receive calls for $200 more than the previous generation!  We also shrunk the chassis (or made it bigger) and made the screen bigger (or made it smaller).We're doing the same with video games because we've actually hit a technological ceiling.  It's not that we CAN'T go further, it's just we've limited ourselves with artificial barriers like ""currency"" and ""political correctness"".  It's either too expensive or too offensive.To add onto that.  Does anyone even remember what video games like Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. cost back in 1985?  I do.  The original NES sold in the US for $299 and Legend of Zelda was $59.95.  Legend of Zelda was scripted, coded, compiled, packaged and ready for release in 3 months and cost approximately $5000 to produce.  The latest console is around $399 and games are STILL $59.95 with the most expensive game to date being Destiny at a !!rumored!! TEN MILLION DOLLARS in development costs (that's just for the first game released, not including DLC and future expansions) and a FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ad campaign spread out over the lifecycle of the title (rumored to be about 10 years).This game, with all of it's expansions up to issue 11 is $60.  The same price as the first Legend of Zelda game, with fully-voiced characters, non-intrusive cinematics, an expansive world, a unique story; I could go on and on.  Even if you don't like this game for personal reasons, there shouldn't be any reason to down-vote it.  It's a good game.  It's playable.  It doesn't pull any punches and it works.  On the off chance it doesn't work, they have Omni-GM's (GM's with root console access, not just a Kick/Ban button for jerks) on hand to fix any kerfunk that may occur....Didn't mean to get philosophical on everyone; but that's just my two cents.

												Creepy MMO - A brief but honest review. The Secret World is by no means a stand-out title. It certainly doesn't re-invent the wheel at any point and the movement and combat feels a little floaty. It's yout typical action-bar-pickup-quests-kill-mobs sort of game. At least that's what you think when you start playing. However; the game developers have managed to capture this really thick atmosphere through a combination of great story-telling, awesome voice-acting and a brilliant soundtrack. When you start playing the game you really start to get sucked in and the experience becomes increasingly immersing as you follow along with the story. You start yearning to find out the secrets behind the mystery. I really get this 'Diablo 2 but set in the modern world.' sort of vibe while playing it. And really it is that which drives me on. The game has a fairly steep learning curve. A complex crafting system, a massive selection of weapons, skills, abilities, stats -- and none of it is really formally explained. But with a bit of surfing you will quickly find answers to those questions. (using the in-game browser is a nice touch.)I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone playing for end-game content or raiding for epic loot. However; if you're looking to immerse yourself in a really well voice-acted horror story that generates an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife, this could well be for you.			"

Short verdict: you will like this MMO, even if you don't like MMOs in general.PROS+ Fantastic lore with a lot of inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft, folklore and mythology. No shortage of pop-culture references either+ Overwhelming amount of content. The Ultimate Edition on sale with a 75% discount is a fantastic deal. Even with the Standard Edition you get plenty of gameplay hours for the buck.+ No subscription, no slots to unlock, all the things that matter are unlockable either with skill/ability points or in-game currency/tokens+ You can solo most of the missions (except for dungeons, lairs and raids)+ Very friendly and helpful community, which is still quite active+ Atmospheric+ Modern day setting, which is a relatively rare thing for MMOs+ No fixed classes, it's all about skills and equipment in this game, which you can easily change+ Seasonal events+ Free membership for 2 months with the Ultimate Edition. The membership offers considerable loot and XP boosts and free travelling+ When buying the Ultimate Edition, you also get one free key of the Standard Version to share with a friend+ Abundancy of outfits and cosmetic items. Many of them are free+ You don't feel the grindiness in the early game period, because everything feels quite exciting for about first 50-80 hours (for me at least) and there's always another achievement, another item, another skill deck to get within your reach+ Adjustable camera distanceCONS- This game is not super-grindy, but it's still grindy, especially in terms of combat. - Tedious combat. Enemies have too much HP, even the easy ones. Unless, you're doing missions with friends, killing takes a long time.- Camera issues - big enemies don't fit the screen very nicely- Even though the enemies change, what changes is their looks, not how they act and feel. Basically, there are just a few enemy types: big, slow golem-like enemies with a lot of HP;  grouped small weak enemies that can overwhelm you with numbers; small to medium size ungrouped strong enemies; spectres with magic abilities and minor bosses.- It's hard to sneak past enemies without triggering a combat. Usually you can outrun them, but you need to be careful of not triggering too many enemies at the same time, which happens quite often- Agartha is a sort of transport hub in this game and its convoluted design makes the travelling a little bit cumbersome. Also, in some maps, the fast travelling points (anima wells) are scarcely distributed.- Although, there is a unique story for every mission, after a while, the gameplay does start to feel repetitive. And that is the main reason, why I'm taking a break from this game. The gameplay starts to feel like a repetitive cycle of clearing the areas, missions and gathering lore and skills.- Too narrow opportunity windows in sabotage missions.- There are quite a few bugs and I needed to switch from DX11 to DX9 to avoid frequent crashes.- The Ultimate Edition does not include all the DLCs, you still need to buy Issues 12-14 additionally.In the end, I'd like to say that I don't like MMOs and the reason, why I picked up this game, was because of the Lovecraftian lore and the fact that you can complete most of the missions alone. So, if you are into a good story and enjoy some modern day mystery, this game is not bad at all, not at all.My overall rating: 8/10 "

												I've never written a review on Steam before.   Many people have already posted about the story line, the atmosphere, etc.  All of that is great.  This is what really makes the game great for me though.   There are no character classes.  You unlock every skill and then you can build your own deck (basically role) for many different types of game modes.  There are your classic holy trinity roles of Tank, DPS, and heals.  However, there are many different hybrid roles as well.  Some examples are a heal tank, melee dps, DPS tank, leech healer (healer that heals with an assault rifle DPS), and then the mixing and matching of many skills/weapons that add more to your build as well.    I have a few hours on this game and my toon can do every role for all the content in the game (sans some brand new content since I haven't learned every role yet in the new content), and that is what makes this game great for me.   Typically in any other MMO you must roll another class to try or play another role.  Not in this game.  You get complete control of what weapons you want to slot, and you craft all your own custom gear.Many MMOs have advertised the ""Play it your way,"" model of character progression and design.   While, you cannot 100% just make up whatever you want in this game, it is the only game that comes close.   You are never locked into a specific class or build, and with their crafting system you can completely customize all your gear.   It really is the closest thing to the ""play it your way,"" I have ever experienced in a MMO.I'd recommend this game to anyone where this is appealing.  To be honest this game has sort of ruined me, as I will probably never want to play a class-based MMO video game again.    I now want my character to be able to perform any role.			"

												Enjoyable MMO that does away with leveling and your basic class system and instead focuses on player freedom and customization. Initially a bit challenging after playing some of the ""Press button to kill things"" games, The Secret World requires you to know your build well enough to utilize it during combat. It can feel a bit unforgiving at times if you haven't balanced out your gear and stats, but everything is customizable and can be broken down to make new items so it shouldn't take long to get the hang of playing.I would suggest the Massive Edition for anoyone completely new to the game. The starter weapons are good through the entire first zone (until you hit about 3 million XP) and you also get an XP booster you can use once every 16 hours (lasts 1 hour).Another big draw to the game is the overall look of your character and how much you can customize their wardrobe. Your stats are based off smaller items, not your shirt, hat and boots. You can acquire clothing items in game by doing various missions or achievements but you can also purchase them through the Item Store, which allows you to preview the item on your character before purchase. Sure, clothing doesn't affect the game, but being able to come up with your own look is a nice touch. What's more, you get your faction outfit as you progress through the game and you can unlock other outfits as you complete ""Decks"" (the closest thing to spec/builds in The Secret World). I would suggest looking over the starter decks early and figuing out what weapon combo you want to play, then spend you AP and SP to unlock that starter deck. Once you have completed it, you can claim the outfit for that deck. (Considering you can obtain every skill and ability in the game on one character, everyone is able to complete every deck and play every style.)One drawback I've found with The Secret World is that it's a bit of a time sink. What felt like an hour of play time was actually about 4 hours of real time. It's easy to get caught up in the world, I guess.			"

												I probably should start by stating the fact that I generally hate MMOs but this... This is different.It got guns. It got zombies. What more could you wish for?No, but seriously. The game has a modern day setting and brings every myth you ever heard of to reality in said world.Think of it as Supernatural being made into a MMO. You even solve cases and there's puzzles on top of the usual mass killing of your favorite creatures. And did I say it got guns? As in firearms - pistols, shotguns, assault rifles beside the magic and melee weapons.RIGHT NOW IT IS ON SALE!! A one time payment like with any other normal game, so no subscription fees.			"

												As far as MMOs go, I'm REALLY enjoying this game immensely.First, to be clear: It's not going to be for everybody. If you dislike MMO-style gameplay, then look elsewhere: this game includes a (somewhat) typical (though unique in some aspects) quest system, the usual grind from time to time, and tinkering with character stats.It also does not give you the full experience if all you're interested in is jumping into a game and mindlessly blowing everything up (which, hey, who doesn't love that, too?). Finally, the graphics aren't going to blow your mind (that's not to say they're bad. It's just...they're MMO graphics. What do you want?)But with all that said and out of the way, I love the effort this game goes through to create such an amazing atmosphere. The story is intricate and intriguing, the main quests include well-crafted cutscenes with quality voice acting. And the quests! The quests took me by surprise!The quests will range from your typical ""go here and kill 10 zombies,"" to an intricate series of puzzles and riddles, leading you through town and exploring secret areas, and finally giving you incredibly challenging riddles that require you to do research (with a pretty cool in-game browser window) to seek out a solution. Never before have I been challenged by an MMO like I have with TSW.And it's also the first MMO like this I've played that has no classes and no levels, pushing you to really invent unique ""deck"" combinations suited to your gameplay, picking and choosing which two weapons you want to use and which abilities for each. I found I was realllly left in the dark about how this all worked, but after I did some research into everything online, everything started to click into place quickly. Which I suppose is just fine for a game that urges you to research and learn, anyway.The subject and genre are unique and interesting, and it's a good experience to turn off the lights, and immerse yourself in the game, reading the clues and lore, learning new things, and exploring this creepy world. I'm hopeful for even more customization of character, and I think the gameplay system could be made more clear somehow, but overall, this game is a definite new favorite in my library. Solo-friendly. Group-friendly. Helpful and nice community.Overall, you only get out of this game what you're willing to put in. If you explore and involve yourself with the story, TSW is a rewarding experience. It was a refreshing change from my years of WoW addiction, and made me brush the dust off my brain. I'm hooked.			"

												PART 1~~Short Introduction~~TSW is a modern horror/mystery MMORPG set in the modern world. You can choose between three secret societies (like factions in other games) to join the battle against nasty monsters or each other.There are no classes or levels but I will talk about that later.~~Payment model~~TSW is Buy-to-play, similar to Guild Wars 2. You don't need a subscription to play but new content is (partially) locked behind a DLC. When you buy the game you get the base game and the first four Issues (that's what content patches are called). You also get enough Bonus Points (after doing 30 missions) to buy one of the DLC.The item shop is mostly cosmetic and the few non-cosmetic items are far from Pay-to-win.The optional subscription gives you some points for the store, a 10% store discount, an item of the month (clothing or pet), veteran points and an item that gives you double XP for one hour (16 hours cooldown).~~Setting~~TSW is set in the modern world. The three faction hubs are London, New York and Seoul. There are three quest regions at the moment, each with 2-3 zones: Solomon Island (New England), Egypt and Transylvania. The next region will be Tokyo (probably late 2013/early 2014).There is a lot of horror and mystery influence from H.P. Lovecraft, X-Files, etc.~~PvE~~Most of the quests have cutscenes and the voice actors are great. This is the first MMORPG where I didn't skip any cutscenes and really got into the story.Every quest is repeatable which lets you correct mistakes you made with your build early on and gives you the chance to get enough AP to get every skill later (see ~~Progression~~).There are three types of quests: Action, Sabotage and Investigation.Action quests are your typical run/kill quests.Sabotage quests have you sneak around and avoid cameras and monsters.Investigation quests have you solve puzzles, use real life knowledge etc. (One example (SPOILERS): In one of the quests you have to figure out that the hint you just got points to a specific bible verse which gives you another hint for the next quest step)The dungeons are some of the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG and can be pretty challenging if you don't get carried through. Each dungeon comes in three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Nightmare.The endgame is mostly running Nightmare dungeons and the two raids. With Issue 8 (released in Nov '13) there are also scenarios to run, which are basically instanced missions for solo, duo or groups with random elements.Unfortunately most of the content is the same regardless of faction and since you can get everything on one character you are not encouraged to make alts.~~PvP~~I don't play PvP myself but from what I hear some love it, some hate it. Better look for another review if you want to know more about PvP.			"

												I've spent around 32 hours with it, and in that time only made it through the first quest zone doing most of it by myself, and there were still quests to complete in the area when I decided to check out the next one. I think there are 8 or so zones in the base game, more available in expansions (one of which you can pick up for free with the Ultimate Edition since it gives you the free FunCom points used to buy such things). The zones themselves span from a New England town to Egypt, Transylvania, and Tokyo, as well as having hub cities like New York, London, and Seoul. The missions are pretty well done instead of the usual ""Kill X number of whatevers"" or ""Collect X number of whatevers,"" and some of what sets it apart from most other MMOs (or RPGs in general) is that it's a modern-day version of the world as we know it (but with a Call of Cthulhu kinda flair, so you run into crazy monsters along the way). You play as a member of a secret organization like the Illuminati doing all kinds of X-Files stuff away from the public eye. There is an in-game browser that you can use to look up fake websites, and there's investigative stuff to find passwords and clues to mysteries. And pretty much everything is voiced. I honestly can't think of any MMO that can compete with it in terms of missions. The biggest gripe most people have with the game is that the combat, like most MMOs in my experience, is kinda boring. It's slightly more nuanced than average, but still not super exciting. You get to pick two separate fighting styles based on the two weapons you have equipped, and you can change and upgrade any of them as you level up. So you can mix assault rifles with a sword and then over time you decide you like blood magic, you can equip a blood magic focus in place of your assault rifle or sword and totally mix up your play style. And yes, it is possible to unlock all of it and even save alternate loadouts so you can swap back and forth on the fly. Pretty much all of the content is solo friendly except for the dungeons, so you can enjoy 95% of the game without needing to suck your friends in or be social with strangers.			"

												If every conspiracy theory and Lovecraftian mythos happened at the same time, you have the setting for The Secret World.Pros* Buy-to-play (ie. no subscription). The game plays fine without spending any more money.* Fully voice acted including multiple appearances from Jeffrey Combs.* No classes, any character can put points into any skill tree.* No levels, you earn skill points at a steady pace. Instead, advanced skills cost more.* No skill point cap. Try everything!* At times it's geniunely very creepy.* A truly unique MMO setting.* Crafting is Minecraft style.Cons* Like much of the source material it's drawing from, the story is gibberish.* PVE combat is easy and gets repetitive.If you're tired of WoW clones and fantasy settings, try this. It's just dripping with atmosphere. Grab it when it's on sale and see if you like it.			"

												This game is not the best MMO I've ever played. Blockbusters like WoW or SWTOR beat it by throwing sheer volumes of money at every problem. But this game doesn't try to compete in their arena, and in doing so became the most interesting MMO I've ever played.Ever standard complaint of the genre is, if not fixed, at least tweaked. Sick of boring Kill X, Gather Y quests? The Secret World has the most involved quest lines I've ever played. Even their most basic missions are steeped in enough lore to keep you engadged and their legendary Investigation missions earn every bit of praise they've aquired. Tired of spammers filling chat with goldfarming ads and racist tirades? The TSW community is only interested in sharing theories and, occasionally, bad puns. Heck, just don't like monthly subscription fees? Pay once, play forever! And don't worry, while there is an add-on store, it's used entirely for cosmetics, convenience, and story additions. No pay-to-win here.If you're a fan of contemporary fantasy or cosmic horror genres, this is an absolute must. Even if you're just a casual MMO player interested in seeing how the genre can work when it's trying desperately to make the Blizzard lightning strike twice, this is a game worth seeing.Come on... take a peek behind the curtain of reality.

												Excellent game, pretty sure this is easily my second most-played MMO and I'm still very much enjoying it. Missions that will (most of the time) keep you interested, and a unique class system. I'll say, this game can be hard to get into. The story alone should keep you going for a bit, especially if you really give it a chance. I sometimes feel the dialouges are a bit drawn out but the story overall is interesting. That being said, questing areas are often not too populated and I imagine it can be hard to make friends, and the ability wheel at first glance can be overwhelming.One of the first thing you'll want to do is join Sanctuary by inputting ""/chat join sanctuary"" into your chat. This is a fairly active chat for new players with a lot of vets willing to help with builds, questing, and more. But as you get more comfortable with the world, your roles, the quests, the dungeons, it can become really fun. This is the only game I've ever played where I LOVE instances. I have no issue grinding every elite on repeat for hours. Each group poses new dynamics, challenges, and the boss fights are generally fun (to me).CLASSES AND FIGHTING:The ability to change out your roles and classes can be weird at first. Essentially in the beginning you will probably want to be guessing at builds online and hope they're effective until you learn the skills. But once you do, it can open up a  world of building your own builds, rotations, there is really no definitive way to play a class and a lot of the time later, you'll find yourself switching skills depending on the situation, or sometimes even roles, making you more and more valuable as a party member for your flexibility. It is amazingly valuable to be mid dungeon wiping and realizing you can't heal something, only to have a dps come up and say ""hey, we can switch"", and still be able to progress. QUESTING AND ENVIROMENT:Most reviews talk about this so I'm not gonna go into it too much. The story is interesting, with nice character variety and interesting side stories. There's some excellent attention to detail. There are actually for real sites they've made for this game connected to the story which can be clues and more, and I love little details like that. (i.e.: a character has a blog writing about something relevant to a quest, you can go to his blog: http://www.monstersofmaine.blogspot.ca/)Immersion is pretty good. Graphics, eh, pretty decent. Exploring and lore hunting is fun. Maps are fairly big, it'll take you some time to run around an entire one and see it all, often you'll find small side missions hidden if you're exploring. One criticism I have is the hitboxes for traps SUCK. I absolutely hate sneaking missions. You'll be feet away from a landmine and it will blow up on you. Absolutely hate those things.COMMUNITY:The community is often one of the better I have been in. If you are new to an instance there are usually people very willing to help out. I mainly heal in this game and I very very rarely get the whole ""omg noob healer!!!"" business (even when I can be that). It can be slow but there are some really cool people on this game. Late game players often even carry the easy difficulty dungeons for new players, there can be a very nice sense of community. Of course, there are the douches. It is an MMO. UI AND THE NEED FOR MODDING:The UI isn't great. It can be glitching and it's lacking as well. I'll tell you right now if you decide to get this game, mod the UI. You'll want better combat logs, resource counters, and... Well, just generally, look for the mods. ENDGAME:I'm not quite to full endgame yet so I feel a little weird writing about this specifically but endgame is grinding. Grinding nightmares, scenarios, signet missions. If you enjoy the gameplay, unlocking all your skills, making new builds, it's fun. But when you get there, that's definitely a thing. (To be expected in an mmo, but just saying.)Anyway... Been meaning to write a review for awhile. So... Off to run 24s. o/			"

												I have really enjoyed the Borderlands series and story - The characters made the difference. I wanted to try out my first MMO however I'm extremely picky about ""Fantasy"" - I usual don't like it. With TSW, it takes place in the Present. It has a ""grown-up"" story full of characters, etc. not found in most games. Plus, this game has as much playtime as the entire Borderlands series combined.There were some Sci Fi MMO's I considered, but I didn't want to level grind - TSW has linear growth and I can ""spend"" my Skill Points where ever to determine my Quality Level (1 - 10).With most of my gamer buddies on Xbox, I have to solo this a lot, and it's very doable - if balanced correctly. Other players are around and will assist occasionally to help you out.Here's my advice if you want to get started on The Secret World:Remember there are no monthly fees. You can play without every buying an In-app purchase. You will earn 1200 bonus credits to buy new side stories or in-game stuff after your 1st 30 missions. You can earn in game credit to buy things too. Spending real money might save you time though, get you time boosts, ""outfits"" - none of which is necessary. The Ultimate Edition on sale is the best buy with issues #1-#11, side stories, & more. Put The Secret World on your Steam Wish List. Install a copy from the Funcom.com site and ask for a 72 hr trial key from the Steam TSW Forums. Then if you enjoy it, get the Ultimate Edition when on sale ( at 60% off = $24 - WOW!! ). *IF you can get the basic Secret World for #1-#3 on sale that will give you time to play it until it's on sale again, but you'll basically spend $$$ to eval a game. Luckily, the Ultimate comes with a base game license key you are allowed to give away. NOTE: This is a FUNCOM key to give, not an extra Steam Key ! Do NOT create any character right away. You need to do research, preferable before you buy it. (Yes, you are already playing the game, not having bought it yet.) Read the Steam Community Guides on it. In particular: The Secret World 101 - has lots of great links at the bottom.

 http://wordpress.tswguides.com/category/tsw-guides/builds/level/my-first-60/ - this site is a must if your new and will be soloing Lastly, after completing 30 missions, Funcom (currently) gives you 1200 store credits which is worth $10. With that credit, you can buy anything you missed. If you own the Ultimate Edition, you're getting $10 back on your purchase for in-store credit for new chapters & packs. Awesome. Thanks Funcom.Character creation: Be patient creating a unique nickname. Without a login, use http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com to look up if nickname is taken. Note: there are also reserved names - First, Nick & Last . Not everyone can be Snoop Dog or Eva Longoria. If you goof up a Toon's appearance or name, (at the time of writing) you can delete you character & create a new one at no cost with the desired nick name (or even same nickname) so long as someone else doesn't grab the nickname -- I did. YMMV. But if you've been playing and want to re-spec - don't consider deleting it as you'll have many months of game play to get back to where you were. There's very rare reasons to delete to re-spec. Servers matter for solo adventurers - you want one to find folks for Dungeon runs, PvP gaming, or meet folks to co-op with. Unless you 'Meetup' with someone on another server or are co-op'ing, you will always PvP on your host. I've read I should have gone with Arcadia RP. Now, it's a Role Play host, that means stow (uncheck) your characters gear so it's not visible. And don't Run & Jump over every car & fence you see. I play that way already when I read the suggestion. FYI, It cost $20 to move an existing character to another server. So choose wisely. You can delete a character & create a new one (you have 3 slots) on your preferred server - but it'll be gone forever.I have my 2nd of three characters on Arcadia RP. Depending on the zone's or sub-zone's population, it can get occasionally very slightly jittery. If that's a problem, don't use Arcadia. My first character is on Daemon server and its really smooth. My third is on Cerberus. Now I have a character on each of the most populated (English) servers. Put every piece of clothing on your character you can when first making them. Jackets, glasses, etc. They will always have shirt, shorts/pants, shoes. However, glasses, hats, jackets, etc. can be removed at anytime. If you want them in-game, you have buy them with earned (or real) currency, achievements, etc. So, take them while their free. You will get bonus stuff from the Steam purchase. Use some of them. Press ',' comma to pull up the store,  select Claim Items, then *review first*. Do *not* claim any yet. Review all the store. Some are even more powerful than earned rings, etc in game but only work below 3mil Exp. Others [ like timed boosts] work for all levels. Consider saving your boosts for later so you level faster/steady on tougher minions/portions. Factions only matters for PvP really (capture the flag, territories, etc.). Everyone has the same story to complete, though your faction will alter some dialog. There are a few faction missions, but they are different perspectives or goals of the same event. Everyone can travel to the other cities: London (bank & large market), New York (body modification) & Seoul.Game Mods:Viper's TopBar Overload and Viper's Deck ManagerYou'll likely want the Mods: Viper's TopBar Overload so you can install Viper's Deck Manager. The site http://secretui.com has them. Some people use http://Curse.com. You can download them from there too. (I don't like having more clients so I don't run Curse on my rig.)VDM is the defacto ""stringifier"" of builds for importing & exporting your current loadout while making loadouts easier too. It's a maintained community Mod. Several Mods are must have but TopBar Overload & VDM are practically mandatory.These sites can share & compare your builds with others outside of TSW:(Note: if your chronicle.thesecretworld.com profile page is publicly visible, some of these sites will import using that too beside your exported VDM string) http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/ http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/Ability%20Wheel.swf (Just the tool) http://www.tsw-builder.com http://www.badomens.net/calculator http://joakibj.com/tswcalcThere's a few more build sites too.BTW, Viper's DontMakeMeWait is super helpful is speeding past all the startup junk.TSWRPAnother popular mod is for http://tswrp.co - it's allows for in-game role play character HTML rich profile sheets to be accessible on the toons. Being HTML, folks can embed photos, use different fonts & colors, etc. Even if you don't RP (role play) you can use it for conveying additional information about your toon or you.

												Well what can I say about this game :P I love it soooooo much, I have put in over 1800 hours so far and not even close to finished yet, new content released all the time and I get to play with my friends. The maps are massive and filled with missions, also one of the best story line missions I have ever seen. For the most part the people are friendly and the GM's are fast to respond and they are friendly too. You dont have to pay to play this game but I recommend paying becasue you get access to a rance of content and store items that you cant buy anywhere els, there are super cute outfits and tons of accessories. One of the best things about this game is you can be any role you like, we have things called talismans and depending on the talismans you equip you can play the role of a tank, DPS or healer, you can also mix talismans and chop and change your spec on the fly, and combind your stats to make a heal-tank :P or a leech DPS or combind all 3 to make very powerful tanking healer dps build thingys (I call them survival builds) to kill the many monsters in the new nightmare level scenario issue packs found in game. Really its impossible to do a in depth review of this game becasue its simply too big and too much to do and too much to say... just take my word for it and buy the game you wont regret it. Sure its hard in the beginning but once you get some gear you can take on the world solo or as a group of upto 10 of your friends :P Make your own guilds and this isnt even mentioning the PVP aspect of the game... just buy it :P			"

												TL;DR Worth the cost for top-notch story, voice-acting, and characters - but the rest of the game is average at best.A modern-day MMO with guns, Lovecraftian horrors, and bare-naked demon lady boobs.Combat is a bit different to standard tab-target and hotkeys, with a smaller set of abilities and a dodge button. Groups and dungeons still boil down to tank/damage/heals though.Story, script, and voice-acting is where this game really shines compared to others in the genre. Focus on puzzle-solving and the modern-day setting I liked a lot, and are a refreshing change to all the dragons, orcs, elves etc. But while this game nails plot, character, and narrative in a way that no other developer does - especially in the field of MMOs - there are a lot of weaknesses.Character creation is very basic indeed. All characters are fashion-model slim (no options to add bulk in the form of muscle or fat), and although there is a slider to alter height, the variation is quite small. Facial options are limited to a handful of starting faces, with a small selection of features and skin colours. The end result is a game populated by characters of the same build, roughly the same height, who all move in exactly the same way. Superficially the faces look different, but underneath it's still easy to spot one of the small number of basic templates.Character and combat animations are also basic, with the same ones being used for a variety of similar skills (sword skills seem most memorable for this).Combat initially seems more innovative because of the small ability set and the dodge mechanic, but is just tab-target and hotkey with the aforementioned grafted on. Whilst not a bad thing on its own, combat in TSW lacks any sense of impact or meaningful feedback whilst fighting (e.g. when using an enormous black sledgehammer with veins of lava on it, I don't feel like it's connecting with enemies, and there is little to no reaction from them when they are hit aside from numbers appearing above their heads). Coupled with the re-used animations this makes battles slidey/floaty, repetitive affairs, even later in the game when more advanced abilities are unlocked.If you treat this game as single-player and buy it for the story, then you will get amazing value for money - there are hundreds of hours on offer here. It's just a shame that the MMO components and the combat (which there is a lot of) are usually mediocre.			"

												This game is one part mysticism and occult, one part urban legends, and one part the Matrix, all put into a blender and injected with steroids and served on an MMO platter. I'm really glad I gave this game a second chance. I followed the game's production which sadly was a mistake because I sort of painted this idea in my head of what the game was going to be like. When I finally got to jump in I was disappointed when ""The Secret World"" wasn't really all that secret, as my first few hours of playing were spent saving a town from a zombie apocalypse. Being sorely disappointed by this overused cliche, I shelved the game. Cut to several years later, I have gotten over my preconceived notions of what this game was going to be and allowed myself to get caught up in the Lovecraftian style horror and heavy occult themed storyline, and I'm loving every minute of it.There is lots of action right from the start, and while playing the newest addition to one of the three ancient factions (Illuminati, Dragon, or Templar) you find yourself instantly going from average joe to superhero. Yes its a little unrealistic and overdone, but don't let this turn you off. Once you overlook how over the top everything is you can allow yourself to really get caught up in the world that has been created for you to discover.You can pretty much play this game like a single player game with MMO elements. Some may be turned off by that, but actually the missions in this game are well thought out, delivered with cutscenes, full voice acting, and are far from your typical kill X mobs, collect X items, etc. that have plagued the MMO scene since WoW (some of this is still present, but usually in the form of optional side missions). The most intriguing thing about this game are the special investigation type missions. These missions don't hold your hand and, for example, will have you using the in game browser to pull up a website for an in game company in order to find clues that will lead you to the next mission objective, or you may need to use google to translate Latin scribbled on the wall that's a riddle leading you to the next objective. This really taps into the whole ""Secret World"" thing, and is very rewarding when you are finally able to figure out the mystery. One mission even had me follwing a clue that lead me to a video on youtube that was recorded by an occult fanatic trying to open a portal to hell (yes this video is really up on youtube). This type of interactive quest system that forces you to think outside the box is something I've never seen done by any other MMO.The class system is completely fluid, you build your own class by attaining ability points (AP) and spending them in one of the many skill trees tied to the different weapon types. You are able to have 2 weapons equipped at one time, limiting you to the active abilites associated with those two weapon types, but you can have passives from any of the other weapon types active regardless of what weapons you have equipped. This system allows for an incredible amount of customization. Also there is no limit to the amount of AP you can gain, so eventually you will have all skills unlocked, so there is no need to develop mutliple characters if you want to try different weapons and builds, it can all be changed on the fly on a single character. (I strongly suggest using some of the prebuilt ""decks"" in the ability window, these will help you learn how active and passive abilities across multiple weapon types can create synergies. This is very helpful to the new player - you also get cool costumes for unlocking all abilites in a ""deck"")As far as the combat and item system, its very similar to SWTOR (Star Wars the Old Republic), albeit the animations are not quite as smooth. Many enemies and dungeon/raid encounters will require you to dodge AoEs and areas you need to avoid will be highlighted, giving you time to run or dodge out of harms way, making positioning very important. This makes combat dynamic and much more engaging. You have 7 active abilities and 7 passive abilities. Items are geared towards either DPS, tanking, or healing, and if you plan on running dungeons and raids (this game has a great group/raid finder) you will need to specialize your gear and build accordingly (but as I said, gear and build loadouts can be saved and changed on the fly with the click of a button to fit whatever your group/raid needs).TL:DR All and all The Secret World has really surprised me. What I thought was going to be just another over the top forray into quest grinding wrapped in a Lovecraftian, occult, conspiracy theorist skin, turned out to actually be a very well created story driven MMO with lots of exciting mysteries to uncover and fun character progression. If you want to experience a game with a dark atmosphere and well written missions, give this game a try, you'll be glad you did!			"

												The best and perhaps only consistently good part of The Secret World is the world design; the environments are generally fantastic, the story can be pretty good, and the world overall is vibrant (if a bit shallow).The gameplay leaves a *lot* to be desired. The lack of traditional classes and level structure sounds interesting at first, but it's little more than a facade in reality. The ""classes"" of the game are your weapons, which each have two different ""roles"" that they're designed around -- Fist weapons heal, Blood magic provides shields, Swords deal DPS, etc -- and the result is ultimately a little more restrictive than Guild Wars (1), except very little in the game makes these equipment ""roles"" explicit, leaving all of that to discovery (by which I mean the wiki). The absence of proper ""levels"" in the game is just as fake -- you'll still be stomped flat if you wander too far ahead of your ""level"" (or encounter a higher-level player in PvP), and you'll trounce anything below your ""level"" -- the game just hides all of that information from you. The game doesn't ""unleash"" you in any way; it just trades your leash for a shock collar of painful trial-and-error.The controls and netcode are terrible. And yet, somehow, despite the fact that your player character controls like a fish flopping around on an ice rink, Funcom had the gall to include a significant emphasis on jumping puzzles in TSW. (Full disclosure: this review was the product of after two hours' rage, trying to glide my fish up *two jumps*, complete with skidding about, unregistered jump keys, jumps of inconsistent height and distance, and random rolling around.)Sadly, the puzzles in TSW are often painfully vague, or utterly tedious. You WILL need to look up many of them from a wiki, and you WILL want to after dealing with some of these quests. For examples: translating morse code for a pattern in a blinking light that you aren't directed towards; translating phrases into *broken* Latin for computer passwords; learning a demonic alphabet so you can type more broken Latin (thankfully provided) into runes on the floor. There's a few good puzzles interspersed, but unfortunately most of them completely miss the mark.Overall, the game just isn't worth playing as a primary MMO. If it goes on sale for $10, consider picking it up to play for a weekend or two; tour the game's environments, enjoy a few of the better puzzles, but don't pay so much that you'll feel obligated to play through the unending piles of awful that this game also offers.

												After buying and playing The Secret World, I knew getting Ultimate Edition was the absolutely right thing to do. It's story & lore beats most of the single player RPGs. All dialogues are voiced, graphics are great compared to other MMOs.Also, there are some crazy missions/puzzles. For example, a while ago I did the Red Handed quest.______________In first tier, there are sick people with some listed symptoms, you need to give them the right drugs.For the first patient, I googled *""spasm in jaw muscles, breathing problems""* it turned out to be tetanus. Then I checked for it's treatment on Wikipedia:http://i.imgur.com/26exBVI.jpgGived Diazepam to the patient.The first 3 patients were easy but the 4th had an untreatable disease (can't remember now, vampire bite or something); but the doctor's father had worked on it, so I checked his diary.http://i.imgur.com/FPNWAYm.jpgIt was obvious that they were elements, I tried to use first letters of English equivalents instead of Latin, but that didn't work.Then, http://i.imgur.com/TJFz66Z.jpgI wrote down the atom numbers of the elements; and then looked for the letter in the alphabet's n'th place.The message was this:“I Asked The Old Drinkers at the Tavern About My Father Some Recalled He Spent Nights With His Local Mistress There. “Good with a pitchfork and that is not all” This woman is long gone, but perhaps something remains.”Went to the tavern, checked the rooms and this was there:http://i.imgur.com/RFq8E6v.jpgIf you strip away the holiness from this message, the truth of my research will be revealedThere are holy places in the village. At the holy church there is a holy man. That holy man owns a holy book. I went to the church, searched around and digged out a soviet laptop.It had this http://i.imgur.com/8vESjSb.jpg&nbsp;The laptop had a password and the hint was this:http://i.imgur.com/54RQf37.jpgI searched the numbers and they were genotype for the UROD gene.https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/UROD#conditionsPassword was **porphyria**____________________________And there's whole bunch of story missions, dungeons, raids, regular MMO stuff etc.That's why I love The Secret World.

												An above average Buy to Play MMO, recommended if you are getting this on sale and are looking for a singleplayer experience in an MMO. Game has promising ideas, but implementation leaves much to be desired and Funcom suffered financially as a result. Graphics:Nice artstyle and atmosphere but overall graphics is not the game strong points. Animation and graphic quality are average at best while optimisation isn't very good (I have better frame rate and less stutter on Black Desert Online with many more player character onscreen compared to TSW not so populated first few zones). Cutscenes are abundant but due to not-so-good animation they are boring most of the time to watch. Gameplay:Interesting non-class based mechanic but still follow the traditional holy trinity which is good. Interesting puzzle approach to quests, but puzzles are not on par with say The Longest Journey and much of the time require you to surf the internet to find the answer. Apparently the game has an in-game web browser just for this purpose. Combo system is so-so, there are MMOs that handles combo much better. Overall gameplay is not mechanically complex as Anarchy Online. It's neither a sandbox nor a themepark MMO, probably somewhere between a sandpark (the like of ArcheAge and Black Desert Online) and themepark (of WoW or Final Fantasy XIV). Can't comment on group content yet as I have not touched it, but the singleplayer experience is meh if you are actually compare it to singleplayer game. I can't help but be disappointed this wasn't a singleplayer game from the beginning, cutting the wasted resource on MMO part to help refine and polish what could have been a great singleplayer action-RPG.Story:Interesting and well written, but nothing groundbreaking. Maybe I have played too many RPGs over the year so it's hard to impress. Too bad Ragnar Tornquist left much early on, but then again the new Dreamfall Chapters wasn't as well received as The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapter either. Is it because ""we've seen it all"" that we keep getting disappointed by further creations in the same veins?			"

												This is a real treasure!The game looks and plays like an mmorpg; mediocre (sorry, mmo-fans). The content and lore is of a level I have not seen in a lot of games. Through the latter I'm getting immersed in a world of fiction and one that borders our own conspiracy culture, history and beliefs. I highly recommend this game, especially if you don't mind solo-exploring (yes, it is a mmo, but it's as multiplayer as you want it to be; not necessary), if you're into conspiracy culture, myths, monsters, puzzles (please try solve them yourself, it feels so good to solve them) and don't mind closing the curtains and locking yourself in for a couple of days.It is totally worth it. Listen to all the conversations (exhaust all your options), read all the lore, do as much sidequests as you can, and this will be worth more to you than it costs. Also; a bottle of wine works well alongside.			"

												Ever heard of a single player MMO? No? Neither have I but if you were imagine something so obsurd you would soon imagine ""The Secret World"".The world is pretty big and open with plenty of quest givers strewn about. With this you can explore and kill with friends but the story missions are almost all singleplayer. These missions are what makes the game so great. Many are investigation missions with criptic clues and puzzles. They actually encourage you to leave the game and use the internet as a research tool trusting that you will return. I have never seen a game with so much confidence in its design as to let you leave and know you will be back.Also, no monthly fee is a huge bonus. It takes away the pressure to play play play just to get your moneys worth.			"

This game have many epic stories and puzzles i very enjoy watching every video in game. In my opinion this is how modern mmo need to look like these days. Would i recommend, yes 100%. From all listed above mmos i would give number 1 place for secret world. Yes its even better than wow for me. I played Wow about 1 year but i didnt like the story as much as Secret World. Wow quests more boring and less fun same as Dungeons and Raids, i dont want to judge Wow but if you looking for a new mmo try The Secret World.			"

												TRANSMIT - initiate Steam signal - RECEIVE - initiate review sequence - JOIN US - initiate purchase protocol - WITNESS - The Secret World.Initiate overview.The Secret World is a modern day setting MMO, which is already fairly unique, but isn't the game's only peculiarity. It has a heavy focus on story and atmosphere, the combat system deviates from the usual MMO formula, and many other preconceptions are either tweaked or totally changed from what people might be used to. The game also has a big focus on customization, allowing players to dress any way they like, and make any skill build they want for a very flexible experience.Initiate positive reinforcement.The game's best asset by far is the story. If you can get into it, it's REALLY good, specially the deeper you go, and the more you advance through the Issues of content. The cast of characters is also well developed and entertaining to listen to, really selling you on the setting and what's going on. The quest design is also very interesting: there's not only fetch quests or ""kill 10 of this enemy"" quests, there's also puzzle quests, or quests that require stealth, even quests that require you to investigate to find an answer, using resources such as Google or the Bible.Beware. The dark side.However, the game isn't without shortcomings. For some, the combat might feel a bit lackluster and simple. While I enjoy it the way it is, and as you play you unlock the more fun to use skills, some of the animation or skill effects are a bit underwhelming. The graphics of the game, while overall great looking, can feel a bit dated or have minor errors sometimes. Finally, the game is known to have plenty bugs, from visual errors, to getting stuck, or even failing a quest because of them, but most have easy solutions and workarounds.Dark days are coming.Overall, I love this game to bits, and is probably up there with Final Fantasy XIV for my favorite MMO. Its issues are many, and some quite obvious, but the good aspects surpass the bad ones by far. I encourage anyone remotely interested in the game to give the free 10 day trial a shot, you will probably be surprised.Our wisdom flows so sweet. Taste and see.			"

												______________________________________Updated/Revised @ 100 hours______________________________________WARNING: This'll likely be long.Firstly, I'd caution social MMO fans that TSW is not the kind of MMO to which you're probably accustomed. While there are many social features here (such as raid-only dungeons, a kind of ""buddy system"" designed to connect likeminded players, etc.), TSW feels a lot more like a single-player game with multiplayer options than the other way around. It's HIGHLY immersive and, in my humble opinion, best suited for roleplayers and hardcore ARPGers than casuals or social butterflies.As for immersion, one of the things I like most about TSW is that it truly makes you CARE about the characters and the stories it provides for you as a player. Cinematics accompany nearly every main or story quest-giving NPC and your quests are capped to better ensure that you take your time while exploring the regions available to you. The stories are very much alive in this game.It's also a true horror fan's wet dream, going far beyond cheap jump scares and the same old monster grinds over and over again. Sure, there are ""kill quests"" which require you to knock off a dozen of the same mob and you may get tired of seeing zombies around every corner by the time you've made your way through most of the Savage Coast, but you'll also be tracking down the pages of discarded horror novels and following in the characters' footsteps. You'll be battling haunted theme park rides and discovering hidden Illuminati archives. You'll be learning all about the woeful fate of Andy's kittens. It makes the monotony of creature killing so much less monotonous and (in some cases) gets a teensy bit difficult to play comfortably alone in the dark.  Key things to remember if you're just getting started:-The leveling system is less about the prestige of character level and more about your combat build, with an emphasis on faction rank and ability combinations. -The crafting system is a little (read:extremely) tough to master at first, but once you've gotten it down, it becomes a fun sort of mad science.-The dungeons are incredible and well worth the effort of LFGs. -You WILL change your mind a half a dozen times about which weapons you want to use. -You WILL get frustrated trying to figure out how to complete some of the investigative quests -You WILL break down and Google how to solve at least one of the aforementioned quests because the game isn't holding your hand.-You WILL die. A lot. -The community is there to help you. They're very kind as a whole and I've personally never seen anyone trolled for not knowing how to do something. Don't be scared to reach out if you need help.The most important thing to bear in mind about TSW, I think, is that it requires patience and a passion for discovery. If you're looking to barrel through a game that'll make you feel like a god from the word ""go,"" try a different MMO. If, however, you'd rather be elbow-deep in the lore of the old gods and feel like you're literally lost in a world of unending madness, play the Secret World.Masterfully written, beautifully executed. It's the best MMO I've ever played.			"

												This was without a doubt, the most amazing MMO experience I ever had in my life. I started back in the good 'ol days when Cyberion City was around in 1993. Then the Diku, Merc, Circle MUDs came out. Then there was Ultima Online, then EverQuest and so on. I built and assaulted fortresses in DaoC and Lineage 2, I enjoyed WoW, was blown away by the storylines of SWTOR and ran through Neverwinter and so many others. None of that compares to The Secret World. The missions, the character progression, the amazing lore and storyline that bleeds into the real world and back. Playing the investigation missions (no cheating) and figuring them out has been more rewarding than many single-player games ever. I loved how the game created mass-instances so immersion was rarely broken seeing hundreds of players running around.  I loved how I could change my builds and change my roles on the fly. That my gear wasn't tied to how I looked at all and I could be whoever or whatever I wanted to be. I felt the pervasive fear of the unknown, the shock and rage at the atrocities of the Orochi Group, the love for Emma, the wild and awe-inspiring raids or dungeons. I was stunned, surprised, and dismayed, and overjoyed at the secrets to behold upon reaching the dark tower. I was there to help the residents of New England, breaking the curses, learning about its secrets and histories. I learned more about the majesty and wonder of Egypt than I had ever before. The brazen adventures of fun as I felt like James Bond or Indiana Jones thrilled me. I liked the weekly challenges, the combat (yes its far better than just waiting for silly things to proc with the slow beat of a ""normal"" mmo combat system) with its dashes and rolls and mixing magic and guns in all their glory.Yet I can't recommend the game anymore. Because instead of making new content, they've decided to kill the game. They're launching a new game with a graphics makeover, screwing over all the original players (you have to start all over again from freshstart), and this old, beautiful game is (as of today) now officially a dead world, a dead game. Its joins its brethern like Anarchy Online. Still running, but dead inside, never to see anything new again. Maybe you'll want to try the new game (SWL), but with a dumbed down combat system and streamlined gameplay, its going to be a sad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of its former self.			"

												It is the best mmo currently available. There is no other online game with better quests or deeper atmosphere. Absolutely everything is voiced and most of the quests deserve to have a full game dedicated to them,If you love the works of Lovecraft, mythology, urban legends, modern setting  and mature community, you will find yourself at home here.

												I like the premise of this game, and to be honest I like many of the mechanics of the game, but sadly it fails as a MMO. While the missions are nice, with really quite unnecessary cutscenes that are just really nice bonus content, a lot of the game seems to be devoid of players who are below Q10; at least on the server I was playing. This means you don't really get to play dungeons and have to focus on missions to ""level"" and gear up. You can play the auction house, but there's too large a divide between those who can farm high-Q areas and those who can't; basically items are either pennies or gazillions, which translates to *not very good* and *completely unaffordable/above your Q-level until you've grinded away hours of your life*.If you ignore this, and focus on the game as a mission-based RPG, it's not bad. Problem is, it's a grindy RPG, and unless you're one of the dedicated few, there's better RPG's out there. While I wouldn't *discourage* anyone from buying it if they wanted to try it out, ultimately it means I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.			"

												Not your typical MMO this one.  It has a lot of the staple MMO tropes with quest based progression and the ""Holy Trinity"" of Tanks, DPS, and Healers...it does hold a special place in my heart.   The investigation aspects of this game are amazing and it's quite clear the writers took a lot of time to make sure that you would get involved in the lore of the store they're trying to tell.  Even in the first zone there are missions that require you to understand latin, know 16th Century composers, and be able to determine where to look off of very little info given. While the combat system is rather bland, and it once again follows the typical MMO tropes of follow a quest line through a zone...I can say it held my attention for the many hours I played (Even though it says I've played 14 I have much more then that due to their launcher being derpy.)  I would suggest picking this up full price if you're intrigued about the storyline and are looking for an MMO to try out...or wait till it goes on sale and pick it up for you and a couple of friends. I do however warn you, if you're looking for the typical WoW style gameplay, it's not here.  If you don't like reading, or using your head then the investigation missions might not be for you. (And yes you can look up the answers online...but whats the fun in that?)  "

												An atmospheric horror conspiracy MMORPG with interesting combat, incredible role flexibility, and great character customization. Making character builds and running the fun dungeons are especially enjoyable.+ Fun dungeons with interesting bosses and only few trash mobs+ Many character customization and outfit options, with clothing stores, a barber, and a plastic surgeon+ Unique atmosphere for an MMORPG blending together horror, fantasy, conspiracy, and pop culture+ The mega server structure allows everyone to meet up and play together+ Full interface mod support, with tons of useful mods available- Performance can be demanding, there are quite often FPS issues, with the interface being a main culprit- PvP options are limited and the reward system is still not optimal			"

												Think 'Stranger Things', the MMO. It's got a great story, great storytelling, an immersive atmosphere unlike any other MMO out there, and is very flexible about your playstyle. You can solo your way through, gear up through PVP, run dungeons, all the good stuff. The developers actively push out new missions in content packs that you can buy (or get for free if you're subscribed), kind of like what Elder Scrolls Online does. It's definitely worth a try if you're curious.			"

												Somewhere in a desolate hotel room there's a guy starting to realize that eternal fate has turned his back on him.""It's 2 A.M., the fear has gone."" he says ""I'm sitting here waiting, the gun is still warm. Maybe my connection is tired of taking chances."" Taking a deep breath, he continues, ""Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head. I'm wrapped up in the silence, all circuits are dead. I can not decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy.""  Frustration is shown in his eyes, as he paces back and forth. Then it hits.""Help, I'm stepping into the twilight zone. This place is a madhouse, it feels like being cloned!"" screaming, banging his fist upon the wall of his empty room. ""My beacon's been moved under the moon and star. Where am I to go, now that I've gone to far?"" Soon you will come to know when the bullet hits the bone.""I'm falling down a spiral, destination unknown. A double-crossed messenger, all alone.

												You'll have to excuse me because I like to write long reviews.In my opinion ""The Secret World"" is an MMO that does everything right. Solid gameplay with a fantastic questing system. This game doesn't disappoint. Every character you meet feels different from the rest, there's no running to npc's taking a quest and skipping through all the quest text. Each mission you take has its own little story and cutscene. Some quests require you to complete others first, in which certain characters will warm up to your character and tell you more of their backstory, making it feel like your actually making a difference. I can't say much about the story in MMO's as most tend to be okay at best but I actually enjoy this game for its story, it incredibly rich on lore and I feel as if I know more of what happens in The Secret World than I do in real life.Purchasing the expansions (labeled ""Issues"" in the game store) has added much more to this game. A new verity of weapons to choose from such as Chainsaws and Flamethrowers, to RPG's and Quantum magic. With the latest addition of Tokyo added AEGIS armor into the game, which is sort of like a rock, paper scissor combat in which you must match your damage type to the enemies armor type to do damage before you can physically harm them. The Combat system""The Secret World"" eases you slowly into its combat, allowing you to train on test dummies at the start of the game to decide on which starting weapon is best suited to you, then you'll quickly acquire a second weapon which allows you to mix and match up to 7 different skills on the hotbar from each of the skill trees from your weapons, many of which can be mixed together to create powerful skill combinations. At later stages of the game, the combat begins to climb in difficulty adding buffs to the mobs you fight, such as Spectres in graveyards phasing in and out of reality changing their physical and magical damage resistances. With the current addition being the AEGIS system.The StoryIts hard to explain the story without containing spoilers, the Story for ""The Secret World"" is incredibly well written and I have enjoyed every minute of it so far. It has a good mix of serious dialogue with a few jokes thrown in the lighten things up. The characters are written really well, there's a handful of characters that are written so that you can understand them emotionally and then there's a fair few characters that are written so that you will dislike them. Each character in the story is varies from each other and keeps the story fresh and entertainingContent (""Issues"")To a certain extent I feel as if this is where the game dropped the ball slightly. Issues 1 through 6 added a good chunk of extra story to the game and felt as if they were worth the money, considering the most you pay for an expansion is around 10 pounds I wasn't expecting a huge amount of content, but atleast something to keep the game fresh for a while longer. Issues 7-8 felt a bit lacking as apposed to its previous Issues. Issue 7 adds an extra bit of story to the Transylvania portion of the game and was fun to play, but as soon as I found myself having a good time with it, it was over. Issue 8 is where my main gripe is at. Issue 8 included the area, well I should say room ""Venice"". In Venice you can take part in scenarios, in which you must keep 2-3 groups of survivors alive through 3 waves of enemies, with a boss at the end of each wave. The amount of survivors alive at the end of the three waves determine how many ""Seals"" you will acquire at the end. The scenarios are a nice addition to the game, but are incredibly repetitive. Having Issue 8 allows you to take part in three different scenarios, not owning Issue 8 leaves you with 1 scenario to take part in. Scenarios can be completed by yourself, as a duo or as a full group. The maximum amount of seal you can acquire is determined by the difficulty of the scenario you undertake. The easiest difficulty will give you around 5 seals and each scenario has a 18 hour cooldown before you can attempt it, and a 45 minute cooldown if you fail it. In a recent patch the need for getting 80 seals to proceed to Tokyo has been removed to just completing the first training mission in Venice, which allows you to move straight onto the next part of the story. However you can still undertake missions in Venice to aquire powerful gear.All in all ""The Secret World"" is a very well created game with a lot of time and care spent in its creation. I would highly recommend this game to any MMO player and strongly suggest that they stick with it. As each issue adds even better things to the gameUpon the recent patch which changes both the combat, gear and story progression my final rating for this game has changed to     10/10			"

												Best singleplayer pc rpg questing game ever. Also it is online and has horriterrimegaultrabad group content. Play it like a singleplayer game, or duo with a friend and the quests will drop your jaw.There are no character levels in a sense, you get skill points and spend them accordingly to get a variaty of skills from the giantish skill wheel, and ability points to pump into your weapons and gear levels. It's a somewhat neat system, but it feels like it's only really there to overcomplicate the ""no character levels"" gimmick when in reality there are levels because you have to pump ability points into gear levels then you are rated by what level gear you are wearing. One of the main reasons why the group content is so bad, the dungeons have a recommended gear level but everyone at base gear level wants to go in asap and get carried / bring down the group.The multiplayer aspect isn't actually that bad, but the playerbase makes it horrible. There tends to be the elitist group that doesn't allow anyone to join or even try to learn the content, then the OMGLETSGO base level players who want to get carried through all the content. The dungeons are pretty well made, focusing more on movement and awareness then mindnumbing loldps.Now the quest system is a whole new monster. The quest system is built for replayability and actually makes you think and work for it the first time through. The quests are basically placed so when you finish one quest, you should be within earshot of another to pick up, and depending on which quests you choose, your route can change when replaying areas. The quests aren't the normal ""go here"" ""pick this up"" ""defend this person"" quests, these will actually make you think and make use of the in-game browser. The first area alone will make you translate latin, find secrets in paintings and artists, connect symbols to in-game items, decipher a nursery rhyme, and figure out meanings of cryptic messages. For examgle ""Time is the province of Kings and Gods. The hands of time point to truths written by Kings in the words of God.  The path is opened to the enlightened."" is just one of the clues during an investigation mission. All the quests in the game are also given a cooldown when finished so you can replay them and get the full xp again; so you can actually play through the same area as much as you want with no penalty, although higher level area will give better xp so you can get some of the higher tier skills easier.The game is a bit pricey but don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for a steal. Long as you treat it like an online singleplayer game, you won't be dissappointed. The investigation missions are definitely worth it.			"

												This is not a bad game, but certainly no masterpiece.It used to be a subscripton game ($15 per month), now it's buy to play, meaning you buy it and don't pay anything more to play. Well, that's the theory. The problem is that you won't be getting a lot of contents at max level, unless you fork up the money for the socalled Issues (content packs). As far as I know, you get the game with updates up to and including Issue #4, while the rest (currently up to #10) has to be paid for.About questing in this game: it has often been said that this game does not have quest hubs, quests are found when exploring. This is BS. There are certainly quest hubs, and the quest you're supposed to find while exploring, are mostly impossible to not find, since you'll either do other quests in such areas, or move though them while going somewhere else. Many quests counts as ""main quests"", and these have one extremely annoying issue: if you already have one, you can't get another unless you accept that the first one is cancelled.Funcom tried to make a combat system with an advanced skill-up system, but (imo) they failed miserably. Though it's not recommended, it's possible to to go through all the contents while never using more than 2 or 3 abilities/spells at any time. That why many jokes about describing the whole conbat system like this appeared: ""press 1,1,1,1,1,2 - repeat and never change"".So, is it worth it?Well, not the full price. This game if often on sale here or elsewhere. If you wanna try it, grab it then. Imo, the game isn't as innovative as Funcom tries to make it sound. To begin with, it feels new and fresh, but it quickly becomes repetitive and average. And that's when you realise that there are better options out there.			"

												The quests in this game are mind blowingly awesome.  I've played dozens of MMOs and none of them can compare to TSW for questing and environment.  This game knocks atmosphere out of the park.The combat system, however, leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Although the skill tree itself is very interesting and allows for really fun and unique builds, the animations are wonky, combat feels slow and boring.Character generation is also not a strong point of the game, making a character that isn't fugly is quite a challenge.  Good thing there are tons of costumes available in game to help you cover up your ugly mug.Still, that quest system though.  Love it.			"

So many things to loosen your grip on your hard earned cash. What's more there is advice we can give, of places you can go to bond with others like yourself. To seek assistance with the things that go bump.Beware sweetling, this is not a battle of good vs evil, those are constructs of human design. No, the moral scope is far more gray than what you'd expect. You are not a paragon of heroics or the bringer of evil....you are merely a bee that is attempting to do what you can to hold Dark Days at bay....however....It's too late for everything is true and Dark Days are here.

												I'll start by saying that so far, The Secret World is probably the best MMO that i've ever played.The storyline is solid, the missions are submersive and even the side missions tie into the main story somehow. It's one of these games where it feels worth doing every possible mission and exploring everything. Some of the missions are rather difficult and will require you to translate morse code, ancient hieroglyphics, binary and the like. There's no handholding involved here and will have you do some true detective work. You are given a In-Game browser to assist you in your investigation missions. The graphics engine works well with the game design and the music is very suiting to the Lovecraftian atmosphere you find yourself in. And as far as i have experienced, the community seems friendly and adult. I haven't run into many other players personally, but i think it suits the apocalyptic mood. It does have a good size player base so the wait for a group event or dungeon is never long.If you want to try out a MMO that is different and engaging? Then you should give this one a try! "

												I'm new to the game, but here are my first impressions.- Graphics are subpar. They aren't TOO bad, but yeah, they're pretty outdated.- Animations are wooden and somewhat awkward. The game isn't that old, so I'd expect slightly better combat animations and smoother character models.- Pretty generic combat. Tab-target, mash keys, watch them trade hits until one drops dead. It isn't that boring, but in this day and age MMOs are moving towards more action-style combat.+ Great setting and theme, with all the secret societies and Lovecraftian monsters. You get to be in the Illuminati and fight Cthulhus. How awesome is that!?+ Engaging and unique quests. Many of them don't hold your hand and direct you to some place to kill some monsters. You have to put on your detective cap and figure things out for yourself. Figure out the code to unlock a safe, hack into computer systems, etc. Or you can pull out the wiki, but that's no fun.+ A huge degree of freedom in the way of character building and progression. No levels, game doesn't pin you to a class, you're able to do whatever the hell you want as long as you work for it.+ A deep and engrossing narrative, which seems to be the main selling point of The Secret World. The voice acting and storytelling are top-notch, and that's saying something because I'm a freak for storyline in videogames. I daresay it's on par with many of the story-heavy singleplayer RPGs of today. It's well-crafted, immersive, and absolutely mesmerizing.So far I'm loving this game. MMOs like this are a real treat -- not a game, but a world to explore and interact with, much like Mabinogi and Guild Wars 2. At this rate, The Secret World may become my new favourite MMO. Its overall style and design is right up my alley.			"

												I can dress like Indiana Jones and whip the f*** out of things. 10/10.       In all seriousness, this is hands down the best MMO I've ever played, and ironically it doesn't feel like one. I've poured every hour I have into this game alone, without friends. It feels like a singleplayer game of massive proportions, with elements of multiplayer. The great thing about the game is that you can play in a variety of ways. Want to solo the entire main game? (Which I did) You can. Want to play through with a group of friends? You can.  The game isn't like any other MMO, your quests don't consist of ""track this enemy, kill 10 of these and then collect  these etc"". You solve actual, real problems in quests called ""Investigation Missions"". The game comes with a built-in web browesr for a reason! The game WILL make you think long and hard, as well as outside of the box. (One mission has you learn morse code!) It's an absolute blast and I can't imagine how much more fun (and easier) it would be to solve missions and hunt down clues with friends. However, there are also your typical combat-based missions as well. The game also covers a vast array of themes and atmospheres- you can go from fighting a zombie outbreak to trekking through a scorching desert. If you're a lore-aholic then you'll be in heaven, the game rewards players for having a watchful eye and putting two and two together. There are also many cultural allusions in the game, too many to count- Although a memorable one is a mission chain in issue 6 that's obviously inspired by Indiana Jones (No joke, you can get the outfit and whip, which is pretty useful!). Graphics wise this is a really good looking game, better than most if not all other MMOS- however I do play at 1440p with max settings. Some areas may look a bit worse than others, but the game holds up fantastic. I reccomend to use DX11 with this game, because there are some truly clever uses of it.     Some people complain about the combat, and I didn't like it at first either- However, once I learned the fundamentals and played for a bit, I find it VERY enjoyable. There's a plethora of different weapons and abilities you can assign to your characters, perhaps the most I've seen in an MMO. There are dungeons and raids as well of course, but if you don't have friends (cough cough) it can be hard to find groups and complete them. This is a shame, because the few instances where I do find a group, it's such a blast to fight through the dungeons. The community is fairly small! I've been playing TSW for almost two years now, and always find myself coming back. The game does recieve updates and new content, however once you complete the main game you'll have to buy what's called ""Issues"" to further the story, which is basically end-game content. All in all, even if you don't like MMOS, I STRONGLY suggest you give this game a shot! TLDR; If your're looking for a good looking game to sustain your attention for a long time, and enjoy solving mysteries in a world that's oozing with lore- give this game a shot. It doesn't feel like a typical MMO!			"

												This game has an Engaging storytelling that is unique to any MMO I have played with cinematic cutscenes for every main  story mission. The mystical, creepy, and even frightening enviornments keep things fresh, Each quest although there are some cookie cutter MMO quest layouts. The overall questing does not feel grindy each quest moves you foward to the next zone and ready to explore something the real thing that stands out from this game are the Investigation quest which force you to use your gray matter and think outside the box to solve AR riddles and puzzles. Combat is basic and is not mindblowing, but its fairly enjoyable. The player customization is fantastic it can feel like a cash grab somtimes, but its completely optional since all clothing is just for a cosmetic purpose.  Community is realy friendly and willing to help you out with many question especially if you join sanctuary chat room. Overall this feels like its own new brand of MMO. I would Definitely recommended.			"

												*this review was written for the original game The Secret World, changes made for SW: Legends changed none of the aspects mentioned*Let me just start by saying that this is by far the best MMO I have ever played and that this game completely destroyed my life - if you have anything important to do, like a deadline coming up, don't get into it. Now, on to the pros and cons. Pros: + Good graphics for an MMO + Extremely immersive, it's got a great story.+ Great voiceovers. + Well scripted, fully animated and detailed cutscenes for every mission (instead of just text and/or NPC voice that you normally see in online games). + TONS of content. + Your faction choice does not impact gameplay, you're not forced to choose a class and there are 500+ abilities to choose from, plus countless augments and effects, making characters really unique and flexible. You can do whatever you want, however you want, with whatever you want. + Very enjoyable multiplayer, the community isn't very large, but everyone is extremely polite, mature, respectful and helpful. No-one is going to call you a noob or any other name if you mess up, and no-one is going to make kitchen-jokes if you play as a female character. I promise you. If you let people know you're new or having difficulties with something, you'll find that a lot of players are willing to give you the equipment they have extra and they don't need, help you set up your build, give you tips or just come and save your♥♥♥♥♥ + Missions are repeatable (with the exception of faction-leveling and some story missons). + Grouping makes the mission is truly a collective effort, meaning that not every single player in the group has to go through the tasks (compared to some MMOs where it feels like playing single player game a few feet away from eachother).  You still have to stay close together in order for completing the tasks to count for everyone. + Extensive DLC once you've finished the main game, and they're totally worth it. + Amazing investigative quests and puzzles that really make you think and depend on your overall knowledge or make you do actual reasearch online. + Tying in with the last +, the game has an in-game browser, so if you get stuck, you have a bug or you want to google for dungeon strategies, you can do it in-game. Cons: - The ""fast travel"" system Agartha is very inconvenient. - Many instances in the story mission are solo instances for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason. Most of the content is playable in co-op (and is much more enjoyable that way), but there is no reason non-faction-specific missions should be solo player.  And yet they are. - In-game items, boosts and modifications are ridiculously expensive to buy with respect to the money you earn doing missions. - Due to the fact that there aren't many players, you might find it can take quite a while to find a group for a dungeon run. It's even worse for lairs, given that you usually need over 5 players to do a lair run succesfully and it's very hard to get people of the appropriate QL together to do them. Unless you're hosting a wicked TSW party at your place. - The game makes you dependent on itself, so expect to spend money on DLC. You'll try to fight it. You'll cry. But you'll also feel like you need it. Meh: +- Combat system is a little weird at first. However, once you get used to it, it's not bad, I've seen a lot worse. +- I'll stick to my point about the investigation missions being amazingly thought-out, however I do find that a lot of them are not completable without the help of a walkthrough. It's cool that they think of detail and challenge, but ask yourself this - how good is your Romanian? Knowledge of Egyptian mythology and American literature? Can you correctly find the Hebrew equivalent of an Arabic word? How are you with Morse and binary codes? What about hexadecimals? Good? Congratulations, you will be able to complete the challenges with your own head. Otherwise...It's still a great challenge to correctly identify the clues and do research. All 'n' all 11/10 would spend hours of my life on this game.			"

												These are all Reviews for a A Secret World ..NOT .. Secret World Legends which will be an all new server with fresh brand new characters and many many changes. Leaving the old reviews is extremely misleading since THIS game has not even been released and the Old version will still be playable. These reviews need to be deleted entirely since TSW will no longer be supported by Steam.  NOT THE SAME GAME			"

												Others have posted highly detailed (and rather excellent) reviews of this great game, so I'll simply offer this anecdote instead:I was surrounded by a horde of monsters, with my health draining rapidly and my end looming closer.  Any hope of survival was fading alongside my depleting health, when out of the blue, some random dude in tighty whities and a lurid green octupus on his head came running through, blades slicing through layer upon layer of foul rotting flesh with frenzied delight.  And as quickly as he appeared, he was gone, leaving naught but a carnage of corpses in his wake.Ergo, I post this review simply to say ""10/10, and a huge thank you to the dude in tighty whities"".

												IntroductionI purchased The Secret World (TSW) in 2012 when it went buy-to-play, and have been extremely impressed by it ever since. This is a game I strongly encourage you to play!Disclosures/About MeI've been an RPG fan ever since around 1994, when I received my first Final Fantasy game on the SNES (followed by Chrono Trigger). I've been interested in MMOs primarily for their story and gameplay components. I have a lifetime subscription to LOTRO and was active on there for 5 years. I've played bunches of other MMOS, as well. Of all of them I've played, I can say that this is the one worth getting behind.ValueFrom a value perspective, this is a great buy. The actual games comes with tons and tons of content-- I'm ~109 hours in as of writing this review and haven't even gotten to the content not covered in the base game. The item market sells cosmetics (which you can also easily get in-game) and sell story content. This is great! As consumers, we're not being bombarded to buy meaningless junk (a la Neverwinter and, eventually, LOTRO). If there's content restrictions from the item store, it's on actual story content, and it's well worth the purchase. The developers are rewarded for creating great story content (not system unlocks or gameplay advantages), and us consumers reap the benefit.GameplayTSW is a nice blend of traditional MMORPGss and newer, AMMORPGS (action MMORPGs). There's dodging, but it's very straightforward and doesn't require ridiculous motor skills. The ability to play with crosshairs is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fluid and fast, and is very hard. This is a challenging game-- you won't get bored, but you also won't get frustrated.SystemsThere aren't many systems, but the ones that are there are great. Think of your skills like cards in Magic: The Gathering. You want to build a ""deck"" that is as powerful as possible. There is no respect cost, and a single character can unlock every skill in the game (no classes, although you will probably end up playing the ""pseudo-class"" you want based on the skills you like). More like the Elder Scrolls than any other MMO I've played. Plus, each skill (there are 588, according to a source online!) can be ""augmented"" to change its effects. We're talking a ridiculous amount of customization, optimization, and progression. It's awesome. :-)Warning, though: the amount of depth and intricacy in the systems means it will take a long, LONG time to learn. That's okay. I'm still learning things, myself. You can't permanently mess yourself up, though (since you can unlock everything on a single character), and learning while you go is a part of the idea of the Secret World!StoryThis is not a game that you should play for the main story, although it is good. Rather, the stories of the world are amazing, from Stephen King-- sorry, ""Sam Krieg"" to HP Lovecraft-- sorry again, ""Hayden Montag"". This is a living, breathing universe, and the sidequests are really the main attraction. If you're looking to power through, skip this game. If you want to be a part of something awesome and really dig into the implications, with full voice acting and lots of strings to connect, this is a great game!GroupingI have no idea. Sorry. I'm playing this like a single player RPG, and it's a great game for it. No need to group at all, from my ~109 hours in. I do not know if there is much group content, and if it is good.Closing thoughtsIf you're looking for an excellent RPG to invest your time in, carve out your niche, and experience a great story, this is where you should be. Highly recommended!			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying, that I hate questing.  I enjoy mindlessly zerging dungeon content.I spent 40 hours QUESTING in the FIRST zone with 2 different characters, because I wanted to try a different build...story is AMAZING.  I can't wait to see what endgame content is like, but even if it sucks, the several hundred hours i'll spend playing through the other story content by myself is worth it.			"

												This is for the original The Secret World, not Secret World Legends. As of April 19, 2017, I have not yet played Secret World Legends, but based on the original game, the published information about the new game, and the company that owns The Secret World, Funcom, it is highly likely this review will still be accurate, for me. If you do not want to hear about the special experience of another player then skip this review. I'm saying that because, personally, I prefer to have my own immersion and discoveries. It's important, to me, to play the game the way the designers meant it to be played, ergo it isn't fun for me to hear about solutions to the quests or how cool some event happened before I see the event myself.SELF CENTERED REVIEW FOLLOWS:I've never seen such a game, even a single-play game. The quests are unique and roughly fall into the catagories: combat; stealth; puzzle. I find that I thinking about the game while I'm doing something else and the puzzles are frequently the last thing I think about before falling asleep.Attention to detail is high everywhere. One thing you'll notice early on is the lack of duplicate scenery. For example, duplicate trees or buildings or rocks or fences or boats are unlikely.I'll add some things about dialog later.It's bewildering to me that this game even exists. The design team should publish a paper on their creative-side business management tactics.Recommended.			"

												I've played WoW i've played Guild Wars I've played a-lot of MMO's and None of them have sufficed. I'd even say I thought I hated MMO's as a whole and would never buy another.Then this game sneaks into my life out of nowhere. First time I play it i sink 2 hours into it never touch it again until 2 weeks ago.  2 weeks ago I start streaming this game on twitch and I fall in love with it. i meet new people playing it. i discover I enjoy doing all the quests. I love the spookyness to it. This is one of the best MMO's i've ever played. -pros Great communityExtensive combatspooky atmosphere perfect for halloweengreat clothing options and unlockable gear through just playing the game.Great Dungeonsreferences real life things like left for dead, google, 80's pop music etc.Great Halloween Events.Has unlockable items you can get by playing their other games.lots to do. atleast 100+ hours of gameplay in standard edition though I recommend you get the ultimate edition.Top notch voice acting Decent graphics-consEnemies can be really OP and you'll be forced to take them on 1 at a time to avoid being killed or have a high level player help you.can be a bit overwhelming at first.Confusing puzzles that require you to research vague clues to solve (how ever this is really fun if you like that stuff)In Conclusion The Secret World Is Fantastic for those who hate MMOs or just don't think they'd enjoy them.

												If you're even remotely interested in getting this game for the story, do it. Any interest in Lovecraft, spooky things in general, the what-ifs of the world? Grab it for 70% off RIGHT NOW.  It is an mmo, and the combat can be a turn off at times, but the story is way too good to ignore for such a price. P.S. Roll Illuminauti as your first character, no regrets. I promise.			"

												Finally an adult MMO that I can enjoy. Nothing is spoonfed to you as TSW constantly requires you to think. There are tidbits of puzzles and many of the tedious quests can be challenging as you will need to find clues/hints to progress (which are not indicated with highlighted items). Some of the mobs are challenging too as they have a specific pattern you have to adapt to (think boss fights in those oldschool Asian fighting games).Some quests even require you to Google answers to puzzles. The lore is a bit jumbled up as everything is mashed up together. You'll get zombies, mages, secret societies, guns and swords in the same game. There aren't necessarily any Sci-Fi lore in the game though (ie. no aliens/technology).The community is still bustling after a couple years which is a great sign. I had expected this game to be dead but it's far from it. I'm sure it'll keep going for at least a decade.I rate this game a solid 8/10. It's extremely enjoyable and refreshing but there are some bugs/kinks that need to be worked out. Some better aesthetic options would be nice (like being able to modify what my facial structure looks like).			"

												Playing this game for quite a while now. Must say, I love this game. I always keep coming back to this game.There are three factions. Though the story stays the same and the results won't really change, it's fun to see the story from a different faction's perspective. The story is amazing, it's very emersive and engaging. It's uses real myths and urban legends to fuel the story. It's good, play it.If you like bees and want to feel special, go play it.If you like to get dirty and love filth, go play it.If you like Ankh, clothing, werewolves, evil Tony Stark Tech, bad people, vampires, classless progression, cool story arcs, interesting plot twist or maybe bees? Go play this game.If none of the above appeal to you, go play this game. It's still good.Pro's:- Amazing storytelling- Myths and urban legends- Classless system (515 abilities)- Be what you need to be at any place and any time- Make amazing roles (Need to tank?? go dpstank, leechtank, mitigation tank, bufftank or healtank)- Clothing is not based on gear- Bees- Giant birds that try to kill you- Everything else also tries to kill youCon's:- Endgame can get boring if you don't play with friends- Sometimes a little grindy- No Tilty or Bob boss- Not enough beesAnyway, go play it.

												Let me be straight i have many hours in almost all popular, semi-popular MMORPGs out there.All them published since 1999 as well as many RPGs.The Secret World is...Its one of a kind.It's a hidden gem.So whats a MMORPG? Its generally and basically large maps with RPG elements where many people play cooperatively (well..most of them and many of them )For me,The Secret World is an awesome single player RPG.Its a precious adventure game. So beautiful that many quests and missions can beat the very best RPG games or adventure games out there.Its a very well done cooperative game and a very tactical one.Its a beautiful massively multiplayer online game with many genres combined.Play as you like.Its a game where you dont have to grind many meaningless hours and be effective.Its both a cup of coffee and a big feast that you can enjoy with others.Its....the RPG game for me.And it should be for you too.P . S : The combat is something you should get used to and love. Can feel clunky at first but beats many tab-targeted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t out there.The price/performance ratio is so epic that you feel the comfort and content feeling when you get it on sales.AND! dont let yourself sink into walkthroughs online.It's at its best if you make yourself solve all the puzzles and missions.

												Easily the Best Questing and Lore of any MMO to date, all of it is extremely well written and thought out. Dungeons are well done; and character customization is fairly extensive and unique.The only Major Complaint I ever had with the game is that when you reach the post-updates end-game you slam into an extra wall of grind that is very tedious.This game is still worth it's price twice over to just to play through the quests and see the Lore; it really puts into perspective what an MMO can be when the developers actually put the time in on the small details.

												The Secret World features some of the most interesting and immersive missions as compared to any other MMORPG. The missions are fully narrated and unique, so you won't get bored reading blocks of text and completing repetitive tasks like in your typical MMORPG. Combat could use improvement, however.Another plus, you don't have to pay a monthly fee to play, and you can purchase additional issues if you want to progress in the storyline further.			"

												First off, I'm giving this game a thumbs down because I am unable to give it a thumbs sideways.  I'm really torn on the game as there are elements that I love and elements that I loathe with a passion.  However, the negative elements are so mind numbingly bad that I cannot reccomend the game.Let's start off with the good.  The setting:  The Secret World takes place in the contemporary real world, except all the crackpot conspiracy theory crackpot secret society stuff actually exists.  Add to that a generous helping of Cthulhu Mythos, and you have a wonderful, interesting setting that's a very welcome break from the awfully worn out standard Tolkien-esque fantasy setting.  The Secret World also features terrific writing and great voice acting, on par with, or even exceeding, many single player games, never mind just MMOs.  It;s all rally interesting and really well done.Also, while the game has its share of standard FedEx and Kill X monsters quests, at least they are dressed up quite well with interesting backstory and delivery.  Plus the game features some cool investigation missions where you are not guided by map markers clobbering you in the face or the game holing your hand and walking you through the steps.  Instead you need to do research, reading lore, looking up figures, checking history of places, and figure out what to do and where to go on your own. (Figuring stuff out on your own, imagine that!)So this all sounds great and it could, and should, be a fantastic game, right?  Well then how come I gave it a thumbs down, then?  Sadly this game features some of the worst mechanics I have ever encountered in my some 30 years of gaming.  I am searching for a word to adequately express just how bad the mechanics are...  I guess ""atrocious"" is the best I can come up with, but I'm not sure it;s strong enough.  I cannot wrap my head around how a game was possibly made with mechanics this awful and how it made it past playtesting.  I can only guess that the person who designed the mechanics had severe brain damage and that Funcom has no playtesting whatsoever.  The combat is awful and boring, and is further marred by controls so poor and unintuitive that it makes combat maneuvering an exercise in frustration.  With enough practice you can sort of get the hang of the controls, but they will never be good or even adequate with any amount of practice.  They are just that abysmal.It's a testament to how great the writing and setting is that I continue to play this game.  The story and writing keep me going.  I cannot reccomend the game, however, with a clear conscience, because the mechanics are just so unbelievably bad.			"

												I don't play mmos, like at all. I usually start playing a traditional mmo and get boredd after 3-5 hours of completely irrelevant unconnected playtime padding ""kill 50 chickens, now do it again!"" type quests. Most other mmos also seem to have a very linear character progression system where you essentially dump time from your life to get the exact same healer/tank/rogue/etc. as everyone else who dumped all that time into the game got. TSW is different, it has 6 different quest types: combat quests are the most similar to a traditional mmo, where you are usually tasked with for example killing x amount of zombies to make life easier for survivors. Sabotage quests are stealth/infiltration type gameplay and they can get very difficult but are very rewarding and fun. Side quests are usually environment not npc driven and can have elements of any other quest mentioned here. Investigation missions are hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥and especially in the first zone there is no shame in googling for help. Story missions that are a great narrative experience and have elements of all the other mission types. And dungeon missions of course that need 5 players and are pretty fun. The actual mission to mission gameplay is very solid and provides excellent background for one of the best narratives and worlds in any GAME i've played in a long while. There are no classes in this game, and gear and your currently selected skills/abilities will dictate your play style and they can be swapped out and experimented with in a moment. Any character can unlock and use any weapon/magic/melee in the game. The game does show its age at times, but the graphics for the most part do the job, the gameplay is also pretty good for an mmo in my opinion, and the story takes the cake, overall it is a solid 9.5/10 and I highly recommend trying it because I think that this is the most underated mmo of all time =)			"

												I'm not much of a fan of MMO's, while I like the co-op aspect, I find they tend to be too much grind, and not enough story. The Secret World is something else though. The setting is unique and intriguing, full of mystery. Main quests have fantastic cut scenes which bring the world to life. My favourite type of quests are the puzzle quests. They can be difficult to solve and frustrating at times but you get such a sense of achievement when you figure them out. I love that you have to actually investigate, looking up bible quotes, mythology, morse code etc.  "

However, the atmosphere of this game is impeccable. The setting, the ambience and music make it all feel creepy and compelling. At times it reminds me of Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.The puzzles are also incredibly interesting, often making you look up bible passages, or classical composers.Great game with a load of content.

												I give TSW an overwhelmingly positive 5 outta 5The community is fantatsic. The support is wonderful. The payment modle is fantatsic.I like this game because there are no traditional levels and no classes. You are free to focus on building the character you enjoy. You pick two weapons to use out of 9 total and your 8 active skills revolve around those weapons. You also get to pick 8 passives. Later in the game you get access to a support weapon, of which there are 4, that has its own passive and active skill. And there are dozens of skills for each weapon type. Putting a build together like this is fun and makes you really think about how everything works together. The great thing is you can have dozens of builds all with different weapons and skills. Even different gear.To be able to swap out your build as you need to is a HUGE awesome feature. Go from a dedicated tank to a support buffer in seconds. That's cool.There's 2 sides to this game... one is combat and the other is missions. On the combat side there is normal PvE grinding (which I find VERY statisfying for some reason), as well as nightmare areas that have stupidly powerful enemies you should get in a good group for. There are also dungeons which are group instanced raids of various difficulty.Missions are a bit more complex. Sure there are some 'go kill things' or 'run to X and get Z' but they are done with intresting bachground. The Secret World is telling you a story in every mission you do. You get to an area and have no idea what's going on. By talking to people, doing missions, exploring the area, actually obersving the monsters behaviors, and things like this... well it all offers you a small piece to what is going on, how it came to happen, and maybe even what happened to lead up to this. But it never fills in all the gaps. And it never comes out to tell you this stuff. You as a player need to connect the dots and really pay attention.This same theme is how the famous investigation missions are. They are like riddles or mysteries you have to figure out by doing lots of crazy things: researching a biblical theologian's works; logging into fake websites (which are suposed to be real in game); using goggle to do actual real research... its insane! And so staisfying!!! Presently I am stuck on one of these missions now. Sometimes I put a 1/2 hour into mulling over it. Sometimes I go to the RP social meet-up spot and actually role-play trying to do work on it... showing people my notes and sharing my thoughts asking for loose tips. Sometimes I take my research ideas online and surf real life counterparts to get more understanding about what the mission is about. Sure I could go to a cheat site but that would totally defeat the reason for the game! I can put the mission down and go kill things or do other more casual missions.The other thing I adore about TSW is the cosmetics. You don't have armor. You have stuff like talismens, rings, and charms which are not shown. So every item you see someone in is just a vanity style. The game has a lot of slots for items: head, face, neck, back, chest, legs, etc... so you can buy clothing items in game and mix/ match them up.TSW is a very hardcore game and not for everyone. I am the type to role-play, take my time with things, and really enjoy a story. This lets me do that beyond my wildest expectations.Sure its not perfect and I would love to see certain things added, such as player owned apartments, but its amazing as it is. If my review made you wanna try this game please friend me and I'll give you a free 3-day trial. Of course I get a little perk if you do this and buy the game, which I would appricate. I'd be glad to play with you and help teach you the basics too.I liked this game so much I spent $200 on it to become a grandmaster (lifetime membership).... but please don't be confused! The game is buy to own. There's an optional membership thingie you can get to give you special perks. If you buy the game you never have to spend money on it ever again unless you want dlc. But dude you kvae no idea just how much content is included in the basic $30 game, let alone the $60 massive edition.This is one of my fav all time games!!! I don't play it constantly because a lot of it is very brain racking and hardcore.			"

												A beautiful MMORPG.This game is as beautiful as it looks on pictures, but only having beautiful look doesn't make the game perfect, The Worlds are beautifully designed and they look stunning. Like every MMORPG, this one is also filled with items that are look nothing like each other. (I loved how you can use gun and melee together).The best thing about this game is that ""IMO"" it doesn't feel like other MMORPGs like WoW or SWTOR. It feels more like Dragon Age MMO, because unlike other MMOs, this one is story driven, an amazing story that will make you want to keep playing.The only downside of this game is that it got many classic MMORPG elements, which is obvious, but  because of that I believe only or mostly MMORPG fans would enjoy this game for long... non-MMORPG players should aware of the repetitive missions (in solo).9/10 ""Strongly recommended for hardcore MMORPG fans""			"

												Ever since the succes of World Of Warcraft every game in the MMO genre has tried to copy it's fantasy style.The Secret World is the original thing the genre needed.To put it simple,If you are a fan of games like Bloodbore, Resident Evil and Devil May Cry... if you like movies like Van Helsing and Underworld...Or you like TV shows like SupernaturalThis game is the MMO for you. It mixes the supernatural genre with light horror and really draws the player in.The gaphics are simple but pretty.When you fight it actually feels like you are the one doing the fighting, and not just commanding it.The game give you these open area's where you can ignore your main questline and explore and go sidequesting.And clothes you wear don't affect stats. So you can fully decide how you look.Only negative I can think of is that there is no above character chat text. Making you have to check the chatwindow a lot.			"

The ""Leveling"" system is interesting, allowing every character the ability to acheive every role in time.There is no ""Pay to win"" play is free after after initial purchase, with option to subscribe. However, subsribing does not give you ""pay to win"" features or OP items.The cosmetic variety is increadible, rarely do you see two people who look the same.All said and done... this game rocks, dont miss out on it!!!

												From the outset after your initiation, you're chucked into the worst map in the game, no matter which faction you choose. Well I say worst because the rest of them are amazing, and Kingsmouth (or whatever it's called) isn't a friendly place, but once you know what you are doing, and that is 'the missions' you'll start to get the hang of how the game works. I struggled hard to push myself and my coop partner into liking this game at that stage. We did a lot of talking and kept turning down missions because they were all ranked as too hard (which they were not). At the time, pre-steam nearly 2 years ago, it was bugged too, zombies popped up next to you whereever you were, like in the middle of a conversation. But getting through the first map, is what it's all about, specialise in one or two skills (preferably from your faction deck), and you'll never regret it, just think of it as an initiation, like having to sleep covered in toothpaste with your new phrat krew. Gameplay, story, immersion, skill... Soon you'll be lording it up.This is the best story driven MMO out there. Hands down.I just bought it again, so I have it on my steam account. That's how good it is, and now it has so much more content, and scenarios etc... Don't think twice about this one. Oh and the voice acting is amazing, you'll want to hear every line of dialogue, so don't forget to keep speaking to people until the white writing goes grey.And the Music? Dinna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna...Also, Wendigo Way, and the a'kabs (Which are basically Wendigo's in disguise!)BUY ! BUY ! BUY !			"

												I love this game, and I hate it even more because of that.The good:The idea is awesome. Secret societies battling secret evil in our modern world. The characters look cool and there is good customization. The locations are really cool and each quest is well written and interesting.Investigation missions are great.The neutral:The skill system is not that great. There is little help in finding a good build in game. There is little sense of progression.Crafting is mediocre at best.The bad:Stealth missions are really annoying.Combat animations are wooden and just look bad.Difficulty of monster varies wildly between push over and whoops, why am I dead?Balance between different skills is bad. Some are OP while other should just be avoided.The horrible:Mission design. This is an MMO. So I will play with a group. Why are there so many forces solo missions in this? It is incredibly annoying when you play together and frequently the game sends you into solo instances. You can't build a synergy team of characters since each one of them MUST be able to survive on their own. From a story point it makes even less sense - if our heroes have been working together on a case, why would they suddenly split up to tackle the big baddie at the end on their own?This is made even more aggravating by the fact that there are missions in the main story line that you MUST complete to progress to the next zone that are solo and incredibly hard. So if you can't complete them you can't get help from anyone, you can't outlevel them and come back and try when you are stronger, because you are stuck in the same old zone and can't progress. Basically you can try over and over again until you get lucky or it*s game over. I have no idea why any MMO dev would consider this design wise. Basically you're telling the player 'you suck, we don't want your money!'Yeah, I hate it, but I hate the game.			"

												Been playing this game for years, and will continue to play it.At first, it was hard to get into (about 4 years ago) when I had no idea what I was doing and no clue where to go - but with any MMO if you need a little help this community comes together in an excellent fashion.There are bugs, there are some things to be fixed; but you know what? The developers are actively listening and fixing things. This is the only community where I have seen one on one face time with Developers, GMs, Community Managers and more. It's one of the reasons why I still play this game, aside from the RP community.If you're thinking of buying this game but unsure? Why not catch it on a sale when it proffers the Complete edition for 70-70% off? Pay only 20$ where I, paid hundreds to get the content when it came out! (i.e. = Issues are about 10.00$ when they come out for standard issue. C.E.s are about 15.00$ ) Type of game where it has no classes, no levels (only ranks - up to 13), where you will eventually unlock everything and will be able to do anything your heart desires. And of course the storyline is superior to boot. I've never been so invested in wanting to see a new expansion but man everytime it does it's better than the last - in my opinion.TL;DR - Maybe not a game for everyone, but it's a damn good game.It's not your typical MMO.It's the Secret World.

												This happens to be the only mmo I’ve played where I’m not screaming into a pillow while I mindlessly grind terribly boring quests (yes, better than SWTOR), in fact I love questing in this game. You’ll want to take your time leveling up and exploring areas, the game actually encourages this by limiting how many missions you can do at one time; one main mission and three side missions. If you’re a chronic min-maxer and feel you  must  race through the leveling as if your life depends on it, there’s nothing stopping you I suppose but you’re missing out on what TSW does best and that’s story, lore and unique characters. As a returning player who hasn’t played endgame content from issue 12, I can’t comment too much on it. Despising the aegis system myself, I might be a little biased since all content from issue 9 uses it. Community is small but great. While questing you probably won't run into a lot of people, bonus in my books really.TL;DR: If you want an incredibly immersive experience filled with lore and fantastic stories then try this game.Edit: Looking at their steam store page, you'll see they've only listed the collectors edition for some issues which are priced around $30 (cheeky). The standard version of Issues can be bought through the TSW store for roughly $10 (1200 funcom points), so fear not, it's not as insanely expensive as it looks.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original game, ""The Secret World"" and have over 350 hours of gametime logged despite only joining the community in the last year or so.  The changes implemented in the beta for Secret World Legends are attrocious.  The core gameplay has been gutted and simplified, and all at the expense of the devout fanbase that has continually bought content for the last year with a promise of future story material which turned out to be a blatant lie on the part of the developers.  Instead of creating new content as a reward for the most recent grindfest updates at end-game, they have decided to relaunch and have all of that previous grind lead to absolutely nothing.  This would have at least been just moderately disappointing if they had not taken away the entire skill system that made the game worth playing, and instead replaced it with garbage.  I will never give Funcom another cent of my money after this.  Oh and if you are even thinking of buying this ""new and improved"" version of the game, just consider this.  This relaunch is being headed by the same person that launched the NGE for Star Wars Galaxies all those years ago (aka forever killed the game and is regarded as one of the worst MMO updates in history).  They are implementing the same crap decisions here, and it will end with the same result.  STAY. AWAY.			"

												The Secret World is basically two games that when mashed together create something incomplete and unpleasant.The story and writing are great, especially the writing. This is a game that if you take your time reading the quest fluff you'll be surprised. Okay, the story isn't THAT great afterall, but I think the setting really benefits the way things happen as you progress. Given the moment I got through the first ""world"" which took maybe 40 or so hours I felt great about it. The moment I went into the second ""world"" Egypt I felt things slipped almost immedately.This and the combat especially are where Secret World starts falling apart. For as much as you can solve quests with knowledge (or the internet) and figuring out what this Moorse Code is pointing you towards or what these crpytic clues mean, the combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's clunky and requires you to have up to date gear as well as skills that are inclined to the opposite of what you're doing. That is to say, the skill system is very large and freeform and it actively hinders you if you do not follow a guide. Trying to peacemeal skills you think you want makes things take longer and fights anywhere from teeth-scrapingly close to utterly impossible.These problems are exponential when trying to complete known ""faction"" quests where it expects you to have gear WELL beyond what you can conceivably have the moment they give them to you. It quite literally took me a week of off-and-on grinding to have the ""right"" skills and gear to even compete with the enemies I fought.When it hits it hits. When it misses you're sent straight up into space. Give it a try when it's cheap to experience the writing but don't expect a WoW killer when it comes to combat.			"

												I tried playing during beta, and at the time it just didn't hit the spot.  I'm not entirely sure why; much of it was the same, although not as polished, and less forgiving.  When the Ultimate Edition came out, with all the expansions, etc, at a discount, I figured this would be my second try.  I really have not been able to stop playing since I got it (except sleep and food, begrudgingly).  If you want a new MMO to be addicted to, this is absolutely it.  Pros: -Atmosphere (horror/arcane/Lovecraftian/gothic - whatever you want to call it) - it's genius-Combat - fast-paced, fluid, not tremendously punishing (although not a walk in the park either, which is nice).  a ton of variety-""level"" progression - it really is very flexible.  Do what you want.  -gear and aesthetics are completely separate.  I love that I can change clothes like I do in real life without affecting my ability to cast blood spray at zombies.  Fickle and vain.  <3-Story / Characters - this stuff is very well developed.  In some ways it may have worked better as a single player game, but there have been a lot of times where another person has come along to save my Dragon hide, and it was great.  -A LOT of variety in quests.  Obviously a lot of killing and a small amount of collecting.  BUT, the investigation and stealth missions really take it up a notch compared to most MMOs I've played.  You will almost certainly need to go online to solve stuff! (built in browser).  There's also creative use of crafting during quests.  Cons: TBD.  JK - I do have some cons.  My biggest thing is really just my general dislike of MMO enemies and story progression.  The constant respawning when you least expect it, the ""grinding"" if you have to backtrack through an area, the lack of change in an environment, even when you complete major quests.  These are not even remotely unique to TSW, but to me they are major detractors.  Remember that time you reinstalled a huge set of wards and destroyed the source of enemies in zone, progressing the plot and saving the entire institute?  No?  You can't tell because there are just as many enemies and none of the wards work after 2 minutes.  MMOs.  Womp.  Leaving MMO-general issues aside, I love this game.  I really highly recommend it if you think the atmosphere/story sound even remotely cool to you.  You (hopefully) won't be disappointed.			"

												This game is just slightly different than any other MMORPG. It's nothing unusual from FunCom. They try to do different game mechanics for every title. And here it is. I love the idea of TSW (modern day, conspiracy, rising darkness,...). When I played it first time (in beta) I was excited. I just said ""I have to have it"". At first game had lot of bugs, but I think that is already ok. What impress me really much, was choice of weapons. You can choose between magic focus (blood, elementalism, chaos), melee weapons (hammer, sword, fists) or ranged weapons (pistols, shotgun, assault rifle).Dark days are coming. Three powerful organizations have to join forces againts rising darkness. People with special gen awake their hidden powers. They have to choose for who they will fight.What will be your choice? Templars? Illuminati? or Dragon?Advantages:+ No levels, no classes, no limitations (you can switch everything in one moment);+ graphics (visually amazing);+ impressive storyline;+ every character has it's own voice and every mission, which you get from them, has cinematic;+ puzzle solving missions;+ inspired by H. P. Lovecraft.Disadvantages:- Low number of players (when you want to go in dungeon, you have to wait longer time);- DLCs (but I understand, that maintenance need money).			"

The game is quite unique in terms of character progression and all stuff like crafting and tallent system with mote than 500 active/passive tallent points available to learn.

												First of all, it takes time to get use to this game because it's very different than the other mmorpgs at the moment.The Secret World is set in a modern-day real world under attack from occult forces.The story inspires a lot from H. P. Lovecraft's works, the Indiana Jones franchise, and Stephen King's novels, and the player's character joins one of three world-controlling secret societies which are the real life myths;  Templars, Illuminati, or Dragon. Like many other MMORPGs combat is move based.The character is totaly free to redevelop their abilities on the go because there is no class system,you can use every weapon, every skill on the game just by learning those skills from the abilities screen.And to gain that ability points you just need to play the game thats all! ; killing mobs,doing mission,dungeons,pvp everything gives you ability points to purchase skills.Therefore, a player can be a tank, a healer and a dps at the same time just by changing his skills on the action bar. You can only use 7 active skills.			"

												Unbelievable game. I've played RPGs all my life and I've never had as much fun as I have with this game. There's a huge amount of content, the areas are deep and interesting, and every NPC has a lovable quirk that makes interacting with them memorable. I can't stress enough how detailed the world is and how critically that supports the gameplay! Also of note, I've found the art to be a lot less sexist than in other games; rather than chainmail bikinis and hulking dudes in tinsuits, the avatars are a lot more realistic and understated.Outside of the artistic aspects, it plays similarly to any MMO that you're used to. The skill bars are short (something I prefer). Interestingly, only 7 of your skills are active, and 7 are passive skills that are hidden during normal play. I'm just beginning to understand how deep the level of character customization can be.A very unique feature is the investigation quest, of which there are many. These quests give very little information at the outset and ask you to solve a puzzle, follow a trail, dig up some old mystery, etc. They are very challenging, and each time I play a new one I'm surprised again at the ingenuity of the game developers.This is an absolute STEAL at $30. I have only two problems: first-time startup was rickety and required some setup tricks on my part, but that took about 20 min to fix. Second, the game world is low on players, so you'll spend most of your time questing alone if you don't play with a friend.			"

No other M.M.O. has such an engaging storyline. There's a reason that S.W. is still going strong. The only negative that I can think of is that it's only available for P.C..

												Please be aware that the reviews as of March 29, 2017 that are being posted on The Secret World: Legends are actually for The Secret World which is a separate game no longer available for purchase because Funcom is halting development of The Secret World to rededicate all development resources to the relaunch of The Secret World brand as The Secret World: Legends.With that in mind, I obviously can't provide feedback for a game that isn't even in closed beta yet.  What I can say is that the relauched version appears to carry over the lore and story line of the old The Secret World and that I would rate that lore and story line as excellent.  So take this recommendation with a grain of salt as that is all it is based on.  The game play, mechanics and quality could end up being exceptional or awful or anywhere in between once this is released as an open beta or full release.			"

But I can give a resounding Not Recommended to the misleading practice (hopefully accidental) of  attributing hundreds of well deserved  positive  reviews for one game to another game not even released.Archive the old game's reviews, give people a chance to see and assess the new game, and THEN we can start seeing trends, but not before.Please, no 'Fake Reviews'! We need to be able to trust someone after all - let it be Steam :)			"

												Out of the reviews I read, nearly all of them were short recommendations. To sum up the reviews I read from people ranging from 20-700 hours game time is ""its good. wow sucks. TSW is free. GG.""I would very much like to disagree to the popular trend of recommending this game. I have played 800+ Hours of this game. At first I was extrememly satisfied and excited to be playing. I LOVED IT! Then I just stopped loving it. I noticed quickly that if you are not playing with friends, you will likely not be playing with somebody other than yourself. The community seems so tight knit to the point of toxicity. If you do not know exactly what you are doing on your class/abilities/build you will be sorely paying for it. PVP seems to be plagued with the 2-3 players than know EXACTLY what they are doing and in result... 1 shot everyone and everything in their way. Making it nearly impossible to have fun while still riding that learning curve. It also seems to me that the Dragon faction will rule Stonehenge and El Dorado (whatever they are called) and the illuminati will rule the Fushang Province (however it is spelled) Leaving the Templars to scrap together a rare victory on occasion.The bag system seems to fail med game due to an increasing amount of lootables/rewards making it a 1-2 hour ordeal to clean your bags and make them viable once more.The PVE dungeon system is a tad bit out-dated, Leaving an old school WoW feel. You either need to walk to the dungeon or be summoned there. There seems to be endless trash mobs inbetween bosses. The bosses feel like they are immensly stronger than they should be for the level you can enter the dungeon. In conclusion, as a F2P MMORPG I would say it is a good time waster if that is all you plan on doing. I would only recommend this game to someone who wishes to waste their time.... I would NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable experience that lasts till the end.P.S. If you don't like my review, don't read it again?  "

												This is probably the most immersive MMO I've ever played, and it's grabbed me like no other. The atmosphere and writing often remind me of Bloodlines. In a lot of ways, it's less like an MMO than a really great singleplayer RPG.Also: this game has a built-in web browser because you're going to need to do actual web research in order to solve some of its puzzles. That's super awesome.			"

												This is the game I keep coming back too. Been playing on and off since 2014. Its nice because the skill system lets you never build your character wrong. Don't like your current weapons? You can train in others.The missions and story lines are amazing. For once, I don't want to just skip through everything and rush to the combat.Even the missions are different. You have some missions that require actual research. Luckily they give you an in game web browser so you can look up translations or references. Player population may look low on steam, but that is because many users have a stand-alone version, or are using origin.If you like playing dress up, there are hundreds of costume pieces. I'm currently running around with a glowing unicorn head.There is a 10 day trial you can find on funcom's website. Try it out, you will be hooked.			"

												I need to play this more.Edit: I played it more.*Can't quite classify it as a normal MMORPG, It has the elements; but a better taste.*You get tons of skills and whatnot- But you are limited to two items and a handful of active and passive skills.*But you can change the presets whenever you want pretty much.*The best part of this game is it's storyline; Makes you think about that is real and what isn't, what matters in life most, and what does not. * It keeps a dark H.P lovecraft feel with a perfect balance of humor and seriousness.* Makes you realize americas government is filled with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-MAKE SURE- To read every report when you finish a quest or side mission, and watch every cutscene; It contains (hands down) the best storyline for a game of this genre.

												This is my POV after 9 hours. I realize there's a lot I haven't seen yet. Overall I like this game but boy does it it come with a lot of annoyances.Pros:- there is no better game with a conspiracy theory plot- there is no better game using Lovecraft- if the writing is taken as such, it is very solid and enjoyable- while there are plenty of games with a lot of 'cool', the 'cool' in this game is pretty enjoyable- a whole lot of content from what I can tellCons:- everything is 'cool', so nothing stands out- everything is a conspiracy, so nothing is mundane- everything is Lovecraft-ish horror, so nothing is really horrible- the missions are very linear- the UI is clunky and confusing- the combat is boring -- while there are a lot of options, they all feel the same- the character jumps like in a platformer- the puzzles of the game require a lot of attention (this could be a plus, just not my thing)- the graphics engine is appalling, I would expect much better FPS for this graphics quality- I had to install an injector just to get halfway decent antialiasing, and getting it to work was a painI give it a 7/10 despite the long list of cons. I have the Ultimate Edition with all DLC, which I bought for 18 EUR. As of now, I consider it money well spent.			"

												I'm on the fence about this one, because there really is a lot to like, but also flops where it counts. Overall this is worth a shot on sale (I got the ultimate edition 50% off, sale seems to happen regularly). The bonuses are all right but nothing to write home about, you get a selection of free starter weapons that you'll replace within a couple hours, a couple costumes, and some ability earning bonuses, but the real reason to get ultimate is so you don't have to buy the chapters (up to 11) separately later. I'm not there yet, though, no where close. This is a game where you can sink a lot of time and always have something to do. There are side quests galore, plenty of lore to read, and even if you're just trying to charge through the main quests, you're in for a pretty long haul. That said, it can be a bit overwhelming, sometimes repetitive, but in fairness, there's minimal grind, it's more of a journey. Go into this game with that mindset and you'll have a great time.Note that I'll be changing or adding to this as I sink more time into it.PROS:* Extremely diverse ability system that you can change up on the fly. It's worth noting that you just keep on getting AP, there is no respeccing because it's not necessarily needed. Also worth noting that many abilities/passives from trees of weapons you aren't actively using can still be equipped--it'll tell you if it requires the equipped weapon (or related skill). There's lots of cool synergy and theorycrafting you can do, one could spend a very long time just sitting there making builds.* The bulk of your experience gain comes more from completing quests, rather than grinding mobs. On one hand, some players may dislike this approach, but it strongly encourages you to engage in quests rather than mindlessly grind, and I'm okay with that model (though quests could have been executed better--more on that below).* The atmosphere is delightfully spooky. The music, graphics and sounds come together very well; you feel like you're the star in an episode of some supernatural show. On that note, some of the enemy designs are very heeby-jeeby inducing, making it all the more satisfying when you kill them.* Voice acting is on point, and there's a TON of it, some voices you may even recognize either from movies or other video games. Seriously, check out the IMDB for this game and look at the list, it's baffling how much talent they got. Notably, they even got horror film legend Jeffrey Combs for a couple voices (who you'll hear very early on if you side with the Illuminati).Now, sadly, here's where I have to rip on it. I say sadly, because these points are pretty major, and detract from what is otherwise an enjoyable entry to the genre.CONS:* Combat. This needs several bullet points to fully explain, because it's a lot of little things that add up:-- No auto-attack. You pick an ability that builds your resources and have to spam that. Feels kinda clunky. This is especially hindering in situations where, say, you catch a nasty lag spike or somehow disconnect, when fighting something so easy an auto-attack would finish it while you're d/cing--nope, you reconnect dead. Fortunately lag spikes and graphic stutters aren't TOO common (and of course can always be blamed on client-side issues), but they do happen.-- Lack of variety in animations. Abilities only have one animation, and most of them are shared with other similar abilities.-- Unsatisfying and awkward sound effects. Sometimes they're on point, but most of the time it just doesn't seem to match the action. In general combat just doesn't feel... tight, I guess would be the word. Things are happening, health bars are going down, but the action all seems disjointed.-- Final note: While the combat does have its issues, it mostly just takes some getting used to. Despite all the disjointedness and repetition, it can be entertaining.* Graphical stutters even with lowered settings and a decent rig, an issue which I'm seeing echoed in other reviews. Apart from being annoying, this can be lethal in many encounters, especially since you can't rely on an auto-attack to save you by the skin of your teeth. Strange thing is, these stutters will happen at the weirdest times, even when there's not much action on-screen. Fortunately there's not really any penalty for dying.* Player characters all look very similar, outfits and hairstyles aside. Couple that with the repetitive animations and you really disconnect from that sense of uniqueness. * Some quest triggers are confusing, and oftentimes you're able to do things before you're supposed to, requiring you to trigger them again somehow. This has yet to break anything for me, but has left me scratching my head on occasion.* Key items specific to quests take up inventory space, and sometimes there are a lot of them; frequent trips to banks and vendors are highly recommended. This wouldn't be so bad, if...* ... you could actually delete quests! That's right, there's no abandoning a quest once you've got it. All you can do is put it on pause to ""make room"" for another active quest/mission, but those key items for that mission? They're not goin' anywhere, forever sitting in your inventory, taunting you to complete that quest. What's worse, I've even picked up key items for quests I don't even have and don't know where to get, and you can't delete those items either.NEUTRAL:* Quests and missions are a mixed bag as far as entertaiment value. Cinematically, they're often fantastic; animations, script, voice acting, the works. Some of the dialog is so convoluted though that you'll be fiddling the ESC key to skip if the guy says anything else blatantly obvious. Gameplay-wise they can be sort of underwhelming. Most side-quests are simply ""go here and kill X mobs,"" with some random stuff mixed in, pretty standard fare for an MMORPG, but they're usually pretty well executed. This is where the grind comes creeping in though, since some kill-quests are rather lengthy, and on top of most mobs having a b*tch-load of health, can be tedious. Missions aren't much different but always have at least one gimmicky element to spice things up. Investigation quests can be fun, but frustrating, and will often lead to you simply looking up the answer online after scratching your head over them.* Speaking of which, I'm not sure how I feel about practically *requiring* players to look things up online for clues to the answers when they can just as easily look up... the answers themselves, but at least they provide an in-game browser. Still, it's a pretty ancillary feature, considering it's probably faster to just, y'know, use your out-of-game browser. It's not like we're not already on a computer with internet. Whatever.OVERALL:This game reminds me of a hodgepodge of some of the best (and worst) elements of other MMORPGs. It's like a mix of SW:ToR (another EA title), City of Heroes (now discontinued), Guild Wars (skill system) and, well... not sure what else. The puzzles and overall secrecy are very unique to this title--a title which the game strongly holds up to. Cinematic production is fantastic and worth it for that alone, but gets shadowed by the awkward, repetitive, and often very formulaic combat (i.e. you will always be doing the same skills in the same order with your build until things die, occasionally using a defensive move). But at the end of the day, this doesn't stray much from the tried-and-true MMORPG formula, so it's hard to complain; I might be a bit jaded from years of this stuff. Customization nuts will have a blast, and the atmosphere is executed brilliantly. So, overall, the good outweighs the bad, and it's worth giving a shot when it's on sale.			"

												This game is huge, a ton of hours worth of game play in just the first two areas. But you're also send requests to go to other places while you're playing depending upon your level, where you are and if you are playing solo or with others.Exploring turns up new quests, rare items and even more instances to check out. Customize your avatar to how you want to look, update your wardrobe by getting more clothes and accessories. Update your gear and try out different builds.The point system allows you to customize your avatar to do spells, damage or AoE damage, ranged or up close damage - you choose your style. Play your way, choose your path!This is a really cool game, love the replay ability and the vast wheel of choices to build on. Plus they've got some really cool perks too. Free offers and brand name items, like a Steam brand clothing, TSW brand clothing and all sorts of cool vehicles, weapon styles, accessories, non-combat pets and more.My only wish is that the pets were combat not eye candy. Would love to see my wolf go after some poor target. It's nice to have a furry companion who'll watch your six. lolDefinitely recommend this game, even got a few others hooked on it. Makes for lots more fun too. I would highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition due to all the special items included in it, but also because it has a lot of the content to play for a long time. Several dlc chapters are included in the UE so you won't have to look for them. Save some money and get it on sale! Excellent deal on how much you get for the price.			"

												Tl;dr at the bottomI've spent about 300ish hours in this game and I have to say it is one of the best MMO experiences I have ever had. I like the combat in this game and it was pretty easy to get used to...The only hard part was trying to figure out what skills work best with others and which passives you should equip to best compliment your build. If you're anything like me, this is very confusing but thankfully the community is nice enough to share builds that help in any stage of the game. Some of the builds work better in certain situations and you could possibly be switching builds depending on the fight ahead of you. I made it through most of the game without much help, as I am a bit hesitant to socialize with other players for fear of being classed as a noob. I just recently made it into Tokyo, however, and found out that none of my previous builds were working out for me. So I started experimenting with different builds that I found on the interwebs and still am having a hard time, especially with the boss-type enemies that have 2 different aegis shields...The Missions in this game are very engaging. From when you click the button to start the quest to the response you get from your faction leader after you finish it. The cinematics and voice-work are very nice and you miss out on a huge part of the game if you skip and don't read/watch them. Then there are investigation missions. Before you start this game, I would recommend you buy a notebook to take notes in as even the smallest bit of information in these mission-types is a potential clue. That is, if you want to solve them by yourself. If you need a bit of help with these, there are guides on the internet that can get you unstuck or if you just don't want to waste time, can get you through the entire mission. One of my favorite sites for this is Unfair.co (I believe is the address). This site actually explains, in detail, the steps they went through to solve the missions and what hints you should look for.Now onto the RP element. This is the most disappointing part of this game for me and it makes me really sad. I love this game and in many games that I love, I love to RP. They have a pretty big RP community with a website and everything to post events. I've gone to a few of these events, and have tried to involve myself in the group. With me being a very new player to these events, it is hard to find a place to fit in. I have walked up to random people that were RPing and led with a whisper asking if they wanted to RP, to which they would usually respond yes. We would then engage in the RP which would usually end up with me RPing by myself, getting 2 or 3 word responses from the other player. After a while, I noticed that the RP community is very closed off to newer people. People only seem to want to RP with people they know and it in turn leaves me standing by the bar, sipping on a drink and ♥♥♥♥ing around on my phone, hoping someone would come talk to me since me talking to them never seemed to work.Recently on Fridays, the developers have been doing streams on twitch, playing through the different issues and answering questions from the community. I went to the latest one, which they had giveaways going on to win either Funcom points or the new Franken Chopper. I actually won the Chopper and was so excited about it. I would love to see more of these events in the future of this game. It's always amazing to see the developers get in there and interact with the players and to see them play their own game.Tl;drI would recommend this game to every one of my friends. From the combat to the story-telling, this game is amazing. The community is usually very helpful and the developers and GMs are also quite helpful. I haven't done any PVP but I hope to change that in the near future, when I understand the mechanics a bit better.			"

												This is the MMORPG that gamers say they want. Deep story, total control over your character's appearance, interesting missions (quests), challenging, skill-based, etc.The only thing I have to say to newcomers is that you need to forget what the typical MMO has taught you about zone progression. TSW has you progress from area to area within a zone, extending the amount of time you spend in a place, and it really helps connect you to that part of the world. Each region is made up of 2-3 full zones, and each zone has 6-10 areas within it that you will progress through.Gamers have been complaining for years in other MMOs about throw-away zones that are forgettable. TSW addresses that, but the tradeoff is you're going to be spending more time in those zones.Now, let me save you the 5,000 word essay I could (and would) write on Investigation Missions. They're the single best thing I've ever seen in an MMO. It's like National Treasure and Da Vinci Code had Rosemary's Baby... and it's GLORIOUS.I can't believe a game this smart even got made.The dungeons are rich and story-driven, and look spectacular, no generic hallways filled with scaled versions of normal mobs. These are hand-crafted and very memorable. Raids/Nightmare mechanics give you a LOT to worry about, and will keep you on your toes. This is not Sinister Strike x3 > Eviscerate raiding here. The mechanics are not very forgiving, and if you screw up there's a good chance you'll just be a smear on the floor.TSW isn't afraid to remind you that while you have special abilities, you're not all-powerful :)11/10Note: Actual playtime is +200hrs or so, as I didn't initially own the game on Steam.

No dialogue all cutscenes, tons of different weapons, all quests optional , good dodge system, great graphics and performance.

												A pile of weird puzzles, intersecting storylines, and the folks running about the world trying desperately to keep or shove the genie back into the lamp. It not the greatest thing ever, but it's solid. Open character developement does leave the problem of how to advance, but it also gives you a fair bit of freedom to tool about with. The voice over quality pretty good, the little flourishes, refferences, and side stories all add to the feel of the world. It's a madcap little world, one I enjoy playing in.			"

												Most compelling MMO I've played, and it honestly might be the only I've played that has actually interesting quests. If you like the occult, metaphysics, or the X-Files, you will love this game. Also, Templars FTW.			"

												It has good moments, it has bad moments. But this game's over all mood is better than most MMOs. Not to mention finishing stories actually effects the areas you save. Also one of the VERY few horror MMOs that actually make you feel nervious as you never know for sure if you can walk away from a monster fight, despite having supernatural powers yourself.			"

												I recommend this game principally based on two things: the ability to role play and the environments.If you are a vetern of mmos then you know that possibly the most important thing in an mmo is the ability to make a character which is an avatar of yourself and to be able to get into that character and role play it. If you can't do that then you are simply grinding quests into oblivion. If you can do that then ""you"" are grinding quests into oblivion but you don't care because it is fun.Now there is a relationship between your character and what you kill. The mobs in The Secret World are reasonable. You won't see any bizzare Korean mythical hybrid-fairy mobs which you could never possibly give a damn about. Or I haven't seen any yet anyways. The first mob you encounter are locals turned to zombies.I regards to roleplaying your character the game has clothing shops in one of the major cities (London) where you can play Mr Dressup and rig out your wardrobe for which ever environment you currently questing in.The environments of the game are present day environments. e.g. the first you get into after your starter city is a small town in Maine and the surrounding back woods. Running around the backwoods of Maine with a sledge hammer and pistols is in my opinion fun.Those two things in mind you should be able to get your character to the end of the game and if you do then your hours spent playing vs. cost ratio should be pretty good.Concerning combat: combat is pretty basic. You get seven slots to put abilities in. You can equip two main weapons. The game uses a combo point builder system similar to a rogue in other games. You build to five points and use a finisher (some finishers use less points). Of the seven combat slots you get it is most likely one will be used for a single target builder, two for single target finishers (one for each weapon), one for an aoe builder, and one for an aoe finisher. So of the seven comat slots you only really get two slots for whatever situational skills. It is likely one of them will be a healing skill. Consequently combat is pretty simple however if you roleplay your character it should be more than rather, rinse, repeat. You also get seven passives to compliment your seven combat abilities and these 14 together will constitute most of your theory crafting and the goal you set for the combination of skills you eventually want to achieve in your dream build. I would not recommend looking up a cookie cutter build in a forum while your are still doing the main quest but rather theory crafting your own otherwise it may become a mundane and anxious process.Concerning questing: quests come in a variety of types and the type of quest is indicated by a box symbol at the quest giver. There are your basic kill quests which never seem to get old. There are sort of covert ops quests where you have to try to infiltrate an area with minimal combat. These can get somewhat old but for the most part stay reasonably fresh. Same obstacles typically but spread out differently. Then there are investigation quests which are fun initially but eventually get very, very old. The investigation quests have two problems in general. The first is the are not necessarily solvable either through intuition or through a process of deduction. Often trying to solve them is trial and error or trying to discern the authors intent. The second problem is they can become quite laborious. Even if you know how to solve a particular part of a quest you can spend a good deal of time translating a piece of text from one language to another one letter at a time. These quests however typically give the most exp so if you want to put in the labor you can. Or you can simply look up the solution online which is very often what you will do which sort of spoils the quest because you are looking at what to do online and then doing it; often times again and again.This for the most part is the secret world: questing, roleplaying, theory crafting in modern environments. I haven't reached the endgame yet but I wouldn't expect much from it. I wouldn't consider this game a race to the end(there isn't really a level cap in this game in the traditional sense. I believe your gear has a level cap) but rather a journey where you try to milk what you can out of the content. Maybe the endgame is good I don't know I'm not there.			"

												This game is outstanding for those that love a challenging game with loads of story-enriched content, and lore-heavy environments. I have not played anything like it. One minute you're killing baddies, the next you're following a set of clues to solve the problem. I spent, literally, over an hour on one mission just deciphering riddles and going on a treasure hunt. 20/10			"

												It's like if The X-Files was written by Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft. It is amazeballs.But it is TOUGH. Not for people looking for a casual and laid-back playing experience.The lore and characters are brilliantly written, with fully animated and voiced cutscenes given out liberally for every major mission. They're HIGHLY entertaining, and worth sitting through. The NPC's come in a vareity of delightfully demented flavors, ranging from 'listen to the teddy bear, he knows what he's talking about' to 'we kill monsters, make them into sausages, and eat them'. This is not an exagerration. These characters literally exist in the game. It's a treasure trove of character personality.The world is a suffocatingly gloomy work of dystopian art. It LITERALLY OOZES with darkness and creepiness in places. You'll see. I lack sufficient words to describe it. You'll see.9/10 only because it's not an easy game for new players to get into. There's a helluva learning curve.But if you love the paranormal/supernatural/horror genre?Welcome home.			"

												""The Secret World"" is an MMO-RPG unlike every other.Besides clever quest-design, with nice dialogs and actual interesting informations, the game got intense dungeons in different difficulties, a universe of skill-possibilites, to choose the most effective playstyle for you - and REAL riddles, which you have to solve with help of your ingame-internet-browser.When you got bored of all the other MMO's gamedesigns, TSW might give you a fresh and exciting experience.

												The Secret World is an interesting title. It's very unique in it's own right while still feeling very much like a normal RPG would. TSW allows you to join under one of three different societies (Iluminati, Templar, and Dragon) and each come with their own set of story, characters, and game world hubs to explore. Outside of these faction-specific hub zones are regions. And boy, there's a lot here. The first place you'll come across is Solomon Island, which contains three distinct locations all ranging in size. The maps are massive, and there are tons and tons of sidequests, main missions, and story missions scattered about. From what I know, there are three or four different regions each containing two or three different areas to explore. Your quests all range in both gameplay style and type. So let's break them down one by one.Story Missions - This are quests that follow the main story of the game. How you play it is up to you.Action Missions - Displayed by a symbol of a man running, action missions are exactly what they sound like. This is where you get to do lots of murdering, defending against hordes, and getting into dangerous situations.Sabotage Missions - Marked with the symbol of a timer strapped to dynamite, these missions are a more stealth orientated. You'll have to do such things as sneaking around enemies, cameras, and even hacking.Investigation Missions - These missions are marked with a laptop. This, in my opinion, is the landmark mission type that sets TSW apart from the rest. Investigation missions utilize the game's world, as well as its assets, to deliver a rich detective experience. Problem solving and a keen eye for detail are a must. And, sometimes, they really push your brain to the limit. Don't look up online guides for these or you're going to ruin all the fun. Some of these quests type involve having to follow clues, or having hints dropped on you, figuring out passwords and stuff of the sort. Sometimes you actually need to hit up Google and start doing some research in order to find what you're looking for. It's that kind of immersion factor that makes you really feel like you're actually working towards something bigger and unraveling the mysteries of the world.Dungeon Missions - Marked with a purple icon with 3 figures standing. Dungeons are, as you'd expect, hard. I've only played through one dungeon, and from what I can tell you pretty much go through treacherous environments that can harm you fighting multiple bosses until you finally get to the last boss. Then rewards ahoy!Item Missions - Marked with a box. These sidequests are not given by NPCs. Rather, they are objects you find around the world (such as a postal van) that grant you the choice of a side quest. They usually tie together with the main story missions.There's another called Scenario missions. I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet, but it seems to go on a pass-fail basis depending how well you and your party performed.Despite the good, TSW has it's draw backs. For starters, don't expect a TPS experience if you choose to use guns. They play out exactly as they would in an RPG. Your skills under 1-7 are what makes your weapons work. Apart from that, the party system has two really lame issues. The first comes from a lot of quests taking place in solo instances. It renders the whole point of a party pointless when you can only advance a certain quest tier by going into a solo instance. Just as well, Funcom also decided to make a gathering loot a game of chance. Sometimes if you kill an enemy, an uncommon or rare item will appear. No one in your party is allowed to take it. Instead, a bar shows up with 3 button choices, ""Need, Greed, or Pass."" Choosing Greed or Need will cause you roll a di (the number goes to 100 I think). Whoever gets the highest number on their roll wins the item. It's a good system, in theory, but it's also a little annoying. I much prefer GW2's method of just having character bound drops for every member of your party. Although having this system gives off the feeling that working together with other members of different secret societies is more like a fragile alliance rather than friendship.Combat in TSW starts off really poorly. Melee weapons and Magic tend to be more offensive and do a lot of damage to enemies. And the abilities you get can really pack a punch. Guns, on the other hand, start off rather weak. And, alone, its incredibly hard to play with. It's hard to avoid getting hit because you have a very limited dodge function. You can only dodge once after, I think, a 15-20 second cooldown. This makes confrontations alone with guns rather annoying because you can never keep your distance. Once you gain new abilities you'll be a DPS machine. Of course, the way to do this is to level up and get crowd control abilities. But expect to die a lot and work your♥♥♥♥♥off.The story is nothing short of a miss. The concept sounds cool, and the world is excellent. The backstory and lore stuff is really interesting. I haven't gotten much into the story, but what really breaks it for me is the writing. Cutscenes, which happen at the start of every quest given by an NPC, drag on and on. And since your character is mute, sometimes you'll just be listening to one guy blabber on about something for over 2 minutes. This wouldn't be so bad if the writing wasn't so laughably awful. Characters tend to reference stuff that exists in real life, and make pop culture references left and right. Seriously, the head honcho of the Iluminati compares the organization to XBOX but ""more hardcore."" What does that even MEAN? There was a secret man who was well spoken but would occasionally drop meme bombs like, ""all your cameras are belong to us,"" and ""I am disappoint."" These quips don't get me immersed in the story. Rather, they suck me out of the immersive experience. I get that the game is set in modern times and in our world but referencing stuff that exists in real life causes players to think about real life and that breaks immersion.TSW originally started off as a subscription-based game. That was dropped once the sales were too low. Now you can just buy the game and play forever. However, the game does have an item store. This store contains various items like clothing, boosters, weapon moulds to give your weapons a cooler look, pets, accessories, etc. You will have to drop some cash if you wanna make your character look like a badass. Thankfully though everything is reasonably priced. Special outfits only cost a little under $10, and bits and pieces of clothing run you about 50 cents to 2 dollars a pop. There is a subscription system, though. This subscription model grants you 1200 funcom points a month, as well as veteran points for more exclusive items, a special item of the month, and other various bonuses. I don't know how much of an advantage it gives. But I've been playing without it and I seem to be doing okay. Even if I am dying quite a bit.In conclusion, TSW is a blast. And well worth it's asking price. I would also highly recommend the RP servers. Ya know, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												TSW takes a different route from most MMOs by not taking us some medieval fantasy world or the far-flung future but instead keeps us right here at home in the modern era (with some serious occult enhancements of course). I am still not sure at this point if TSW is taking content directly from Lovcraft's stories or just drawing HEAVILY on them. Regardless, the early parts of the game feel like they would be right at home between the pages of his book. The enemies in the game are pretty different from what you would find in other mmos, at least visually. They aren't repeated so much as to feel stale, but they share enough common themes that you can look at a mob and know roughly what you'll be up against.Now for the meat of the game; Do you like class systems? Do you crave adhering to a set of archetypes; playing a sword and board fighter or a swift rogue? Well tooo bad, this game abandons the class system, instead allowing you to specialize in certain weapons, from the hard hitting shotgun to the protective embrace of blood magic's barriers, this game has a little something for pretty much any playstlye (Don't worry meatheads, you can still hit things with sticks). Just because there's no class system doesn't mean that you can't play as a tank, or dps or whatever. In fact, where most MMOs or RPGs would restrict you to choosing one, TSW allows you to mix and match 7 abilities, 7 passives, and 2 weapons. Like the passive from the fist tree that ups your crit chance by 15% but don't wanna get your hands dirty in melee combat? Feel free to use it with your fancy assualt rifle. There are a total of 9 weapon types. Each weapon has 2 'inner' paths that must be maxxed out to access the 6 outer paths. Each path has a mix of 7 abilities and passives. I don't think I need to do the math to tell you that there are a ton of options for kitting out your character. All in all the skill system in this game is easy to use and let's you make a character that is uniquely yours.The only real problems with this game are as follows:It suffers from the same problems as most MMOs: Quests can get repetitive (Kill 10 of enemy x) although there are plenty of interesting quests availible. Because it's an MMO, story doesn't feel as important or persona. Group play is required for a full experience, which  I guess is par for the course for mmos.There aren't a whole ton of people playing. I don't know if that is because I chose a low population server? Or if it is just because the game is less than popular, but it can get a bit lonely, and a bit difficult to find friends to raid with if you didn't bring your own.Some random good stuff about the game:Dungeons/Raids don't just have a stupid amount of enemies followed by a boss, instead they have a ton of bosses followed by a super boss. This means you don't have to wade through slightly stronger versions of the enemies you've already been fighting! It also means more drops!All main quests are fully voice acted apart from your character, some of the people are interesting, I particularly liked the  native american guy and his disinterested teen niece playing chess and mangling metaphors while hordes of Ak'Ab and Draug overran the Town.Enemies are interesting. Sure you start out fighting zombies, which I guess are pretty common, but pretty soon you'll be fighting things like wendigos, fish people, and weird giant bug things!The game is fun. I am normally not a person who enjoys the bland washed out feeling of mmos. But this game did it for me.There are mission types which require no combat, and mission types that require honest to god problem sovling, critical thinking, and an awareness of lore! Note that Funcom has set up websites that you need to visit and explore to solve certain quests. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ That took me for goddammed ever to figure out.Instead of armor deciding your look, you get to choose what your character wears. Defensive stats are derived from occult talismans and lucky chamrs instead of pieces of metal or cloth.Sorry for the rambly-ness of this review, but I hope I get my point accross. Game is gut, it's only 30 bucks, it's worth the money.			"

												The Secret World is pretty crazy. It has a really high level of story presentation and character personalization, comparable to some offline RPGs. Also, the intro for the Dragon faction totally sucked me in. Maybe it's because I was able to understand the Korean and Japanese NPCs even without the English subtitles, but yeah, it totally felt like I was living through some surreal dreamscape version of my own life, except with a few more Lovecraftian horrors. It IS a freemium game, but it seems that the money extras are largely cosmetic, and not necessary to actually survive.			"

												I will admit. I was very surprised by this MMO and originally did not think I'd ever play it. Thanks to a Steam flash sale, I purchased the massive edition (with a few extras thrown in and some of the expansions.. called Issues, btw) for my brother and myself and tried it out. It's fascinating and unique. Edgy voiceover dialogue and discussions, pretty involved quest/story lines, class-less/level-less system, nicely rendered atmospheric environments all in a modern/urban setting. Funcom did well with this so far. There's a slight learning curve and might not be the easiest or the best game to start with for an MMO newcomer. For newcomers or vets alike, stick with it. The community seemed mature, decent and helpful (at least on the server we chose). And we saw our fair share of players running around in the starting areas, the travel nexus (called Agartha), and the first mission zone we were travelling in. There were default notifications about activity in the PVP territories too, so it seems like the game (at least on our server pick) has a decent amount of traffic and population.Graphics (8-9) - DX9/11 support, FXAA, tesselation, good graphics options for the workhorses and the slow ponies. Some character models are nice looking and some are just ugly (like SOME of the NPC's.. good lord, comb that hair)Fun (9) - Puzzles, engrossing questlines, decently fleshed out NPC's, class-less/level-less, fashion options.. wide variety of playstyles supportedSound (8-9) - Fully voiced NPC dialogue/cutscenes, Random NPC voice chatter, good atmospheric mood background music, appropriate sound effects, nothing fancy thoCommunity (8-9) - Decent population sampling for areas we've explored, specific chat channels set up for things like ""Mission Hints"", etc. and rather helpful, mature, decent chatter in the channelsPerformance (8) - I have settings turned up to Ultra on my semi-beast of a machine. I got the occassional lag in some areas, that I haven't quite isolated as graphics lag or connection lag. I'm leaning towards graphics lag due to the area I was inValue (8-9) - B2P (pay for the game, don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee). There's optional membership sub for added bonuses, there's an item shop you can buy things with cash (mainly cosmetic fluff and some value-added consumables), I got massive edition for a steal on a flash sale during the summer sale 2014, but overall the pricing is good with all that's included compared to other MMOsService (8) - The account management site is a little outdated and piggybacks off the old AO account management look and feel.. not very informative or user friendly and can be confusing at times. But you don't spend alot of time in there so I won't penalize the score too much.VERDICT: So.. to sum it up, I'd give this a 8-9 out of 10			"

												I find this game a rare treat, where crusading and cross-dressing are both valid responses to the oncoming end times. Items and costuming are optionally separated, so you can fight werewolves in kink-wear and cyber-wear with equal efficiency.Two words of advice for the beginner players: in the Ability Tree are the starter decks, stick to them until you've finished the Inner Wheel. It'll give you insight into how  a deck should go. Also, don't specialize your Skill Trees too much. The game's designed to improve each weapon generally concurrently and you can sort of snooker yourself with not upping every skill.			"

												A mediocre MMO, but a great single player game with social elements. You have to go into this game with a certain mindset to really appreciate it. Do you value well written quests, a well told story and an interesting setting with good characters? This would probably be right up your allyway, if you can deal with the clunky combat. If not it's best to look elsewhere.---MORE INFO---Dungeons are extremely fun and among the best I've played in any MMO game so far. Community is also among the best and is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Be sure to /chat join sanctuary when you log in. As I mentioned before, combat is a bit clunky and slow and it can be a bit easy to screw up your build. They added decks a while back that make it easier to follow a certain skill path that can fit what your looking for. Quests are spectacular and are not your typical MMO fare. Some of them are actually quite intellectually challenging and will have you solving puzzles and using the in-game browser to research information. The lore is also very deep and if your big on sinking yourself into a good story, there's lots to find here. End game unfortunately doesn't seem to be very big, it's more about the journey then the goal in this case.All in all, TSW is a niche title that will satisfy a certain subset of players. If what I said sounds good to you then it is definitely worth a shot. You may request a trial key over on the official forums (or here, on steam) just to try it out and see if it is for you. For a new player there is a lot to discover and do. Hope to see you in game!			"

There's optional membership sub for added bonuses, there's an item shop you can buy things with cash (mainly cosmetic fluff and some value-added consumables), I got massive edition for a steal on a flash sale during the summer sale 2014, but overall the pricing is good with all that's included compared to other MMOsService (8) - The account management site is a little outdated and piggybacks off the old AO account management look and feel.. not very informative or user friendly and can be confusing at times. But you don't spend alot of time in there so I won't penalize the score too much.VERDICT: So.. to sum it up, I'd give this a 8-9 out of 10			"

												While I Don't have many hours in, often games first impressions makes or breaks the game.  I have been intrigued by this game for years, but never really looked at it when it was first released.  Since it is F2P and the initial investment for the game is low I thought I should give it a try.  I knew from research that this was not a normal model of a MMORPG as the normal leveling model is not used.  But instead we get a Skills based game in which you control how you play and how you play it.  While I am no where near the end game I understand that synergies between skills are very important and how you build is important as you move through the Game.  The good news is if you screw up, go back do some more farming and tweak the build.  You are shown a interesting opening sequence that starts the story, it takes awhile to get through, but does set up what is going on nicely.  You are treated to a breakneck speed Tutorial that gives you some basics about the game.  But if you are familiar with most other MMO's and how they work you can get through it fine without much fuss.  Then you are dumped into London and told to go off and find your HQ, there you select your first weapons and skills and are sent out into the world.This all works well and the graphics are as good, if not better then more of your standard fair MMOs.  Game play is pretty intuitive in terms of movement and combat skills, The Complications set in when you try to figure out the Skills and abilities.  However, thanks to in-game help and a good community forum I was able to select a combination of skills that would give me some good DPS and Survivability for the opening area in New England.  If you love the walking dead, you are going to really like the opening quest line.  The traditional gearing up is not the same as most MMOs it uses talismans to adjust your stats, as well as your weapons, clothes are just costumes and only add cosmetic looks.  The only con is the learning curve, while a familiarity of MMOs helps, reading the forums and various guides also help, but maybe a stronger tutorial area where  you get to see things like crafting might help.  All and all, if I did not have to go to work I would be still playing.  Reviews were a bit mixed on release, but the game seems to have matured and many of the issues in the early reviews have been addressed.  So my advice looking for something a bit different give it a try.			"

												I find this game a rare treat, where crusading and cross-dressing are both valid responses to the oncoming end times. Items and costuming are optionally separated, so you can fight werewolves in kink-wear and cyber-wear with equal efficiency.Two words of advice for the beginner players: in the Ability Tree are the starter decks, stick to them until you've finished the Inner Wheel. It'll give you insight into how  a deck should go. Also, don't specialize your Skill Trees too much. The game's designed to improve each weapon generally concurrently and you can sort of snooker yourself with not upping every skill.			"

												Best and most underrated MMORPG. Lovecraftian/dark fantasy/occult theme with RPG gameplay and NO subscription fee. Arguably strongest lore of any game, immersive with fantastic environments, tons of content, great community, compelling writing/characters/voice actors, fun for casual and hardcore MMORPG players. Fun single player missions as well as group raids, dungeons, and scenarios.One instance of customer support was very helpful. I am always delighted to buy content-rich expansions to the core game, which are numbered Issues (they're up to #10 now) and support the developers. One of my all time favorite games.			"

												An awesome mmorpg that pushed the gameplay scope past what was usual for such games. I played quite a bit of world of warcraft and while it has a lot of end-game content, the questing was typically extremely boring because each quest played the same way. The secret world has a lot of variety in quests (Called missions), there are story missions, combat missions, sabotage missions and research missions. The game itself is based on real world myths and mythology and the research missions showcase this the best. You use an in-game internet browser often to research specific subjects. It can range from relatively simple puzzles to huge research undertakings. Story missions are specifically related to the overall story arch, combat missions are more like traditional quests that you'd expect in an mmo, sabotage missions revolve around usually stealing intel or destroying points of interest without being spotted.As far as combat goes, it's responsive and pretty fun to play. There are no classes, instead there is an ability wheel that you can unlock entirely. You are restricted by your hotbar, which you can equip a single set of passive/active abilities restricted further by the weapons you equip. My only real complaint is that typically if you want to do PVE dungeons as DPS, you will have a difficult time in the high end dungeons compared to ranged dps.The game has no subscription, it relies upon expansions (called issues) which add more areas and missions to the game, as well as lots of cosmetic options. And last but not least you can play as the Illuminati, Templar, or Dragon. While many mmorpgs have a 2 faction world, the secret world has 3, which all work together except in PVP scenarios.Even with a somewhat lacking/restrictive endgame PVE, I managed to spend 300 hours playing this game before reaching the end of the main storyline (not including any of the DLC). This is the only MMORPG that I could ever recommend at this time.			"

												A game where the story shines. The lore is indepth as any early Bioware game. In game graphics are great. Excellant voice acting. Cut scene CG, meh. I have spent over 350 hs in the game with only one character. Between SWTOR, Diablo III, Guide Wars 2 and the Secret World, I hardly have time for my console games.Character creation and skill/ability wheel is easy to use. By the end of the original issues (1,2 and 3) your 2 favourite weapon abilities will be maxed and you can use your further abilty points to invest in different weapons.Then you will get the use of an auxillary weapon and now with issue 9, you get the AEGIS system.Bottom line. If you like the X-files and supernatural themes, this is the game for you.			"

												It's definitely an interesting game. Not for everyone. I will not go into the details (there are tons of a very good reviews already), just add my own opinion.I like that I have to read/listen the quests and think. I like that I can select how much I have to think (investigation mission might be too much after a hard day in the office, for example, but I can skip those to the time when I feel like scratching my head in puzzle). I like the story, voice-overs and atmosphere in general. Combat system is not extraordinary, but fun enough to explore and combat itself is not boring.The system requirements for a decent performance are a bit tough, considering what you get in visuals. The price of the whole package (base game + all the DLCs) might be a bit steep. I am not sure how much fun is the ""end game"" - doesn't look to me as a lot right now.So, overall - worth to take a look if you want something different from ""most other MMOs"" and if you like story-driven gameplay. During the sales on the base game it becomes ""must try"" option in my eyes. :) Just be sure to check system reqs (should be no problem for a reasonable _gaming_ rig, but be careful if you have something more office-oriented or old. ""SWTOR runs on my machine fine"" doesn't mean TSW will).			"

The setting and plot are gorgeous, I would tell more, but don't want to spoil anything. If you like conspiracy theories, H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, post-modern literature and urban legends and would like to play an immersive MMOm than you should check this out. The Secret World is different from other multiplayer RPG's.P.S. There is no stupid grinding in TSW, which is a sickness for most MMO games.			"

												I'll admit, this game doesn't have a good first hour of gameplay. However, after you findout how in-depth the skill tree really is, it opens up ridiculous amounts of possibilities. They need to have respecing available though just incase you♥♥♥♥♥♥up bad on your skill tree. You feel rewarded after playing though unlike many other MMO's (After the first hour or so).There are two skill tree's in the game. One for Skill points (What level of weapons and armors you can use) and ability points (What abilities you can do). The amount of experiance to fill the experiance bar does not change through out the game, however, the number of skill points and ability points does for better abilities and stronger skills. You earn 1 skill point for each time you fill up the experiance bar. And as the experiance bar is divided into three sections, you also earn 1 ability point for filling up each section of the bar. Some people might ask why this would even make sense to do this. The reason is because they want to be innovative. A more rewarding system. Instead of getting 1 skill point for killing a billion enimies for doing 10 long♥♥♥♥♥quest's, you earn a bunch of ability points to spend along with skill points which makes the game feel much more rewarding.If you stick to the game and choose a weapon that you think you'll enjoy using, you're much more likely to enjoy the game. Let's say that you want to use the assult rifle as a weapon, but also you want to use blades and you're stuck between the two, why not choose both?? You can have two weapon that you use where you can mix their abilities together to kick some major♥♥♥♥♥I would reccomend this game, esspecially if it goes on sale again.			"

												The world is not what it seems. For every civilization that has existed there are people who work behind the scenes making it tick, or toil. Behind them is the mystery that reaches into places we've never been or even imagined. Danger lurking and the unknown beckoning you to investigate. Dig too far and you might end up buried and forgotten or you might learn what few do. Imagine a world where everything that you thought was not real existed, man and monster. All of those mystical places each with their own calling. Do you join or not and if you do, then who? Enter yourself into The Secret World.The Secret World is a mature themed MMO right out of a graphic novel. It involves mysteries of the kind that you'd not likely imagine and characters and worlds beyond. Its graphical features are truly amazing as are its cut scenes, dialog, script and voice talent, all of course mature rated. This is the MMO that I've been waiting for a long time and it fits the bill perfectly. I cannot give away much more than to say that if you've ever been curious and found that you had a unique calling, you need to experience it.- It is great as a multiplayer experience though it is not required to enjoy the quests as they scale to team member count.- The music, atmosphere, voice acting and cutscenes are all top notch and yes it does have them but they are part of the narrative to the rich story this game possesses. This adds to the overall experience so this is more than just a loot grab. This has a story and a background. Something that you can learn from if you pay attention. Like a good movie or book it is a testament to the artform of great story telling though you are the story as it develops.- This is not a money grab in terms of it being an online game with F2P aspects. You pay up front for the client and it comes with a great deal of adventures and experiences. You can play the whole game without buying a thing in the store but there is a point to the online store, that helps but it is not required to enjoy the game. You be be just as powerful without purchases as you can with, its just a matter of how quickly you progress and how cool you look (vanity). Vanity as we all know in online gaming is becoming its own artform and expressive language.- There are multiplayer quests and dungeons that benefit from team work, but they are optional quests that do not detract from the main story line. Optional.- The worlds to explore are huge and with so many quests that you will likely miss many along the way so the replay value is high as is the play style.- Decks are a system of building your character according to archetypes that benefit your character in different aspects plus providing a cool look for your character and other archetype specific gear. A great idea reminiscent of class kits in dungeons and dragons.- It benefits from team play for sure as you can level much faster as a team. When teaming as I've mentioned, the quests and scale in difficulty so the gameplay doesn't become easier but requires team work.Did I say atmosphere? This game is oozing with atmosphere in so many aspects it is incredible. If you are a fan of the X-Files or Coast 2 Coast, you want to play this though it is not really a conspiracy theory type game but delves into the mysteries of the unknown for certain.If you decide to open the door to investigate further, I highly suggest taking the time to look over the decks system involved in picking a predefined archetypal role for your character as there are benefits.

												This game is a joy to play.  Don't get me wrong, it is not without its flaws...  Poor optimisation (especially DX11) chiefly amongst them.  But the fact that I am a huge fan of Lovecraft alone bypasses that.But the game itself?  Very few games have been made where you don't 'have' to do much combat.  Especially MMO's...  In fact, the games combat is fairly bog standard tbh...  It uses the tried and tested formula (mostly, there are also area attacks that deviate from this) of clicking on a mob and pressing number keys to kill them.  But, active dodge and moving during charge attacks at least livens it up a bit.But the game comes into its own with the investigation missions.  I recall one in particular, quite early on, where you find a van with some ID in it and have to use an actual website to search for clues.  I'd never seen this in a video game before, so it kinda blew my mind a bit.  A game incorporating things outside of it's programming...  Not really seen it since either to be honest!But, some of the investigations take minutes or hours, by hearsay, I've also heard some people can spend days on some...  So, not always to be taken lightly.Another fantastic point is the 'class' system.  Or, lack of one at least.  Buying skills and making a usable skill set out of them means an amazing amount of diversity.The size of the game is impressive also.  I believe I paid £15 back when I got it in a sale and out of it, so far at least, I have gotten almost 100 hours.  That's not bad going really...  I've barely even made any headway, out of all that time, I am still on the first area, yet to explore the rest of the game...I can't comment on PvP however, as I have not tried it yet.All said and done though, it's a much slower pace than most modern MMO's, so if you're used to the likes of WoW (not meant to sound like a hit at the game as I do still play it), where you do a few quests, then move on to the next area after an hour or two, this may not be for you.  Like wise if you like structured classes that immediately declare what 'role' you will play.But on the whole, I would recommend this to anyone.  Especially those who are interested in games with deep, interesting lore and also any fan of H.P. Lovecraft.  For the latter, it really is a must.			"

												All the urban legends and conspiracies are true! The Secret World pits players against horrors beyond belief, in scenarios inspired by classic film and fiction. The premise is exciting, but is it worth playing? Well...in a word, no. But that's a rating I need to clarify.It does have some interesting areas, enemies, stories, and especially the unique experience/ability/skill system. The voice acting is generally good. There's plenty of tongue-in-cheek, which helps it not to take itself too seriously when it shouldn't. And what music it has is very good.It's easier for me to talk about where I feel TSW failed. First and most importantly of all, the factions are all horrid packs of asslords that you will not like...how original. I understand they're going for 'realism' -- which, to clunky writers means 'unlikeable people' -- but it's been done to death, and here it just puts new players off. They're instantly confronted by people they have no real reason to do anything but work against, no matter who they pick. Given, after the introductory missions, you won't have to deal directly with your faction very much at all for long periods of time, but making it a pillar of the game itself was a mistake.I think it's a major problem of MMOs that so many have resorted to shoehorning characters into militaristic factions that not only don't make sense but aren't appealing, and it doesn't even matter the setting; they still do it regardless. If this really needed to be a part of the game, it should have been closer to endgame where a player chooses, based on interactions up to that point, which faction they will support. TSW's premise is one that would just work so much better if the player were an unaffiliated character, slowly figuring out the factions and figures behind the scenes, perhaps communicating with unknown parties...unknown until much later in the game. With how little part faction plays for quite some time, it really would have been much better to take that approach, as well as more suspenseful and engaging.As for writing, it's absolutely awful. The introductory missions are so abysmal they're often embarrassing, and some of them are offensively sophomoric or uncomfortable in clearly unintended ways. Characters are obnoxious 'just because', and they're not even believable or realistic in their presentation. It's pretty much a mass collection of people you are designed to dislike, which destroys any real willing suspension of disbelief.The character development systems are interesting and robust, but even though skills and abilities are given video tutorials, there are other systems in the game that players are left to sink or swim. Items accumulate in the inventory without explanation, and even though a shop presumably for kits to use them can be encountered, no effort is taken to explain. Similarly, certain gameplay mechanics go utterly unaddressed, such as dropping missions you don't want to complete (you can't, only replace them), or how the game expects you to approach the stealth-oriented missions (which it only informs you are stealth-oriented and gives you no real information on how they're different).And speaking of those stealth missions, avoid them like the plague. While the battle system and skills/abilities are actually refreshing and robust for the most part, the game is not nearly solid enough to even remotely allow for the kind of precision and demanding that they require. There are also a number of occasions where a player will find himself instantly blown up, with no explanation as to why or how it could be avoided. Nothing is explained about these overly picky missions, and they're frustrating and worthless. They don't fit in TSW anyway, but there's no effort to introduce them to the player, and as a result they just end up even less likeable.The tracker is okay, if a bit too approximate. It'll lead you to the area, but highlighting of key interactive objects is very poor, meaning you might pass by an essential item a few dozen times before happening to notice it. While I understand the need for not making the objects too incongruous, they end up being annoyingly hard to find and blend into the scenery. It would be nice to have an option to make the objects more noticeably highlighted.Speaking of options, it would also be nice to have the option for subtitles when people speak, for those of us who are hard of hearing or simply can't understand what some of the voice actors are saying. Sometimes there are subtitles, sometimes there aren't...There are no recovery items or boost items that are made clear initially either, so it can be a bit overwhelming for new players to become used to what's going on. The introduction to battle, a dream sequence common to each faction, doesn't really help much and, like the rest of the intro sequences, is incoherent and fairly useless except for raising questions it has no intention of answering.The game itself is something that can be enjoyed if you can tune out the poorer aspects of it. Battle is usually fun. Exploring the environments is enjoyable, and they're given a lot of personality. The player characters aren't super-customisable, but they're not bad. If you avoid the stealth missions, most of the others are fun. The stories of the locations -- what I'd really call 'modules' or 'regions' -- are pretty interesting, even if the overarching story is the opposite.TSW is one of those games that has such potential, but it doesn't actually manage to achieve much of it. It's frustrating perhaps most of all because if you can see that potential, it's terrible to see it fail again and again to actually get there. The result is a mediocre game that I can't really recommend to anyone without a lot of caveats and disclaimers. If you really want to try it, get it on sale and give it a try. I just can't guarantee you'll think much of it other than an occasional time-waster with pretensions it isn't able to back up, and that's a pity because it could have been something so much more special.

												Best single-player MMORPG. 10/10Joke aside, it's worth buying it just for the lore, story and universe, I haven't grouped once nor played the PvP part, too busy being immersed in the game.			"

												(HEY! If you just bought this game in the sale, there's some noob tips at the end of this to help your experience!)If you want your 100% typical MMO experience, where you have to skedaddle your way through highly-obvious grinds and lock into a class and settle on things, don't play this game. The Secret World (TSW) is a game that obviously experimented in every field of MMO gameplay for the sake of standing out. And in my honest opinion, it worked out. The first thing you'll notice is the missions. They did a really, really good job on the missions. You're pretty much taken on a journey from the second you're forced to find your way to your chosen faction's HQ. By the way, Factions only affect main storyline, pre-made decks, where your HQ is, and PVP by the way. A lot of people use them for roleplaying purposes. You can do most non-faction quests regardless of faction. All main missions and ""storyline"" missions are fully voice-acted, and you'll fall in love (or hate) with many of the characters. Plus, they're all pretty well-written; the game really stands by its mantra of ""Everything is True,"" and it shows. In terms of objectives, the missions are always similar, but not the same. There are some ""investigation missions"" that are basically like a giant mystery, involving real-world research and thinking outside of the box. That's also paired with some ""stealth"" missions, plus your typical MMO missions; honestly, though, you'll only realize you're grinding if you pull yourself out of the immersion. Speaking of grinding, the class/role system, if you can even call it that, is unique but fun. Basically, you're only given a choice of weapons that accomplish different roles, and it's up to you to figure out the best way of building up your character. And everything depends on your weapon choices. Although it seems complex at first, once you figure out the role of each weapon - and they aren't always what you think - you can easily find a play style that suits you. I've seen other MMOs try the ""choose-your-path"" style of role-building, but none quite work as naturally as this. The fighting is something that you either absolutely love or despise. Paired with the weapon system, it can prove complex for newer players. There's a lot of kiting, which they honestly never really talk about; you just have to figure it out on your own. But with practice and the right set of character abilities, it's something you can get used to. The endgame stuff isn't as easily achievable as one may think. Here's the thing - the $30 set is the ""base game,"" and then for $10 each after, you can buy extensions to the game that give you more plot. The good news is that I hear nothing but good about these ""Issues,"" as they call them, like ""issues"" of a comic book or magazine. The developers clearly intend on putting out high-quality, entertaining content (with some good diversity, if I may add). The bad news is that there's a lot of this content, and without getting a hold of it, the endgame community may seem a little isolating. I do have to talk about the community and support. Two words: Absolutely unmatched. All of the veterans are really noob-friendly (as far as I've seen), and many come back for their ""nightmare mode"" (endgame difficulty) and extra missions, but stick around and will answer questions and even do dungeons. There's a sizeable roleplaying community that has a lot of great events and great people, and it may drag out your TSW experience (like it did for me) and keep you engaged. The developers are the icing on the cake. Sweet, rich buttermilk icing. Although they are largely hands-off, they lurk in the forums and roleplaying communities and keep an eye out for the players. (We're pretty sure they cracked a joke about one of our roleplaying characters at some point in the last week.) They have a ""monthly director letter"" where they chat about progress and upcoming events and content, as well as their intentions behind everything. And they're dorks. Complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dorks. Their selection of cash-shop clothing, their absurd number of pop culture references, the Lovecraftian air of the starter section, and some of their missions. What a bunch of dorks. If you plan on starting TSW keep the following in mind:Join the Arcadia or Cerberus servers. The former is livelier and has a lot of great players, the latter has more people and... more great players. You WILL use two weapons. Embrace them. Decks! Do a deck. They guide you into a weapon role. Open up your ability screen and to the left you'll see ""decks."" Choose a starter deck unless you're feeling courageous. Don't just skip through the mission briefings. The quests are really well-done and roll into one another. Collect lore! They look like little yellow boxes with hexagons on them. They give you EXP, achievements, and items. And again, everything's very, very well-written. Don't be scared to ask questions in General Chat. Everyone's usually very nice and willing to ask questions or help. The only place spammed with trades is Agartha (where you go from place to place). PVP is not a place for noobs. Wait until you're at least done with Solomon Island. Conclusion: This is definitely worth $30, and it's a steal if it's on sale. You can use as much time playing it as any $60 new-release game. Actually, you can put more time into it. Why shouldn't you? The developers and community put a lot of love into the game, and it really shows.			"

												The Secret World (TSW) is the first MMORPG that kept my attention long enough for me to actually reach the max level of the game. To a lot of people that's probably an easy task - but a lot of these styles of games are a grind. TSW, however, is not any ordinary game. It's smart, it's terrifying, and its action packed. The story is a unique blend of action, adventure, and horror, and I can promise you that you’ll never be bored if that’s your kind of thing. The gameplay is unique in the fact that you can play all the major roles on the same character. This means ideally that you only need one character in the game – but they still give you three slots if you want one character for each faction. You have to pick and choose your build, only having a select number of ability and passive skill slots at any given time. It makes you think, and you have to adapt to different situations.So far the game has a lot of replay value in the dungeon content, along with the ability to repeat any mission you’ve done. They also have some really cool season specific events around Halloween and Christmas which make the atmosphere even better.  As for end game content, I’m still working my way in getting there. I’ve just finished issue #8, and will be venturing into the new Tokyo issues very soon.  If you’re looking for a normal run of the mill MMORPG – this isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a challenge, and value story - pick this up. You won’t regret it.			"

The community is solid and (mostly) beginner friendly, and it's short comings early on have been mostly fixed although non-gamebreaking bugs are still common.I won't say it's for everyone, but it's a solid game that will appeal to many.

												I don't often write game reviews, but The Secret World compels me to write one.First off, the virtual world is incredibly detailed and the atmosphere really does fit the theme of a creeping horror. Very Lovecraftian in most places. The cut scenes are always worth watching. It isn't a game for those with short attention spans, the missions are designed to be solved like a puzzle and the clues are often hard to spot if you aren't paying attention. Sure some seem like the standard kill x monsters, but the Lore and backround built into them does make it very different from the usual MMOs. The in-game community is very friendly too. There's never any awkwardness about asking for help - sometimes there'll be offers of aid in general chat, so even if you're shy about asking complete strangers, there's plenty of opportunity to voice your questions then. Chances are, someone else could be stuck on the very same mission and you'd be helping them out too.			"

												This is, without a doubt, the coolest MMO I've ever played.  The Secret World, while unfortunately mechanically uninteresting most of the time, is the smartest, best-written MMO on the market today.  Investigation missions are a welcome (and much-needed) break from the standard ""kill 5 boars"" fare of the modern World of Warcraft clone.  This game makes you think to solve its puzzles, and it will make you feel like an idiot.  But that's a good thing, really, if you're looking for something different.  This is the first MMO where I didn't just mindlessly click through a million of the exact same kill/fetch quests  over and over and over again to grind to the level cap. I care about the characters and their stories.  The voice acting is great, and the writing is dark and witty.I love this game, and hope it sticks around.Just wish they'd make the combat as interesting and fun as the rest of the game. "

												""It's an MMO for the intelligent gamer.""The Secret World had a lot of hype when it first began circling the web and thankfully it delivered.  The repetitive quests age is over and you will not find a lack of things to kill or puzzles to solve. And when I say puzzles, I don't mean ""light the pillars in the correct order"", I mean translate “Clavis Aurea” from Latin which means ""Golden Key"", go back to City Hall you wandered through on that other mission, grab the giant key on the wall, bring it back, and see if it opens the door. In simpler terms, you will never have to worry about having to go kill 10 monsters for this NPC and then 15 for the next.The Secret World is also a classless game, you aren't stuck playing the fighter or rogue. However, you must be careful what abilities you invest in, because there isn't a reset potion. Which means if you invest 500pts in swords and then decide you want to wield a gun instead, you can't relocate those points and will be weaker with the guns against tougher monsters unless you go back to a easier area. That's not to say you'll get bored with the sword, but it does make you question where to put each and every point you gain.All and all, it’s a good MMO and well worth the onetime payment. If MMOs are your thing (and you like the World of Darkness/Cthulhu feel) I would recommend giving The Secret World a shot.			"

												Possibly one of my favorite online games of all time. Join the secret world and unravel the truth behind this modern-day MMORPG. But know that it's so much much more than another cookie cutter MMO. Classless, it encourages you to think outside of the box in solving combat situations. And the story is as thought provoking as it is engaging, taking you through a slew of uniquely-spun takes of myths and legends that would leave the brothers Grimm proud.			"

												The Secret World is pretty cool.I think the best thing about the game is the writing - the quests, characters, stories & locations are clearly a labour of love.The game itself is actually quite fun to play, too.It gives you the freedom to develop in any area you like, and there's really no reason not to experiment.  If I had to choose a favourite style of character progression in an MMO, I'd go with the old school 'Ultima Online' approach, where your skills develop as you use them.  (Well, actually they had that in some MUDs well before MMOs but let's not get bogged down on details).The Secret World simply rewards you with Ability Points (used to learn skills) and Skill Points (learned to get stronger) .. hmm, writing that down it sounds weird .. but anyway, you get the points and have the freedom to spend them anywhere .. the game has an ability wheel that is in many ways strange and counter-intuitive, but when you work it out, it's good.The game makes a strong first impression, but then, as you step toward mid-game, starts to wane a little .. so I think most players are either:Dabblers - new players giving it a goCitizens - folks who have had their dabble and powered through, or went away and came back (like me)When I returned to the game after my dabble, I suddenly 'got' it.  I understood the mechanics better and was a LOT more successful in my play - and once you hit that point where you're comfortable with the mechanics, the game becomes really quite cool indeed.Give it a dabble.  If it's not your cup of tea, try again a month later.You won't regret it.  It's a good game.			"

												Yes. This was everything I wanted it to be.An MMORPG in the modern world. With every possible myth, legend, lore, and tale in the hidden, Secret World view.No levels, but as you gain experience you choose to unlock more abilities themed around weapon types. Choosing your abilities and maximizing synergies with effects feels like TCG's deck building.  I love combining dual-wield pistols with lightning attacks.Quests are more than ""Kill x# of y"" and some are full-on puzzles worthy of classic Adventure Games or Myst in their diabolical obscurity, many requiring intentionally looking up information in the real world; bridging the game's themes of conspiracy into IRL.Great game for RP.This is maybe the only online multiplayer type game where I'm not rushing to get to max level, because I feel everything on the road there is worth experiencing. I never feel like I'm grinding.The only negative IMO is that the engine doesn't feel optimized; only a very good PC is going to run it smoothly, even with all of the settings turn pretty far down.

												First Look ReviewThe Secret World is a very different type of MMO. The Secret World strengths are in its missions. Missions now take research and all no longer just simple ""fetch"" quests. Some investigative missions actually use external game assets, like browsing Google to find a certain game related websites. These kinds of ideas are innovative and really provide the player a sense of immersion. The Secret World is a very challenging MMO and does have a learning curve. Not having a level cap is a hard concept to grasp when playing for the first time. Since the player can basically have all the skills in the game, its hard for a new player to decide what starting skills would be beneficial for early game. Personally, I did not do any research on skills and leveled Shotgun to start out. I soon realized during my first dungeon encounter that some boss uses a good number of Area of effect spells, basically causing me a lot of deaths and very little DPS. My recommendation for a new player is to decide early on the type of player you would like to be (Damage, Healing, Tank) and research what skills would be the best for these roles for early in the game. But, since this game does not have a dedicated class system, players can change skills on the fly to meet the needs of the encounter. Again, great flexibility and innovation.In my 50 hours of gameplay, I did notice some difficulty scaling issues. Without prior research, its hard to determine if the player has the power to survive the encounter. I noticed this while primary completing the story quest and have come to a point where I need to complete other missions for skill points to level up my health and damage. Again, this is due to the fact I went into this MMO without prior knowledge. The Secret World forums has a great write-up on how monsters difficulty is determined based on the estimated power of the player. The Secret World is a fun and challenging MMO and is recommended for any players looking for a flexible and different experience than any other current generation of MMO's. "

												10/10 would go beneath the primal fluid again.I definitely enjoyed the game for the price I paid for it. There's plenty of skills to choose from, so you can mess around with different combinations. Quests for this game is very interesting and some are pretty hard if you don't look up a guide to it. If you can find some awesome people to play with, this game will go a long way for you. You choose from one of the three factions: Templars, Dragons, and Illuminati. Each faction is against each other in PVP but in the PVE world you are all together. The server you pick only matters for PVP aspect of the game as you will be able to play with everyone for PVE. Cabals which are the guilds in this game are faction specific, so if your a Templar you can't make a cabal with your Illuminati friend. The biggest downside to this game is the player base. Even with all the servers being able to play with each other, there are times where it is dead.Pros:- Lots of skills to play with- Lots of weapon choices- Lots of unique quests- Storyline is pretty interesting (different for each faction, Illuminati is the best in my opinion haha *eye in the sky*)- Dungeon bosses gain different abilities depending on difficulty- Can unlock everything on 1 character (weapons and skills)Cons:- Community is dwindling- Combat system is not for everyone- PVP unbalanced (normally 1 faction dominates, depends on the servers your grouped with)- Dungeon/Raids get repetitive- Slow updates- Gotta buy ""Issues"" for some new content (not really a bad thing since your supporting the game but it might not appeal to everyone)If you meet anyone from my Cabals Lachesis, Atropos or Clotho, they are some awesome people :D Unfortunately I have not been playing the game for a while now.PS: Beware of Sliggity he's a therapist.

												Fun game and different from the previous MMO's I've played in the past. There aren't too many hunt X amount of items in the game which I appreciate. There is also no numbered leveling system. I like the Lovecraftian feel to it and there are plenty of creepy stories that make me hesitate going alone to certain areas. The game is a bit tough to learn and it expects you to think your way through some missions. Solving missions and puzzles are very satisfying when you finally get it.			"

												I haven't played this game for a long time yet - 11 hours - But so far this game has been really fun and getting addictive. 9/10 - Some of the monsters are very hard to kill when going solo. The whole leveling system and attack list seem a bit complex to when you first start to play it.			"

												Great game, full of spooky scary stuff... that you can kill... and then go buy clothes because what's more important than good gear? Looking as sexy as possible. Spend a couple of grand on a jacket that you're just gonna die in. Go find a hord of zombies to maul you to death, that shirt you got is going to be ruined after that gang bang. I rate this game a 10/♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A strange game that has a colourful setpieces, and wide range of interesting lore.THE LONG REVIEW:The Secret World actually caught my attention because I saw the word ""conspiracy theory"" in the description; it just goes to show you where I get my entertainment. Anywho, The Secret World is a mashup of just that, along with strange myths and legends, and secret societies that you get to take a part in (LIKE THE ILLUMINATI!!!). At first it sounds a little odd because it's set in modern day, but I can assure you that it's a welcome change of pace from the Fantasy and Sci-Fi setpieces that other games have. The story is fairly straight forward, you pick your faction, and develop your character from that point on. As my main, I was able to chose two starting abilities, the first being the ability to use an Assault Rifle and a Sword; which was awesome because the way in which it's presented to you.I think most of my fondness for the game comes from just the mystique of the world and factions. There is just so much lore that you want to discover because it takes on all of those myths, and conspiracy theories that are so entertaining to read about already. So props to the developers for taking on something that I don't even think anyone else has taken on (to my knowledge), technically they're lore is already made for them.But as cool as The Secret World is the graphics and animations can be a little stiff at times, making it kind of dated, but if you have a decent PC you should be able to up the settings. The UI is also kind of cumbersome to use, it's a little bit all over the place, and not very straight forward. In other games, things kind of come to you intuitively, but here you have to sort of test things out to see if they work. Which brings me to my next point, questing. Questing can be great if you get the hang of things, but it was so bothersome seeing so many just all over the place. I'm fine with games making plenty of content available, but I think that the harder missions should have been locked away from sight until the player reached the apropriate level; I saw way to many HARD or VERY HARD quests that I wanted to take on but really couldn't because I kept dying or I just didn't want to bother, which bothered me because it felt like a waste leaving quests there open.Oh, the other thing is that dying isn't normal either. When you do die, your spirit gets respawned at a point and you have to run to your body to revive them. Strange I know, but it works for the universe  - though after a while it might be annoying for some peopleOverall The Secret World is an odd gem, it has a lot going for it's strange premise and the concepts are all there to back it up. I really have been enjoying my time playing the game, aside from the few problems I had. The Secret World is an easy reccomendation, and if you decide to play the game, it's best to do it with friends since the experience will be a tiny bit better; again it's not your typical MMO, approach it as a game like DIABLO or DESTINY.MADE FOR: People who love conspiracies and the secret societies surrounding them.  NOT MADE FOR: People expecting a full blown MMO in the same vein as say World of Warcraft.THE SECRET WORLD8/10			"

												I purchased this game during the original launch. There was a spirit that was there with the release (for anyone who saw the teaser commercials) that really had a hard time making it to the game.I am a huge Lovecraft fan and I enjoy every aspect of cosmic horror. The base game captures a lot of cosmic horror elements quite well, but if you're not willing to pay every time you want to see a little bit of new content, you'll be left bored pretty quickly.Cons:- 0 Endgame- Poor optimization has plagued this game forever      - Makes PvP a chore to play through when multiple people group together      - High particle density boss fights lag- Gated 'premium' content (micro-expansions that nickel and dime you for 1 new dungeon and a minor story line)- Became a dress-up simulator after initial launch failed- World PvP is skewed by faction popularity (Illuminati -> Templars -> Dragon)Pros:- Alt-free system (on the fly class-changing)- Atmosphere and base story are amazing- Being a Templar- Not being a Dragon (who even are these guys)- Not being Illuminati			"

												I absolutely love this game. If you're a fan of the Supernatural and being badass, this game is for you.What I really like is that you can play alone or with friends and the challenges are the same. I've only played for 40 hours, but after playing some other multiplayer games with toxic communities, this one is not one of them. Everyone is very friendly, and most times are willing to help and teach the beginners.It is also a very forgiving game. If you don't like a weapon set up you may have picked before, you can easily switch to another set and begin storing points for them. The only thing I find lacking is the character customization as the males and females have a set body figure. You can make them shorter or taller but their body shape remains the same. I also think that more customization would be highly benefitial to the game, but I do like that you can wear anything you want and it's not covered by ugly suits of armor. All in all, I recommend this game for the player base and the gameplay, as well as the story.			"

												It's an MMO for grownups. Lots of fun quests where you have to look things up out of game, and actually use your brain and stuff! There's also a good it of the down and dirty killing things, but with a storyline so good you'll not want to skip the cutcenes explaining EACH quest. Even the NPCs are so awesome and individual that you'll want to stop and chat with them... like the Sir in the park in London. You actually feel like you're a part of this awesome place. Huge open maps that you can either physically walk to and from each place OR fast travel to from a really unique hub.My only qualm is that I wish they'd trust the player a bit more in the character creation. You can create a unique character but it never really feels unique enough. Lots of awesome clothing choices though to make up for it. You can also pretty much create whatever play style you'd like.

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO which I wish was more popular, or it may be because of the server I am playing out. But nonetheless it is a really fun game and the mechanics, abilities and story are really ground breaking and interesting. It can be a bit glitchy at time, and PVP is pretty difficult as a low level with low level equipment, but it is gauranteed to be a fun experience playing with friends, or simply doing something alone depending how you play MMOs.

												So, it has been some time since I wrote a review for this game. Before whenever I did I was somewhat interested and said it was just a good game. But after spending many...many hours in this game and hitting a mark where I am doing end game content, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. This game is a very unique MMO and pretty amazing if you are interested in the RPG community in it as well. Not many reviews here will talk about the ARGs, ((Alternate Reality Game)) that they do, blurring the line between real and fake. The Twitterverse, where you hop on twitter and post as your char, the developers even get in on it and post things as characters in the game world! It is super awesome and super fun if you are into that!If you are into just solo gameplay, this game has you covered as well! An amazing story with likeable chars, unique quests and amazing music! The PvE is amazing as the customization for your ""Deck"" ((Set of skills)) is amazing. You can be anything you want and that is always awesome.PvP, the community is full of amazing people. Before when I wrote the review I didn't talk about PvP... but this is the first time where I have entered a PvP area as a noob and had people actually helping me, wanting me to do better and willing to HELP me do better by giving me advice in very nice ways, never rude.Now, ever game does have it's flaws, this game can be a bit buggy at times and Egypt... *Shudders* Egypt has an AMAZING story, but I found myself struggling to get through it at times. Other than that though, this game is nothing short of awesome.do yourself a favour and pick up this game. This is quite literally the best MMO I have ever played and it would be nice to have more people on here!			"

												I have a love-hate relation with TSW. I really like the character system used, giving you a lot of freedom on how you want to progress. An other very good point of TSW is the questing system. You can't just pick up every quest out there and you haveto be keep on what quests you take. I also like how the game looks like - it really gives you an apocalypse kinda feeling.What I don't like are the hordes of zombies (which are pretty agile BTW) that you see everywhere and how some are really overpowered. An other bad thing is the 'X marks the spot' idea for quests. You can see from afar where you have to go to, to do your thing :(Last but not least, the game absolutely looks stunning!Addendum July 8th, 2016 I've give TSW an other try the last two weeks and it's growing a lot on me. These last two weeks I've played over 50 hours already. One of the biggest problems I had with TWS (the hordes of zombies) is almost gone now, because I've moved out of Kinsmouth Town and went on the the Savage Coast, and am about to hit the Blue Mountains. Though there still are a lot of zombies around, the game finally goes deeper into the Lovecraftian lore as well...An other thing to point out (and why my love-hate relationship started) is the main story of the game. In the past I tried to do that one and pick up some missions along the way. This results in the game becoming extremely hard (close to impossible) for me when the main story hit the Blue Moutain. Now I've changed my focus more on completing the maps and do the main story as I'm on that map.Last but not least, I've always loved the story telling as it was done and it's been the reason I gave TSW a try more than once. A day or 2 ago I spoke with a veteran player and he told me that the main developer (who now has left) was a vivid role-player. I guess that's why I loved the story telling so much, having played Dungeons & Dragons for close to 3 decades and recognize when an experienced GM has laid out the main story.			"

I am now fluent in Latin and Romanian, and have applied for a job as a codebreaker.The dungeons are great fun.The abilty wheel allows so much customisation to builds.Great Community.Cons: Crafting seems pretty pointless.Combat is very basic.The engine is a bit dated! (the zones look amazing though!)In the 2 funcom games i have played, the guild/cabal panel/options always seem like an afterthought and are not prominent are interesting.... basically a list of names!

												So I've been playing this game about 2 weeks, and I really like it.  I had played AO from launch, and decided I'd skip Funcom games until they got their act together.  I have to say, The Secret World ain't bad.  It's not my beloved City of Heroes, but then ... nothing will be.It's a truly classless and levelless system of the kind Ultima Online wanted to be.  Every character can have every skill at max in the end game.  What makes that interesting is that you can only use a limited set of skills (a ""deck"") at once.  The game really shines when you figure out new builds from what you've unlocked.Plus, I adore Lovecraft.  This game is like mainlining heroin for a Cthulhu fan.  It's a dark, atmospheric war among 3 factions.  The mythology is Harry Potter meets At the Mountains of Madness with a dollop of Bram Stoker.  Good stuff. "

												WOW! What a highly under-rated game! Nothings here I would consider 'new' or 'special' (with the exception of investigation missions having me looking up ancient latin text in Google to get a code to open a door to then have to find a famous composers name to solve a riddle in a painting to then... （の ワ の ）it's fun) but the mature, modern setting with the Dark supernatural HP Lovecrft themes... Refreshing. Some nice voice acting as well. Better than average for sure. Effective story telling for the missions. Free form choice of weapons, abilities, and specs to playstyles. Plenty of choice. No P2W aspect within the microtranactions, all clothes, digital dressup. The way I prefer it and am happy to support with micro purchases from time to time. Worth every penny for 30$. If you happen to pick it up on sale, even more value. You'll even get 10$ in ingame micro currency for completeing 30 missions on your account. Free money to buy some personal style from the store!!Totally worth the time youll put in for the money you spent. Especially with no subs.			"

												Seriously why is this game so under-rated and buried. Me and my wife have absolutely loved this game. We really enjoyed it when it first released. We had some computer issues. Got them fixed and forgot to come back. Gameplay is solid. The mechanics of attacking feel good. The Storyline is to die for. Lack of a class system provides an interesting challenge when doing AP/SP. The graphics are also quite fantastic. Seriously very well could be the most under-rated game of all time. I will say i'm unsure of the END game. But honestly the storyline alone is worth the bang for the buck.			"

The community is generally very nice too, which is a rarity in the world of MMOs. My only major complaint is that the extra content is expensive - too expensive unless there's a sale - and that some of teh endgame content is a bit grindy.But overall, a good game.			"

												This game is great. I love the Universe, the quests are interesting, and the combat is exciting. The game takes place in a world where every myth, legend, and conspiracy theory is true. Players can choose between three secret societies to work for, The Dragon, The Templars, or the Illuminati. One great thing is the classes, or lack therof. Players can choose two weapons to start with, building their skills as they play, and if a weapon begins to not seem like the right fit, you can choose to learn a new one, this is definitely a great MMO, and I reccomend it with every fiber of my being.

												I'm gonna Say it Here... I Love this Game and I Don't know why.Maybe its the design, maybe its the way the system opens up as you get more Xp, or how no ability is locked off to you without Reason (Story Spoilers for why 1-2 Abilities are locked.. so i won't get into it). The ""Deck"" design for building your character is nice and gives decent hints for how to play different Playstyles, In-game tutorials are there if you need them for most of the Systems that are in the Game... And the Community is Generally friendly.The story is fun (For Me atleast) and goes into directions that are predictable sometimes and sometimes a Complete Curveball (Transyvania and Dracula are one of the more interesting ones). Then there is the Lore entries... You don't just get one or 2 pieces of information about whats going on or Concepts.. you get massive logs to look though that give enough information to sate most people.. and those things it doesn't answer? It's usually just not something you've found yet...Overall I recommend The Secret World.... It's a Fun Romp though a Modern World that's going though a Magical Apocalypse as Cthuluoid entities (And Things MUCH WORSE) are waking up and breaking into our reality....The Dreamer's Wake, How will you stop them?

												All right, so the game looked promising at first. $30 for a modern/Fantasy MMO? Awesome, sold. Now, I'm an lover of the Souls series. As anyone familiar with the series can tell you, multiple characters for different styles of gameplay are a must. TSW however? You can do anything. Top all the weapon and skill sets out, flip between as you see fit. Sweet. But still, that's end game, and we're just getting started.First run, Dragon (because who doesn't love a little chaos). Pistols and Rifles. Soldier style. Cleared up to Transylvania, including completeing the main story quest line. But hectic. Didn't know enough, character is strongish, but a complete mess with points and abilities all over the place. Oh, found this thing called a Deck. Helps you stay decently strong while giving you things to word towards. Sweet. Time to restart!Second Run. Templar. Deck deck deck, Exorxist? Healer based deck. Cool, reduced que times for dungeons. Soloing the main story was a bit problematic, but hey! I'm a healer, I don't die easy. Story cleared up to Transyl again. Like it, but I don't love it. Restart.Third run. Templar, Paladin Deck. LOVE it... Tankability if I want it, high single target damage if I want it. Decent Aoe and crowd control too, all I gotta do is switch some specs up. Absolutely best run, but got stopped when buddy wanted to run with me. Paladin for solo time... Time to make another character, we'll get back to the Paladin later.4th character. Eh... Dragon, screw it, let's check out the Matial Artist deck. Very gook tanking build. Easy control over the mobs, though in story, a bit lackluster in damage. All right, it takes me forever to kill them, but it takes them forever to kill me. I win, I have decent passive healing. Chaos Magic via close colse quarters crowd control is a blast, and the sword skills boosting my defensive rating by a chunk, love it. Story cleared past Trasnsyl, caught up to Paladin, switch back to continue with my buddy on the character I love.20 minutes back on paladin, and I'm content locked. I check out the content pack I need, $10. Okay. But for only a portion of the area I'm in? Wtf?I go to Steam, and everything Issue 9 and up is only available via Collectors Edition. $25. Funny, cause directly from the site, I can get the standard for $10. Any package deals? Not unless you paid $60 intitially for the Ultimate Edition. Anyway to just upgrade to Ultimate? Hell no, you get another base game key to give to a friend. I can't give someone that, I'd feel bad. Steams total price for DLC is $210! Okay, so 7 DLC packs are $15 over priced. So buying standard straight from the source? 210 - 105. Still $105. Already paid $30. So 135. Sorry, what? AAA games go for 60, and reduce their DLC prices after a year or two. This game is 4 years old... 4 Years...I love the game, I love the mechanics, but I can't justify that price tag... I can't. I really want to recommend this game, but if you aren't going staight for the $60 Ultimate, which still leaves 4 DLC packs locked, I can't. Was it a full game? I'm sure it was, at one point! But I've been hearing about Tokyo since the beggining of the game, and now you're telling me I can fight there, but I can't progress without buying something? Why even bring it up!? Lock me out of the whole area. Don't let me in then tell me, ""Money or you can't do anything besides kill trash mobs.""Gameplay 9/10.Story 9/10.Prices 2/10.It's been 4 years, and you want that much money. That's now how you increase a player base.			"

												Bite Sized ReviewThe Good:+ Really Nice Graphics for an MMO+ The Interface looks really nice and slick, nice sounds on it too like when you unlock an achievement+ 2 Weapon System allows you to mix up your character build+ No classes, anyone can change character roles at anytime+ The atmosphere of modern day but with ghosts and goblins etc. is great+ Missions are voiced with cut scenes+ Mission Variety is great: Combat, Stealth, and PuzzleThe Bad:- Loading times/ how often you see them is a little excessive - Que times for PvE Dungeons and PVP is too long, even during weekends when it should be fast- Enemies get more health at higher levels, and just become bullet sponges near the end- Equipment (except weapons) does not show on character - Good/Interesting Vanity Items must be purchased with real money- Expansion content is locked behind multiple $15 add-ons- Can only make human characters in a universe where there are ghouls, goblins, zombies, and werewolves- Base game story line has a weak and uninteresting finish- Act of combat and combat animations are stiff and boring- Dwindling Player base- It is an MMOThe Verdict:I loved this game for a long time and only recently buckled down and beat the base game storyline. I loved the world and atmosphere this game gave off, but at every turn I felt like the game could be so much better if it was a single player RPG instead of an MMO. The combat and animations suffer and the fact that enemies respawn after you've killed them just leaves the game feeling hollow. I truly feel if Funcom were to take this world and make a Vampire the Masquerade style game out of it, it would be amazing. "

												I payed full price for this, and to be honest, judging by how the game looks and how the concept was presented, it looked sweet. Now that I played some of it, it really becomes repetitive, especially that you can re-do missions that give you more money or experience than others, and some of them are investigation missions too, it just feels like you are solving the same mistery over and over again just to grind some daily credits. Gets boring really fast, also eats up alot of RAM.			"

  The Secret World is the beast, in good and a couple of small bad ways First of all, I love this game. Weirdly enough, I have had some problems with a ""dxgi_error_device_removed"" error report, it is the first time I've seen this error. After install and observing the report I simply tried rebooting my system and after that, the game worked perfectly, at 100 - 120 fps I played for a couple of hours, and was really enjoyed. Next day when I tried loading the game, it came with the error, I tried rebooting without any luck and now I'm stuck with the error reports. Beside my frustration I can highly recommend this game, since this bug seems to be pretty uncommon for people with newer gear. I really hope the developers find a solution, in the meantime I will try to fix it myself.Of 2 hours of gameplay I can already say It's one of the most enjoyable MMORPG games I have ever played (I have played almost every popular EU&US MMORPG games there is) CPU Intel Core i5 3570K @ 3.40GHz  RAM 8,00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 799MHz  Motherboard MSI Z77A-GD55 (MS-7751) Graphics BenQ XL2420T (1920x1080@120Hz)2 x 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (MSI) SLI	 Storage 2 x 223GB Intel Raid 0 Volume (SATA)465GB Western Digital WDC WD5000AAKX-003CA0 (SATA)If anyone have an solution please tell. :-)			"

												At first I was a bit skeptic, because all the MMO's I played were in a fantasy world, but ohgosh, I love 'The Secret World' so much! All the NPC's are amazing with great voice actors. There are more type of quests, for example the investigation ones, where sometimes you have to browse the internet to find answers and clues. You have a great set of skills and weapons and you can freely choose what you want to level. You can choose from three secret society and every one of them are unique and really interesting (I especially like the templars with Dame Julia :D). The combat is not that interesting in my opinion, but not that bad, especially if you choose a weapon which you really like. I think it's a great game and if you like MMO's and interesting stories, you should definitely try this game out! :)			"

												Honestly: I would highly recommend this game. Enjoyable combat, interesting story, intriguing and well-realized setting, and deft writing with both a sense of gravity and humor. The MMO elements come on too strong for me, and honestly, I wish the game was more of a Borderlands style optional co-op, but it still works reasonably well the way it is. Additionally, I personally would prefer not having a completely silent protagonist without access to even text dialogue, although the fact that every quest of any import is given in soliloquy does do something to help with that. Overall, however, the game is fun enjoyable to play--and it would probably be even more so if the MMO elements were actually appealing to you.			"

												There's no game quite like The Secret World. It's a mish-mash of a lot of things. It works very well as a single player MMO. You get the feeling of a community, but you aren't constantly forced to group to get the best loot or the best experience. The thing that will keep you playing is the world. It is beautiful. As well as this the way you're character will look and feel will become a lot more personalized than other MMOs. Overall, it's definitely worth a look if it peeks your interest. Without a subscription fee, the amount of content packed into this game nowadays is great value for money.			"

												I'm really happy I tried this game -- I've overlooked it for years.  I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.The down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.Honestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.

												Never done the MMO thing, because the games didn't seem to be my style. The only thing about WOW I got into was Hearthstone. I was fixin to try Diablo on PS3, then I read about TSW. I thought, man that's more my kinna game. So I finally purchased the base game, and still getting familiar with the game play. I have to say, even though I'm early in the game, it has been Fantastic! I hate I found out about it 2 years after the fact, and wished it had a bigger following. I tried to sell it to my WOW folks, but bad timing on that. :) Anyways, if you're into the MMO and the Horror genre, this is the ONE! Myself, looking forward to purchasing the remaing issues.			"

												This game is pretty awesome once you get the hang of it. Graphics are pretty awesome and i dont feel like i am forced to buy anything to progress. The cash shop does have items that increase your characters power but its only for early game content and is replaced fairly quickly.  The in-game browser is useful sometimes when you have to use it and believe me you will have to use it a lot. I like that i dont have to keep making new characters in order to try something different i just keep getting skill points and abilities points (AP & SP) and just level up the appropriate skills and im good to go! Crafting is a lot different than i am used to in any game. It is very difficult to understand if you do not do the tutorials as you go. Do not try to figure it out on your own trust me you wont be able to. Most of the zones i have seen so far have a kind of horror feel to them and as you wonder through the woods in some places you can hear chewing and ripping of flesh and some other unsettling noises which is kinda disturbing at first lol. I do recommend this game to everyone especially if its on sale .. you dont need a sub to play and progress in the game .. you only get extra XP and other resources from quest completion with a sub. The gameplay is unique and satisfying and everyone should try it out.Edit: Thought i would come back and give more info about the game that i did not provide in my review. You get your own museum which is sorta like a housing system to show off some cool stuff. Its all instance based and you display exhibits of the creatures you kill in the world. In order to display to the creatures you just simply kill them and collect lore as you quest or whatever it is you do in The Secret World. I suggest you wait until you have finished spending your AP (ability points) on your character progression before attempting to restore your museum. The exhibits are not free and will cost you quite a bit of AP in order to restore one exhibit.. there are many... many .. exhibits. I have spent quite a bit of time doing dungeons and world bosses recently and depending on which difficulty you do the dungeons you will find them quite difficult and you will die alot. Most of the encounters in the game are not melee friendly and have one shot potential so take this in consideration before trying out your builds. I recommend completing the starter decks to see what kind of weapons you would like to play with.			"

												This is the best MMORPG I've ever played to ! I definitely recommend it.- The content is really mature and dark (Lovecraft influences), missions aren't about killing mobs only but it also involves stealth missions (don't try to kill mobs there you'll end up dead) and investigation missions (trust me you'd do things you'd never imagine doing while playing a game).- The universe is modern which is not common in MMORPG and it's very refreshing.- The gameplay is amazing, with 3 weapons (2 main and 1 auxiliary) you can create tons of build among 525 abilities (active and passive) depending the situation you're facing, there isn't level progression in the game and you can switch role (dps, healer, tank) at any time of the game but end game is more appropriate to do that.- The main story line is catchy and interesting. Templar, Illuminati, Dragon ... Chose your side.- The community is really involved in the game and is mostly really mature (especially during event time).Well I guess you can easily notice my love for this game however there are still few negative points about it.- As much as I love pvp in this game, it takes sometimes a long time to enter into pvp area due to the lack of pvp players.- The game engine suffer of some optimization problems especially when it comes to gather a lot of players at the same place (lots of fps decrease) and it also happens randomly at some specific places (and it's not a question of computer hardwares).- Developers are slow to release new contents even tho there are lots of things to do in The Secret World.Besides these few negative points, I must confess that this is one of the best game I've ever played to and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a whole new experience !

												Excellent game with new innovative ""leveling"" system. The graphics aren't next gen, no, but they are pretty amazing for an MMO. The story is rich and very smart, a real thinker's game to be honest. No MMO has gotten me to really care for the story like this one has. The dialogue is rich and engaging, and while at times te ability wheel prevents your character from their potential,it adds to the challenge that is this game. Definite recommend for MMO skeptics like myself who usually quit MMO's after a couple of months.			"

Character customization is great, the enviroments are huge and detailed. The enemies will send a tingle down your spine on some occasions. Some of the quests are very well thought up and require you to research it 99% of the time using the end game browser, for the investigation missions I mean. Does the whole no level thing very well.

												A game that's fun and easy to pick up whenever. From lore hunters to endgame smashers, The Secret World is oft understated in the MMO world. I started out on my own originally, quit for about a year, then returned when a friend decided to join in. Since then, we've been joined by two more, who we are running through the hoops somewhat with laughter all around. Many TSW players will admit that starting out can be a little daunting since there is a learning curve, but those who stick around past the frustration will find the game rewarding in many ways.As several other reviewers have noted, this game is coded and run on Flash; however, there are player-made mods (Curse.com has a client that can install them for you) that can help with everything from re-arranging the user interface to auto-sorting your inventory. Additionally, the graphic may not make some of the graphically inclined too happy, but honestly I was not bothered by it and found it charming.I would go into depth on mechanics and whatnot, but it has been covered by others prior to myself. All-in-all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge.			"

												The PvE is absolutely amazing, with freaky horror themes and mythology all mixed together.The PvP is the worst of any game I've ever played in my entire history of gaming. All of the builds in the game center around 1 of 3 of the most powerful crowd controls in the game, all of which being defined by the fact they have very little counterplay options because they are instant-cast and have 5 or less frames of windup animation.Ranged PvP can be defined as Cardiac Arrest + X. Every ranged build is just basic builders/consumers with that one hard-CC being the basis to all encounters that player has. Melee PvP can be define as  Strange Attractor + X or Double Impair Sword.And that's as deep as it goes. Funcom has no idea how to balance it so those 3 builds sit in masses alongside healers who have the age-old balance issues of almost every MMO's pvp healers, in that they heal wayyyyy too much because the game is PvE focused above all, and there isn't a true healthy mid point they can reach between being able to outheal raid bosses but still being able to die to player characters in PvP.If you're looking for a great PvE experience this one is worth a few weeks of play. If you're looking for PvP you should look elsewhere, this one is atrocious.			"

												Absolutely amazing game, it really is a good game but it is HARD, and when I say it is hard I mean to do this game alone you are off your head.  It is hard to learn, play and level up.  To rank up you need insane XP.  A long lasting game though to get far but you need friends to team up with, because the AI are hard as hell.The game itself is beautifully made and plays nice. Tons to do and keep you going a great buy.The graphics are really nice, really they look really good and offer a nice change with the textures. The audio is basic chop, bash, swing, yelling. Nothing special compared to any other mmo. The controls are easy to use, really they are simple to get a hold off and nothing complicated. The game itself, really is good... The features built in make this game one hell of a massive learn curve... This is no normal MMO I found... It is brutally hard to play the game alone, really I was owned left right and centre.. It is a game to be played with friends and the game offers some amazing character progression and stats to build... You should play this game with friends really it is so hard and that is good, I sadly had no friends who wanted to play, and I was sadly skeptical to play the game because I did not enjoy the beta but the full game is really good... I've never payed to play it and only bought when it was buy to play.  If you want a game that is hard to play, long to learn and master with friends that takes team work, this is definitely the game for you!			"

I definitely recommend it.- The content is really mature and dark (Lovecraft influences), missions aren't about killing mobs only but it also involves stealth missions (don't try to kill mobs there you'll end up dead) and investigation missions (trust me you'd do things you'd never imagine doing while playing a game).- The universe is modern which is not common in MMORPG and it's very refreshing.- The gameplay is amazing, with 3 weapons (2 main and 1 auxiliary) you can create tons of build among 525 abilities (active and passive) depending the situation you're facing, there isn't level progression in the game and you can switch role (dps, healer, tank) at any time of the game but end game is more appropriate to do that.- The main story line is catchy and interesting. Templar, Illuminati, Dragon ... Chose your side.- The community is really involved in the game and is mostly really mature (especially during event time).Well I guess you can easily notice my love for this game however there are still few negative points about it.- As much as I love pvp in this game, it takes sometimes a long time to enter into pvp area due to the lack of pvp players.- The game engine suffer of some optimization problems especially when it comes to gather a lot of players at the same place (lots of fps decrease) and it also happens randomly at some specific places (and it's not a question of computer hardwares).- Developers are slow to release new contents even tho there are lots of things to do in The Secret World.Besides these few negative points, I must confess that this is one of the best game I've ever played to and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a whole new experience !

												The Secret World is a somewhat unique and interesting take on the standard MMORPG fare. It stands out by having a strong focus on a rich and interesting world, a New World Order themed storyline, paranoid story elements and plenty of characters with their own agendas. TSW shies away from Elves & Orcs and medieval armor and instead brings a cleaner cut world, but one with interesting factions with their own stories to explore, and tons of interesting things to find.HighlightsThe great pleasures of The Secret World over its competitors come from the style and story matter and the very clear choice to make this game NOT full of the typical MMORPG mechanics and content. Quests, for example, are structured so that you can't simply walk from area to area collecting quests then running off to fulfil their requirements. Instead, mission types are usually very different and unique, have adjustable difficulty and more. They're designed to make you play in a different way, to be engaged in what you're doing and thinking about what's going on while you explore. Levelling up, another MMORPG standard, doesn't exist, and failing a mission wont make you want to fight more monsters, collect more resources or spend more gold. Instead you'll seek to approach something differently, fight the enemies more , or talk to characters you missed.* Voice acting is above average, especially for an MMORPG. It helps add distinctness to characters and their personality. Sound assets and audio in general is very well done and treated with respect in this game. Hearing something unusual on a mission in any other game would be a glitch, here it's a clue.* Personally I love the fact that this game has been designed with solo-play in mind. There are elements where it's useful to work together as a group, or have friends involved, but on the whole you can play the entire game without talking to another human player. There's no pressure to level up and unlock this and that, and you can always find something else to involve yourself in* The lack of a level cap or limitation adds more depth to character customization while not restricting you to any one play style. If a particular set of tasks require you to have more health to tank, or your friends need a healer for some quest, you can adapt yourself to fulfil that role* While I have many problems with the pricing structure of this game, one thing I'm happy about is the non forced in-game purchases. Funcom Points are non essential and only really prompted for on the website and can be completely ignored* Whether its the nature of the game, or the types of people that it attracts, the community in this game is great. Stumbling across interesting people to talk to is common, and finding helpful and friendly team members is always easy* Character customization has a ton of features, and other than some small facial structure feature problems, the clothing, gear, equipment and selection screens are all quite deep and usefulMistakesHeld back by a number of small mistakes, there's plenty to make you pause, but nothing that should stop you from enjoying this title if you've already decided it's something you'd like.* The graphics are fairly good and do the atmosphere justice, but they're definitely not as good or well optimized as you'd find in competitors like Guild Wars 2, EVE Online or The Elder Scrolls Online.* Funcom support is inconsistent and typically either very swift or awfully long with their replies and help* There are also some very poor interactions between the Funcom interface/website and the game, buying in-game currency with Steam wallet, for example, is a frustrating process. Nicknames must be unique to the server, and seemingly never expire, so choosing a nickname is a horrible process of trial and error until you find one which isn't already taken* Poor UI elements and general lack of elegance in the overlaysRecommendationsTSW is a polarizing game, and there's a very real risk of simply not enjoying the way the game plays. If you're looking for a contrast to the traditional Triple-A MMORPG fare, if you like slowly exploring and uncovering the details of a story and if you don't mind cutscenes and combat being mixed in there and don't mind also working towards unlocking skills and abilities, you'll likely get a lot out of The Secret World. It's a great time sink for those who enjoy it, with more than 100 hours of story content, with a main storyline that could be completed in somewhere around 12-15 hours if the rest of the world were, for some strange reason, ignored.Reviewing the pricing an MMORPG is a little more difficult because of the number of pricing models available, including any DLCs, paid content and more, and The Secret World makes it even harder with a franky awful pricing model. A one-off payment of £24.99/29.99€/$29.99 which, for the amount of content involved, is fairly priced, even when compared against competitors like Guild Wars 2 which runs from £34.99/$39.99 up to £79.99/$99.99 is available, and fair for what's included.Then there's the Ultimate Edition which is £44.99/54.99/$59.99 and is simply ridiculous for any video game. I know some people like to argue that this is an expected price of some Triple A titles and console releases, but if the standard of game pricing means I'd have to spend more than $300 for a handful of games then it's simply a bad price market, regardless of playtime. There are also 3 overpriced DLCs available on Steam, at £19.99/24.99€/$24.99 each. That's a disgusting £59.97/74.97€/$74.97 for 3 pieces of DLC, each of which also require the base game to play. And to the naysayers comment that they're included in the Ultimate Edition and shouldn't be purchased separately, I ask why they're called Collector's Editions, or even available for purchase if not to try to justify the price of the Ultimate Edition in comparison. Furthermore, the Ultimate Edition includes a second copy of the base game when purchased from Funcom, but NOT from Steam where the majority of purchases take place, which is another disgusting move.If the pricing scheme gives you reason to pause, you should remember that the DLC were originally offered as seperately sold content, giving the customer plenty of price options. The Massive Edition, which has now been removed from the Steam Store and which offered exactly the same content as the Ultimate Edition minus Issue #8 (considered the worst and most pointless of the issues) also came with the removal of the separate DLCs and was then superceded by the Ultimate Edition, presumably for a new round of sales, and to remove those DLC options and prompt buying of the Ultimate Edition. While I'm being harsh on a game that offers an absolute ton of content for the right player, it's important to understand that it's a potential waste of $60 or more for the wrong player and that simply not risking your money on a game you might not enjoy may honestly be the best option for many.When on sale, that risk becomes far more manageable. At the time of review, The Massive Edition reached its lowest price in December 2013 of -67% (£14.99/18.99€/$19.99) which was more than a fair price. So far the Ultimate Edition, which is almost identical) has only reached -30% and I'd recommend waiting til it drops at least -50% or more.* Early PR and even marketing of the game and content was done via ARGs[wiki.crygaia.com], which were puzzles and promotions that involved real world websites and groups along with game content and resources and were quite special in their own right* All active accounts on The Secret World come with TestLive access[forums.thesecretworld.com], similar to a beta or test server* Similar to WoW character pages, you can access a detailed list			"

												The greatest storytelling you've seen in an MMO (yes, story in an MMO, you heard me), combined with a cast of memorable NPCs and excellent voice acting makes TSW a worthwhile purchase even if you normally don't like this genre. You can play it as a traditional single-player RPG and still have a great time. And if you choose to stick around after finishing the story, the game has a surprisingly mature and friendly community that is always willing to help. Now go buy the Massive Edition, because it includes the last 3 issues, which are a treat to play.			"

												I felt compelled to write a review for this game. Played this game on an off for a while now.  I managed to get some of my guild gaming buddies to jump in,  including my wife O.O  This game starts of easy enough with different types of quest missions for different tastes of game play. With a main storry line to follow along, its hard to get lost.  Vidio clips to follow along as you progress to immerse yourself, like an interactive novel.  I have no idea what end game play is like so I won't comment .  But I will say this.  Running like hell is a strategy that should be on your list of game play. Hence my next suggestion is find friends to play along with.  Some of the game play is intense, a fire fight from one end to the other. Solo play is possible but with a lot of watching where you move and when. Playing with a group of friends is more enjoyable and probably the way the game was originally set up. Buckle in for a rough ride.       New comers to the game don't be afraid to totally explore your abilities and skills.  Even have decks that can help you develop a combat style and a new look for your toon. A story line worth watching, not a total waste of time.  PvP gankers well probably not the place for you this game is mostly co-op and that's the way we like it. But the pvp zones come in different sizes and as in all pvp in the beginning grinding is a major factor in pvp performance.  And probably weapon quality that only can be achieved with some time spent in game.  PvE areas consist of questing areas, epic areas that can reward you with better loot (suggest a full group) Group instances, solo instances (part of the story line and also acts like a guide for the strength of your toon  eg. can do it yet, go find better gear. Collect stuff make better gear (strongly suggest going on line as this part is not a simple click and play as some items need to be placed correctly.)    Or loot better gear from the instance or as you dive in deeper into the game.   Yes this game has been around a while and yes probably could use a machine upgrade for some better graphics and I hope is on the agenda as this game does deserve a spit and polish. Yes I do give kinda a mixed review but I did enjoy my time spent on this game. I'm just blunt and say it as it is.19/02/16Ok, been playing for a little bit now and what seemed like an huge grind has been drasticly reduced.  Once you have made your Nightmire challenge (nm* dungons ) and start looking at some of the more challenging instances. You quickly recognize a huge jump in difficulty. Things are done by the numbers, need to do this need to do that. Failure to do so, drastically reduces you chances. But thankfully you have probably found a guild to roll with that can guide you though the nightmare. Bit of a pun but totally true. But don't fret if you have not, the community as a whole is still helpful as always. Notifications do come up that a new player is in your instance with you. So they know right of a nub is in the room. So don't be shy and raise your hand.  As for end game the first Raid is in New York city and suggested entry is for Pugs 10.44 *quality 10 gear with a level 4 up grade on the item itself and the glyph placed in it) Guild runs 10.11 easily enough. Although nm are difficult once you learn the fights its all rather easy, believe it or not its true. Yea a bit more dancing as I like to call it but it needs to be harder right. And to make things even more of a challenge a couple of instance have been added to keep you on your toes. I won't comment on as I have not delved into them extensively as of yet.As of before pvp does not make a huge impact via in game but does help in over all upgrading items that your toon has in his/her arsenal.  Shambala has now been added as a new venue to go rumble in and has proven to be a place to quicly try out new builds and crazy build and builds that make no sense or just fun builds because your toon looks cool. Trust me no one really cares at least when I decided to dance in the middle on more than one occasion no one gave me crap for it. hehehe XD After all its a game and meant to have fun in. Ok blunt truth now. At first I love the new pvp area. But it does get old and the auto balance of your toon has been exploited by a few in game. Thankfully the match is over in about 5 mins but the rewards are good win or loose. A bit better if you win but the main purpose for going is not taken away.  Currency used to upgrade items on your toon.  The down side are the exploits some people use in the game. The run certain builds that take advantage of the balance and well it kinda over. In some cases its mostly prime time its who side has the most exploiters will win the match. More on the down side. It has left the other pvp zones to almost ghost towns. That have left to more crafty ways to finishing them if the zone has come up as a daily. Thankfully it seems exploiters are catching flak from other players as for the numbers seem to have dropped a bit. So as for pvper its proven to be a fun stomping ground, but could be disappointed as for the sudden drop in the other pvp zones. I think most including myself as for this novice pvp'er disappointed by the balance of rewards from one zone to the other and the new balance installed in Shambala only to be exploited by a slim number of elitists that have some profound thinking they are Uber leetz when most just think the opposite and they lack any kind of skill.My thumbs up still remains as I still find this game worth my time. And remain hopeful that the crew at TSW fix the issues that now come up that are all in all kinda minor and probably could be easly fixed. So keep gaming and who knows maybe see you in game.  8D			"

												(Only just purchased on steam, but have 300 or so hours as of this writing)Mediocre combat. Fantastic (though sometimes rage inducing) investigative quests. Interesting take on character building, where you build a set of active and passive abilities that synergize well. One of the only MMOs where our group actually bothers to play with each other, instead of just racing to prep for dungeons. Play because you like theorycrafting or want a game where it's actually easy/rewarding to play with and help out friends.			"

So as for pvper its proven to be a fun stomping ground, but could be disappointed as for the sudden drop in the other pvp zones. I think most including myself as for this novice pvp'er disappointed by the balance of rewards from one zone to the other and the new balance installed in Shambala only to be exploited by a slim number of elitists that have some profound thinking they are Uber leetz when most just think the opposite and they lack any kind of skill.My thumbs up still remains as I still find this game worth my time. And remain hopeful that the crew at TSW fix the issues that now come up that are all in all kinda minor and probably could be easly fixed. So keep gaming and who knows maybe see you in game.  8D			"

												So compellng and such a great change from WoW (I miss Vanilla Wow....), although WoW would probably have me hooked again if I spent the 5 days needed to download it all again.Only drawback is the amount of thinking needed (LOL?)I mean the game has it's own in game Google you need to use to solve quests.  I think I'll try it again though - I can see it's worth the effort to get through the first few levels - just gets a bit confusing with how to character build and what to specialise in.  An awesome concept that more people should take a chance on.  And yes, it's addictive unless you have absolutely no patience! :)  Great graphics, items, lore, and really nice to be playing with ""real"" people and not just NPCs for a change.			"

												If you are looking for something different than the traditional hack-and-slash or ""kill 10 X and bring me 6 Y"" type game, and if you enjoy reading an intriguing novel, TSW is the game for you. Excellent storytelling, fascinating storylines, exciting quests given by realistic characters - this game pins me to my chair everytime for hours on end. Not to mention the unusual skill-ability system, which doesn't penalize you for thinking outside the box and creating a warhammer wielding thaumaturge mage (with a rocket launcher). Some of the research quests are highly complex, requiring real life research (Internet is available in-game), and sometimes solving codes and cyphers yourself. Creativity and logic really helps during gameplay, and prevents the game from turning into a point-and-kill. Overall a very much enjoyable experience. 10/10			"

												so i'm not very far into this game, this is basically a first impression of the game so far: the secret world doesnt play like most mmorpg's i've played before. in the ones i've played, y ou grow bored if you're just gridning or doing quests by yourself, but the thing i like about TSW is that you can play by yourself like its a regular rpg if you want to, and you won't lose interest, or so i haven't yet. one thing i would change is the combat, its not point and click attacking like in WOW or any other  mmo.  you don't attack with your mouse, rather your number buttons, which can be kind of bothersome when you encounter multiple foes. really cool storyline so far (i haven't played any other faction yet besides illuminati) and all in all, i'm enjoying this game so far. on sale righ tnow for about 10 bucks, i'd say its worth it.

												A phenomenal adaptation/inspiration of HP Lovecraft's delightly horrifying works. Unlike traditional horror, which relies on jump scares and cheap frights, The Secret World draws upon Lovecraft's uncanny ability to tap into what truly terrifies the soul rather than what frightens the central nervous system. You won't be jumping out of your seat on this one. You'll be glued to it.Initially, I was hesitant to try this game out as an MMO, feeling it may better be adapted for single play, but I couldn't be more wrong. The community is just as friendly as my first MMO, FFXI Online, an experience I'd been unable to replicate until TSW. Although you can play through the game by yourself, you'll never feel truly alone, at least until you enter a wonderfully creepy solo instance, further reducing the frights and increasing the terror. Find a friend or sibling to play with, as I did, and you'll truly be in for an incredible experience.The Graphicsare good, even on a computer like mine that's overdue for a graphics card upgrade and experiences odd memory leaks. Even on low settings, the ambience of each zone feels truly unique, coloring each story in a uniquely terrifying way. From the uncertainty of what lies directly in front of you in the fog of Solomon Island to the unforgiving blistering heat of Egypt, this is a world flush with care, love, and lore from its developers.The Musical Score is very good. There's little else to say but that you won't be disappointed in the game's ability to match the cadence of your decesnt into madness with an appropriate tempo to accompany you.The Lore is what will entrance you for hours. Ragnar Tørnquist, the game's creative director, may very well be HP Lovecraft's reincarnation. You'll feel drawn into his world immediately, spending hours simply hunting down little bits of story to add to your knowledge of the secret world, and keeping your eyes open for new information.The Gameplay is truly phenomenal. While the control scheme is typical for an MMO, with your expected hotbar and somewhat uninspired movement, level progression is unique and entertaining. Eschewing traditional levels, you're allowed to select any ability, any weapon, and any strategem you desire, mixing and matching abilities from different progression trees to create a unique set of abilities. Tanks, DPS, and Healers are one thing, but the variety of choices you have on how to fufill those roles are quite large. Your Missions vary from simple collection quests and defeat a certain amount of enemies, to truly baffling mysteries where the game refuses to hold your hand. You're expected to use your brain, decode complicated ciphers with demonic runes, open up a bible to find a clue hidden in Psalms, or go online to one of the game's shadowy corperation's websites and find its employee directory for your next clue, using the game's own web browser feature. I will admit to you a remarkable frustration towards the morse code segments, though. I did not go to nautical school. I'm fairly certain most of us didn't either.For a fan of MMO's, this is a must buy. For fans of Lovecraft, this is a must buy. For fans of neither, this very well might be the game that endears you to both.			"

												This is one of the best MMOs I've ever played, if not the best. The combat is the standard ""Press 1, 2, 3, to attack"" yet it feels a bit different. It may be the modern setting, the mix of rifles and magic, or hammers if you want aswell. The quest design is easily the best I've seen in a MMO. You aren't a ""god"", you are just a soldier for the faction that you choose, among others. At the moment the game seems sparsely populated, but it may just be the time of day. All in all I recomend this, though look at screenshots and the other reviews before you decide, since this isnt FTP. "

												Pros:-Modern setting with good graphics, intuitive controls, and tons of lore-Delve into the story behind factions including the Illuminati, the Templar, and the Dragon-Many hours of gameplay (At 20 hours I had just finished the first main area)-No subscription required, some free items included in purchase (check 'claim items' in store in game!)-Unique travel system between maps using underground tree network Agartha-Cutscenes and voices for every major NPC/quest to draw you into the story-Decent character customization choices for clothes/appearance-Unlock special outfits by completing certain skill sets-Over 500 skills to select from including 9 different weapon categories.-Equip 2 weapons at once, allowing use of skills from both seamlessly without even having to swap manually-Choose 7 active and 7 passive skills from any that you have unlocked from all categories.-Given time a single character could learn all skills; no specialization prevents you from unlocking any others-Solo play possible for those who enjoy it for all but the toughest missions-Variety of mission types - action, sabotage, investigations, item, dungeons, etc-Investigation mission puzzles are likely the most challenging you have seen in a gameCons:-No auto attacks, no attacking without skill use; this means you spend lots of time mashing your main skill button-Equipping new weapons/armor does not change the way your character appears-Some puzzles so challenging you are expected to solve using web browser, which can detract from immersion-Although no subscription required, you do have to pay for further releases of content (issues).-No means of travelling quickly within maps so you lose a lot of time having to repeatedly walk/fight your way through-'No class / No level' system is not accurate; you still gain XP and are limited by your skill and item levels  -This makes it somewhat less clear when you are really 'level-appropriate' for a given area until you end up dying-Due to most missions being repeatable in any area, you have less of a feel of closure when moving on to the next area			"

If you like conspiracy theories and Lovecraftian horror, and don't mind some slightly dated hotkey-based combat, this is pretty good.

												I've had expereince with many MMO's and RPG's. This one is so refreshing. It isn't the standard pick a class and level up system. This one allows you to be whatever you choose to. Whether you want to be up close, ranged, a mix between the two, or some random combination of skills that somehow you are able to make it work.In the game, you are able to use 2 different weapons at any given time, (Not including auxilary since I still havent made it that far) which already expands your capabilites beyond most other MMO's. Now if you don't like what you chose thats fine. You simply earn more Ability Points and Skill Points (which isn't hard at all) put them into a different category and start using different skills and weapons.All the main missions include cutscenes which are fully animated and IMO well written. Then you have side missions everywhere. Some are just there for extra experience, but most actually tie into either the main storyline or one of the main missions.But out of all the things this game offers, so far my favorite, is the investigation missions. These missions are difficult. They make you think. They only give you hints as what to do, you have to figure it out. There are no waypoints with this one. You will have to search things up and read from books, myths, news reports, and anything else you can think of just to be able to complete these. But if you don't care for this, then just google the mission follow the steps get the experience and move on with your life like a lame person would. (No offence to all those who do this.)I haven't experience everything this game has to offer yet, so I'll probably come back and add to this after another 100 hours of gameplay or so. Cause at this point, I only complete the first story mission I was assigned. From what I know, I still have 3 other HUGE zones that the story will go across and I've only done 1.So if you want a simple answer on whether or not this game is worth it. Yes. No subscription, but offer's just as much content as a subscription based game.			"

Update: They ruined it. I kind of regret spending money on this now. They've made a lot of bad changes for their new free-to-play re-release(that replaces my Steam version) and totally screwed over the original player-base that spent $50-100 to play all of their very over-priced content, while also limiting your character slots to one in the re-release and making you start over, among many more changes I don't like. Screw Funcom. This is no longer the game I purchased, which is bullsh!t.----- Original Review: -----9/10 - Easily my favorite MMORPG, which is also an incredible single-player game. This is a unique experience I highly recommend.Pros:Mature-themed and intelligent dialogues--they don't hold back.The atmosphere is amazing; better than most games I've played. You'll never want to leave.Unmatched missions that have a lot of variety and plots that are better than some AAA titles, with great voice acting and solid cutscenes(featuring your character!) for at least half of them(There's a lot!).A lot of missions are repeatable.Investigation missions are unlike anything you've seen before. They require real investigation, whether it be using your knowledge of the game, searching the internet(there's an in-game browser), or even calling real phone numbers. Expect these to be insanely difficult. You should put some on hold and do other missions while you think about their solutions or hints, explore the vast world until something ""ticks.""It makes you think.Everywhere in every zone, there's rich content to be found, whether it be hidden lore or a mission.Tons of in-depth lore to uncover.Many large zones to explore with different themes, filled with great design, content and atmosphere.Encourages exploration.You can explore when you die, as a ghost, and it is required for some things. The world changes when you're dead.Lovecraftian horror.Choose from three factions, each with their own story and hub. Illuminati, Templar or Dragon.Great character customization with tons of cosmetics to unlock or buy.You get a hat for eating 7460 tacos.Countless in-game achievements with rewards of all kinds(XP, cosmetics, items, titles, etc.).There's no character levels. You earn XP to unlock Ability Points and Skill Points; the required amount of XP never changes. You're able to unlock all 500+ abilities on a single character to create complex builds. Skill Points decide which quality level of items you can equip.Since your equipment's quality level matters so much, it's not such a bad idea to rush to the next zone to get better loot, then go back to make things a bit easier(A mission may be required to advance to the next zone).Two weapon types can be equipped at once in any combination and you can change them at any time, then you can unlock a 3rd special weapon later in the game.9 Main weapon types include Assault Rifle, Pistols, Shotgun, Fist, Hammer, Blade, Elemental, Chaos and Blood.There's auxiliary weapons such as a Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower, Quantum, Chainsaw and Whip. These would be the 3rd weapon you can equip at once and they each have their own set of abilities.Seasonal events.Good pacing; not grindy as most MMORPGs are.Nice music, I never felt the need to disable it.Buy-to-play, no subscription.Over 160 hours in and there's still a ton of content I haven't done.Memorable.Dungeons and Scenarios have multiple difficulties.After completing 30 missions, you get 1200 free points to spend in their store, which can be used to purchase extra mission packs among many goods.The Issues(mission packs) that are sold don't really come into play until endgame and they're optional, so if you make it that far, they probably deserve the extra money anyway.It has PvP, for those that are looking for it. You can completely avoid it like I have.The community is nice and helpful. Be sure to join the ""#Sanctuary"" chat channel, great place.You can fast travel to anima wells you find at a very low cost.The zone maps seen via the [M] key are very nice, with coordinates as well as the ability to place text markers to label noteworthy spots. I use that feature a lot.Addon/mod support.Countless high quality textures and images you'll see in missions.Upgradeable sprint speeds(unlocked through faction rank. You have to buy the upgrade in your faction's hub and a lot of people tend to miss this feature for a long time).Item crafting and disassembling.Auction House(I like them, and it only helps this game).Expand inventory space many times simply by using in-game currency. You can split inventories for sorting.You'll probably only use one character, but you can have multiple.Makes time fly.Cons:Ridiculously underrated considering this may be the best MMO available. There's not a ton of people playing(a few thousand maybe), but that's okay, since at least 90% of the content is possible solo. It's pretty much a single-player game with social features, but you can group up if you wish. I'd say most of the players are using a non-Steam client, so ignore the Steam charts. It's actually not integrated with Steam at all, so you don't have to run it through Steam either. You get a key for the game that you redeem on your account to activate it.Some people don't like the combat, some say it's the only downfall, but I personally kind of like it; I've seen much worse. You'll be dodging plenty of attacks, kiting and aiming with AoEs or cone-style attacks, plus the animations and effects are nice.DX11 has a couple bugs, so you may be better off running it in DX9 like me. I think DX9 even gives a better framerate. The option is available.The framerate could be better, but it's acceptable and I get too immersed to notice. I think maybe it just doesn't like my 8-core AMD CPU very much, that's not uncommon with MMOs.The prices on Steam are fairly high, especially for Issues(additional endgame missions), but it's definitely worth it.It may be a bit difficult to get into at first, for some people, but that's because there's so much to it!50GB install size, but judging from the amount of high quality content and voice acting in the game, that install size seems fair.No Steam achievements. I would've enjoyed them.Update:10-Day Free Trial here[play.thesecretworld.com] "

												I was really looking forward to this game, and thought it had a lot of potential.  It does have some good points, like a pretty engaging story, especially for an MMO, and a really cool look.  It also has a very nice skill system that allows a lot of customization.  Unfortunately, it's very grindy.  Not as bad as some MMOs, but you will end up running through the same areas, doing the same quests, killing the same monsters over and over again.  After a while it gets tiring.The biggest issue with the game, though, is that it forces you to do a lot of solo missions, where your friends cannot come along.  When you're playing through the game with a group, and suddenly you all have to go into solo instances for twenty minutes to do some mission, it kills a lot of the fun of the game.  And those are the best missions, the ones with story and complexity, but you can't play them with other people.Overall it's better than average for an MMO, and if you like the sort of urban fantasy vibe, it does that very well.

There still are people playing it which is nice, the missions I have played so far seem varied and interesting, the graphics are pretty good, and the atmosphere is nice.  The game is not ground breaking, but it is a fun mmo to play.  The only probelms I have had with the game are the long amount of time the patching is taking, not sure if that is because I just purchased the game, but everytime I have wanted to play it is patching, at first it took a long time, now it is down to about 3 minutes.  The other problem is that I had a lot of stuttering when using dx11, so I had to switch to dx9 which I haven't had any problems with FPS wise or stuttering.  I like the game, I would recommend it for some fun playing experiences, definetly not the greatest game every, but for me it is very entertaining.  FYI there are some pretty good videos on youtube by Totalbiscuit and others if you want to look at gameplay prior to buying.			"

												TSW is a great f2p MMORPG with a short learning curve but still offers alot to the more 'hardcore' oriented gamer. Fun increases when you are familiar with classic horror and conspiracy novels (f.e. ''Shadow over Innsmouth'' by Lovecraft) but it's not needed to understand what is going on. A great plus is the character progression system, which doesn't use character-levels at all but a very intelligent gear-system that makes sure content doesn't get 'Blizzarded' ( you know...outdated after every patch, completely useless and a waste of time to even go for it). The PVE system works perfectly while the PVP system (which is always a big deal for me) seems a little bit weird... it feels like it was forced in there but not really intended, in other words it plays like a stand-alone minigame thats not a huge part of the game even tho it has impact on whats going on in PVE (buffs etc). The story suggests otherwise, three factions fighting for world-dominance should have a GREAT pvp system imo. But after a few of those really CRAZY and mindblowing missions (like the twisted themepark in area2) you won't really miss it. Everything has voice-over and looks really beautiful IF you can run it on full resolution.Only flaw is the crafting system. It is dumb. Nothing else to say about it ;)TSW gets 9/10 points			"

												Best MMO I've played in many years...I was so tired of the classic elves-dwarfs-orcs styled MMOs, all medieval and fairies everywhere... Now i can play in the cold technologic modern world, where secret societies run everything. It's just perfect.And the quests aren't just ""go talk to that guy, skip the dialog and go back to get your reward"".Here you actually need to do research and pay attention to details and conversations.The only thing i don't like is to have a voiceless character, i never liked that from any game.And again, unlike other MMOs here you need a real strategy to defeat different bosses or even some mobs, it's not just go target and click some skill buttons.100% recommended if you like this kind of games.

												i wanted this game, and bought it, because i'm a big mmorpg person. i didn't do much research before buying it on sale.this game has horror elements. one of the main missions required me to walk through a very poorly lit parkade, where i would sometimes be pulled to the side and attacked by pitch-black, disfigured mutants. at the end i had to defeat a monster that looked like a large, muscular, quadrupedal, vampire arnold (from hey, arnold) that also spawned in an area without light. let's just say it was ♥♥♥♥ing creepy, okay?for the first few areas of the game, i made sure to frequently empty my bladder to avoid any unwanted disruptions.i love the skill system. this isn't a game like world of warcraft where you pick your class and you're stuck with only three ways to play your character until you decide to reroll - it is completely possible to max out all skills and abilities in every section of the skill wheel. you can only have two weapons equipped at a time (not counting your auxiliary), and you have seven (plus one for auxiliary) active and passive ability slots.the combat is very good for a tab-targeting game. from very early levels, they teach you to watch your positioning and surroundings, and that is carried throughout the rest of the game. nearly every boss has mechanics that require you to pay attention to the fight and be aware to what they will do, and some mistakes could mean you sit out for the rest of the boss. there is very little room for error, especially if you lack self-heal or healing abilities.overall, i'm enjoying my experience so far. this game has a lot of small things that games i previously played had not offered me. i do not know what endgame consists of, but i would like to try to fill out my entire skill wheel before quitting.

												The Secret World breaks many standard MMO rules.  There are no levels or classes, armor items are divorced from cosmetic items, players can respec their powers on the fly, and almost all quests can be repeated.  These changes work in the game's favor, creating a game that rewards persistant players who can take the time to learn its more esoteric systems.  The world building is fantastic, and I enjoy exploring the game's creepy locations while tweaking my character to create the perfect warrior to stand against the forces of darkness.			"

												Having been playing since before its official release, I gotta say this game is a keeper. Intriguing story, plenty of stuff to do, plenty of things to see, and I personally find the combat refreshing for an MMO. Dungeons are there to grind if that's your thing, although the elitism can be annoying at times (don't be a 1970 please--use your keyboard). Honestly the main story and multiple side stories which all tie together are what really make this game wonderful. Everything is rooted in real life legends, mysteries, places, stories, and intrigues. There's TONS of lore to peruse through and investigation missions, while often being really frustrating to figure out, are also very interesting in terms of their topics and references. Animations and clothing selection could use a bit of work but at least the number of mission bugs has decreased a lot (LOL when this game first released). I also wish the main story mission was repeatable but alas, perhaps someday. In addition, I wish holiday events were laid out more simply and were not so heavily based on big team activities, BUT then again this is an MMO, and one based on the hidden ""secret world"" to boot. It should be noted that this game is fairly graphics intensive-expect it to be necessary to lower graphics for large groups and dungeons.Overall, this game lives in the spaces between genres in more ways than one and that's what makes it the memorable experience that it is.

												-----------------------------------------Battle Cthulhu, reclaim Hell, explore an abandoned amusement park, investigate the mysterious Orochi Group, haunted mansions, Indian legends, ancient cities, condemned laboratories, child experiments, buzzing bees, the growing Filth, mad scientists, soviet slaughterhouses, and all things occult. Come on in.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------State of the MMO:A niche game with a small but dedicated fan base. New content is still being added. I wouldn't worry that you are buying an MMO at the end of it's life.-----------------------------------------There are great adventure zones:Kingsmouth, where a mysterious fog has rolled in and brought its share of zombies.Egypt, where a group of cultists are working to revive a dead god.Transylvania, where ghouls and spectors outnumber townsfolk, and old soviet experiments have created deadly vampires.Tokyo, soon to be released.-----------------------------------------Skill System/Theorycrafting:There are nine weapons, from which you can use any two at a time. Each weapon focuses on two possible roles, like healing/tanking/dps/support. There are over 500 unique skills in total, and the forums are always buzzing about the optimal builds for each role. No weapons are really that underpowered, and each works well depending on the situation. Gear can get rather complicated at high levels. People who like min-maxing will have a blast. If you don't, tons of people will be happy to give you tips.-----------------------------------------Missions:Some of the best I have ever played. There are ""investigation"" missions where you must crack codes, solve mysteries, and investigate the occult. A lot of these bring back a pen and paper adventure game feel, but can easily be avoided if not your cup of tea. Most missions are on a 1-2 day cooldown, after which you can do them again if you like.-----------------------------------------PvP:I actually can't recommend this. There are some that really love it, but I would not say this is one of the games stronger points. -----------------------------------------The Community: This game has the best community I've ever seen. It's a more mature demographic than you might find on the average WoW server. It's easy to find a guild to group/raid with, and even at low levels there are tons of people eager to help. There is even a player made, in-game channel called the Sanctuary, devoted to helping newcomers.-----------------------------------------Cash Shop:There is a cash shop, but 90% of it consists of vanity items/exp boosts. There is nothing in it that could really be seen as pay-to-win. As the game is no longer on a pay-to-play, new content is a one time purchase in the cash shop. Again,  they are not strictly necessary, but I've enjoyed each one enough that I would buy it again. If the massive edition is on sale you might want to get that, as it will save you around $20 at a later date.----------------------------------------------Overall I would highly recommend it.			"

												The Secret World is a game I was tempted to play when it was released in 2012, but because it was most likely yet another MMO condemned to fail I just never bothered. The Steam sale reminded me of its existence and the removal of the subscription requirement gave me a reason to try it out. Yes, it's barely alive and (thus) not much of a MMO but the Secret World still manages to be surprisingly entertaining nonetheless. It may have been different before, but I'm very well able to play the game without even sharing a minute with another player. I even surprised myself with a feeling of rather irritation than excitement when I see another player, who is most likely going after 'my' quest mobs or about to spoil a future quest event. The only thing you might miss when playing on your own are the few dungeons the game has, but the solo-instances make up for them.Which brings me to the strongest point of the Secret World: the quests are captivating. Not just because of the dark (sometimes twisted) stories they have to tell, but also the refreshing gameplay. Most quests involve in-game cinematics and the occasional text (item) is often displayed to you in a very creative and attractive way. Yes, you're still more often than not killing # of these things and gather # of those items. But it rarely feels like a grind; as the mobs and the environment are stunningly original and demand your full attention: Traps are where you least expect them and the mobs are often well camouflaged. A step in the wrong direction often results in death due to a 'double pull'. The occasional 'research quest' are incredibly well done and connects the game with the real world in a fantastic way. Though people with a proper brain will still find some of them extremely challenging. Veterans might beg to differ, but the game is hard so far. As a newbie you're thrown into the deep after struggling with poor tutorials and a 'help'-system that seems to be half finished; on some meaningless subjects you're bored with a video, while some of the essential subjects consist of one empty sentence. While the game pretends like it doesn't matter what kind of weapon (spec) you pick, you will notice soon enough that without any strong healing abilities you'll end up dead quite often, as the healing abilities of some weapons simply aren't good enough. After I realized this and adopted 'Blood Magic'-healing, the game feels more doable. ConclusionThe relatively hard (combat gameplay and learning) difficulty and 'subscribe-to-play' competition were probably the main reasons this game wasn't succesful as an MMO. Yet the Secret World is captivating, rewarding and original in its genre. I sincerely recommend you to give it a go when you're into challenging games with good stories to tell.			"

												One of the few mmos that I can get into without a group of friends to play with. I'd say this one is truly original when compared to the WOW style mmos that are all too common. Pros No levels, just gear (enchanted belts, rings, bracelets, etc)Freedom to switch it up as often as you like (weapons,passives,actives) Clothing is completely aesthetic, wear whatever looks goodIt's pretty solid in the gameplay department as well. You can equp two different weapons and alternate their abilities to create unique combinations, and the game helps you out by giving you templates (""decks"") that give you a path to take toward an effective weapon combination.ConsWarning/spoiler:Story is complete gibberish, and most of the voice acting is sub-par. At no point does the main storyline even begin to make sense, so just roll with it. (lol)Overall, I think this is a great game that is worth maybe 30 dollars for everything that it offers. (Get it on sale, if at all) 8/10 at current sale price5/10 at full price "

												The most interesting mmorpg I have ever played. Here's a few reasons why I think so:Quests: They require some skills and/or a little thinking to complete. You will never want to skip any new cinematic, besides you might want to watch them again.Dungeons: They require a good amount of teamwork (ALL THE TIME!) to survive and help survive. The atmosphere for each dungeon is unique and you need to share tactics to survive some fights.PvP: There are 3 different PvP zones with quite different goals to compete;  and there  are 3 factions competing which makes player versus player fights more tactical than many other games. Role Playing: Dude! That's the best thing in this game. Players are always friendly and easy to communicate that it makes role playing easier to take place. Costumes are great. There is no other game which allows you to buy (with or without spending real money) soooo many costumes. TWS also has events such as costume contests.  Most of the similar games pay the least attention on allowing people to customize their characters' looks. In TSW you can customize your outfit the way you like and not only female players love it!!!			"

												TSW is an action adventure game with MMORPG mechanics (combat, PvP, group content). The writing and art design are all excellent - enough to warrant a satisfying single player experience! If you're a fan of Gaiman, Lovecraft or King - you'll love the setting. Horror is a main theme here and there are many ""nope"" moments.I've been playing this game since early access and the story/setting still messes up my head big time. It slowly builds from mysterious text messages, words hastily written on torn-out pages, whispers from the faucet. To get a glimpse of what's happening, you have to piece it from lore entries, dialogues, small hints in dialogues or hacked emails.The production value is very high. Most quests have fully voiced cutscenes and there's a lot of unique art assets - all items you investigate have their own art work (cell phones, books, notes etc.). This is one of the most challenging MMOs I've played - both quests and combat require thought and skill. Investigation missions are hard, but even the basic missions require some investigating (in most cases you actually have to figure out where to go). Many quests play like an adventure game - you have to hack computers, combine items, finding hidden objects, solve environmental. Combat requires a lot of movement and the limit on active/passive skills requires a good setup.The game goes very cheap on sales and the basic purchase gives you full access to PvP, dungeons and raids. Subscription is totally optional and just gives you a small xp boost, points to spend in shop and a vanity item. There are paid mission packs released every few months and some of them are good to have for high-end gaming. The game shop is mostly xp boosting and clothing - there are ""magic boxes"", but it's nothing major (everything you get from them can be obtained by normal means).BRAINBONER 428/10			"

												If you want a game that mixes thought provoking puzzles, a classless system, complex-as-you-want ability system as well as traditional MMORPG elements ... TSW is fabulous.  The graphics are very nice (intel i5 w/ Geforce GTX 670 4GB and 16 GB RAM runs ~60 fps).  The investigative missions can be VERY hard (for example, need to know or study Morse Code for one particular mission).  No other game I know of has a built in Web Browser just so you can look up which composer wrote a particular song so you can hack a password ingame.  FunCom is not trying to nickel and dime you but does offer boosts and vanity items in the online store.  Catch it on sale for 15 bucks you will be completely tickled.  Pay full price and you will not regret it.  You'll easily get your money out of this one even before you leave the first real zone.If you are not interested in having to think through problems and want everything handed to you ... THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.  You do not have to do investigative missions at all, but they really do help set this one apart from everything else.On the bad side ... my only complaint is some of the monsters' models looks overdone.  Someone tried way to hard to give lots of detail and really only succeeded in a mess.  But they are monsters, so they shouldn't be pretty.			"

												This game is pretty damn good if I say so myself. The storyline is unique in a sense that it combines modern day cities and areas with ancient myths, giving it a farmiliar feel but also a very foreign vibe to the environments. The characters are completely customizable, both in the way they look and how there is no specific class system. The community is very helpful with different problems as long as you just ask, and overall it is a fun and addictive experience. The only complaints I have on this game is that the graphics seem outdated by a couple of years or so, and it is hard. And I mean HARD. Because of the way the game is built, there is no leveling however your character recieves skill points to level up different skills and items, most of which would keep you alive in higher skilled areas. I found it hard to just go in alone and do my own thing, and the community is smaller than a standard MMO so it usually is just solo questing. Of course, once skills and quality gear is found, the game progresses rapidly and you'll be in transylvania and egypt in no time. There isn't much of a learning curve, although it takes some experimenting to find out your own playstyle, as there is no class or leveling system. All in all, a buy to play game with no subscription fee is well worth the money, and in the case of the Secret World, is worth every penny. 9/10			"

												Excellent storytelling and a break from the fantasy and sci-fi mold make this game engrossing. The ability to level up all the different weapons and skills on a character and swap between different sets of them at will means you never have to reroll or level an alt or find someone that can fit the role you need. At 100+ hours I've still got lots to explore. Well worth the price.			"

												Very unique spin on classic MMO tropes; the investigation missions are very detailed and require such varied skills as breaking morse code audio, crytpography, and attention to small details within the game world. I also like the skill system; there are no levels just experience points to spend and if you dedicate enough time you can max out every available power in the game. Very enjoyable, especially with groups of friends.			"

I've played lots of MMO's and TSW definitely thinks outside of the box, the story is immersive and really draws you in.If you want the same old MMO go and play WoW,  If you want a grown up MMO and have to think for a change, TSW is the game for you.

												A decent game with some unusual elements for a semi-action MMO. However, it seems that at one point during its development, the project suffered a few major hits (budget, staffing, production, etc) and to be brutally honest, I don't think this title ever really recovered. What went live was not what this game had the potential to be.I'm not going to ramble about specifics. The UI is a bit dodgy, the gameplay is middle of the road for semi-action MMOs, the writing is reasonable, the in-game instructions on how to play it are not, and if you don't have at least a moderate graphics processor, you're going to struggle with some of this game. Beyond that, all I'm going to say is THIS GAME IS NOT SCARY. It's more of a conspiracy theory MMO than anything else, regardless of what the first zone might be attempting. Oh, and... expect puzzles which involve knowledge you probably don't have.I'm going to recommend this game with a caveat: play it for free for a while, at least until you hit the content pay wall. Keep an open mind about it - you may find the design differences refreshing. If not, well... all you've lost is time.			"

												If you're a fan of horror movies or conspiracy films, this is the game for you. It manages to blend The Mummy, The X-files, Friday the 13th, and a bunch of other franchies into one perfectly.However, game play can be a bit repetitive. While this game does feature better combat than most MMOs, it will get stale after playing for a prolonged period.But what you're really here for is the story, lore, and the atmosphere, all of which are top notch. Plus, a ton of fun easter eggs and references to horror series.Give this one a chance if you're a horror junky. The game even manages to be quite scary and distrubing at times in its own right.			"

Recommended with CautionThe Secret World is a very artistic game full of varied and immersive content. However, it has its problems and people looking to purchase the game should weigh the pros and cons carefully before investing time and money into the title.ProsStarting out the game is really impressive. The acting and the writing work hand in hand to deliver immersive content early on to the player. You can chose from three factions and each has a different flavor. Missions are varied and don't come off like the typical set of chores ala ""Go to Farmer Fred's fields, kill 10 vermin in the fields, bring 10 vermin tails  back to Farmer Fred for reward.""Any grind is well hidden in the game world which is expertly crafted from the outset. It makes most of TSW highly replayable.Other plusses include the helpful community of users and the excellent response time of their customer service staff. When you run into trouble GMs will respond quickly and efficiently to your troubles.This is where TSW shines and it can't be emphasized enough - it makes the game unique and special. It almost makes its many cons forgivable.ConsThe game has a limited shelf life. You can do their lovely missions over and over and enjoy dungeons and two small raids and mini raids called lairs. However, their later end content lacks the polish that their first few zones have.As a composition, TSW begins to fall apart at end content. It comes off poorly coded and rife with bugs and very low in actual story content. Issue 8 and Issue 9 are blatantly grindy and are lacking in much story content. In issue 9's case the story is there, but there's little of it. It feels more like a beta than anything that should be ready for prime time.High end dungeons for end content players have many mechanical bugs as bosses will glitch and run off the field of battle and reset themselves. As a MMO it fails in encouraging cooperation. Their loot system is antiquated and follows a Need or Greed model rather than some of the more party friendly games like Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar. This doesn't pose a particular problem in the early parts of the game, but in end content where the game degenerates into a grindfest, it can be an excrutiating experience. For example, in issue 8 you can grind bosses and they can drop junk or uncommons. Other problems include a dated engine and poor graphics optimization so there are a lot of glitches, frame rate drops, and lag on even higher end computers which are well above the minimum requirements to play the game. Other ThoughtsFuncom went through some layoffs in the recent past and that has impacted the TSW team heavily. They are slow to put out content and the new content that is being delivered just doesn't have the polish as earlier content.It's blatant that they are cutting corners and delivering substandard content. Anything after Transylvania should be viewed with caution.Pre Issue 8 and 9 had its quirks. Like they couldn't afford to give you choice in the story or even hire a voice actor for your character so you get to play a mute. Or the writers were stuck on how to advance a story and so they have your character constantly derp their way through the storylines. The amount of times your character is punked is mildy amusing at first and then just gets blatantly annoying. More blatant signs start in Issues 6 and 7 where they couldn't manage to put females in the budget and used the generic male story line for females including resources in their cut scenes like male walking animations and story choices. So if you're playing a female or if you are a female player, you're not important enough to put in the budget. You get to move around and respond to story content as if you were male.ConclusionI'd recommend the game for its early missions. There's enough early content in the game that would keep a player and their friends busy for a good many hours and allow for a lot of cooperative fun. If you're an end content player, I'd suggest finding another title because this one just doesn't have what you're looking for.			"

Dark Demons Cry GaiaAs someone who generally avoids MMOs, The Secret World hooked me fairly easily with its modern-day urban fantasy setting and Deus Ex-like approach to conspiracy lore. In presentation alone it’s a huge breath of fresh air.The game is “buy to play,” requiring an initial purchase with further subscription being optional. The benefits to a subscription are loyalty rewards for time subscribed ranging from unique pets to clothing items, an XP boost, a 10% discount in the item store, and, most notably, ten dollars worth of currency for said item store. The store itself is home to a great deal of items, but they can ultimately be placed into two categories: Cosmetic and Boosts; even the mystery Loot Crates only provide semi-randomized bonuses that fall into the second category. Paying real money for anything that affects gameplay is really only buying an accelerator for one kind of progression or another, and progression is nowhere near slow enough to make the player feel shoehorned into spending money if they don’t want to. In fact, it’s probably far more likely you’ll find a pair of pants you really want for your character in the item store than a boost you can’t live without.Being effective in combat is more about planning out builds and skill rotation than spamming abilities; players have a fairly limited number of active abilities at any given time, split between any combination of two weapon classes. Some combinations are, of course, better than others, but most weapons have something to offer any given role. The MMO “holy trinity” is present in any activity requiring a group, but because the game is classless and every player eventually learns every skill, there is significant wiggle room. One (in)famous dungeon is often done with a self-healing tank, for example, while the group’s healer switches over to dedicated damage-dealing. Another dungeon usually sees the damage-dealers also playing support roles to help the healer deal with the bosses’ tendency to spam damage-over-time effects.Aside from things specifically meant for groups, the main meat of the game can be experienced from start to finish by a solo player, although this severely limits play options; a soloist will have to be able to survive on their own, requiring some form of healing or tanking ability, usually the former. Co-op’ing the story and sidequests with even a single friend can result in a much more diversified experience with players able to pick and choose roles, but the capability of solo play allows players who wouldn’t normally be interested in a social experience to treat the game like a normal RPG with drop in/drop out co-op. While endgame dungeon grinds can’t be done solo by any means, the entire story can be played through without ever touching the endgame grind. A player uninterested in making the numbers on their gear go up will not find themselves hindered in advancing the plot.The story itself puts most single-player RPGs to shame. NPCs are lovingly voice-acted and animated, reflected in the game’s 40GB install size. Moreover, they are written as interesting people and do not lose the player to apathy while waiting for them to just say what item they need five of brought to them. Mechanics like player resurrection don’t just have lampshades hung on them, but are actually important to the setting; being dead and looking for something of interest on the other side is required for solving more than one quest. The actual plot twists and turns around the game’s various locations, avoiding frustration by giving the player character actual progress in solving the various mysteries before bringing up new ones. There is a lot of story to go through; sidequests often provide relevant information, if not easy access to the in-game codex, giving a reason to do them beyond the XP reward. Unfortunately, the plot does not vary greatly between the different factions; the different NPCs one must deal with provide greater variety between them than the faction specific missions, although a point in those missions’ favor is that they are each actually the same mission as seen differently by each organization. Still, at no point did I find myself not caring what happens next, and not just for the main plot. The player is actively encouraged to wander around Elder Scrolls style (though the game world is nowhere near as large as that comparison may imply, unfortunately,) exploring everything. Many quests are found in the wild instead of being given by NPC questgivers, and almost every quest involves exploring the setting in some way, even if it’s only fighting back a nasty overgrowth of the local eldritch horror.Quests are built with the setting in mind. An entire subset of quests is labeled as “Investigation,” and the game is not kidding. These often require serious thought and observation of details, a far cry from the usual MMO fetch quest. The fact that your character is given a high-end smartphone in the beginning is not just for flavor, as you will often use the in-game web browser to check information from company websites and blogs, or, if you’re very poor at puzzle solving like I am, to google the solution. There is absolutely no shame in giving up on a quest or three in this game. While the investigation missions may be unforgiving, they are rarely illogical and progress naturally; finishing one without cheating feels like one has made a genuine triumph instead of feeling like one has worked around obtuse design.If anything is obtuse, it’s not the quest design but, rather, the UI. Why a game that has not one but two quests involving morse code does not come standard with an in-game notepad is beyond me. Fortunately, many of the UI’s shortcomings (including the lack of a notepad) can be solved with third-party plugins. Quests are also not bug-free, but the developers have been very diligent in fixing them since release. They're also very attentive towards the player base; not only do events happen regularly, they last long enough for anyone interested to achieve even the most grindy of goals and once-in-the-game’s-lifetime rewards without playing the game non-stop for a week on end.The game does not have in-depth PvP, but what’s there is functional. Enough people play it that you’ll end up in a queue for the PvP areas more often than not. Starting players will have a stat boost when entering PvP so it can be played at any point in character progression, not just end-game. Effectiveness is entirely based on build, and the game encourages different builds not only for different situations, but for the different activities as well. A standard solo build will be less effective in a dungeon, a standard dungeon build will be less effective in the Scenario activities where each player must have some level of survivability instead of relying purely on the healer. The game makes it relatively easy to manage different builds with an easy menu for saving them and then switching between different ones.The graphics do not disappoint. High settings put a high amount of detail on everything, from paved road to grass to buildings to clothing. The game is fairly scalable but meeting the minimum system requirements are a must, the developers have not been conservative with them. If you choose to roll a Dragon, be prepared for an experience with the uncanny valley in the intro; by and large, however, the game avoids this problem. The writhing Filth lives up to the horror people speak of it with. The baked desert of Egypt is, as it should be, a far cry from soggy, dreary New England.The Secret World brings some much-needed variety into the MMO space, not just for the setting, but for the effort put into quest design that makes accomplishing things both interesting and fulfilling.

												This is without a doubt an interesting take on the MMO genre. Instread of the usual high fantasy route, this game decided to go with a more urban take and set the game in the modern world kept secret to all of us normal people. As your character is basically forced to join into a secret society; either the Illuminati (who are much less competent than you would think), the Templars (Think old guard, less sinester than Assassin's Creed would have you believe) and the Dragon (Far East Triad that does what the Illuminati wishes they were doing). Afterwards you take up your new powers and fight against supernatural horrors arround the world or atleast the Soloman Isles, Egypt, and Transylvania in the base game.Combat is mostly combo points to anyone familiar with WoW or Diablo, Firearms attach them to your enemies, magic has your character hold the points, and melee changes it up and works like a 5 point energy that restores over time. It doesn't take much to get use to.Quests come mostly in two favors, your 20 bear asses collect or kill quests and investigation missions. Investigation has you searching areas, solving puzzles, learning passwords that often require real world research to find. The game has an in game internet browser for this reason. Yes, investigation missions give more experence than almost anything else (that anything else being the main story).Overall this MMO is intresting, but I can only recomend it if you can find it on sale. I will also note that this is only for the base game. You will be paying more money if you want more content outside of the base game.			"

												Great game.  Many reviews call it one of the most underrated games out there and I have to call that pretty accurate.  MMO in a modern environment with all kinds of fun twists.  The game has a great mix of zombies, cultists, conspiracy theory, and other crazy subjects that just fit well.  It keeps some of the favorite MMO conventions like tank, healer, dps roles---but at the same time, breaks away with a fairly complex skill system.  The game is overwhelming and pretty hard at times and always a bit strange--but very few games have captured me like TSW.  The quests are actually interesting and varied.  The cut-scenes remind me of GTA a bit in style and do a good job of drawing you in without being too long winded.			"

												People may be put off by the big price tag, but its definatly worth the money you pay for it! The controls at first seem a bit hard to use, but after playing it for a few hours (which you will have no trouble doing so) you will get used to the controls and start to actually enjoy them! The game is huge. Ive only played for about 40 hours, over 2 different characters, and Im still in the first issue/expansion pack! The community in TSW is great. You will end up doing quests with a few randomers if you are doing the same quest, which is an experience you wont get in something like WoW. This is a great MMO with a subscription like experience, with a pay once, play forever price tag! Great MMO and I recommend it to anyone interested in MMO's, but is put off by the subsription based games.			"

												Something about The Secret World immediately makes me paranoid in the best of ways.It doesn't play like a cookie-cutter WoW clone, which I think is a very good thing. It's VERY story heavy, and the story is fiendishly engaging. A lot of the quests have fully voiced cutscenes which involve the NPCs giving you hints for what you should do. The quests are highly intuitive and unique and are, in my opinion, a fantastic study in how to break the 'Kill X monsters' or 'Find Y items' monotony of many MMOs. Prepare to use your brain because these quests actually require you to think. Pressing B in-game brings up an internet browser which they fully expect you to use to google things. One quest wanted me to spell out a specific word from a specific verse in a Latin translation of the Bible. Another had me go to a fake company's website to look up how to repair one of their radio dishes and then sent me a location in Morose Code. I haven't even covered a fraction of the content, but I'm excited to see what else they have for me.The game isn't perfect by any means, but it's still really cool. The setting and the world they put together is my all-time favorite type of setting, so I admit I'm biased on that but even so it's really well done and very coherent. I'll try and wrap this up without repeating things now:Pros:Super awesome atmosphere, interesting story line, really unique and memorable quests, gear and clothing are different things so you can dress however you'd like, go clothes shopping in London, punch some zombies, really flexible skill system which can and should be changed up as needed, most things can be completed solo if approached intelligently, it actually treats me as if I can think instead of blindly pushing me from quest hub to quest hub, you can phone in completed quests so you don't have to run back to the quest giver, look for quest clues while you're a ghost, there's a skinwalker type dude who can sell you GIANT STACKS OF TACOS in London. Don't want to use tacos instead of traditional health potions? That's cool too because you can break the tacos into giant stacks of nachos for quicker snacks.Cons:Skill system can be intimidating at first, the minimum specs are kind of high and it doesn't really play well if they aren't met, quests, especially investigation type quests, can get really hard, really fast simply because it's expecting me to do things I'm not trained to do in a game. One quest dealt with a ghost and I didn't know what to do because it turns out I needed to be dead to see the next clue.It's different, but I'd like to see more things like it. There isn't a subscription fee so if you're even curious you should give it a chance. If you're not sure it'll run, ask someone who plays for a referral and try it for 72 hours free.And remember, EVERYTHING. IS. TRUE.			"

												I'm a sucker for mash-up urban fantasy/horror so I am so all over TSW's premise. The game's first (non-tutorial) zone, for example, features using local Native American magic and the favour of the god Thor to help the Illuminati and an expy of Stephen King fight Viking zombies dredged from the deep by Cthulhu-esque horrors, summoned by Loki using Aztec blood magic and the sword Excalibur, as part of a plot to bring about Ragnarok by stabbing a giant black cube-thing which is part of the machinery of Gaia. Things just get weirder from there.The story, cutscenes, characters, and dialogue in this game are, in my opinion, the best in any MMO currently out there, and it's one of the only MMOs I've played through multiple times solely for the story. This is definitely TSW's strength; this, and a particular type of quest the game has, called Investigation Missions, which will... well. There's an in-game browser for a reason, and I sure hope you like looking up Egyptian heiroglyphics and Hebrew plagues on Wikipedia, because you will be.They're the good parts.Unfortunately, then there's the rest of the game. TSW's mechanics are, in my opinion, as terrible as its writing is amazing. Mechnically, it's a tedious, frustrating grind that gives the illusion of choice in character building, but is ultimately so poorly balanced that I really hope you're playing the one spec that's actually useful because otherwise you're going to be spending an awful lot of time in the graveyard. (Slight disclaimer: all of this game's gameplay is built around groups. Though it's possible to solo--and I have--it is exponentially easier to complete with even just one other person along for the ride.) Not to mention that, once the story is over, the gear grind begins and, well. It's a gear grind. I hope you like raiding!There are going to be people who love TSW's mechanics, and more power to them (they're the sorts of people who like to use words such as ""oldschool"" and ""hardcore"" to describe their MMO playing). I'm not one of them. So take the last paragraph with a grain of salt.Mechanics aside, I have a lifetime sub to TSW and I don't regret it... but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, either.			"

Raids are amazing, dungeons are awesome, extensions are great, and there's actually a pretty good RP community, making The Secret World a really damn good MMORPG.The only downside would be the optimisation (those loading times are just horrendous).Buy it, tho.

You can rank up easiliy by replaying earlier missions, which only get easier when you rank up. And with these new points you can start on new weapons and builds if you would like to explore. In the end you will have every weapon in the game and be free to switch at any time.			"

												I no longer enjoy MMOs these days. If you're looking for a good World of Warcraft fix, The Secret World won't help you at all. In the traditional MMO sense it's not that good. There's no feeling of progress in gaining xp and gearing up isn't satisfying so as a Diablo-style loot fishing lottery it's bad. The combat is a lackluster combination of Age of Conan and Guild Wars that feels hollow and has to be included in the game just because MMOs apparently can't exist without constant combat. The skill trees seem bland and honestly I don't see much difference between the fighting styles because they all have generic skills that do some damage. How do you even fire a shotgun in 50 different ways?HOWEVER, all of that can be endured or mostly ignored (combat hasn't been difficult either so far) to enjoy what this game does best, it isn't actually a WoW-style MMO but instead it should be treated as an online adventure game. The very detailed setting areas seem lovingly crafted, the lore is interesting and subtle and the NPCs are actually pretty well written and voice-acted. The world is a hodgepodge of secret societies and X-Files paranormal and Lovecraftian influences combined with just about everything else that fits under horror. If you liked how some of the areas in Age of Conan felt and looked, I think it's based on the same engine. It seems fairly taxing though so weaker rigs might have problems.Here comes the real reason why you should give this game a try: The quests. Sure, there are traditional MMO style quests that have you fedexing items somewhere or following simple map pointers to kill 5 of thing X and return, with cutscenes. These are enjoyable because the well-made maps make it seem like exploring instead of grinding. THEN you run into some of the investigation quests which might be the best content I've witnessed in MMOs. These are quests that don't have any easy pointers at all, only vague and cryptic clues. They're like Alternate Reality Game things where you must use google and wikipedia to decipher all the puzzles, they can't be solved just within the game (well, the game actually has a built-in web browser). Don't be tempted to go straight for the spoilery walkthroughs but try to solve things yourself! I don't think I've felt so clever in ages when I managed to crack a devious puzzle involving medieval lute music and googled actual score sheets.So, have you ever made that mistake in an MMO where you realize that a particular puzzle has to do with entries in the bible, so you look it up and fail to see how it all fits, only later on realizing you should've checked wikipedia based on another clue so you'd realize you had to look up the passage in the original latin translation? Other MMOs have done the Indiana Jones action side but this game does the library research/puzzle cracking side.I've played this thing solo just because I think it works nicely as an atmospheric single player roleplaying/adventure game where you sometimes bump into other players, I have no idea what the group instances are like. If they're like the usual raid combat stuff I'll happily ignore them because I'll focus on the content that makes me feel like a X-Files librarian instead of the usual warrior puppet flailing around to the beat of bosses.Oh, and because it doesn't require a subscription I don't need to handle it like a job that has a clock ticking ""play me now or you don't get your money's worth!"" Grab it on sale and you're set. Perhaps you'll even enjoy the combat side, but I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this game anyway.			"

												Imagin if patrick stewart played han solo in star wars... well this game is nothing like that! Despite this, TSW is a really smart game, I had to learn latin, morse code, cryptic roman cyphers, musical notes and scales, binary code, advanced mathmatics, oh, and i ended up buying a book the game recommended!! Which helped me solve a puzzle! ""I ♥♥♥♥IN LOVE PUZZLES MAN!!"" After playing 200+ hours when describing this game I often refer to that movie inception. Have you seen that movie inception? Well, if you have; imagin that movie if decaprio had won an oscar! YEAH! INTESE RIGHT?! Now add Dr.Who and all his adventures with a dash of tactical situations imploring solid snake-like stealth and you got this game! Oh yeah, indiana jones is in this, there's also the lost arc, dracula, Rosamund Pike, and theres even a belmont achievment! The feeling you get after unearthing so many artifacts and solving so many mysteries is.. well take a moment to imagin the life of laura crofts sports bra... Yeah, feels that good!

												I have never played such a facinating, intense, clever single/multiplayer MMO ever and I have played a few! This game allows you to take many paths such as a main line quest to find the achient truths behind the whole back story of the game.  With three different factions and their own point of views on all the quests you will want to replay it at least 3 times! If history and future dont take your fancy enjoy many of the millions of side quests, each mission unique and significant. Level you character up to be who you want to be! You want to throw blood at an enemy fine! You want to be a swordsman go ahead, what's that you want to bludgeon people with a hammer sure! The game has so many possibilities from missions, to boss/dungeon fights or simply collecting history and enemy bites called Lores. Play on you own, with a friend or a group! This game IS what YOU want it to be.			"

												TL;DR: Used to be great, now it's dead. I want to play, I want to love it, but can't.I used to play this game a lot. Sometimes I'd take a break of a couple of months, only to come back when the urge to dive in gets too great. I've got 9 characters all kitted out for end-game. But now, there is nothing to get back to. There is still only the old end-game content to repeat, which is just too easy now with the current end-game gear. The only hard part of the end-game is to find a group to play it with. There are hardly any players around to group up with. Community initiatives like Noobmares or Sanctuary also no longer function as a good place to find a group. There simply aren't the players for it. It's still a great game for it's solo content. DLC Issue 8 (?) has the scenario's, which is solo end-game route to take. Instanced 30 minute sessions of hard content, which require you to tweak your weapon setup to reliably complete it succesfully. However, with 3 scenarios at 3 different difficulty levels, it gets old.And that's the thing with this game. It gets old. There is no new content. The last big release of content was Tokyo, where Season 1 of the main story line has been concluded. It was delayed over and over again. It was supposed to include a new playing field to do missions in, dungeons, raids and a lair. However, by the time funcom started releasing it, it was cut up into pieces. The playfield came in 2 seperate DLC issues, with extra missions as purchasable content (now repackaged as DLC issue). The dungeons came in another seperate DLC, the raid in yet another seperate DLC. All to be purchased. Still waiting for the lair. And the promised auxillary weapon. Ok, rant over. Back to reviewing:Pro/con:+ Great atmosphere.+ No fixed classes.+ Enough to do solo.- No new content to speak of since ... forever?- Endgame group content practically dead.- No reason to fine-tune your build anymore, as you can breeze through 99% of the game with ease.

												I tried several times to get into the game, from its publication in 2012 until 2015. The ideas Funcom had were superb, The game's tone is as sinister and mysterious as intended. I can only recommend it for its vibe, and I suggest to everyone who is interested watching the first two hours of the game on Youtube.Where the game falls flat (for me) is the approach to player friendliness, or User Experience, as it is called in the software industry outside of gaming. User Experience is horrendous. Google for ""secret world frustrating"" and you will see what I mean. Many of the quests have you running or clicking around aimlessly, as you cannot find what you are supposed to do, or where you are supposed to do it. TSW's idea of mission design is like giving lego pieces to somone who has never seen any, and tell them ""Play!"".They follow the same route with the brilliant idea how a character's skills are built, then leaving the player completely in the dark how to do it efficiently, so that you can actually play the game. The forums do not help either, as the majority of good advice is from players who left in 2012 and 2013. With the game's changes since then, their advice no longer works, and trying to understand what experienced players talk about is like reading a foreign language without a dictionary.Some players claim that the game is the Thinking Man's MMO. They are entitled to their opinion. I view it as the Unfinished MMO that would have needed another two years of design and development, and with that it could have been a great title.I am utterly disappointed, as the game could have been so much more.

												The Secret World is in my opinion the best story driven mmo that people do not play, not that it doesn't have a healthy population it does but it should be bigger.So the good parts if you like a story driven quest that are dripping with tension and build up the atmosphere like a good psychological horror film then this game is a good place for you.  They also do the slasher horror style too if that is your thing.  They have traditional quests with way points that lead you around while telling a story but they also have investigation missions which are a different beast altogether.  These are like a mini detective novel where you will have to research on the internet (no not for the walk through, play the game properly, grrrr).  For instance one required me to translate Romanian another take down and decode morse code .  They really make you think and will tax your brain cells assuming you do them properly without any cheating.So stories good, it also looks pretty decent as well graphics wise and the audio does its job of building up atmosphere too (like it does in a good film).Right the not so good (not bad just not good either).  The combat is clunky and will take some getting used to.  There is active dodging, telegraphs from mobs to avoid and that can get a little hectic.  The skill system has so many aspect to it  that it can be a very confusing thing to get a grasp of when you start. Its quite possible to make the game harder for yourself than it needs to be if you are not careful with your build (there are a ton of guides to give you the basics that will help you get a good start though so don't worry too much about that).So yes a flawed diamond of an mmo and if you can put up with the odd bits then you will find a really great, deep and atmospheric mmo that no other has been able to match so far.

												While it certainly is a MMORPG, it doesn't play like one, in a good way. Most of the early content is solo-able, and the mood and atmosphere involved is certainly better than most MMOs I've played. The first unique thing about The Secret World (TSW) is its setting. Unlike the other MMOs out there that are either sci-fi or fantasy, TSW is set in mondern times, though there are certainly fantasy elements (magic). The setting reminds me a lot of Vampire: Masquerade - Bloodlines. Slight horror elements with a lot of Dan Brown/Lovecraft influences. The writing is rich, and my favorite thing about TSW has to be its quests. In addition to your typical fetch quests, TSW has investigation quests. True to its name, you really have to investigate, solving riddles along the way. For instance, one quest's puzzle required looking up a certain bible passage while another needed you to translate a phrase into Latin. Being able to solve these investigation quests without any online walkthrough help, even non-spoiler ones that drop hints, is a rewarding achievement all on its own. The biggest concern about TSW is its combat. It is similar to Guild Wars 1: 7 active and 7 passive skills that you choose from your repertoire, and the targeting system is quite similar to GW1 as well, though a little bit more clunky. For instance, while in GW1 using a skill automatically turns your character to face your target, here, if you're midcasting a skill and you break line of sight with the target, the skill is interrupted, so turning the camera is needed against agile enemies while hitting the skill hotkeys. Anyway, if you're a fan of any of the following: good writing, Lovecraft, Dan Brown, GW1, and Vampire: Masquerade - Bloodlines, then I strongly recommend this gem.  "

												Probably the best ""Pay once Play Forever"" MMO out there. Investigation quests are one of the things that makes this game so damn unique! Along with it's horror and occult theme, how cool is that?Definitely worth picking this game up!			"

												A fun modern MMORPG. The deck progression system is very unique and surprisingly deep. TSW has an interesting story presented like in no other MMO I have ever seen, with several strange and seedy characters to meet along the way. I cannot speak for the PVP aspects of this game, but the PVE side has been a blast so far. My one advice would be not to cheat on the investigation missions, as they are a truly unique experience that you shouldn't miss.			"

												Not an MMO fan at all. Most are boring and repetitive; taking place in only a mock environment of the one before it. And if you're into that then rock on. But for those like me who have a hard time with them, this is not the case with TSW. The world is modern and imaginative and you get to fight the ravenous monsters of the supernatural realm. The leveling system is unique and allows you to customize your character to be any type you want. I actually compare it to the sphere grid in FFX to a point. The locations are based off of real geographical locations from our world, as well as containing lore and beasts straight out of supernatural mythology. I've put 40 hours in the last 4 days (Partly because I had a lull in school and work). This game is awesome. Worth the price. Worth the boring tutorials in the beginning. All of that.			"

I don't ""lose"" the storyline during gameplay and I don't feel like I'm helping npc's out with household chores that they could do on their own.- Unique missions/quests. Sabotage, investigation, puzzles... All done well and some you even need to use outside resources or knowledge. (I love thinking puzzles though.)If combat gameplay and PvP are your game #1s though, I'd suggest getting trial time or on sale. It's not bad, but it's not for everyone.			"

												Stands out to me as one of the few MMOs out there these days that are worth playing for several reasons:1. No monthly fee, great for someone like me who hates the guilt of paying money for something you can't play every day.2. Real freedom in how you build and setup your character, with zero lock-in. While you can follow guides for decent setups, you don't have to in order to be a ""good player"". You can change your character or start pursing a different setup at any time, without being forced to spend in-game or real money to ""refund"" points or anything. You can even re-do missions to get the rewards again, so if you've spent your points in a way you wish you didn't, it's just a short time before you can do the mission again.3. A smart, fun, non-WoW-like mission system with actual interesting and compelling stories. Additionally many missions require actual thought and paying attention and in some cases puzzle-solving (or at the very least, if you're lazy, googling the answer).4. A rare real-world modern fantasy setting rather than generic elf/orc world #706a5. Updates that actually address player issues like UI improvements and upgrades, not only tiny bugfixes and difficulty-lowering tweaks that keep subscription money flowing.6. An achievement for eating enough tacosAnd much more. I was burned out on MMOs completely till I tried this and I have enjoyed it immensely. If you're looking for something new and interesting, I highly recommend The Secret World.			"

												I gave this game a thumbs up, but do realise it is an aquired taste. The strong point of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Compared to other MMO's it beats them by a mile (storywise). However compared to strictly story driven (stand alone) games, it is not all that good. I often wondered if this game would have been better as a stand alone. There are a lot of cutscenes, which are usually nicely done. The quality of the main storyline did suprise me as it flutters around and some side missions are actually better than the main storyline.The combat is rather rather dull and hp of many mobs increases faster than your dps. Combined with the story driven missions it makes the game feel rather slow. This does not have to be a bad thing mind you, but when indoctrinated by WoW or the like you will really have to get used to this game. The game can be quite unforgiving at times, which at certain points is a nice challenge, and at other times quite silly (making you want to read the mission guides in advance). Bringing a friend does help quite a lot (but be aware some parts of missions have to be done solo in mini instances).PVP is aweful at the moment. Players are ""balanced"" but not quite to the level of other QL10.5 types. Most areas are static most of the time, being at the mercy of the faction with the most players. On the flip side, it allowed me to read a good book while picking up points for epics, jumping in (and dying painfully) when we got attacked. All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere in the game and running around trying to find out what happened. I picked the game up on steam with a discount and I think it was worth the money. Though, as you noticed, I think it could have been a lot better. I have not played endgame content (raids), nor do I think I will. The replayablility does not seem that high to me, once you have seen a story, you will want to go to the next (even though they are repeatable).Ps. the game seems to be optimized very badly, at least for 32bit systems. I actually had to tweak my memory to make it run (I wish I could say smoothly). I ran it without steam, hence the low hour count.			"

												The best mmo game I've ever played. It has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyone seems so adequate I want to got acquainted with every single person, also it has some quests which are actually quests. Im talking about puzzles, not about ""slain 10 boars"" quests. The first game I read every single story, main, puzzle or dungeon quest (additional quests dont contain any interesting information), because there is always an interesting story. Every single dungeon has its own tactics and you surely won't beat a single boss if you dont know how to move or what to press. Also it has very wide world with an atmosphere of a post-appocalypse, I wanted to make some screenshots to show that, but I always forget to press F12 when I see a great view, because I am always too excited about it. This game also contains a lot of easter eggs, such as Jack' O Lantern, Overlook motel and MiB (the three I saw for myself, maybe there were more but I didnt notice). Also it has pretty good character customization. By the way, unlike other mmo games this one has cosmetic clothes: usual dress you chose at start and then change in shops using in-game currency, called Pax Ramona; and items which gime you bonuses such as health, hit rating etc (called talismans. Chaning it wont apply any visual changes to your character). The game has 3 alliances to chose from and has no classes. Thats because you are free to chose any 2 weapons you like and make up your own kind of class, using 7 active  and 7 passive skills. The game has very interesting and as for me hard craft system, so you can make your own equipment like weapons, talismans and even energy drinks (some kind of potions which give you damage absorption or vampiric effect on your attacks, for example). If you need more info about this game, you can ask me, I will be glad to help you.			"

												Really hard for someone like me who doesn't play a lot of MMO's. Has interesting and unique story arcs that form the overall plot, with classless and level-less skills and abilities. Picking a faction only seems to change the faction specific quests and your overall appearance when it comes to costumes.Ties in a lot of real world conspiracies, myths and urban legends so it's not your regular fantasy genre settings and I commend Funcom for that.From early on, it's best to focus on only two weapon types as any more than that will drastically increase the difficulty of the game and the time taken to level up.Graphics are pretty nice, especially the attack effects, lighting/smoke and character models. Cutscenes are mediocre, with lots of out of sync lips when characters are talking but it's tolerable. The network ping is pretty bad from time to time (from Australia) and the minimum latency is around 280ms so feels sluggish even though I'm running at 60fps.Full of helpful players and cabals (clans) that can make it a lot easier for newer players.Lots of customisation and options to tinker with and it's easy enough to add friends or meet up with someone on the same server as you.

												I absolutely love this game. It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales. Fantastic design.The leveling system is thrown out the window in favour of a much more involved (and often revised) system of skill and ability points which are earned as the player hits experience threshholds. Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set. Otherwise, the game plays smoothly. I'd give this game a 8/10. A must buy if you have a group of friends who seem even remotely interested.			"

												I haven't gotten very far, but this is the first MMO that's actually captured my attention for longer than a few weeks. It's a fresh take on the genre with an unconventional leveling and class system, as well as some really interesting quest designs that you don't see in other MMOs. I highly recommend it. Pay only once! No monthly subscription!			"

												Stands out to me as one of the few MMOs out there these days that are worth playing for several reasons:1. No monthly fee, great for someone like me who hates the guilt of paying money for something you can't play every day.2. Real freedom in how you build and setup your character, with zero lock-in. While you can follow guides for decent setups, you don't have to in order to be a ""good player"". You can change your character or start pursing a different setup at any time, without being forced to spend in-game or real money to ""refund"" points or anything. You can even re-do missions to get the rewards again, so if you've spent your points in a way you wish you didn't, it's just a short time before you can do the mission again.3. A smart, fun, non-WoW-like mission system with actual interesting and compelling stories. Additionally many missions require actual thought and paying attention and in some cases puzzle-solving (or at the very least, if you're lazy, googling the answer).4. A rare real-world modern fantasy setting rather than generic elf/orc world #706a5. Updates that actually address player issues like UI improvements and upgrades, not only tiny bugfixes and difficulty-lowering tweaks that keep subscription money flowing.6. An achievement for eating enough tacosAnd much more. I was burned out on MMOs completely till I tried this and I have enjoyed it immensely. If you're looking for something new and interesting, I highly recommend The Secret World.			"

												Not an MMO fan at all. Most are boring and repetitive; taking place in only a mock environment of the one before it. And if you're into that then rock on. But for those like me who have a hard time with them, this is not the case with TSW. The world is modern and imaginative and you get to fight the ravenous monsters of the supernatural realm. The leveling system is unique and allows you to customize your character to be any type you want. I actually compare it to the sphere grid in FFX to a point. The locations are based off of real geographical locations from our world, as well as containing lore and beasts straight out of supernatural mythology. I've put 40 hours in the last 4 days (Partly because I had a lull in school and work). This game is awesome. Worth the price. Worth the boring tutorials in the beginning. All of that.			"

I don't ""lose"" the storyline during gameplay and I don't feel like I'm helping npc's out with household chores that they could do on their own.- Unique missions/quests. Sabotage, investigation, puzzles... All done well and some you even need to use outside resources or knowledge.

While this still will be true with the TSL relaunch, I am hesitant at best with some of the things I am hearing about what is changing. I will be playing it , but I have VERY high expectations, which I hope will be met.For now I will keep my review positive for the sake of optimism. However I sincerely hope the game will not be dumbed down, like so many others have. it was another reason I fell for this game, because of it's difficulty. While I see making a better tutorial system for new players, this does not mean you have to dumb down the game.			"

												Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now. Funcom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the ""AP Injection"" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).I could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.

												This game is great. It is great because it is challenging due to the fact that the quests sometimes involve puzzles or stealth missions, and there are many opportunities to go off the beaten path. This game plays more like a real story from dnd than just some hawked up and spit out mmo by one of the other companies. You should play this game if you like full immersion story lines that allow you to take your own path, and let you choose which quest to do instead of a normal zombie quest one after the other. Also if you like skill trees instead of just boring levels, this is the game for you.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales. Fantastic design.The leveling system is thrown out the window in favour of a much more involved (and often revised) system of skill and ability points which are earned as the player hits experience threshholds. Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set. Otherwise, the game plays smoothly. I'd give this game a 8/10. A must buy if you have a group of friends who seem even remotely interested.			"

												I have never played such a facinating, intense, clever single/multiplayer MMO ever and I have played a few! This game allows you to take many paths such as a main line quest to find the achient truths behind the whole back story of the game.  With three different factions and their own point of views on all the quests you will want to replay it at least 3 times! If history and future dont take your fancy enjoy many of the millions of side quests, each mission unique and significant. Level you character up to be who you want to be! You want to throw blood at an enemy fine! You want to be a swordsman go ahead, what's that you want to bludgeon people with a hammer sure! The game has so many possibilities from missions, to boss/dungeon fights or simply collecting history and enemy bites called Lores. Play on you own, with a friend or a group!

My girlfriend bought it for us to play together, it pisses me off that we can't do much at all together. It feels like they started making a single player game and decided to turn it into an MMO last minute. So, it's a fun and challenging game if you plan to mostly play it alone and I recommend it to those that like to solo and only play in groups for things like dungeons. I don't recommend it for people that want to play through the whole game with friends.			"

At first I didn't rate it much but once you get used to it's quirks it's really very good.I've played most of it on my own, mainly through choice but PUGS don't seem to be that common in PVE compared to say guild wars. Also I've only come across ONE complete idiot so far.			"

												Stands out to me as one of the few MMOs out there these days that are worth playing for several reasons:1. No monthly fee, great for someone like me who hates the guilt of paying money for something you can't play every day.2. Real freedom in how you build and setup your character, with zero lock-in. While you can follow guides for decent setups, you don't have to in order to be a ""good player"". You can change your character or start pursing a different setup at any time, without being forced to spend in-game or real money to ""refund"" points or anything. You can even re-do missions to get the rewards again, so if you've spent your points in a way you wish you didn't, it's just a short time before you can do the mission again.3. A smart, fun, non-WoW-like mission system with actual interesting and compelling stories. Additionally many missions require actual thought and paying attention and in some cases puzzle-solving (or at the very least, if you're lazy, googling the answer).4. A rare real-world modern fantasy setting rather than generic elf/orc world #706a5. Updates that actually address player issues like UI improvements and upgrades, not only tiny bugfixes and difficulty-lowering tweaks that keep subscription money flowing.6. An achievement for eating enough tacosAnd much more. I was burned out on MMOs completely till I tried this and I have enjoyed it immensely. If you're looking for something new and interesting, I highly recommend The Secret World.			"

												I haven't gotten very far, but this is the first MMO that's actually captured my attention for longer than a few weeks. It's a fresh take on the genre with an unconventional leveling and class system, as well as some really interesting quest designs that you don't see in other MMOs. I highly recommend it. Pay only once! No monthly subscription!			"

												The Secret World is in my opinion the best story driven mmo that people do not play, not that it doesn't have a healthy population it does but it should be bigger.So the good parts if you like a story driven quest that are dripping with tension and build up the atmosphere like a good psychological horror film then this game is a good place for you.  They also do the slasher horror style too if that is your thing.  They have traditional quests with way points that lead you around while telling a story but they also have investigation missions which are a different beast altogether.  These are like a mini detective novel where you will have to research on the internet (no not for the walk through, play the game properly, grrrr).  For instance one required me to translate Romanian another take down and decode morse code .  They really make you think and will tax your brain cells assuming you do them properly without any cheating.So stories good, it also looks pretty decent as well graphics wise and the audio does its job of building up atmosphere too (like it does in a good film).Right the not so good (not bad just not good either).  The combat is clunky and will take some getting used to.  There is active dodging, telegraphs from mobs to avoid and that can get a little hectic.  The skill system has so many aspect to it  that it can be a very confusing thing to get a grasp of when you start. Its quite possible to make the game harder for yourself than it needs to be if you are not careful with your build (there are a ton of guides to give you the basics that will help you get a good start though so don't worry too much about that).So yes a flawed diamond of an mmo and if you can put up with the odd bits then you will find a really great, deep and atmospheric mmo that no other has been able to match so far.

												Ever wanted to battle a Lovecraftian creature with a shotgun? Now you can. The Secret World is a unique MMORPG for many reasons. It features a modern day setting in which secret societies battle out with many various myths and legends. The game also has a class-less system, in which players can put a combination of any two weapons of their choice and create a skill set based on their own playstyle. The setting takes place in a modern day age where creatures terrorize the world and it's up to secret societies to contain them (for multiple reasons). The game features an engaging story and side-stories to go along with quest. The stories are amazingly well-done, espically in quest/missions, often invoking a sense of mystery to push your forward. Many of the quest vary, but still retain some of the fetch and kill quest, many have you solving eleborate puzzles, sneaking through a heavily defended base, solving a murder, dodging the line of sight from a sniper; while, more are simple, such as killing X numbers of enemies.  However, the game has a very dark overtone, which can be a turn-off from the usual easy-going nature of MMO worlds. For those wondering about the classless system, the ""Trinity"" still remains. The character can equip non-aesthetic gear known as Talismans to boost their profiency in one of the ""Trinity"" (DPS, TANK, HEALER). The classless system features 9 weapons each with different roles such as support, healing, dps, debuffing, and etc. You can combine any of these two into combos that fit your playstyle. The combat is a lot more active than most mmos, requiring you to dodge and actively use skills.Speaking of non-aesthetics, the gear you get stays off your character, so you aren't forced to wear that ""ugly armor"", the game features clothing that you can purchase, unlock, and (obviously) wear to suit your character. While the intial character customaztion isn't so robust, the game features a full line of clothings in which you can dress your character.The game features big areas that are themed, filled with plenty of quest to keep you busy. The difficulty curve feels about right, slowly scaling up with your progression through each area. The game features the typical ""instances/dungeons"" where you battle your way through the standard 6 boss format with up to 5 players. It also features three difficulty levels, Normal, Elite, and Nightmare. Normal serves as the progressing line through each dungeon, with fairly standard completion. Elite is the same thing, but for higher level gear, and Nightmare is a brutal and hellish asylum for those whom honed their tactics to form a congregation to conquer Satan's dungeon for a rewarding payoff. (It's THAT ♥♥♥♥ING HARD).Although, with such content, comes a couple of bugs. Playing the game for long periods of time can cause a memory leak, and once in a while you may experience a quest/dungeon/game breaking bug. However, this can be easily repaired by contacting an admin via /petition command, or logging off and back on. The beginning of the game (the first area) can seem a bit slow, slowly racking up abillities points while more slowly accumlating skill points to spend on your weapon skills. In short, The Secret World is a unique experience from an MMO perspective, featuring the right amount of difficulty, story, and gameplay to keep a driving force to play it. The game features several bugs however, which are easily repaired but can get annoying sometimes. For those looking for a core MMORPG, the trinity and character devloping remains and does not delve into over-""casualising"" itself. The game is downright hard, yet forgiving. It inspires creativity by allowing a free-form system in skill development. If you're looking for a refresher and are willing to try out something a little different, The Secret World is that MMO.-This awesome game was a gift from an awesome friend, shoutout to him :D!!! Thanks a lot for it!-			"

												I absolutely love this game. It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales. Fantastic design.The leveling system is thrown out the window in favour of a much more involved (and often revised) system of skill and ability points which are earned as the player hits experience threshholds. Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set. Otherwise, the game plays smoothly. I'd give this game a 8/10. A must buy if you have a group of friends who seem even remotely interested.			"

												I gave this game a thumbs up, but do realise it is an aquired taste. The strong point of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Compared to other MMO's it beats them by a mile (storywise). However compared to strictly story driven (stand alone) games, it is not all that good. I often wondered if this game would have been better as a stand alone. There are a lot of cutscenes, which are usually nicely done. The quality of the main storyline did suprise me as it flutters around and some side missions are actually better than the main storyline.The combat is rather rather dull and hp of many mobs increases faster than your dps. Combined with the story driven missions it makes the game feel rather slow. This does not have to be a bad thing mind you, but when indoctrinated by WoW or the like you will really have to get used to this game. The game can be quite unforgiving at times, which at certain points is a nice challenge, and at other times quite silly (making you want to read the mission guides in advance). Bringing a friend does help quite a lot (but be aware some parts of missions have to be done solo in mini instances).PVP is aweful at the moment. Players are ""balanced"" but not quite to the level of other QL10.5 types. Most areas are static most of the time, being at the mercy of the faction with the most players. On the flip side, it allowed me to read a good book while picking up points for epics, jumping in (and dying painfully) when we got attacked. All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere in the game and running around trying to find out what happened. I picked the game up on steam with a discount and I think it was worth the money. Though, as you noticed, I think it could have been a lot better. I have not played endgame content (raids), nor do I think I will. The replayablility does not seem that high to me, once you have seen a story, you will want to go to the next (even though they are repeatable).Ps. the game seems to be optimized very badly, at least for 32bit systems. I actually had to tweak my memory to make it run (I wish I could say smoothly). I ran it without steam, hence the low hour count.			"

												Have played this game since its earliest beta, hands down one of the most unique MMOs on the market that you can play. With the addition of the Ultimate Edition out now you can purchase  the entire game , spanning from Issues 1-4 (Which come free with the game when it was a subscription game), to Issues 5-11, 3 Sidestory DLC Packs (1 for Investigation Missons, the other 2 for Tokyo missions).The main thing that sets Secret World apart from the rest of the MMO market, is that its a Classless game, no ""Levels"", there are a total of 525 normal abilities that you can master and aquire, doing that unlocks you a sweet Tron style outfit, the Panopic Core. The XP Bar is there just like anyother MMO, but each time you gain XP you gain Ability Points, which are used to unlock abilities, and Skill Points, which you use to increase your skill in the weapons and Talismans, Talismans are basically your gear in game, they do have stats, just like a normal mmo. You can only have a total of 7 Active Abilities / 7 Passive Abilies, 8/8 once you aquire the Auxillary Weapons.The cosmetics of the game are your characters clothing, you can aquire clothing in anyway in TSW, either by unlocked abilties, achievements, Decks (premade builds), buying them from a clothing store ingame or from the Item Shop. The Item Shop for TSW is pretty much all Cosmetics, you can purchase the Issues and Sidestory packs from the ingame shop, but it just unlocks Questing Content, nothing else. There are Ability Point Injectors you can purchase, but seeing as you can get AP pretty quickly without using them, they are not worth it.The game spans multiple locations, from New England to London, Egypt to Seoul, Transylvania to Hell, and finally to Tokyo where the games Season 1 concluded in Issue 11. The content in the game gives players hours, upon hours of playtime. Each zone having its own unique feel, the characters in each zone are fully voiced in and out of their cutscenesThere are multiple missions types in the game; There are your normal 'kill this, kill that, gather this, gather that' missions called Action Missions. Side Missions that are usually 1 or 3 tier simple quests, Investigation Missions, which require the player to think outside the box by looking up information about the quest, even the cutscenes themselves hold some information about the actual quests, and then Sabotage Missions which requires the player to not get detected by any of the mobs, explosives, or cameras.The Community of TSW, is probably the greatest community in an mmo that i've been apart of, Devs and GMs interact with the community every week, two of the devs have started streaming every week on twitch showing the ins-and-outs of how they make the game.There will be times when something bugs out, and you have to send in a petition to a GM to get it fixed, the usual time it takes for a GM to respond to your petition will roughly be atleast 3 minutes tops, the GM team they have is always online to help players when they need it, and thats great customer service.Overall, The Secret World is an amazing MMO that more people should check out, specially with the new ultimate edition that gives you every content update in the game.

												PROPlenty of intrigue, mystery, and spooky appeal. These qualities make this game unique amongst my steam library, i will likely never uninstall this. ;)CONControls are hardcoded, need AHK (third party program) to rectify this so you can bind abilities to mouse clicks and customise the targetting modes. There is an AHK file floating around out there called advanced reticle mode or something like that which does this.BUILDS AND GEAR (early on)For the beginning trash mobs you'll want some AOE attacks and self-heals for solo survival. I suggest getting the sword early on, there is a very early ability available which functions as a self heal if you slot the corresponding passive for it, and there are plenty of aoe sword attacks available. Fist weapons have alot of HoT abilities, which can be quite good to use just before heading into a fight, so I would suggest getting that as your secondary weapon when starting out a new character.BUILDS AND GEAR (endgame pve/pvp)It can be quite difficult to play any build you want if you do not have gear with stats that compliment them! Endgame gear can be hard to get for either pve or pvp purposes, however pvp is a bit more forgiving in that you get a stat buff depending on what pvp role you choose, and then the stats on whatever gear you're wearing will replace the least-prioritised stats from the stat buff (also known as equal-footing buff). This makes it a little easier to make viable, specialised builds for pvp without having to attain endgame gear.			"

												The setting is what originally got me to buy it. When I first heard about it, I figured it would be like Hunter: the Vigil but online, and settings-wise, it is similar.What has kept me playing are the NPCs and the ability system. I play with subtitles on and I take screenshots all the time because of the awesome, funny, or insightful things the NPCs say. Player abilities are built around selecting 2 weapons, 7 active powers and 7 passive powers. It gets more complicated as you go because synergies emerge as you earn powers that set conditions and then exploit them. There are no experience levels; content is separated mainly by the quality of your talismans (talismans because pants and shirts are divorced from in-game effect, freeing you to look how you want). Group roles tend to fall into tanking, healing, support and damage. You are free to change roles any time you aren't fighting: just use the gear manager to switch between ability and equipment sets.Every MMO seems to want to avoid the ""kill 10 rats"" type quests, but The Secret World is one of the few that succeeds. Those missions still exist, but they are clearly labeled Action and they appear along side Sabotage missions, where the player must avoid detection and Investigation missions, which actually require researching the clues on the Internet.PvP is the primary deficiency I've seen. It is kind of unpopular and my computer can't handle it. (Assault rifle particle effects can be crippling.)TL;DR - Not a straight WoW copy and great if you're into Lovecraft & World of Darkness			"

												The Secret World isn't perfect. That being said, it is one of the most entertaining, immersing and downright fun games I played.Now, I'm not a big fan of MMOs. You can look at my hours spent of TF2 and compare it to true veterans, but that's because I have other activites to do in my young, adolescent life. MMOs are an unfortunate example of this, and I can never truly get into them due to the sheer level of devotion it demands from the player.The Secret World is not that kind of MMO. In fact, it gets so much right, it's hard not to pick it up in the first place.Unlike many of it's genre, TSW has a very deep and interesting story. That isn't to say that other MMOs have good stories, but this game revels in pride with it's atmosphere and lore. When you first create your character, you are given a selection between three factions; the Templars, the uncompromising yet morally-just (for the most part) lions of the Secret World. If you love knights or want to be the closest you can get in this world to a hero, then don the red and white of the Templars. The Illuminati are the opposite; instead of fighting for order and stability, the Illuminati seek to change the world with their power - for better or worse. If you dream of becoming stronger than anyone else, then you'll love this faction. Finally, the Dragon are a green sea of chaos, always making small actions that bring changes of gargantuan proportions. If you're looking to change a long-stagnant world, then play as the Dragon. Personally, I chose the Templars, for I agree with them for the most part.Anyway, the story kicks off with you swallowing a Bee. Unlike the boring bees we know, these creatures grant magical powers to those they choose as their bearers. After (somewhat) mastering your magical powers, your consulted by one of the three factions to go to their headquarters and begin your journey. After a short prologue, you are free to explore the world.First of, the world is huge. The Secret World boast three main regions to explore. The first area you got to is the sleepy Maine coastal town called Solomon Island, which is a sort of earlygame area. You go to Egypt for the midgame, and finally Translyvania for the lategame. If you could pay the DLC, you get to go to one more area, but I'll cover that another time.The story follows your war on the rising darkness, and you meet a wide cast of colorful characters to help you in your journey. This may be me personally, but I loved the questgivers. They weren't some mindless, one-dimensional characters who just were there to give quests, they have their own little quirks and loveable traits. This - as I mentioned - is one of TSW's strong points; the story. Seriously, you'll spend hours on the well-written characters, and even more time finding all the lore collectables.The story may be great, but it wouldn't matter if the gameplay sucked. Thankfully it doesn't, and while I don't have that much experience with MMOs to compare it to another format, I enjoyed it. It really is something different; unlike the traditional MMO format, you don't have levels. Instead, you have a selection of one of nine weapons that let you create your classes. I chose a Hammer/Shotgun DPS/Solo build, and you can do whatever you want, provided you can make the synergy work. Another unique fact is that there are no levels; the experience is fixed, and you get an Ability point for every 40,000 XP you get, and a Skill Point for every 120,000 XP.Ability Points, as the name implies, unlock new skills for your characters. Abilities are based off the combat; you have resources, and you need ""builders"" to build a resource with each hit so you can do resource-consuming attacks. There's also healing spells, buffs, debuffs, you get the idea. Meanwhile, Skill Points are this game's level system. If you put a skill point into a weapon you use, it goes up. The cost for every weapon rises until it reaches it's maximum. In order to equip a powerful talisman (equipment that determine your stats) you need to have the required skill level for that item. The best part about the Skill Point system is that progression happens at a very generous pace: you'll be hitting levels very quickly, making it a lot more fun than the tiresome slog of other MMO grinds.Finally, the DLC. Now normally I dislike DLC, but here it's some of the best this side of the medium. You'll have to pay with Funcom Tokens (which require real money) but the content it provides is so fun, it's very much worth the admission ticket. Even beyond the DLC, the game doesn't actively force you to buy it to have fun; you're more likely to buy a sick motorcycle than you are to purchase XP boosts.Overall, this is a very, very fun game! If you are a MMO veteran or a newcomer seeking to enjoy fantasy in the modern world, this won't disappoint. That's a promise.			"

												tl;dr: Great ♥♥♥♥ing game with innovative mechanics and ideas, reminicent of the World of Darkness and the Dresden Files. Go try it!Some thoughts; The Secret World (TSW) is one of the most exciting MMO’s that I’ve had the pleasure of trying, with a deep and intriguing setting that encourages exploration both of the world and the narrative. The setting is heavily influenced by the works of writers such as H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, where you awake to a secret world, filled with monsters, spirits and ancient horrors from beyond this world, where all the legends and fairytales have a kernel of truth in them. The game looks stunning design-wise, and every area of the game draws heavily upon both pop cultural and historical representations of such settings as dreary New England or Ancient Egypt. You’ll spend a lot of time enjoying all the references that pop up and the new takes on myths and legends, all tied nicely together with the game’s central lore. TSW boasts some of the most intriguing quest systems I’ve seen so far in a MMO, especially the investigation missions, where the answer to a given problem often is not to be found in the game itself, requiring that you make use of the game’s built in web browser to investigate the clues for an answer. This can lead to some very frustrating moments as the difficulty of these investigation missions can be rather steep at times, showing that the game priorities not only combat as a challenge mechanism. TSW also makes heavy use of the graphical representation of the world itself to give you clues to further you on missions, where you can have walked past something several times, only suddenly to realize that there is an actual reason behind the design, beyond simple esthetics; they are a clue. But it also feels familiar to traditional MMORPGs.When it comes to the combat, TSW is complicated, simply put, and many a player has had a running face-first meeting with the metaphorical brick wall, as the game suddenly demands that players develop a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the game in order to bolster combat efficiency. The in-game tutorial of this is a bit lacking -especially given the huge amount of freedom the player is given concerning builds- which leads to no small amount of frustration at times, but once you have overcome this wall and started to learn how abilities work in conjunction with each other, the gameplay is rewarding and deep. Given that TSW has turned Free to Play, it is well worth giving it a go, both as a single player experience and as a deep and challenging MMO. The main critique I have of the game is the end game, where it turns into a traditional MMO and focues upon raiding and grinding, but this too is fun and challenging. Funcom regularly updates with Side Stories, quest chains and new areas that both further the main storyline and act as smaller short story-like experiences.			"

												The combat in the game can get a little repetitive like most MMO's, but the way the quests are done are a completely new and refreshing take.  The investigation missions force you to search for answers outside the game which makes for an experience like none other.  The puzzles start getting a bit tricky after a while as well, so the game outside of combat gets pretty challenging.  Definitely recommend this.			"

												Fantastic RPG.  Setting and themes not often investigated in other games, especially in MMOs.  This probably isn't the best exemplar of the MMO genre, as raiding, dungeons, and PVP, while there, are in the background compared to the stellar questing.  This game is not as social as others as you will not come across so many people during questing, and this is by design.  However, the questing, story, and environments are so good it's well worth playing, and you could treat this as a single-player game of sorts if you want to.  Combat leaves a bit to be desired, but the system for ""leveling up"" (there's no actual levelling up in this game) is pretty unique and good.			"

												Currently in Egypt and taking my time. There's so much to see and do in this game, from auctioning things off to questing and farming monsters for achievements. With the new museum, there's even more to do in the game. Cosmetics are just that in this game, cosmetics. There are no clothing stats and no leveling, so you can go at your own pace and enjoy it. There's no really forced grouping beyond maybe the dungeons, so you could reasonably solo the whole game if you wanted to. The dungeons have different levels too, as long as you complete the normal level first. The item store has lots of cool things, and you can get the DLC content easily if you save up on points. The quests are fun and challenging, with investigation quests being the hardest, but most rewarding kind of quest. The story carries easily over the worlds, despite some little hiccups, overall you can just take it all at your own pace and enjoy it, changing gear and weapons as you go along to find your own style.

Ive never spent 20 hours in a game so quickly before, and to be honest im not even 10% into the game yet. I can easily see this game being over 500 hours especially with the expansions that i got included with the ultimate edition!After 20 hours, im no way near bored, still discovering and learning new things every day and the missions are so much fun! None of the quests feel boring or repetative, they actually feel like real quests that you are doing. Plus for the main quests i love seeing the FMV sequences play out, they can be quite fun!!If you havent seen this game before, i urge you to not think about it, just buy it! The only problem is that when you get into this game theres no getting out, and you wont be able to play anything else for weeks to come (probably much longer!)!!! "

The questing is fun and the combat is very interesting. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys story content in an MMO, or just questing in general. The quests are engaging and the story is intriguing.There's enough content to get you your money's worth, and if you've got friends, even more so. 78 Illuminati conspiracy theories out of 100.			"

												For fans of mmos and lovecraftian stories, I gotta say this game has left a pretty strong impression as I'm hooked in the world. The stories of the characters from the towns and locations you visit just suck you into the whole experience. I'm the type of person who can't stand playing mmos alone for too long, but Secret World just does it in a way where I feel completely driven to keep going solo and enjoy the bits of lore that the developers has left for us to discover. Absolutely one of my favorite games and I highly recommend for anyone to try out if they love dark stories and conspiracies/occult in their games.			"

												Hello I walk into emptyI can't recommend this game enough. Funcom's central product, it seems, is individualistic and memorable experiences, and The Secret World is exactly that. The base game is good quality, with haunting and horrifying settings and strange and memorable characters. The quest structure mixes episodic hubs that introduce you to fleshed out and interesting characters, and an overarching narrative that has you unravelling the designs of some unknown force.The game also offers something unique to MMOs: the investigation mission. These are augmented reality puzzles, drawing you into some truly challenging and lateral riddles, while using alternate reality to beautifully blur the lines between our world and the secret world.But it gets better.The DLC take off and make everything good about the base experience more spectacular. Issue #5, The Vanishing Of Tyler Freeborn, is the first great example of this, with a climax taking place inside a psychedelic nightmare brought on by a cosmic horror called ""The Filth"", a major antagonistic force running through the game. This sets the stage for what is to come in the remaining DLC, with the lines blurring ever more.			"

												Fantastic RPG.  Setting and themes not often investigated in other games, especially in MMOs.  This probably isn't the best exemplar of the MMO genre, as raiding, dungeons, and PVP, while there, are in the background compared to the stellar questing.  This game is not as social as others as you will not come across so many people during questing, and this is by design.  However, the questing, story, and environments are so good it's well worth playing, and you could treat this as a single-player game of sorts if you want to.  Combat leaves a bit to be desired, but the system for ""leveling up"" (there's no actual levelling up in this game) is pretty unique and good.			"

												For fans of mmos and lovecraftian stories, I gotta say this game has left a pretty strong impression as I'm hooked in the world. The stories of the characters from the towns and locations you visit just suck you into the whole experience. I'm the type of person who can't stand playing mmos alone for too long, but Secret World just does it in a way where I feel completely driven to keep going solo and enjoy the bits of lore that the developers has left for us to discover. Absolutely one of my favorite games and I highly recommend for anyone to try out if they love dark stories and conspiracies/occult in their games.			"

												Hello I walk into emptyI can't recommend this game enough. Funcom's central product, it seems, is individualistic and memorable experiences, and The Secret World is exactly that. The base game is good quality, with haunting and horrifying settings and strange and memorable characters. The quest structure mixes episodic hubs that introduce you to fleshed out and interesting characters, and an overarching narrative that has you unravelling the designs of some unknown force.The game also offers something unique to MMOs: the investigation mission. These are augmented reality puzzles, drawing you into some truly challenging and lateral riddles, while using alternate reality to beautifully blur the lines between our world and the secret world.But it gets better.The DLC take off and make everything good about the base experience more spectacular. Issue #5, The Vanishing Of Tyler Freeborn, is the first great example of this, with a climax taking place inside a psychedelic nightmare brought on by a cosmic horror called ""The Filth"", a major antagonistic force running through the game. This sets the stage for what is to come in the remaining DLC, with the lines blurring ever more.			"

												I know you might have already heard/read all of this before, but I'll say it anyway. The Secret World is both a wonderful game and a wondeful MMO.Its game mechanics are good : dynamic fight, complete lack of classes allowing you to build your character according to your play style, very different types of missions...The writing is absolutely marvelous. Every single mission has a story behind it, and shows it to you. Every. Single. One. No ""fetch me twenty wolf pelts"" or ""bring me ten goblin heads"". Here, you even have missions that ask you to think and do proper research to solve the riddles.And there is so much I could say about the setting or the story but that I won't because I'd be serious spoilers and they are both worth discovering on your own.

This game has great content, the quests don't feel grindy, there are a lot of themes and variations in the story, great characters and the fact that you aren't leveling up in a traditional way means there's room for making errors and it let's you experiment with different builds and playstyles without having to make a new character.

												After trying dozens of MMORPG's, TSW was the first game that let me care enough to try the dungeons, to go on the raids, and take part in special events.  The setting and lore is fantastic, the story is enthralling, the locations are varied and the NPCs are remarkably well realized.  With no classes, there's no frustrated restarts and tedious level grinding. TSW is the game I play when I don't have the money for hyped new games and need to forget the marketing.  It's solid all the way through.			"

												This game is great. It is great because it is challenging due to the fact that the quests sometimes involve puzzles or stealth missions, and there are many opportunities to go off the beaten path. This game plays more like a real story from dnd than just some hawked up and spit out mmo by one of the other companies. You should play this game if you like full immersion story lines that allow you to take your own path, and let you choose which quest to do instead of a normal zombie quest one after the other. Also if you like skill trees instead of just boring levels, this is the game for you.			"

												One of the few games I can recommend for the story and possibly the only MMO I can recommend be played just for the story itself. The writting is brilliant enough to put many novelists and script writers to shame, albeit that might not be saying as much as I hoped with what passes for novelists and script writers. It is quite qoutable and if it was a tome would be quite respected as a great work of the early twenty-first century. However, I, again, admit that may not be saying as much as I hoped with what has been considered great works in previous centuries.			"

												The secret world is an MMO focused on all things found in Lovecraft lore. The game looks nice, sounds nice, and plays very well for how ambitious it is. The game boasts a large world and replayable missions while lacking tried and true character leveling instead opting for experience based skill and ability point on a threshold system. This lends itself to a feeling that no point spent is wasted. I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a solid MMO with a moderate difficulty who isn't a fan of a monthly sub fee. Worth the money.			"

												The Secret World is one of the more unique MMORPGs out there - and it's certainly one of the best in terms of its world (every conspiracy theory of our modern world is true), story (putting even TOR's Imperial Agent to shame) and some Quests (Investigation-Quests); however - the MMO aspect of the game is more of a hindrance than anything else - at least in my opinion.+++unique setting+++a very good story (sadly shackled in an mmo)+++interesting NPCs; very good voice acting+++investigation Quests (which e.g. require you to deciper a morse-code, use a bit of latin or visit websites set up by the devs themselves (http://www.orochi-group.net/)++Wardrobe-system: You only gain stats by your weapon and talismans (which are invisible). So you can buy clothes in the store (both in-world and microtransaction) and mix-match however you see fit; you can also unlock sets by doing certain quests/challenges)++no 'real' leveling (instead you spend earned AP and SP on your weapons and your 'skill-wheel)++challenging dungeon encounters (nightmare), where each dungeon tells a story of its own++Quests are voiced+You can equip 7 Skills (1 Elite) from a maximum of 2 weapons, so it's more of a tactic choice than anything else (mix/maxing in nightmare-difficulty dungeons is a real thing, though)+a bunch of weapons, ranging from sledgehammers over assault rifles (terrible animations, sadly) to blood- and chaos magic)---the animations are mostly terrible--the endgame is somewhat stale (and over pretty quickly if you're with a group of friends)-sabotage missions and other quests-pvp is fun, although somewhat broken (Cardiac Arrest/Bloodshot // gear plays a MASSIVE role!)Overall, the game is very good if you're willing to ignore or tolerate its shortcomings and I totally recommend it. (I, for example, always return when a new Issue is released [these continue the main story])			"

												I have played many MMo's almost from the start.  I played this last year for 6 months, and stopped. Since that time, I have purchased almost all the MMO's available on Steam. The problem is, that sooner or later, they all become the same. Same mechanics, same p2w issues....or broken economies. I decided to come back here - to the ""Secret World"". It really is unique. The most adult...and an experience not found in other MMO's. Without pointing out things already discussed by others....I can simply say, that if you want a deep experience, one you can handle mostly on your own, until you are ready to seek out and join others (or not)...this game can't be beat.The mechanics behind the skill systems are varied, deep, and potentially endless in their set ups. Its like   ""X-files (the creepier episodes) meets I am legend meets the Seventh sign. What more can you ask for?This is the only game ( MMO) that I have actually spent significant time changing my outfits to suit the atmosphere of whereever the missions take me.   And trust me......I would never have thought clothing options would be so fun?  (omg)Get this. Play this.Learn what is happening in the world around you ......			"

There are no classes or levels. You pick your starting weapons (guns, melee or magic) your group (illuminati, Templars or the Dragon) and off you go to solve the mysteries of The Secert World! While this game suffered early when it was released it has since been updated and refined into a decently made MMO that has a strong committed base of players. The missions you get sent on will test everything from your characters strengths to how intellegent you are.

												I'd like to apologize ahead of time for the lack of a pros and cons or other in depth analysis you might see in other reviews. I'm just here to brown nose a little.I don't write reviews, ever, but for this game I can make an exception. It's story telling is genius, its graphics don't even need to be good (Even though they are) because they way they've managed to capture the atmosphere is so perfect that I lack words to describe it, and the voice acting is top of the line.The Secret World is like playing through a really good psychological suspenful, mystery, horror movie. I captures all of the best elements of story telling and its lore has a deceptive depth to it. For the life of me I cannot understand why this game hangs on the fringes as something of a cult ""classic"" when it has the potential to be something huge.Between solving puzzles and wracking my brain dechipering codes or unravelling painfully obscure mysteries I find myself at a loss for exactly how to convey just how much I like this game. It's strange really. The feeling it gives from the music right down to the appropirate scenery. Every lovecraftian thing, every eldritch monstrocity seems enough to make anyone's skin crawl with creep, fear, and confusion.In more than 100 hours of gameplay I've played solo, I've not completely a single dungeon, and I still find this game incredibly entertaining.I'll say this and shut up. The story writers for this game could have easily written a series of novels and even the scripts for award winning movies. Hell, even a television series would be mindblowing with the kind of writing they do. I don't know what intellects they have behind it all (Never watched the credits) but these folks are top notch.

												For the LAZY PEOPLE! - If you want to see a PRO-CON list immediately, click ""Read More"" and scroll DOWN!Categories!!! - Positive commentary.!*!*! - Negative Commentary!!! - I can't recommend this MMORPG enough. I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, ""There are muthical creatures in this game!"" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with. So you WILL have to grind and wait a bit to be able to kill or fight the monsters coming up in the next section of the mission.!*!*! - The learning curve on this game is also a bit of a moderate level. The interface and hotkey tutorials is easily forgotten so you will have to dock some time into learning it. Understanding some of the combat mechanics such as Resource Pooling and Ability screening can be a bit tricky. Figuring out what your supposed to do, how to get stronger character wise, how to get better clothes and MUCH better gear can also be a bit of an issue for new players unless they delve into some research. Noobies might find it frustrating a bit to figure out what they're doing.The All in All:PROS-The Factions are Illuminati, Templars and Dragons. Awesome in a box.-New and Fresh setting. Set in the Modern Day rather than fairies and Knights in shining armor.-$29.99 is a GREAT price for what you're getting.-Combat is fun and well executed.-Great Mission and Questing opportunities-Graphics won't murder your computer. (CPU may be an issue)-Thousands of different play styles and combat combinations.-Really. Fricking. Fun.CONS-Learning the game is a bit tricky.-Character Development vs Monster Progression is hard to keep up with.-Some might find the game a bit repetitive in combat.(Vary your playstyles as you go through! Don't stick to one or two weapons!)-Most of the ways to make yourself look cool is by paying REAL MONEY. But it is not a requirement. Faction armor is provided.The Verdict, Should you buy this game?YES! For 30 bucks you are getting a SWEET deal. Any MMORPG fan is going to fall in love with this game. The factions are each unique and great! The weapons and magics are all cool and well designed. The quests feel endless. For not subscriptions, this is a MUST BUY! This is definitely a 9/10. I say 9/10 since there are definitely some fixe(not just bugs) and tweaks dearly needed. But otherwise, almost perfect. Get. This. Game.			"

You actually pay attention to what is going on, not just follow the big arrows and click the same buttons over and over. I never got to end game though, it works best if you have friends playing too as the matchmaking or finding groups to run with while leveling never really clicked for me. The leveling system is really cool with you can pick and switch between any of the many areas to level in however it does make it hard to determine relative level of content and dungeons that you should be running.

While this game suffered early when it was released it has since been updated and refined into a decently made MMO that has a strong committed base of players. The missions you get sent on will test everything from your characters strengths to how intellegent you are. I highly recommend keeping a pencil and notepad near you while playing if you don't just want to Google the answers for the Investigation missions.8/10 - Graphics8.72/10 - Story7/10 - Innovation10/10 - Replayability9/10 - Sound & Music10/10 - Challenge (without being frustrating)			"

												Quite possibly the best MMO I have ever played. I don't really play much of the genre because I'm usually turned off by the mechanics and repetitiveness of gameplay but this game gets around that by having quests with really good writing and characters.

												This is the first MMO I've played, and I must say it's been quite a treat. The base game includes plenty of content, but I would strongly suggest the Ultimate Edition. At first, I was wondering what I was getting into it. The gameplay seemed overwhelming without much of a tutorial. However, after digging around for info to get a grasp of the game, I began to realize how great of a game it was.The story is immersive and the quests are excellent. I especially love the investigation quests; these quests will have you googling and cross-referencing the most obscure information, which may rack your brain, but anyone who loves reading up on random facts and history or once dreamed of being Sherlock Holmes will surely love these quests. And of course, I have to recommend a game that has me using a pen and tons of scratch paper. And of course the combat. Not being much of a combat-game person, I do enjoy it in this game. I was in-experienced in deck-building (still am), hence how it may be overwhelming to a newbie MMO player at first. In terms of community, you're not going to see hundreds of people running around and the amount of general chat in most areas will be pretty minimal. But there are ways to find groups to join. Most people tend to be playing solo unless they're playing in dungeons or PVP.Only con I have is the occasional crash, otherwise 10/10. "

												This is a groovy-cool, eerie MMO that breaks a lot of rules that MMO's have picked up along the years. First, there is no leveling. That's right. You gain experience and apply experience benchmarks towards skills and abilities. Your one character can conceivably learn how to do everything in the game. There is no cap on your advancement. This is a really cool aspect to the game. They balance this seemingly amazing gift with the fact that you can only ever have 7 active abilities and 7 passive ones. Many of these play off each other too, so it behooves one to play their character with a concept. The lore of the game is ripe with themes from H.P. Lovecraft also, so if this sort of horror appeals to you, then TSW is a real treat. Armor is gone, replaced by an assortment of magical treatments that provide you with the real armor against all of the unholy and undead things in the game. I would definitely recommend a visit to The Secret World if you haven't already. Its fun, it's a treat, it's really really different. "

												The Secret World is probably one of the best MMO's at the moment. The graphics are good and if your graphics card is good enough, you can even get tesselation into the game which makes the game look pretty awesome. The game is also optimized pretty badly, it runs mostly in quite good fps but there are some places which makes your fps spike pretty low, especially if you use the tesselation.What makes this MMO stand out from every other MMO's currently available is that the ""class system"" is unique and works pretty well, because you can make your own ""class"". What would be cooler than playing with a group where one player uses firearms, one magic abilities and another a mixture of melee and magic? The class system is so cool that you can even mix two different types of abilities into one. There isn't any levels in the game, complete quests and kill enemies to gain ability points which are used to unlock more abilities for you to use.Also, the game takes place in present time. The enemies are mostly created from different urban legends which makes them quite interesting and unique from other MMO's. The storyline kind of mixes things with real life, urban legends and myths which makes it really interesting and different. One of the things I like the most with the quests are the research missions, which tells you what you need to find out, then you use the in-game browser and find out the answers yourself to continue the mission. Sometimes it is too hard to find out the answers yourself though, so you need to find a mission walkthrough to get past one obstacle, but they are pretty fun and sometimes they make you involved deeper into the story.Although, the early stages of the game is pretty easy with a group, I recommend playing this with a few friends. The game gets tougher when continuing towards the end, and once you progress long enough you can't solo the quests anymore. One of the biggest reasons why you should play with a group, and it is more fun than playing alone.If you want a good MMO, which is different from other MMO's at the moment, you want this one. So what are you still waiting for? Buy it, play it, treasure it. Whatever, just stop reading this and go join the war!			"

												steam says 1662 hours spend but it is actualy triple that since i no longer use steam to play it.best mmo out there. quests are great fun. the dungeons are the best i have seen in an mmo *perfect difficulty, great lore, not to short/long. and offer lots of replayability when you get to nm level you can pretty much make any builds and stat combination you can think of to be the best dps/heal/tank out there.end game players are helpfull and there is little to no elitism.game may seem quite at first but if you join #sanctuary #event and #pvp your chat box will never be empty.pvp while unbalanced at times is rediculously fun just make sure you have some hear first or you will get destroyed as players tend to be endgame level. (this is my fav part of tsw) cabals are very nooblet freindy and if you are new dont be afriad to ask in generel agartha (hub) to join one as there are always recruiting to help you get to endgame and it will be much easier to participate in lairs, elites, nms and even pvp!the zones are very diverse and fun to expore made up of almost entierly unique textures  and picking your own faction is super fun.it is quite performance heavy so make sure you have a somewhat decent computer to play or you will have bad fps most likely. since i love this game so much i will give it a 10/10.

												It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with an MMO. So many of them these days seem exactly the same and it's been hard to truly get excited about anything new. In that regard, The Secret World is a breath of fresh air. Based in a modern world, the storyline is captivating and the quests are really unlike any other. Sure there's the typical ""kill this many of these"" that you get with most games but that's to be expected. What really stands out are the investigative quests which actually require you to do your own research and problem solving. Character building is pretty interesting too although complex in the beginning. Once you understand how decks and synergy work with your talismans and weapons, it's actually wonderful. You have an extraordinary amount of options in how you want to play and it's rare that any two people will play their characters the exact same way. I can see that the learning curve is a bit of a turn off for most people starting out with this game, but if you stick with it, this game really is a gem. There's also a lot of special little surprises and references that show up that appeal to fans of nerdy culture. Unlike most MMOs this one actually works really well as a single player game but it is absolutely more fun when playing with a group.			"

												One of the best story driven games I have played, online or not. Very unique, interesting world and events, way different than any other mmo quests. You actually pay attention to what is going on, not just follow the big arrows and click the same buttons over and over. I never got to end game though, it works best if you have friends playing too as the matchmaking or finding groups to run with while leveling never really clicked for me. The leveling system is really cool with you can pick and switch between any of the many areas to level in however it does make it hard to determine relative level of content and dungeons that you should be running.

You can choose from three factions at the start of Character Creation, in which you can level and exile. Every faction has it's own features, advantages or disadvantages. You got to try the game out, the story and the ambience are just amazing. The graphics rock even on low settings. So please try it out, it's worth a shot! (Maybe even two.)8.6/10			"

												An MMO is only as good as the sum of its parts: the story, the multiplayer aspect, the cash shop, the ""hook,"" and the company that makes it. The Secret World is a very good MMO, but because its director has changed, the end product is a bipolar mix of MMO design philosophy. The early and middle parts of the game are rich, interesting story, supplemented by detailed environments, memorable characters and enemies, and well-written plots. The endgame is a punishing grind for gear and skills. Additionally, the latest holiday events were grind-fests, as well. Would I recommend this game? Yes. The story itself is such a beautiful thing that it deserves recognition. However, the endgame is a bucket of cold water to a damn good Sunday afternoon nap, so be sure to prepare yourself.			"

												For the LAZY PEOPLE! - If you want to see a PRO-CON list immediately, click ""Read More"" and scroll DOWN!Categories!!! - Positive commentary.!*!*! - Negative Commentary!!! - I can't recommend this MMORPG enough. I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, ""There are muthical creatures in this game!"" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with. So you WILL have to grind and wait a bit to be able to kill or fight the monsters coming up in the next section of the mission.!*!*! - The learning curve on this game is also a bit of a moderate level. The interface and hotkey tutorials is easily forgotten so you will have to dock some time into learning it. Understanding some of the combat mechanics such as Resource Pooling and Ability screening can be a bit tricky. Figuring out what your supposed to do, how to get stronger character wise, how to get better clothes and MUCH better gear can also be a bit of an issue for new players unless they delve into some research. Noobies might find it frustrating a bit to figure out what they're doing.The All in All:PROS-The Factions are Illuminati, Templars and Dragons. Awesome in a box.-New and Fresh setting. Set in the Modern Day rather than fairies and Knights in shining armor.-$29.99 is a GREAT price for what you're getting.-Combat is fun and well executed.-Great Mission and Questing opportunities-Graphics won't murder your computer. (CPU may be an issue)-Thousands of different play styles and combat combinations.-Really. Fricking. Fun.CONS-Learning the game is a bit tricky.-Character Development vs Monster Progression is hard to keep up with.-Some might find the game a bit repetitive in combat.(Vary your playstyles as you go through! Don't stick to one or two weapons!)-Most of the ways to make yourself look cool is by paying REAL MONEY. But it is not a requirement. Faction armor is provided.The Verdict, Should you buy this game?YES! For 30 bucks you are getting a SWEET deal. Any MMORPG fan is going to fall in love with this game. The factions are each unique and great! The weapons and magics are all cool and well designed. The quests feel endless. For not subscriptions, this is a MUST BUY! This is definitely a 9/10. I say 9/10 since there are definitely some fixe(not just bugs) and tweaks dearly needed. But otherwise, almost perfect. Get. This. Game.			"

												An MMO is only as good as the sum of its parts: the story, the multiplayer aspect, the cash shop, the ""hook,"" and the company that makes it. The Secret World is a very good MMO, but because its director has changed, the end product is a bipolar mix of MMO design philosophy. The early and middle parts of the game are rich, interesting story, supplemented by detailed environments, memorable characters and enemies, and well-written plots. The endgame is a punishing grind for gear and skills. Additionally, the latest holiday events were grind-fests, as well. Would I recommend this game? Yes. The story itself is such a beautiful thing that it deserves recognition. However, the endgame is a bucket of cold water to a damn good Sunday afternoon nap, so be sure to prepare yourself.			"

												I've been playing The Secret World for some days now and I got to say Im impressed!The game hasn't got much popularity and yet there are lots of active players around.The game mechanics are really good for an RPG and it kinda reminds me of APB: Reloaded mixed with Rift.The class system, skill system, ability system... they are all new and make this game unique. And The Secret World concept itself is already as unique as any game can get.I trully recommend this game to and fan of RPGs, its worth every cent you pay for it ;)			"

												For the LAZY PEOPLE! - If you want to see a PRO-CON list immediately, click ""Read More"" and scroll DOWN!Categories!!! - Positive commentary.!*!*! - Negative Commentary!!! - I can't recommend this MMORPG enough. I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, ""There are muthical creatures in this game!"" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with.

Posted: June 19, 2015
												The first MMO I ever played was Anarchy Online, also by Funcom.  I bought it when it was first released and played for years to come.Since I've tried to find an MMO that I felt had as much depth as well as a breathtaking atmosphere and nothing could compare.  That is until I got my mitts on The Secret World (again by Funcom - it appears they got my number).  So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.Story:One of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.  The questing and story mission are some of the best I've ever experienced in any game, much less an MMO.  The number of story missions, main missions and side missions is staggering, but what's even more staggering is that they all interweave into each other, contributing to the overarching story as a whole.  Everything feels connected and it's the most rewarding solo experience in a game I've played to date.Multiplayer:At first, I thought the multiplayer aspect of the game was sorely lacking, but upon joining the Sanctuary chat channel and finally getting powerful enough to start enjoying dungeons, playing with a team really opened up.  Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.Character depth:The reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.Atmosphere:Graphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).  Community:I've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.Overall:If you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.			"

												This game is mindblowing. I have been playing mmos since UO, and I seriously started to think that the mmorpg genre can't show me anything new. I was wrong, and this game gave me back my faith. We can often meet with the expression of a game having no ""level system"" which is always untrue, only the hardcore fanboys/girls believe it strongly. In a hidden way there is always a level system. However in the case of The Secret World my statement is only partially true! You get XP, and by reaching the right amount you get one of the two types of points. One type is used to purchase skills, one is to level up the abilities needed to wear better stuff. So basically if you want to equip endgame items, you need more xp, so thats paralel to a leveling system, since a new character cannot equip lvl 10 talismans for eg. but pretty much that's it. The skill system is amazing! Confusig at first sight, but in reality it's so simple, yet refreshing and new. And there are lots of skills. Lots, but not overwhelmingly lot. Amazing flexibility, you can really mix anything with anything, you can mix guns with magic or meelee weapons, no matter what you choose, if you choose the right skills for your 2 weapons, you will be succesful.The story is awesome. The game is filled with cutscenes, everything is fully and nicely voiced. You can skip them though. If you hate the ""next-next-next-accept-close-next-next"" type of games, you'll loooove this one. If you love stories, you'll love this one. Why? Because accepting a quest is EASY. 2 clicks, open and accept. And you know what type of quest is that from it's color and icon, even before opening it. If you want it's story, you'll have a cutscene. You don't like it? Just skip it, and go. You don't have to wait. Story maniacs, like I am can find many NPC to interact with with a small symbol. If you ask them, they will tell you stories and information. Again: fully voiced.Sounds are awesome. Period. What about the music? Astonishing! Beautiful. Period. The kind of music which I can listen outside the game, too. Soundeffects are also super. Graphically the game is nice, and runs smoothly on almost max graphs on my few year old, veeeeeryfar from atomic-high-über gaming PC. It has surprisingly few errors. I only found one so far, my sword sometimes goes trough my character's arm, which is pretty good comparing to other mmos (WoW: worgen's fur vs armor, rings a bell to anyone?).As for the atmosphere... AMAZING. Gloomy, but not depressing, apocalypic feeling, cool horror monsters and some quests really bring the true horror feeling. Also the game has brutally CHALLENGING (I mean it!!!) puzzles, if you are as clever and educated like me, you'll only need the chat or the game's ingame internet browser (yeah, for obvious reasons they made one) 50-70% of the time. From deciphering morse codes, to translating latin texts, to finding things in a Bible, realizing a painter's or a composer's name, there are tons of things which gives you the feeling that you're inside of a treasure hunting movie with a freemasonic theme.This game is pure genious. Some monsters become repetitive after a while, it's a common mmo sickness. Luckily you can choose to start another type of quest instead, if you don't want to butcher anymore, and when you would get too tired of the monsters, you'll be sent to the next areas.My biggest problem so far was the fact, that I haven't bought the game with all issues, while on sale, since you can't get them without the game on steam. Now I'll have to buy them for a full price. No, seriously my biggest problem with the game is that you cannot drop a quest. If you want to pause it, you'll have to take another from the same type of quest to take it's place. (There are a certain number of quests from each type that you can have at a time.) But the thing I like in it: if you pause a quest, and later return to take it again, you can continue it from the point you've abandoned it: most quests have steps called tiers, and after completing each tier, you get XP, and after completing the whole line, you'll get the final q reward.If you love mmos, buy it. If you love mystery games buy it. If you love horror, at least watch some gameplay videos! If you prefer gore/guro style things maybe it's not for you, but if you like mild horror too, you'll love it. There were some moments which gave me chills, and in one case I even screamed (:blushes:).			"

												There is nothing like The Secret World. In a MMO marketplace dominated by fantasy and ""space"" titles, TSW has attempted to do something unusual and has succeeded. The developer, Funcom, has a history of releasing cerebral, out-of-the-box titles and TSW continues this development strategy. While not tied to a single famous IP like Funcom's Age of Conan MMO, TSW reaches into many lesser known or less celebrated genres such as spy (James Bond), explorer (Indiana Jones), and horror and also the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and John Carpenter as well as many conspiracy and secret society tropes found in movies and fiction. The updates to the game are released as Issues (complete with comic book cover art) and the hundreds of game missions are connected as part of a vast, interwoven story which unfolds as the game is played. Fully voiced and animated cut scenes for main missions add to the feel of a film or television series with recurring characters. All of the conventional MMO features are here too with a crafting system, PvP, pets, mounts, raids, and guilds (Cabals) but unlike anything found elsewhere in multiplayer online games. For a new experience intended for an adult audience, play The Secret World.			"

												I can't tell if I hate The Secret World or love it, it has really nice story telling, solid combat and intriquing locations, but it plays on the perfectionist, you'll never find the ""perfect"" build because there's so many abilties and combinations to mix around with in the games ""deck"" creator (Essentially a create your own class) but you can't be one thing, tanks and healers NEED a dps build to get through the story or swap to something like a Heal Tank or Leech Healing (IE: Stealing health from the enemy using DPS and redistrubiting it to your team or yourself) as someone who wants to always be at their peak, it's infuriating finding a deck that feels nice but just doesn't have the DPS or heals, and with the announcement of Funcom being up for sale, it's a risky buy but I'd still recommend it, if nothing else, for the storyline. and you WILL need the expansions for this (called Issue's) as the game's story heavily relies on them so do yourself a favor and get the ultimate edition.

												Excellent game if you are in to conspiracy theories, horror(zombies,vampires,ghouls etc).  A good story that is mostly narrated in cut scenes.  If you are not too fussed about pvp and enjoy running around doing single player type missions and bumping in to a few other players now and then, and maybe doing a dungeon or two, if you can get the team, then give this game a go.  If you know someone who already has the game ask them for a free 3 day pass to check out the game, you will know within a couple of hours if this is the game for you. If you think there are too many 'ifs' in this review, you may need to ask yourself, 'IF it was worth reading all the way to the end'			"

												At this point I have only played through the first area (Kingsmouth).  I have to say that this is quite possibly the best mmo I have ever played.  I'm not exaggerating.  It's not perfect, but so many things are done right it's amazing.  The skill/ability system, the gear, the quest system, atmosphere, story, and don't even get me going on the voice acting; I'll just say it is by far the best of any game I've played, escpecially mmos.  The combat is similar to GW2 or DDO, where it's action oriented with no auto-attack but you have a target; well, soft-target since it targets whatever is closest unless you lock the target. This game is so good I wish they would overhaul Anarchy Online and use the same quest, skill, and ability system; it would fit there perfectly, and they already ported it to the same game engine.  If wishes were dollars I'd be a billionaire.			"

You need to think about everything, lots of easters, achievments, you can create hero with abilities you chose from, only thing that stops you from playing secret world is issues from the real one. Greatest mmo i played so far... why? I  created illuminati chick with bad♥♥♥♥♥spells which is actually work in action. Well... you can buy and smoke cigars, drink, emotes, ♥♥♥♥ing hell... and that dark ironic atmosphere is driving me happy, so ♥♥♥♥ing happy. You still dont own this story breaking and amazing MMO?

I bought it when it was first released and played for years to come.Since I've tried to find an MMO that I felt had as much depth as well as a breathtaking atmosphere and nothing could compare.  That is until I got my mitts on The Secret World (again by Funcom - it appears they got my number).  So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.Story:One of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.  The questing and story mission are some of the best I've ever experienced in any game, much less an MMO.  The number of story missions, main missions and side missions is staggering, but what's even more staggering is that they all interweave into each other, contributing to the overarching story as a whole.  Everything feels connected and it's the most rewarding solo experience in a game I've played to date.Multiplayer:At first, I thought the multiplayer aspect of the game was sorely lacking, but upon joining the Sanctuary chat channel and finally getting powerful enough to start enjoying dungeons, playing with a team really opened up.  Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.Character depth:The reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.Atmosphere:Graphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).  Community:I've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.Overall:If you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.			"

												This game is mindblowing. I have been playing mmos since UO, and I seriously started to think that the mmorpg genre can't show me anything new. I was wrong, and this game gave me back my faith. We can often meet with the expression of a game having no ""level system"" which is always untrue, only the hardcore fanboys/girls believe it strongly. In a hidden way there is always a level system. However in the case of The Secret World my statement is only partially true! You get XP, and by reaching the right amount you get one of the two types of points. One type is used to purchase skills, one is to level up the abilities needed to wear better stuff. So basically if you want to equip endgame items, you need more xp, so thats paralel to a leveling system, since a new character cannot equip lvl 10 talismans for eg. but pretty much that's it. The skill system is amazing! Confusig at first sight, but in reality it's so simple, yet refreshing and new. And there are lots of skills. Lots, but not overwhelmingly lot. Amazing flexibility, you can really mix anything with anything, you can mix guns with magic or meelee weapons, no matter what you choose, if you choose the right skills for your 2 weapons, you will be succesful.The story is awesome. The game is filled with cutscenes, everything is fully and nicely voiced. You can skip them though. If you hate the ""next-next-next-accept-close-next-next"" type of games, you'll loooove this one. If you love stories, you'll love this one. Why? Because accepting a quest is EASY. 2 clicks, open and accept. And you know what type of quest is that from it's color and icon, even before opening it. If you want it's story, you'll have a cutscene. You don't like it? Just skip it, and go. You don't have to wait. Story maniacs, like I am can find many NPC to interact with with a small symbol. If you ask them, they will tell you stories and information. Again: fully voiced.Sounds are awesome. Period. What about the music? Astonishing! Beautiful. Period. The kind of music which I can listen outside the game, too. Soundeffects are also super. Graphically the game is nice, and runs smoothly on almost max graphs on my few year old, veeeeeryfar from atomic-high-über gaming PC. It has surprisingly few errors. I only found one so far, my sword sometimes goes trough my character's arm, which is pretty good comparing to other mmos (WoW: worgen's fur vs armor, rings a bell to anyone?).As for the atmosphere... AMAZING. Gloomy, but not depressing, apocalypic feeling, cool horror monsters and some quests really bring the true horror feeling. Also the game has brutally CHALLENGING (I mean it!!!) puzzles, if you are as clever and educated like me, you'll only need the chat or the game's ingame internet browser (yeah, for obvious reasons they made one) 50-70% of the time. From deciphering morse codes, to translating latin texts, to finding things in a Bible, realizing a painter's or a composer's name, there are tons of things which gives you the feeling that you're inside of a treasure hunting movie with a freemasonic theme.This game is pure genious. Some monsters become repetitive after a while, it's a common mmo sickness. Luckily you can choose to start another type of quest instead, if you don't want to butcher anymore, and when you would get too tired of the monsters, you'll be sent to the next areas.My biggest problem so far was the fact, that I haven't bought the game with all issues, while on sale, since you can't get them without the game on steam. Now I'll have to buy them for a full price. No, seriously my biggest problem with the game is that you cannot drop a quest. If you want to pause it, you'll have to take another from the same type of quest to take it's place. (There are a certain number of quests from each type that you can have at a time.) But the thing I like in it: if you pause a quest, and later return to take it again, you can continue it from the point you've abandoned it: most quests have steps called tiers, and after completing each tier, you get XP, and after completing the whole line, you'll get the final q reward.If you love mmos, buy it. If you love mystery games buy it. If you love horror, at least watch some gameplay videos! If you prefer gore/guro style things maybe it's not for you, but if you like mild horror too, you'll love it. There were some moments which gave me chills, and in one case I even screamed (:blushes:).			"

												I really love how in depth this game is! It goes so much deeper than what you see on the surface, meaning you actually have to investigate for some missions, looking through the web to crack the codes in game. It's something for those who like a challenge, not your typical mmo at all.One of my tope 3 favorite games of all time hands down!			"

												I have played this game on and off for a while now, can honestly say it is well worth it for the price I got for it on sale.Pros:+ Story is immersive.+ looks pretty good, even at the lowest settings+ isn't terribly optimized. As of writing, I am currently playing on a dell Laptop/tablet, which is thin as hell and does not have beefiest of integrated graphics. It runs at 40 FPS despite this+ Absolutely oozing atmosphere. This is combined with all of the fully voiced cutscenes for almost everything. It must be staggering how many hours of dialog have been recorded for this.+ Scratches that (murder) mystery itch*+ can be played alone or with friends. Soloing is perfectly viable, but it gets lonely in the middle of abomination torn hellscapes.+ The playerbase alive is for the most part. There will be someone to raid with most of the time. (Better with friends though)+ Sound design is superb.Cons:- Combat system is awful tedious, even with optimized builds. It uses a building system, with basic attacks setting up for stronger attacks for the cost of a resource. This is also combined with the idiocy that somehow an M4 isn't tearing through a bunch of waterlogged zombies, or a Spas-12 isn't turning a scarcrow into straw. Nothing has any impact. (This could be subject to change because I heard through the grapevine that combat is getting a few changes at the end of March 2017, so this could be moot around then)- Be prepared to go through a ton of older missions to level up, because leveling is an absolute b!tch in this game. I have had to retread a ton of old quests that I already finished for some exp boosts, because the next part of the story would absolutly thrash my @$$. - *The leaps in logic you will have to make for investigation quests will require you to visit a walkthrough routinely, unless you're Sherlock frickin Holmes or an absolute madman. Like seriously, I am not some great intellect but I can say with some confidence that I am not a massive idiot, and the reach I would need to get most of this is absurd, like a BROKEN CLOCK ON THE WALL SOMEHOW REFERNCING A BIBLE VERSE TO LEAD TO A CLUE. If I have to play this game without a walkthrough, I am pretty sure I would be an absolute lunatic by the end of the first story arc.- Takes up a lot of space, file is hueg.			"

												I have only put in about 10 hours so far but I am enjoying it. The graphics are of good quality, So far there seems to be a decent amount of missions. I love that there are no classes and you can just build and build your character. The story line for this game is quite solid as well. I would recommend this game.			"

												This game infected me. For a long time I wanted to play this game, before it came out I was super pumped to play, after it arrived Life situations lead me away from gaming but soon a gnawing feeling came back I kept looking up this game wondering about it. After playing it I was hooked I played for all 32 hours straight I was sickened by the amount I played and time and energy put into the game. So I put it down immersed myself in school and family and yet...and yet I never forgot about it or stopped thinking about The Secret World... now 8 months later I have returned and I feel this time I wont stop...

												This game is so vastly different than when it first came out.  Yes, the engine is old and clunky, but get past that and you have a top quality MMO with superb voice acting, and incredible storyline, and brilliant open-ended character customization.If you're tired of the rehashes of WoW or EQ, looking for a new genre that can cater to multiple playing styles, don't pass up this gem.

												As a bit of an older player, The Secret World is exactly what I am looking for. Interesting stories? Tick! A bit of horror, a bit of humour? Tick! Challenging quests? Tick! Multiplayer content so I can play with friends? Tick!I love this game and am having a blast. My only concern is that the first couple of hours didnt really do it justice and it wasnt until I got into the first quest zone (Kingsmouth) that it really started to shine. If you are sick of grind and want something thats actually interesting, mature and challenging then this is a great MMO.			"

The game is alive and well, with a vibrant community and constant updates, it's really nice to see.Definitely recommended, quality MMO!			"

												The game story and world building is really amazing. I wish that the main player was voice-acted (I'm spoiled from playing SWTOR and Mass Effect) but for what it is, it's quite good. It does seem to be a bit harder to figure out for new players compared to other MMOs like SWTOR and ESO. Very distinctive and stylish though so an A- overall.			"

												I first experienced The Secret World at PAX 2012 when they had a small demo available to play.  While there I got some Illuminati dog tags and a free code to try out the beta when it became available.  Well, I did the beta and fell in love with the game.  The combat system can be challenging as it gives the player free reign, you can use whatever weapons and skills you want, you can tank, heal tank, dps, heal, or heal by causing damage (leech heal).  The storyline is the best of any game I have ever played.  If you love story driven games, this is the game for you!  The incorporate lore and stories from all over the world, the in-game lore items are an amazing read and gives you some insight into the NPCs you encounter.  Overall, its a great game, optimization is the only downside to this game as running DX11 can cause random crashes and frame drops.  On DX 9 it's still graphically good, but fps can still be an issue.			"

												For what it's worth, the base game of Secret World is fun and very immersive. It's also great fun to co-op. However, the end game content is lacking. There's not much point in having alts since you can easily respect your character. Plus, the ""missions"" for each faction can be are terribly frustrating so once you get through you'll be hard pressed to ever want to do them again. Dungeon running is fun but it takes a lot of time and practice to get the hand of it and with each new issue (what... I already paid and now I have to pay again!?) you'll find yourself further and further behind.			"

												It's an amazing game, the investigation missions are unique and very fun to play. However, the client is 40Gb for no real good reason - the only thing stopping me from keeping it installed and playing it more often. If HDD space is of no concern, I would highly recommend this game!			"

												First of all, this is an MMO -- so it suffers from the usual MMO problems such as network lag, grinding and cash shop.However, as far as MMOs go, it's actually quite good. The story writing is surprising for an MMO, and they hand out experience generously -- there is no penalty for advancing in the game, and you keep getting progress no matter what. Most of the game can be soloed, although you'll probably hit a problem or two along the way, especially if you don't have dungeon- or cash-gear. Still, it feels much less penalizing for me than other MMO""RP""Gs did.The progress itself is extremely fast, but feels very slow -- while you have hundreds of ""abilities"" that you can get, and points just keep rushing in, you can only ever equip 7 (or 8, if you count the special aux weapon ability). So, for the most part, you'll just spend your points on abilities that you'll never use, which fills up your ability wheel but doesn't change the game.Same goes for weapon skills -- most of the time you'll just advance weapons that you don't use, because you've already maxed out the weapons that you do use... so, again, spending points all the time for only cosmetic progress as your skill bars fill up and the game stays the same.If you have access to good gear then you're probably running dungeons. Since you can get all abilities and use all weapons, you're not locked into a specific role (like DPS, healer or tank) --instead, just get suitable gear for each role, get familiar with a set of abilities useful for that role, and you can just switch your setup whenever you want.Bottom line -- it's still an MMO, but one that feels recommendable enough. It's definitely not a ""thumbs down"". "

												I throughly Enjoy this game once in awhile, I played it alot just when it was released, ran Endgame content, which, while buggy as hell, was fun to do, Abilities, Spells, Passives, and Aux weapons are all fun to play with and make weird crazy synergies, and quite honestly, if it weren't because I mostly play games with friends to have fun, and none of them seems to like this game, I'd probably have more then 5000 hours by now.The story is pretty catchy if you actually read into the quests, or just watch the cutscenes unfold, there are some funny and some interresting NPCs and characters in general, I like the gear system, and loved the Fashion system, you can look however you want and not have it mess with stats at all, and planning and synergizing skill and strategies with allies in Dungeons, and Raids, aswell as Nightmare areas, are really fun, (though you do get groups that don't communicate at all, but that's the same in all games).The UI is wank, and the game is still to this day riddled with bugs, though it's alot less bad then during release, and getting higher up in gear level can be tedious to start with, but it has alot of good qualities that overshadow its flaws for me, and what problems the game has, I can live with.Would I recommend this game to people?Well, ask yourself, do you like a deep skill system can allows synergies between weapons and spells you didn't even realise were there? Yes? WellDo you bother following the narative of a games story as you progress through it? Yes?Do you like quests that challenge you, not nessesarily your character in the game, but you as a player, that have to sit down and actually do some research to get on with certain quests? Yes to this too?Well does the game being buggy at times put you off, that said alot of it is minor now, and you can usualy work around it? If it doesn't put you off from a game, then absolutly I'd recommend it! It's a great game and very fun to mess with, Builds, Dungeons, and some pretty interresting quets await ahead in this game.All this said, I'll mention that the game does have PvP, but I'm not much of a PvP'er so I've barely touched it, it seemed okayish to me, but my guess it that there are probably 2-5 builds that completely dominate the PvP Areas, and that if you don't play those that you won't do too well, but I don't know for sure, this review is all from the PvE aspect of the game for me.

												The story is something I'd like to see. I wish there were more MMOs with a horror theme and a real-world setting.But this is one I cannot enjoy. There's a lot of 'stealth' and timing elements that are very hard, impossible for me. There's a lot of frustration looking for well-hidden and hard to find objects. Every mission is repeatable and I find myself doing the same ones over and over instead of finding new ones. It gets boring.Combat is weak compared to other MMO games and the character development system gives the illusion of free will but really traps you into buying a set of skills with synergies or else having a terribly innefective character.It's hard to get a group together and the world looks vacant with very few other players.I'm disappointed in my purchase and will be going back to LotRO. That being said, I'm sure there' an audience for this game. Just be aware that it's got a very high element of a scavenger hunt. It's complicated, rather than complex, and a lot of times it's east to be totally lost as to where to go or what to do next.			"

												There're no good nor bad MMOs. Every MMO is tailored for different kind of people, some MMOs focus on storytelling, some on good combat, role-playing, trading and crafting. I never recommend MMOs, I just say what I like/dislike, because in the end, it's all about personal preferences. I gotta say that The Secret World is a pretty good game. But I did not like it.I've played the game for 10ish hours, which is not nearly enough to fully understand an MMO, but it's enough to grasp the basics and realize if I like the game or not.Let me tell you how I felt during my time playing.So right after I clicked the character creation button, 3 factions popped up - Illuminati, Templars, Dragon (which is some Chinese organization?) - and I got to see a video for each one, showing me what's their ideology. I picked Illumati as they seemed the most appealing to me. Cinematic rolls in, recapitulating what happened during the last week. Long story short - a bee flew in my mouth, gave me super powers and apparently now some weird energy bursts out of me from time to time (not in a sexual way). Alright, the story is a little bit odd, but let's run with it. After 10 mins of high-quality cinematic experience, I have sudden need to go pick my laundry. I meet this Russian guy, let's call him cousin Roman - and he tells me he's being watched by the Illuminati, I look around and soon find their base located nearby in an old building (not so super secret afterall eh?). All of a sudden I'm being dragged by some guys, screen goes dark and when I wake up, an Einstein-looking mofo greets me, I go through briefing and finally get to weapon selection room, where I picked two of 9 possible weapons. Up until now I was actually fine with what was happening, despite the fact that the story might not be the best one ever. What really throws me off is how all the weapon animations and poses look like - one of the main things, that make me interested in an MMO, is how I feel when playing my character - it doesn't matter whether I play as a cute anime chick or a muscular man. Or a muscular anime chick. Whatever it is, I just want to feel like a bonafide badass and The Secret World has the exact opposite effect - I made a pretty cool-looking character, but after I got to try out the weapons, I felt like a cringey, awkward neckbeard weaboo warrior. The pistols don't even aim at their target, I just shoot them in random directions and the bullets land regardless, the swords remind me of The Blade[imgur.com] meme and the magic... why even put magic in such a mature, modern world? It's all such an odd mashup, as if the developer was trying to put in as many different combat styles as possible, but I really don't think it's necessary.Alright, weird story and awkward animations, I can live with that. After that I went through a portal thingy and got ported into a heaven-like place with a bunch of giants chilling around. Scratch the mature, modern world, forget I ever said that. We full fantasy now. I went through another portal and found myself in a post-apocalyptic world, where human survivors fight zombies and finally got a taste of combat, gotta say it was a bitter taste. At this point I have 4 abilities, 2 for each weapon type, which would be fine, if only there was at least some synergy between them - but there wasn't. I could mash the same single-target button, switch it out with an aoe button from time to time, but I didn't feel like it makes any difference. Also my buttons felt unresponsive, like every ability needs to finish its animation before I can do stuff, which I'm not a fan of either. As my next ability, I picked a drone, not only did it not synergize with my kit at all, it also seemed to be completely useless. This combat just doesn't make me feel like a badass at all, it makes me feel lame, slow and bored. It's just not fluid enough, not fun for me. Instead of being a god among humans, I'm a weaboo neckbeard gun-wielding ninja warrior.I really like the quest system, you can find quests pretty much wherever you go, no giant exclamation marks above NPC heads, you just talk to them, or find a random item laying around in the world and voilá quest started. I also gotta compliment the crafting system, which involves disassembling and assembling all kinds of items. Character customization is also well done and the game doesn't seem to be pay-to-win. However, I can't play without a combat system that I'd enjoy, that's the dealbreaker for me.Ever since WoW's Cataclysm, I've been desperately trying to find an MMO that would fit my tastes, played over 25 different ones. Is The Secret World ""the one""? Unlikely. I might give it another shot, perhaps the combat gets better eventually, but at this point I say no, I still like WoW more, even though I don't really like it. Gotta love WoW. And hate it. Eat donkey d, Blizzard. "

Develop content with support from your loyal playerbase and just when your CFO or any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decides he needs more money, you take that content to a new game.

												Amazing game. It's an MMO that plays like a single player game, and the atmosphere and lore are incredibly immersive and detailed. I read that, in some areas, you will hardly ever see any other players (by design) in order to enhance the player's immersion in the environment. Pretty kickass. The Ultimate Edition is a great deal in terms of value, so if you're thinking about buying TSW and wondering which version to get, pick the Ultimate Edition. You'll save a bunch of money on the other issues (storylines) in the long run: you get issues 1-4 with the base game, but you get issues 1-11 with the Ultimate Edition. You also get 30 days of membership, 1200 bonus Funcom points (which you can use to buy issue 12 or 13 if you felt like it), an exclusive outfit, some other items, and a bonus game key for the standard edition of the game that you can give to a friend. It really is worth it to get the Ultimate Edition over the base game.			"

												I was thoroughly enjoying the setting and stories. I downloaded this game based on the Extra Credits review, especially the section about the investigation missions.My only problem with it is the standard MMO grinding. Yeap, I killed that group of zombies last time I walked around the block and they're back for me to kill again. Killing the baddies in this game is too grindy for my likes. Especially when the baddiest are so frigging powerful. I definitely prefer games where I seem to be making an impact in the world. If I shoot a bad guy in the face I want him to stay dead.However I did really love the setting and storytelling of this game. I just wish I could have gone further.			"

												I was thoroughly enjoying the setting and stories. I downloaded this game based on the Extra Credits review, especially the section about the investigation missions.My only problem with it is the standard MMO grinding. Yeap, I killed that group of zombies last time I walked around the block and they're back for me to kill again. Killing the baddies in this game is too grindy for my likes. Especially when the baddiest are so frigging powerful. I definitely prefer games where I seem to be making an impact in the world. If I shoot a bad guy in the face I want him to stay dead.However I did really love the setting and storytelling of this game. I just wish I could have gone further.			"

												TSW has the most original and innovative approach towards online gaming I have personally expierenced. With missions running the gamut from killing ""X amount of zombies"" to ""recreate this missing classical score""(or else it gets the poison again!), and even solving riddles told entirely in base 10; there is truely somthi ng for everyone. TSW is a magnificent adventure to be had, but truth be told, some of the puzzles are insinely overcomplicated... and thats where playing with friends really makes this title shine. If you play regularly in a group, this is not to be missed.p.s.all investigations work on the honor system, no cheatsies!			"

												Super rich story and atmosphere. That is what hooked me to this game and it never misses a beat there. The combat is pretty basic, but the best thing about it is the variety at which you can choose your skills from. There is little chance that you and another player will have the exact same build, unless you are using the preset kits. The missions in this game can be very challenging! So challenging that they installed an in game browser so you can look up clues in your missions. Which can range from morse code, quotes from the bible and sheet music, which all in all make for a really rewarding experience.			"

Review - some tips for upgrading at the endI am an MMO Snob.   What does this mean?   I love the idea of MMOs and have loved the idea since it first was given a name (I beta tested Ultima Online).    However, I am really picky about game play and the vast majority of MMOs because of how the stories and quests are laid out I believe I would prefer as single player.   Like I said a snob.The Secret WorldIs an exception for me.   It uses similar MMO mechanics, but the way the story is laid out and the reasoning behind why there are many of people running around just works for me in this MMO.   Also it has a one of a kind atmosphere and story.   If you are a fan of Horror, Urban Fantasy, Conspiracy Theories, Urban Legends, and the Supernatural then this MMO has all of that.   There is no other game out there (including single player) that quite catches this atmosphere.   I'd love to play some of those if they existed.This MMO can be played solo for the most part, or with a group.   There are some side DUNGEONS that you need to group up to play (they are cool) but, they are optional.The game has basically three varieties of quests.   It has your standard quests you'd expect from MMOs with killing something, fetching something, delivering something , etc.It has sneaky quests where the goal is to destroy or sneak around.It has these puzzle quests... and yes they are TOUGH and intended to be so.   Many of them you couldn't solve on your own unless you happened to be a genius biblical scholar.   However, the game has a browser built in or you can even launch a browser outside of the game.   It is intended that you use web pages and such to help you solve these puzzles.   They are COOL.   I doubt anyone could solve them all without searching the web.   There are also numerous sites offering walk throughs that are helpful in this.   You can pound at them and try to solve them and then when you start to get frustrated enough you are thinking about stopping go hit a walk thru and continue on, or you can use the Walkthroughs to power through these quests and still experience the story and vicariously feel as though you solved them.   It leaves this to the player's choice, so they work well.They recently updated the game so special currency you could only earn through PvP you can get just playing the game in general.   This is used to purchase nifty special items.If you hate MMO mechanics that might wear on you like it does for me.If the atmosphere and story appeal to you though you may find that it is easy to overlook that like it is for me.UPGRADING EXISTING ACCOUNTSOnce you purchase this you'll get a new steam key.I get the key by going to LIBRARY then GAMES then Right click on The Secret World and click View CD Keys.   Click on the ulitmate edition.   Click copy to clipboard.   Go to the Secret World website and login to your account.   In the lower left corner is a KEY REGISTRATION area... put this key there and click register... then scroll to the bottom of the page again and tell it GO to apply it to your account... then scroll to the bottom again and click CONFIRM.   You can then purchase any of this stuff for 0 in the in game store.My older ReviewThe mechanics in this game are not anything earth shattering.   If I were basing this review on that alone this would get a downvote from me.   However, it has a very cool atmosphere, and a great story.   It is unique from that perspective and in my opinion is worth the price of entry just to enjoy some of the environments and stories.			"

												What i can say for now - Not a bad game. Combat system is crap, to be honest. Character customization is good from one side, but bad from other. Few faces to choose, few eyebrows, few lips and noses. Few skin colors and they are bad.Each face has its own preset colors. For example, face No1 can have white man skin color, but face No2 can have light brown as lightest color. No racism intended =).With clothing it is much better. You can wear T-shirt and vest above it.Two combat styles for character, your choice. Pistols, sword, chaos magic etc. Combine as you like.Best thing about this game is plot. How many MMO`s with plot you know?  Star Wars the Old Republic maybe? This game has voiced dialogues. It can be played alone and that is good. You don`t need to wait for group.			"

												Never thought that i would spend so much time playing a MMORPG, but i dont regret any minute in the secret world. Mainly because most of the time it doesnt feel like a common MMORPG. Its way too sophisticated for that, in every aspect.I especially like the cutscenes for Main quests, well written and directed, which adds to the dense atmosphere the setting already provides. And the huge amount of clothing for your character.			"

												This game is AWESOME! It's quite emmersive. There are 3 types of quests. Main quests, side quests, and small quests. Main quests and side quests consist 3 types of quests, Action quest (the usual fighting stuff except most of the time you have good reason to do it), Sabatoge quests (these are inflitrating something, usually an underground hideout, or some sort of enemy related building, and well.... you sabatoge it with various things to do), and Investigation missions (these are what seperates the secret world from everything else. Basically it's an ARG where you have to find clues, solve puzzles, and investigate things both in and out of the game with reasearch via google and books). Small quests are just small things like go from point A to point B and do something or fight these monsters. The more generic quests. And every quest besides small quests have a fully voiced cinematic cut scene. Combat is very free and open. The only downside that's preventing me from playing right now is that I don't have anyone friends who play it and the game is significantly better with friends. #4EverAlone :(			"

												I have played through much of the starting area and I have to say that it is one of the most innovative MMMOs I have ever played. It is uniquely story-driven compared to many other MMOs that have story elements tacked onto fighting in order to level up. Of course, with any MMO one aspect is to see your character advance. The Secret World is no different but FunCom has somehow removed the grinding elements. You can learn any skill and max it out if you wish—so there's very little sense that you can ever screw up and select an ""unworkable build"". Instead, you take the abilities you've learn and configure them so that they work well together. No re-spec is necessary. Gear is important, but not absolute, and its readily available.If you're the sort of person that ""wants to love their MMO"" but somehow just quits without ever going very far, this may be the game for you. Now that it is subscription free like Guild Wars 2, playing is a one time investment. There is a real world store but it sells consumables and cosmetics which are unnecessary. There are even ways within the game to get new outfits without spending any real world cash.If this goes on sale at Steam, I heartily reccomend it.			"

												The Secret World is great game but with some flaws. Repetitive quest lines and missions to do over again to just rank up a higher level to get past a ""bump"" in the story line. The area that you start out will last 20hrs or even more, putting skills up and leveling. And to end up going to a new world of the game of doing the same thing over again.(Would I recommend this game? Yes, if you can manage this through with out breaking though.)A fun MMORPG game with interesting combat features and story.			"

												There would have been a time when I would have not recommended The Secret World; always a conceptual marvel, beautifully told and voice-acted through episodic adventures, but hampered though combat too clunky and obtuse to prevail over its ridiculously harsh difficulty scaling.This has since changed, a complete rebalancing of mobs and streamlining of its combat system allowing the game to finally play to all its collective strengths; the storytelling, music, atmosphere, freedom of choice, art direction, wardrobe system, lack of handholding... it's all still there, no longer burdened by everything in between.This of course raises an important question: is The Secret World still an archaic behemoth true to Funcom's mixed legacy? Well... yes, but consider it a massively more intuitive one as of my recent revisiting -- a fan without question.			"

												Simply put: Don't buy the game standalone.  I don't mean don't buy the game, I mean don't buy THIS particular version of the game.  The Ultimate Bundle is what you actually want to buy.  Why?  Because the Ultimate Bundle comes preloaded with almost all of the expansions for the game (you'll also get $10 worth of Funcom Points upon completing your first 30 quests; I recommend using this to buy Issue #12).If you buy this there is no upgrade option, you'll end up having to buy the Ultimate Bundle which is basically buying the game twice.  Either that or you can buy the expansions if you want, but that'll cost you more than just buying the Ultimate Edition.  So in summary, the game itself is GREAT, I absolutely recommend it.  But buy the Ultimate Edition so you won't end up having to buy it twice, and you'll save a bunch of money on the expansions!			"

												This game is simply amazing, it's total unique and gives you a gaming experience you never had before. The story telling and the setting is fenomenal. There are quest where's no hand holding, and you have to solve a mystery (they are super hard, and super satisficing to complete them). Also there's constant content updates, and it's not pay to win.The only con, that I can think of, and this only alone may make some people don't want to play is the combat system. It's quite slow, if you know these games, I would say it's  Guild Wars 1 and Final Fantasy XIV combination.			"

												There would have been a time when I would have not recommended The Secret World; always a conceptual marvel, beautifully told and voice-acted through episodic adventures, but hampered though combat too clunky and obtuse to prevail over its ridiculously harsh difficulty scaling.This has since changed, a complete rebalancing of mobs and streamlining of its combat system allowing the game to finally play to all its collective strengths; the storytelling, music, atmosphere, freedom of choice, art direction, wardrobe system, lack of handholding... it's all still there, no longer burdened by everything in between.This of course raises an important question: is The Secret World still an archaic behemoth true to Funcom's mixed legacy? Well... yes, but consider it a massively more intuitive one as of my recent revisiting -- a fan without question.			"

												Simply put: Don't buy the game standalone.  I don't mean don't buy the game, I mean don't buy THIS particular version of the game.  The Ultimate Bundle is what you actually want to buy.  Why?  Because the Ultimate Bundle comes preloaded with almost all of the expansions for the game (you'll also get $10 worth of Funcom Points upon completing your first 30 quests; I recommend using this to buy Issue #12).If you buy this there is no upgrade option, you'll end up having to buy the Ultimate Bundle which is basically buying the game twice.  Either that or you can buy the expansions if you want, but that'll cost you more than just buying the Ultimate Edition.  So in summary, the game itself is GREAT, I absolutely recommend it.  But buy the Ultimate Edition so you won't end up having to buy it twice, and you'll save a bunch of money on the expansions!			"

												the secret world or, tsw as it is known by its ever growing fan base, is a free to play open world rpg adventure game. I looked into this when i got tired of fps games, and endeavored to find something different to indulge my minds ever yearning need to be placated. no easy task i can assure you, but tsw hits the mark, it has a story line which will take you from the gloomy rural outskirts of kingston town all the way to the frozen warewolf ridden hell of transilvania, along the way you will run through, tombs, deserts, hidden tree fortresses, grave yards, and encampments of npcs ready to guide you on your way as you journey through the vast and diverse landscape that is the secret world. the story line itself is complex, and if you fail to watch part of it you will find yourself wondering what is going on throughout the rest of the game, but then half the fun of this game is that you do actually learn from it, and its maturity level is fairly high, unless you have an iq of 140 and consider yourself to be ""quite the historian"" or your primary place of residence is in a library i doubt that you will get all of the obscure historical references left by the game on hand, and will more than likely have to do a bit of light reading before it all starts to take form. to be fair, I think i learned more from this game about ancient european history and folklore than i did in school. you will also find that unless you have that knowledge you will probably be looking up solutions to quests online quite frequently, i know very few people that can speak all the languages that you would need to know to even begin to fathom what the quest is asking you to do. but that doesnt really work against it, the game has a built in browser for exactly that purpose, which has been adjusted to provide search results that will only give you a clue as to the answer and not give the entire game away.they have obviously put alot of thought into it, and i liked that it took me a whole year to level up just to complete the main ability tree, it keeps you focused and goal oriented for a long time, even after you have finished the main story line, there are sub stories and seasonal stories constantly being released, plenty of which are free to play. id look into this one if you like adventure games, or rpgs, or massive online multiplayer games, and also enjoy an intellectual challenge, this might have what your looking for.

Ingame shop has cool and conveneinet stuff, but nothing you really need, which should be the point of an Item Shop. Membership gives you some pretty cool perks, but similarly, nothing you really need. Which should be the point.Overall, best fantasy MMO I've ever played. Plenty of new stuff regularly.

												Hey all !Just want to put few words in here about this tittle. I have been playing MMORPG for over a decade now. Seen better and worst many times before. The secret world is definitely worth your attention if: you like horror climate in games, if you like freedom from start of the game, if you likke innovative ways to build and progress your character, if you dont mind progressing through most of the game on your own and dont mind spending lots of time looking for groups. Then this game is a perfect choice. Myself however i had a large issue with lack of group runs on the low level, i dont mean QL1 or 2 here i mean QL5 and above. Sadly there is no groups for new players, yes the Sanctuary chat is friendly and full of people but none of them is willing to do group runs below QL10 cause they dont get anything out of it. The facebook page is almost dead and apart from devs putting up the news there the response is very very little. Seem that the game is largely populated by high level players who dont bother with newbies. No LFG tool also does not help in this type of game as fresh players have no way to learn their class in group. Personally i think this takes a lot of good out of this game. MMORPG is all about teaming up with people and overcoming obstacle in groups and i am sad to say but you will not see this in here untill you waaaaay deep into the game and bored of feeling that you play another single player rpg.Iam recommending this game as a good game on its own but not for hard fans of team work.

												Currently at Savage Coast.This game has a lot of mixed reviews, and for good reasons.I bought this game last year (I think) and it's sat uninstalled since the first time I played it. At the time, I couldn't figure out what I was doing because I was focussed on other stuff and couldn't be bothered trying to get into something new (my own fault, obviously).But anyway! Installed it recently again and I've got to say it's excellent in some ways. The story and overall concept is absolutely brilliant, I love it. Modern setting in a good looking environment and plenty of cool places for roleplaying. Unlike most MMORPGs (including Champions Online, which is a favourite), the questing doesn't feel linear at all. I haven't had two quests that have felt the same, and I've completed more than I can count. The combat is great fun aswell, though I would prefer it if this game was gamepad compatible. Still, other than that, no complaints really. Questing gets tough though, and you have to pick your upgrades carefully or you'll not enjoy your time. Playing with another person (preferably someone you know, who is an active player) is insanely good fun!The character customisation is great, appearance you might find a little limited. But then again, I say that after playing Champions Online which is simply insane when it comes to your character's appearance choices. Speaking of CO, this game is pretty much Free Form the whole way through. You're not stuck to any particular tree of abilities, and you can even (if you have the patience) keep going until you get enough skill/ability to points to unlock ALL the powers *insert raised torch* and alter your build however you please. It's pretty endless, and there seems to be new content every year which is really cool.The environments themselves look great, from London to Egypt this game offers some great adventure. The enemies are well designed and sometimes things get pretty spooky...also BIG THUMBS UP FOR VOICE ACTING!The loading times are...horrific, at least for me. Just logging in takes longer than you'd think necessary, and then switching from Agartha (probably didn't spell that properly!) to London is equally as irritating. Updates aswell...despite being able to get 1.9mb/s on Steam, the game launcher gives me an average of below 1mb/s and just goes up and down seemingly without end.Weapons/Talismens seem scarse. I've completed a lot of quests and so far only received one weapon (that I actually use with my powers). However, I found the auction house to be very helpful and the rare weapons you buy with tokens from completing quests in specific areas give you a great punch! The community has to be one of the best I've come across. Very helpful, there's always someone around to help out. The RP community is very good aswell, the TSWRP addon from Curse makes it very comfortable to create a character. The lore also is very clear so there's not much confusion to be found.Consumables are suprisingly fun, SMOKING A CIGAR HEALS YOU IN THIS GAME. Also, they're cheap (in the Horned God bar) which makes it handy for characters who want to have a shmok'! Great game for Roleplayers, great game for PVPers, great game overall with just a few flaws that can be overlooked with ease. Also, anyone calling this game ""pay to win"" has either not played the game at all or have some other reason to moan about a problem that doesn't exist in this game.8/10, may seem a bit of a high score considering the flaws but in this case the benefit SERIOUSLY outweighs the cost.

Review - some tips for upgrading at the endI am an MMO Snob.   What does this mean?   I love the idea of MMOs and have loved the idea since it first was given a name (I beta tested Ultima Online).    However, I am really picky about game play and the vast majority of MMOs because of how the stories and quests are laid out I believe I would prefer as single player.   Like I said a snob.The Secret WorldIs an exception for me.   It uses similar MMO mechanics, but the way the story is laid out and the reasoning behind why there are many of people running around just works for me in this MMO.   Also it has a one of a kind atmosphere and story.   If you are a fan of Horror, Urban Fantasy, Conspiracy Theories, Urban Legends, and the Supernatural then this MMO has all of that.   There is no other game out there (including single player) that quite catches this atmosphere.   I'd love to play some of those if they existed.This MMO can be played solo for the most part, or with a group.   There are some side DUNGEONS that you need to group up to play (they are cool) but, they are optional.The game has basically three varieties of quests.   It has your standard quests you'd expect from MMOs with killing something, fetching something, delivering something , etc.It has sneaky quests where the goal is to destroy or sneak around.It has these puzzle quests... and yes they are TOUGH and intended to be so.   Many of them you couldn't solve on your own unless you happened to be a genius biblical scholar.   However, the game has a browser built in or you can even launch a browser outside of the game.   It is intended that you use web pages and such to help you solve these puzzles.   They are COOL.   I doubt anyone could solve them all without searching the web.   There are also numerous sites offering walk throughs that are helpful in this.   You can pound at them and try to solve them and then when you start to get frustrated enough you are thinking about stopping go hit a walk thru and continue on, or you can use the Walkthroughs to power through these quests and still experience the story and vicariously feel as though you solved them.   It leaves this to the player's choice, so they work well.They recently updated the game so special currency you could only earn through PvP you can get just playing the game in general.   This is used to purchase nifty special items.If you hate MMO mechanics that might wear on you like it does for me.If the atmosphere and story appeal to you though you may find that it is easy to overlook that like it is for me.UPGRADING EXISTING ACCOUNTSOnce you purchase this you'll get a new steam key.I get the key by going to LIBRARY then GAMES then Right click on The Secret World and click View CD Keys.   Click on the ulitmate edition.   Click copy to clipboard.   Go to the Secret World website and login to your account.   In the lower left corner is a KEY REGISTRATION area... put this key there and click register... then scroll to the bottom of the page again and tell it GO to apply it to your account... then scroll to the bottom again and click CONFIRM.   You can then purchase any of this stuff for 0 in the in game store.My older ReviewThe mechanics in this game are not anything earth shattering.   If I were basing this review on that alone this would get a downvote from me.   However, it has a very cool atmosphere, and a great story.   It is unique from that perspective and in my opinion is worth the price of entry just to enjoy some of the environments and stories.			"

												What i can say for now - Not a bad game. Combat system is crap, to be honest. Character customization is good from one side, but bad from other. Few faces to choose, few eyebrows, few lips and noses. Few skin colors and they are bad.Each face has its own preset colors. For example, face No1 can have white man skin color, but face No2 can have light brown as lightest color. No racism intended =).With clothing it is much better. You can wear T-shirt and vest above it.Two combat styles for character, your choice. Pistols, sword, chaos magic etc. Combine as you like.Best thing about this game is plot. How many MMO`s with plot you know?  Star Wars the Old Republic maybe? This game has voiced dialogues. It can be played alone and that is good. You don`t need to wait for group.			"

												TSW gives an interesting spin on the Fantasy genre by placing it in a modern setting rather than the classical Middle Ages theme.  It bares more resemblance to a Lovecraftian horror than a Tolkien work, dubbed by my friends ""Call of Cthulu; the video game"" (even if only few parts have sanity meter mechanics).Settings include a small town in New England overrun by undead, a city in Egypt fighting against a new uprising of one of its ancient foes, and a series of post-Soviet occupation Trannsylvanian towns besieged by vampires and werewolves.The foes run the gambit from classic design to compleately reimagined, whatever needed to fit into a modern setting.  Zombies in track suits, golems made of scrap metal, cultist in hoodies, and vampires covered in parkas and gas masks (to protect themselves from the sun, duh), scuttling wendigo, sloshing dragur, glowing will-o-wisps and more.Characters are distinct and memorable, with NPCs that will make you laugh audibly, cry physically, and moments that will make you go ""what the f###?!?""  Every one of my friends who have played this game have a favorite, and a least favorite, character.  Dialogue is well written, better than some TV shows.Quests vary between standard assult and dungeon missions that require slaying of hordes of mosters (or one big one), sabotage missions that require tact and subterfuge, and research missions that involve extensive out-of-game study.I cannot emphasise the awesomeness of research missions enough; they are incredible in-depth puzzles and can make you do anything from learn arabic to visit game-based websites on the real world internet to scribble notes about demon runes like a madman.  The lazy can simply Google search for a walkthrough, but those who enjoy mystery will have a blast connecting the dots.As a MMO RPG, it still suffers the stanard MMO RPG flaws; other players mercing your tagets before you can reach them, small pools of active players looking for group for the dungeon you want to run, nessicerey grinding to become strong enough to handle the next area, player characters in gaudy outfits providing jarring contrast to the scenery, the silent protagonist, and so on.  However, these flaws don't detract significantly rom the game.When all is said and down, I would recomend this game to any fan of modern fantasy.			"

												I've played, or watched playthroughs of, many ""Lovecraftian"" games in the past, hoping to find something that got the right atmosphere without being overly shock-focused, overly gross-focused, or 3edgy5me.  I'm kinda annoyed with myself that I was not aware of The Secret World before, AND that it took me almost a year between buying it at a sale and finally trying it.  Seriously, wtf me? PROS:  This game is basically the tabletop RPG Call of Cthulhu, but in MMORPG mode.  It hits the atmosphere and puzzles just right without being overly tedious as far as the usual grinding quests go.  The monster designs are fabulous.  Don't just assume that everything is zombies (I know someone who tried the beta then ignored the final release because he assumed that!)  Once you get beyond the starter area the enemy diversity gets super interesting and the world building around them is amazing.  I've also never encountered puzzles like this, ones where you actually have to do real world research in order to figure things out instead of just clicking the shiny things in different orders until something happens. It's inspired me to make some additions to the tabletop game that I run!  The super nice thing is that the really difficult puzzles are just side quests, so you can choose how/when you take them on.  Also, the quest difficuly labels change as you increase your skills/weaponry which makes it a lot easier to choose what to do next.CONS: Unintuitive GUI.  Fortunately you won't be fiddling around with it excessively, but it can definitely make using consumables in a fight difficult.  The fighting itself gets to be rather repetitive and it can be difficult to switch targets, but honestly, they're just there to slow you down, increase the task difficulty and provide drops.  This is not a fight-centric game.  The communicty (at least at the lower levels where I still am) is also not very close-knit.  I haven't encountered any LFGs except for difficult dungeons, just people soloing.  On the other hand, I've had a lot more randoms just jump into a fight to help and then continue about their business once the trouble was over, so that's pretty cool.  I've seen some people mention that this game would have been better as just a regular RPG and I can't really argue with that at this time.OVERALL: the cons aren't nearly enough to keep me away from this game.  It's atmospheric enough to creep me out at times (beautiful sound design, omg) which is really difficult to do, challenging enough intellectually to keep my brain awake, great enough story telling that I've found myself wanting to steal them for my own games, humorous enough that I've taken screen shots for the first time in years, and so on and so on.BRB going to buy all the DLC			"

The game has some of the best stories and I love that fact that every mission has its own fully voiced cutscenes with AAA voice acting. THe devs did not hold any punches when it come to giving The Secret World a super deep and really enjoyable setting ans story. Unlike all the other MMO's out there, this game makes you feel alone, all by yourself. You dont see all these random people running around killing enemies in front you you, crowing towns, ect. They do a great job of managing the servers to devide you up in your own little world. You will come across people here and there but its not common. But if your looking for people to play with, either it be randoms or not, all you do is use the chat and youll have people teleporting to you in no time. there is always tons of active players online at any given moment.The only thing i didnt like at first was the combat. it felt slow, clunky, ect. But i gave it a try and now I love it. Compaired to WOW, this combat is amazing. WOW is way clunkier and slow paced than TSW. So if you liked WOW, youll think this is a dream. I love the Fact that no matter what map of a map you are on, what area you headed, you always run into side missions, investagation missions, ect. At times youll see a few next to each other that you can activate and kill two birds with one stone since one is ""kill X amount of creature"" while the other was ""Investgate X area"" it doesnt happen to oftn but it feels good to get the xp very quickly in one clean swoop. Other games have you running all over the place and back again just to continue on the missions, not TSW. Once the mission was completed you just collect your rewards and xp. And also half of the XP earned will be given to you split up with each TIER of the mission. So if the Mission is 200k xp and is a 5 tier mission, you will get 25k per tier and on the last tier youll get the 100k thats left. You can also pause missions and do them at a later date while starting a ne wone and go back to where you left off, not worring about the lost time or XP. It does well for giving you what you earned.I can go on and on and on but im tired of typing and want to go play some more. If you are the slightest interested in the game, just go and install the free trial and give it a go.BTW, Still a great game			"

												While I feel this game has a myriad of flaws that would otherwise keep it from getting my recommendation, this game captured me in a way that no MMO ever had before. The environments are imaginitive, the characters are interesting, and the quests are some of the best I've experienced in any game, let alone an MMO. Mind you that you have to slog through a lot to get to that sweet core, but it's worth the time I've sunk into it and more.			"

												(Don't let my playtime fool you, I've only spent about 8-10 real hours playing.)I've just recently gotten back into this game after a long hiatus and I've never really examined an mmo in such a way as I have with this one. I guess I'll just start: 1. The game definitely scores well when asked about its battle system and variety. There are plenty of skills to mix and match to create a versatile and powerful character. 2. Time = Success. Like most games, the only way you'll prosper is by spending time in the game and really cracking down on how you build your character.3. EXPLORATION/MYSTERY. It may seem trivial as I continue to explain this, but this game has a special component that makes it stand out when compared to other MMOs. Mystery Solving. Although some aren't very difficult to piece together, it takes a bit more effort than just simply reaching a destination to complete a quest. You must closely examine objects you receive during quests to complete certain puzzles correctly. ----------A short but sweet review. I am still actively playing this and I will change my review as I further experience the game.			"

A quick shotAn excellent, soloable, online game fat packed with Lovecraftian horror, excellent writing, rock-solid and emotive voice acting, spooky atmosphere, adult themes, beautiful rendering of the locales, enjoyablet but not spectacular combat, but massive freedom in choosing how you fight and explore the world; and explore you will if you want to immerse yourself in this game.Grab the Ultimate Edition, and if you can get it on sale them so much the better. Very unique game for folks not looking to grind out pick-up and deliver quests and raid group instances all the time. Very much enjoy this game and I hope the devs find a way out of their financial troubles as this game deserves even more support.Well worth checking out.M13			"

												Play it because it is an immersive, fun, engrossing game. The story is enveloping, the writing wreathed about you in sheets of atmosphere. It is incredible. And, having other people running around doesn't ruin it (my main complaint with MMO games). I actually jump for joy when I see another player hunting for clues to one of the many brutally hard puzzles.This game is beautiful, and the only MMO I enjoy.			"

												If you love story, atmosphere, and immersion (with a spice of horror) in your game, The Secret World is the game for you. The questing system is different and requires a little getting used to because the lore requires you to piece the story together. Once you get hooked on the story and let the immersion shine through, you will find that the other flaws in that game become strangely dim.

												This is probably the only game in the world to frustrate me in a very specific manner.  I enjoy it, it's good, but I'm down right furious that it's not better.  The story and setting is my favorite in gaming and is incredibly immersive.  The actual gameplay however is either just OK or inscrutible.  For instance 95 hours in and I have virtually no idea what my stats do or if my build is good.  The story and the voice acting make up for everything though.  I'll always remember investigating on Solomon Island, or doing missions for the statues in Cairo.  This game should be better!  So it can be everywhere!Edit Feb. 2016 = I've purchased the lifetime sub before it went away, I love the story and presentation but most everything else is either passable to just terrible.  The game has given me an error EVERY time I log out.  Every third or so time I try to log in to the game it either get's stuck on the load screen or the program just ends.  The design of about ten percent of the missions will just infuriate you instead of challenge or engage you.  This game is wonderful by really old school PC standards but in this era of PC programming I expect better.			"

												I've played, or watched playthroughs of, many ""Lovecraftian"" games in the past, hoping to find something that got the right atmosphere without being overly shock-focused, overly gross-focused, or 3edgy5me.  I'm kinda annoyed with myself that I was not aware of The Secret World before, AND that it took me almost a year between buying it at a sale and finally trying it.  Seriously, wtf me? PROS:  This game is basically the tabletop RPG Call of Cthulhu, but in MMORPG mode.  It hits the atmosphere and puzzles just right without being overly tedious as far as the usual grinding quests go.  The monster designs are fabulous.  Don't just assume that everything is zombies (I know someone who tried the beta then ignored the final release because he assumed that!)  Once you get beyond the starter area the enemy diversity gets super interesting and the world building around them is amazing.  I've also never encountered puzzles like this, ones where you actually have to do real world research in order to figure things out instead of just clicking the shiny things in different orders until something happens. It's inspired me to make some additions to the tabletop game that I run!  The super nice thing is that the really difficult puzzles are just side quests, so you can choose how/when you take them on.  Also, the quest difficuly labels change as you increase your skills/weaponry which makes it a lot easier to choose what to do next.CONS: Unintuitive GUI.  Fortunately you won't be fiddling around with it excessively, but it can definitely make using consumables in a fight difficult.  The fighting itself gets to be rather repetitive and it can be difficult to switch targets, but honestly, they're just there to slow you down, increase the task difficulty and provide drops.  This is not a fight-centric game.  The communicty (at least at the lower levels where I still am) is also not very close-knit.  I haven't encountered any LFGs except for difficult dungeons, just people soloing.  On the other hand, I've had a lot more randoms just jump into a fight to help and then continue about their business once the trouble was over, so that's pretty cool.  I've seen some people mention that this game would have been better as just a regular RPG and I can't really argue with that at this time.OVERALL: the cons aren't nearly enough to keep me away from this game.  It's atmospheric enough to creep me out at times (beautiful sound design, omg) which is really difficult to do, challenging enough intellectually to keep my brain awake, great enough story telling that I've found myself wanting to steal them for my own games, humorous enough that I've taken screen shots for the first time in years, and so on and so on.BRB going to buy all the DLC			"

												Almost a thousand hours outside of steam.Best modern day MMORPG.Love steam so I purchased to have a more fluid and central game library.Now I almost always play solo. With the occasional visitor starring in my MMORPG experiances. This game is great for that. SOTNW, TSW, ESO, DDO and STO are my personal top 5 (in no particular order).Bouncing through time, fighting evil.Fun times as my screen shots show:  The Secret World  "

												I have to say I really like this game. Having played multiple MMO's, what fascinates me about this one is it's simplicity. You don't need to spend years figuring out the best builds or the most successful mechanics. People who fancy the sophisticated stuff might dislike that, but I'm really into it.The atmosphere is pretty good (for an MMO at least), and different quest types like sabotage (sneaky-stuff) and investigation (use knowledge and research to solve complex riddles, some of them are really difficult, don't spoil them by cheating) increase the overall feel.Those of you familiar with the works of Lovecraft will find some resemblences in the game, something I'm highly enjoying (especially since I feel there's way too few Lovecraft-themed games out there).It might not have the larges community, the fanciest graphics or the most complex system, but this game has it's own elegance. In a certain way, it is truly unique.If you're looking for a simple, rather easy-to-learn MMO with a rather different setting than most, this one might just be right for you.			"

												This game is far from perfect, but I couldn't care less because it's incredible. I've tried other MMOs, and none have stuck the way this one has.For one, the theme and storytelling is perfect. The characters are amazing, the fully-acted cutscenes are awesome, and the story missions are entertaining even a second time on an alt. As for the theme, it's a fantastic departure from the typical fantasy MMOs, which can be fun, but this is the only MMO I've found that has this particular feel. It's creepy, it's goofy, and it's set in modern day so it feels far more real.For two, the non-story missions don't feel like the typical MMO grind. There are a few ""Kill x monsters"" missions, but even those are typically wrapped in either a great narrative, an interesting location, an interesting mechanic, or all three. It doesn't feel like a grind because those ""Kill x, fetch y"" quests are spread out amongst other, more story-driven missions.The character models could use work, and the starter clothes are crap but there's a lot of room for clothing customization as you progress and gain money. The cash shop doesn't have pay-to-win items, and IMO they're not even edging close to that. It's like 90% hats and pants and weird animal heads. The gear that's for sale is very rapidly outclassed by other gear in-game.Speaking of gear, it's not tied to your clothes at all, so you never have to worry about choosing fashion over power. The weapons each have their own skin, but you can reskin the weapons for in-game money, or you can just disable the weapons so they only show when you're actively using them.A very rambly review, yes, but I couldn't recommend it more highly. There are some weird bugs and weird lag issues, but the story and the atmosphere make it 100% worth your time and money.			"

												tl;dr - Some will be turned away from the lack of convention; however, those who embrace it will be rewarded.Let me first get this out of the way: this game is not for everybody. If you want a typical, linear fantasy story; then, you are going to be very disappointed. The story of the game isn't one fluid narrative, it's the opposite. It tends to give you bits and pieces of what the storyline is as you complete quests, and you don't understand what or why you do things most of the time. Yet, that matters little in a game like this. As matter of fact, that might be the main attraction.The best part about Secret World is the apparent lack of convention. There are no classes, no levels to speak of. The level of freedom with constructing your character is quite refreshing from typical wizard/ warrior/ archer mmo's. If you make a mistake in your build or skill tree, you have the safeguard of knowing you can simply earn more SP or AP to fix your character. It's even possible to earn every skill from every weapon, and every ability from every weapon. As a matter of fact you are given a reward for doing so. The Secret World rewards players for thinking outside the box, I've never used Google to solve a quest up until I played this game. Become very comfortable with the idea that you'll be using search engines for trickier questions and riddles being asked in the game. However, there is an in-game web browser for your convenience, should you choose to use it.Yes there is grinding; but the number of content available and the variability between each quest never makes it feel like you're grinding. You can choose to rush your character to high faction ranking, or you can take your time and explore the game. The game often rewards you with achievements, lore, and some surprises if you choose to do so. This game has arguably one of the best mmo communities I've played in so far. Helpful veterans always help lower level players, and Cabals (the Secret World's version of guilds) are diverse in their members and goals, and players always seem to be working with each other to support other players who ask for help. Cabals can also hold a large number of members (I'm currently in one that has over 250 members).I bought this game on sale, and I am sad I didn't buy this sooner. However, even at full price this game is still a steal. I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for something different and unconventional.			"

												This game is addictive. Gameplay is engaging. The graphics aren't optimized for DX11, but they work great in DX9. The gameplay is rich in story content. There is so much story content it completely and utterly blots out any semblence of a plot. So get engaged and choose a path...because there are no levels. Only levels of reality.			"

												Story rich, classless lvling system, great community and superbe ambiance.The game has some flaws, it suffers mostly from the different budget funded for each episodes with some clearly much better than others.That aside, the world is consistent and enjoyable, either by yourself or in group. The game designers nailed quite well the genra with the secret society and things hidden in plain sights.You will often be challenged to actually read/look for clues in your environment, there is also some puzzles that will take you time and knowlege to solve them, hence the in-game built browser.All in all, a great MMO with a good concept and even the first 4 free episodes are pentyful enough to want to get some more.The classless system is really refreshing too, you almost can't go wrong with whatever you decide to build. There are more optimum builds than others but if you follow the general guidelines you will be all fine.One thing I didn't really liked was the interraction with the secret society. You are a field agent but you hardly have any dealing with your group aside sending reports at the end of missions for rewards. Everything you need to learn is on field.I would have loved a bit more on that aspect but it is relatively minor concern of mine.			"

												I used to hate MMO before this game.PROs:It has everything a great MMO should have:- interesting story (plus I LOVE horror and dark stories in it).- amazing power costumization: you can literally have all the powers in the game and mixing them as you want.- it's challenging: if you are looking for an hard game to beat, this is your game!- awesome factions: you could be Dragon, Illuminati or Templar.CONs:Obviously it's not a flawless game- poor character personalization.- a bit ""rusty"" gameplay that you have to metabolise in order to truly enjoy this game.Best feature:Investigation missions are the real deal for me. They are a series of missions that you can beat just by using your intelligence, intuition and the in-game browser. As the whole game, these missions are a pretty hard challenge, but beating it without the wiki feel so awesome you'll get fast addicted.			"

												The Secret World is my first MMORPG and it really is a quality game. The horror atmosphere is great and the game has 8 large zones that are incredibly varied and range from spooky New England towns through parched desert landscapes in Egypt, vampire infested Transylvania, and finally to Tokyo after an apocalyptic infection.It has a large variety of missions, some with very interesting stories - one big stand out for me was an issue in Egypt that included a section on a train. It felt like being in an Indiana Jones movie.As a rule the community is quite supportive and there is still a stream of new players joining. The server system is such that the population in zones is controlled so it never feels crowded.			"

												The Secret World is a SUPER fun mmo, that has hardly any attention and should be better recognized. The questing system is really good and not boring at all unlike most mmo's which consist of solely fetch quests and the like, you actually feel a sense of accomplishment when completing puzzles, challenges, and missions, not to mention the cool ""class"" system. The game has no set classes so basically whatever kind of weapon you want to use is what you will use and then you will rank up the skills of the weapon. You can use 2 weapons at a time to make your own hybrid set up. Want to combine an AR with magic? You can do that, lots of choice and freedom. Plus its an mmo that is isn't pay to win and doesn't require a monthly sub to play. The game does have a cash shop, but you can only buy cosmetics and unique mounts and clothing in it. No P2W items available. There are also world bosses, dungeons, raids, and a good pvp system in place. All in all The Secret World is a great mmo and needs more time in the spotlight!			"

												The reviews present are largely for 'The Secret World.'  Funcom has relaunched the game with different mechanics.  'Secret World Legends' and 'The Secret World' are two different games.Sadly, I have been forced to provide a negative review, only because Secret World Legends has attempted to co-op The Secret World's reviews.While 'The Secret World is an amazing game with fabulous writing, 'Secret World Legends' is a separate game, and I can't in good faith give it a positive review.  Funcom produced an amazing title with 'The Secret World,' but I will not permit them to decieve potential buyers by simply switching titles.   I can't say enough good things about 'The Secret World,' but 'Secret World Legends' remains up in the air.  I would recommend waiting a time before committing to anything.			"

												I honestly can't play this game anymore.  I tried to give it a chance, it has a pretty interesting backstory to it, but the combat and movement mechanics are just unbearable.  The Movement is slow and klunky and the camera is always fixed.  I spent about 10 minutes reworking the keybindings to try and make the experience more comfortable, but there was still a lot to be desired.  Fighting is especially annoying because the mouse buttons cannot be rebound for attack purposes.  You can get guns, and there is even a way you can aim with a reticle, but trying to use movement keys while mashing another button to attack is just too annoying.			"

There was also an issue this text never displaying properly, and looked closer to some made up language than actual latin characters.

As long as you enjoy the game as it is, nothing to worry about.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  some people criticize the repetitive-ness of the missions and the need to farm/grind to get to the endgame - I myself don't think the game is too much of a grind (8 years WoW speaking here)- it is slightly underpopulated - especially when it's daytime in GMT+1- it is HIGHLY addictive - this should serve as a warning to those who get easily hooked and I mean it.There's just SO much to do, in a COOL environment set in reality. The mythical background stories are immersive as ♥♥♥♥ and you cannot help but notice that the clock somehow shows 10 hours later than when you've looked before :P-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:Get this game, if you're into MMORPGs.Get this game, if you don't wanna spend too much money on a game.Get this game, if you enjoy secrets, mysteries, fantasy tales, conspiracy theories and more.Get this game for a healthy dose of humor, addiction, fantasy roleplay, slicing hoards of zombies, ocean creatures, vampires, mummies, werewolves, ghosts and dancing on the roots of Yggdrasil.Otherwise, ... well, why are you reading this review anyway ?

												Based in a modern world setting The Secret World is very unique and sets itself aside from all the other MMORPGs out there and that is a really good thing when the market is flooded by online games that are all very similar.  The Secret World is not for everybody though. While it is heavily story-driven there's a lot of puzzle solving to do and they're not always easy. One of the things I like the most about the game is the skill tree. Actually, it's not really a skill three but a skill circle, which means you can spend points in everything and make the most hybrid builds ever. Theres lots of possibilities and yes there is no particular ""winning builds"".If you want to discover the mysteries of our world and dig deep in the illuminati's secrets then this game is for you.

												An amazing experience. The start is a bit of a grind, at least back when I played it. However, once you get past the initial starting zone, and you start really realizing what an amazing amount of freedom you have when chosing how to progress your character, the game really opens up. Would definitely recommend if you want a fantastic MMO with a dark and gritty style that acctually challanges you and refuses to treat the player as an idiot.			"

Graphics look very nice even on lower settings so if you don't have a powerful system it'll still look good. I've had a lot of fun in the game.I feel like there's a tad too much grinding but that's down to personal preference.			"

												Based in a modern world setting The Secret World is very unique and sets itself aside from all the other MMORPGs out there and that is a really good thing when the market is flooded by online games that are all very similar.  The Secret World is not for everybody though. While it is heavily story-driven there's a lot of puzzle solving to do and they're not always easy. One of the things I like the most about the game is the skill tree. Actually, it's not really a skill three but a skill circle, which means you can spend points in everything and make the most hybrid builds ever. Theres lots of possibilities and yes there is no particular ""winning builds"".If you want to discover the mysteries of our world and dig deep in the illuminati's secrets then this game is for you.

												Easy recommendation. I really enjoyed this game, it is very unique for a MMO and the story was well done - Lots of content to keep you playing. However, the endgame game play isn't easy to break into, groups are unnecessarily elitist, leaving long queue times, and ultimately the reason I rarely play now. For the price,  0 - end game was well worth it.			"

												Ill be honest, Im no fan of mmo's. But this one did catch my eye, content wise. It has more than any mmo Ive seen so far and thats worth. But for $30... it is not. I bought this game in high hopes paying for such amount was going to be worth. In my opinion it is not, for several reasons. Im not too great at reviewing, but I will say I am gonna try to get a refund.I reccomend this for the people with either no lives or love all MMOs. Youll love it then. Cons-1. Slow gameplay.2. Some levels of p2w but not much.3. lies about being a non-typical MMO4. there is classes, its the weapon types. Another lie.5. Boring solo, and you basically need a friend or 3 at times otherwise youll get lost in a puzzle or will have to grind for a whole 2 days to kill a enemy.6. $30 DOLLARS ? NAH. Id rate it a 20 max.  Theres more but I dont wanna bash a game too hard. And oh i can with this. But lets get on the good parts. Pros:1. Fantastic artwork in my opinion.2. skill tree is alright, better than most.3. The community is good, some will help you level, do quests, and go through dungeons. Mostle helpful. (Some will be trolling aswell.)4. Lots of content, like quite  a damn bit. They sure put work in that. 5. Easy and customizeable design of Hud and easy to use systems.6. If on sale for anything less than 30 dollars. GET IT. comes with free month membership which is how long youll play it.7. Some pretty hard quests and some that are new for any MMO. Like puzzles that you literally have to google details, become a detective, and wander far to figure out.Overall 6/10 for me not liking most MMOs, and a easy 8.5/10 for people who like them. "

												The Secret World or TSW is an excellent MMO produced by Funcom.For starters you can pick up most of the DLC and maingame for just $60 as part of the Ultimate Edition which is about as much as you would have payed for a AAA game without the DLC.Here is a good tip to those who do not know about the ""leveling"" process. Your character can learn every ability and skill in the game and can assign only up to 7 abilities on to two bars, one for actives the other for passive effects. You may be wondering what classes in the game there are, truth is their are none. You are only limited to the combination of weapons such as Pistol and Shotgun or Blood and Sword when it comes to how you play your character. So you might have messed up your build, don't worry, you can repeat any mission except the main storyline missions. As these will provide you with the necessary experience to gain ability points and skill points.Although the setting is modern day and it presents itself in a grim dark fantasy, the story and npcs are very meaningful and quiet human for how they deal with their situations.The most populated shard, according to my research, is Cereberus. I mention this as you may notice that the lower level zones are quiet empty so bringing a friend in is a welcome idea. Although when it comes to raiding and dungeons, don't fret as you can join parties across shards.The game is definetly my recommendation as its very well made for an MMO in today's market.			"

												TLDR:  Go buy this game right now.I came way late to the party to The Secret World, and I'm sorry I did.   This is not only one of the best MMOs ever made, it's one of the best games ever made.  The quality of the quests alone is enough to warrent a purchase, especially now that it's F2P.  In no particular order, why you should buy this game immediately.1.  Character building.  If you like tinkering with characters, this game is like crack.  You can choose any combination of skills and passives at any time, save the build, and switch between them pretty much instantly.  This is a character tinkerers dream.  Once again, worth buying the game *just* for this.2.  The quests.  I'm not usually much one for quests, and I tend to find them boring, poorly thought out and/or written, or really flimsly excuses to get you to go pick up 10 bear asses.  This is the first MMO I've played where I look forward to the next quest string.  The writing is superb, not just for a video game, but in any context.  The voice work is also outstanding.  The game is intelligent, and funny, a great combination.3.  The world.  The game world is really fantastic, and draws you in to the setting very well.  It's easy to suspend disbelief and really buy in to the world.4.  The QUESTSSSSSSSS.  They are so good, and so varied.  There are so many different kinds of quests....it's...amazing really.  There are more good quests in this game than all other MMOs combined in the history of MMOs, and that's not hyperbole, I've played most of them.5.  The challenge.  Both from a combat perspective, and a using your nogging perspective.  You actually have to think in this game to solve some things.  You also have to pay attention to what you're doing and how you're buidling your character.  Random run of the mill quest mobs can and will kill you if you don't pay attention.  I love that.  It's not so hard that it's frustrating, but it's hard enough that it keeps you engaged, unlike every other MMO that more or less lulls you to sleep while leveling.  Leveling in this game is *FUN*....gasp.This game is an absolute steal at 10 times the price, once again, not hyperbole.  Why this hasn't gotten more attention, I'll never know.  Maybe it's too smart for people?  I dont' get it....  This game is amazing, and by far my favorite MMO for ages, and close to being my favorite of all time.This game is in my top 10 games of all time right now, not just MMOs, but anything.  I'm shocked at how good this is, and how little attention it's gotten.  Everyone that is even remotely interested in character progression games should own this.			"

												The Secret World [TSW] is an MMORPG that has a great Storyline. At least thats what i felt. =)Due to my lack of obedience to the publishers rules i unfortunately got banned.But nevertheless i can recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an  MMORPG in a mystery setting that even brings actually challenging riddles to solve.If you do not play for maximum progression you got a really big varienty of skill -and weaponcombinations to choose from and if you are the type who want's to minmax there is enough research material and guids or theory chrafters out there to give you the most efficient build for the things you are doing.

												First off 350 hrs spent and still not done!!! Love this game with the different aspects that it brings to traditional MMO's. There are so many different classes and skills sets that you can really change how you play the gmae to how you look. It's a small company that runs the game and a good group that still maintains the community. Which is friendly compared to others out there (DOTA-sneer) Have no shortage of content if you buy the memership for life which is steep but the content and story makes up for it. There is again no shortage of content or skill building inthis game. Is there a end game? Yes and brings more to the table. The lore and backstory to this game is one that everyone should read and playthrough at lest once. Again 350hrs and still playing. Just check it out before deciding to go full membership. (no subscriptions for full membership and FREE stuff to boot)			"

												Secret World is a very interesting MMO currently on the Market, for a unique still of game like this i would rather have a list of Pros and Cons for it;ProsAmazing QuestsThis game has some of the best MMO quest's i've came across they make you actually think and solve problems. You will need a Bible, know Binary, know Borse code and much more just to complete these quests.Interesting Story/ArtCurrently i can't find a good mmo with a story similar to Secret World it has a very interesting approuch to Mythology. Overall i enjoy the feel of the game.ConsBoring Animations/EffectsCurrently in the games current form the animations/effects are very basic along with the Combat System while i enjoy the idea of the game most of the animations are simple spins with colorful effects tied to them. Nothing to be impressed by and very dull to look at all day not to mention it doesn't give you that feeling of being a Powerful being when you are a ballerina 24/7Confusing QuestsI'm not asking the quests to baby-mode me and i do enjoy the overall idea of the quests however, while they are Amazing they are still confusing... If anyone spends too much time on on quest they will most likely lose intrest and just quit the game. The quests are a double sided sword.PvPPvP on this game is very boring in my eyes... The damage output on the game needs to be overlooked with a few other things to make this game be very successful. However, this could just be a personal opinion when i'm trying to be biased as possible.Try out the game yourself, Its truly something you should experience yourself (As i think almost every game is) Overall the Cons i listed are a few of the things i dislike about the game but you might not see as a Big deal or even enjoy			"

												This is a very underrated MMOG it  is beautifully done and not your run of the mill typical elves and orcs mmog either. The game has a modern setting which is refreshing to say the least and also there are no levels. This is not the type of game you play and worry about grinding to catch up with the vetern player base. I  seriously recommend buying this game if you are looking for a change of pase from all the other MMOG's out there.			"

												Really solid game with a compelling story. The best F2P MMO I have played (paying gives you access to some additional quests and a separate in-game currency, both are not required to enjoy the game). Intriguing story and a nice way of making a modern-setting MMORPG.			"

												One of the best... if not the best mmorpg i have ever played. Definitely a game to try!!!EDIT: ... Still the best mmorpg I have ever played, its got tactical and strategy situations, character development is very vast and there are at least 300+ different builds for tanking, dps, support, medic, etc, also it is updated quite often and there are new players joining all the time.BUT.... best of all it never ever EVER gets boring!!! there are way too many  things to do o theres never a dull moment, which compels you to keep playing... which in my opinion bumps it to 1st place.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=SPOILERS=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=I dont know why I marked this section as spoilers... even if I keep talking for an hour I still wouldnt even scratch the surace of this games amazing storyline.So... you start with one of 3 factions in this game, Dragon, Illuminati and Templar. The faction you are in only makes a difference when it comes to boosts and buffs which changes dependiing on how your faction does in PvP. You also choose 2 wapons from a selection of 9 different kinds of weapons (3 Melee, 3 Ranged and 3 Magic), although you are limited to 2 weapons at a time there is no rectriction on how many weapons you choose to master ... meaning that there is a huge lot of customizing available and choosing the right 2 weapon combo is all up to you ...(I suggest Assault Rifle and dual pistols for beginners :D). Each weapon has active abilities and Passive abilities which you can chose from but you can only have 7 active and 7 passive abilities equiped at once, but there are over 40+ different actives and passives for each weapon which makes character development very very interesting. You can also import and export your builds or other builds from different players and this is an in game feature not a mod. So players can share thier builds with each other. PvE builds and PvP builds can be the same but usually they differ a lot. I usually tank in PvP and my builds for PvE are vastly diferent, they might have the same weapons but totally different actives and passives. You can find a lot of good builds for PvE online but PvP builds are not so easy to find, players who do well in PvP want to keep it that way so hardly anyone shares good PvP builds but I guess thats expected. What makes this weapons customizing even more awesome is that you are not limited to the passive abilities of the weapons you have equipped, for ex: If I have chaos magic and elemental magic equipped (good weapons for intermediate players) I can equip a passive ability of assualt rifles which increases accuracy even when no assualt rifles are equipped. SO ... I guess you kinda see why i said it never gets boring... but this isnt even the tip of the iceberg lol. After weapon abilities comes armor/armour. The armor aka talismans you can equip come in levels, so level 1 talimans <lvl2 talismans<lvl3 and so on. But its not so simple as that, there are different lvl 1 talismans with varying stats. To equip higher lvl talismans you have to master the lvl in your skills table first. Same is for equipping higher lvl weapons. There isnt a character lvl system, but rather a stat based system. And your stats get affected by weapons and talismans. The higher the lvl, the better the stats. Doing missions grants you 2 different kinds of points, AP which is ability points and SP which are skill points.  To unlock wepon active&passive abilities you need AP. To increase the lvl of weapons or talismans you can equip you need SP. Generally AP is gained faster than SP but that kind of balances out as you progress in the storyline. I suggest that when using SP, focus on talismans first then weapons and there are 2 different streams for weapons, max out one stream first then move on to the next because if you spend SP equally on the streams, you might have both streams at lvl 5 lets say, you will only be able to equip lvl 5 weapons even though the total amount of SP spent, if spent on one stream only, would allow you to equip a lvl 7 or lvl 8 weapon. But in the end its up to the players as to how to spend thier AP and SP :D. Lastly, for weapon customizing, you can greatly impact your stats by glyphs. Glyphs are an accessory for weapons and talismans. There are tons of different glyphys that each have different stats that can be applied to the weapon or to you (talismans). Sooooo.... that was JUST weapons and that was a brief explanation :P. Theres quite a lot more to weapons, talismans and glyphs but this should be enough to get you started. Moving on to other things I love about this game... Crafting. Not a lot off players like crafting in the beginning of the game but thats only because its not easy getting materials early on. But you can craft any weapon, talisman or glyph as long as you have the materials. But crafting is a little different in The Secret World. You dont just click craft and voila the equipment is crafted, thats boring. Luckily we have a way more interesting crafting process which you will learn very early on in the game so im not gonna type up another essay to explain that, just know... they found a way to make crafting fun :D.PvP: PvP is again a lot of fun. There are 3 different battlefields you can fight on and each has completely different set of rules and objectives. So its not just 1v1 or team battles. The following site can explain PvP briefly or in detail a lot better than I ever could so make sure to check it out, https://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?60445-PvP-101-The-Beginner-s-Guide-to-TSW-s-PvP.Theres so much more I can talk about, relating to this game but it would all be but words you are reading, If you really want to know what the game is like you should play it :D. The cost is so meager compared to content of the game and its just a one time fee. Also theres no kind of pay to win scheme. The only thing ive ever bought from the store is boosts. Other than boosts theres not much that money can buy to give you an edge over others which is the biggest selling factor in my opinion. I wont deny that there are other mmorpgs with similar characteristics but I am positive that The Secret World is one of the very few (I can count them on both hands) that combine all these amazing features into one very very very amazing game :) If anyone needs any help dont hesitate to send me a message here on steam on in game (IGN: NexisX)			"

												Secret World is a very interesting MMO currently on the Market, for a unique still of game like this i would rather have a list of Pros and Cons for it;ProsAmazing QuestsThis game has some of the best MMO quest's i've came across they make you actually think and solve problems. You will need a Bible, know Binary, know Borse code and much more just to complete these quests.Interesting Story/ArtCurrently i can't find a good mmo with a story similar to Secret World it has a very interesting approuch to Mythology. Overall i enjoy the feel of the game.ConsBoring Animations/EffectsCurrently in the games current form the animations/effects are very basic along with the Combat System while i enjoy the idea of the game most of the animations are simple spins with colorful effects tied to them. Nothing to be impressed by and very dull to look at all day not to mention it doesn't give you that feeling of being a Powerful being when you are a ballerina 24/7Confusing QuestsI'm not asking the quests to baby-mode me and i do enjoy the overall idea of the quests however, while they are Amazing they are still confusing... If anyone spends too much time on on quest they will most likely lose intrest and just quit the game. The quests are a double sided sword.PvPPvP on this game is very boring in my eyes... The damage output on the game needs to be overlooked with a few other things to make this game be very successful. However, this could just be a personal opinion when i'm trying to be biased as possible.Try out the game yourself, Its truly something you should experience yourself (As i think almost every game is) Overall the Cons i listed are a few of the things i dislike about the game but you might not see as a Big deal or even enjoy			"

Таков мир многопользовательской ролевой онлайновой игры The Secret World, разрабатываемой компанией Funcom.Вообразите мир где вы можете стать тем, кем вы мечтаете, мир где нет таких ограничений как классы персонажей и уровни.Представьте себе мир, где правительства стран незримо управляются кардиналами из секретных сообществ. В игре The Secret World вы сможете приобщиться к их тайнам. Иллюминати, Драконы и Темплары – каждое общество отстаивает свои интересы и ведет войну с надвигающейся тьмой. В зависимости от того к какому секретному сообществу вы решите присоединиться, ваш игровой персонаж и все ваши впечатления и события в игре будут полностью изменены.ОСОБЕННОСТИ !  ○Ни классов, ни уровней – только полная свобода. В The Secret World нет ни классов, ни уровней. Вы можете стать кем угодно и играть так, как вам хочется.  ○Узнаваемые страны. Действие The Secret World разворачивается в современном мире. Исследуйте города и участвуйте в приключениях на различных континентах!  ○Вступайте в тайное общество и сражайтесь под его флагами. Пополните ряды ордена Иллюминатов (Illuminati),              Драконов (Dragon) или Храмовников (Templars), чтобы сражаться против других игроков (или плечом к плечу с ними) за власть над миром.  ○Потрясающий сюжет, какого еще не было у MMO. Над игрой работает гениальный Рагнар Торнквист (Ragnar Tørnquist) – автор The Longest Journey.  ○Тысячи единиц оружия и множество специальных возможностей. Пистолеты, штурмовые винтовки, черная магия, катаны, взрывчатка – вас ждет множество видов оружия и особых приемов.P.S:Игра стоит своих денег.			"

												It's an MMO. If you don't like MMOs, just pass on this. The characters are surprisingly good for an MMO, but that agonizingly slow slog through the ""gameplay"" keeps the player from actually getting to see anything fun or interesting. It's standard MMO fare. The settings are different, but all these damed MMOs seem to be the same. Piles of players run around, killing crap while you kill your own crap, you get a quest that sounds interested but amounts to killing X # of zombies and getting X # of items from their corpses, wash, rinse, repeat. I was a fool for buying this and thinking it would be any different from other MMOs aside from the setting. Save yourself time and money. There are so many better games out there. This is not even the least bit enjoyable. I wouldn't even recommend it if it were free to play unless you already love MMOs in general.			"

												I loved parts of TSW.  The lore is great, and the quests are some of the most interesting that I've ever played.  Some of them were genuinely moving, or laugh-out-loud funny.  The investigation quests are unlike anything that I've ever played before.  All of these things basically made for a fabulous single-player game.  I played that game, and loved it.  I'll probably pick up the various expansion packs as they're released, and play the new content.  The mmo parts... are not so good.  The Dungeons are ""meh"" and the pvp combat is dull and grindy.  I could never bring myself to play the raid content, because I'm allergic to grinding.  The single-player aspects of the game are good enough, however, that it's absolutely worth buying and playing.			"

												One of the best... if not the best mmorpg i have ever played. Definitely a game to try!!!EDIT: ... Still the best mmorpg I have ever played, its got tactical and strategy situations, character development is very vast and there are at least 300+ different builds for tanking, dps, support, medic, etc, also it is updated quite often and there are new players joining all the time.BUT.... best of all it never ever EVER gets boring!!! there are way too many  things to do o theres never a dull moment, which compels you to keep playing... which in my opinion bumps it to 1st place.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=SPOILERS=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=I dont know why I marked this section as spoilers... even if I keep talking for an hour I still wouldnt even scratch the surace of this games amazing storyline.So... you start with one of 3 factions in this game, Dragon, Illuminati and Templar. The faction you are in only makes a difference when it comes to boosts and buffs which changes dependiing on how your faction does in PvP. You also choose 2 wapons from a selection of 9 different kinds of weapons (3 Melee, 3 Ranged and 3 Magic), although you are limited to 2 weapons at a time there is no rectriction on how many weapons you choose to master ... meaning that there is a huge lot of customizing available and choosing the right 2 weapon combo is all up to you ...(I suggest Assault Rifle and dual pistols for beginners :D). Each weapon has active abilities and Passive abilities which you can chose from but you can only have 7 active and 7 passive abilities equiped at once, but there are over 40+ different actives and passives for each weapon which makes character development very very interesting. You can also import and export your builds or other builds from different players and this is an in game feature not a mod. So players can share thier builds with each other. PvE builds and PvP builds can be the same but usually they differ a lot. I usually tank in PvP and my builds for PvE are vastly diferent, they might have the same weapons but totally different actives and passives. You can find a lot of good builds for PvE online but PvP builds are not so easy to find, players who do well in PvP want to keep it that way so hardly anyone shares good PvP builds but I guess thats expected. What makes this weapons customizing even more awesome is that you are not limited to the passive abilities of the weapons you have equipped, for ex: If I have chaos magic and elemental magic equipped (good weapons for intermediate players) I can equip a passive ability of assualt rifles which increases accuracy even when no assualt rifles are equipped. SO ... I guess you kinda see why i said it never gets boring... but this isnt even the tip of the iceberg lol. After weapon abilities comes armor/armour. The armor aka talismans you can equip come in levels, so level 1 talimans <lvl2 talismans<lvl3 and so on. But its not so simple as that, there are different lvl 1 talismans with varying stats. To equip higher lvl talismans you have to master the lvl in your skills table first. Same is for equipping higher lvl weapons. There isnt a character lvl system, but rather a stat based system. And your stats get affected by weapons and talismans. The higher the lvl, the better the stats. Doing missions grants you 2 different kinds of points, AP which is ability points and SP which are skill points.  To unlock wepon active&passive abilities you need AP. To increase the lvl of weapons or talismans you can equip you need SP. Generally AP is gained faster than SP but that kind of balances out as you progress in the storyline. I suggest that when using SP, focus on talismans first then weapons and there are 2 different streams for weapons, max out one stream first then move on to the next because if you spend SP equally on the streams, you might have both streams at lvl 5 lets say, you will only be able to equip lvl 5 weapons even though the total amount of SP spent, if spent on one stream only, would allow you to equip a lvl 7 or lvl 8 weapon. But in the end its up to the players as to how to spend thier AP and SP :D. Lastly, for weapon customizing, you can greatly impact your stats by glyphs. Glyphs are an accessory for weapons and talismans. There are tons of different glyphys that each have different stats that can be applied to the weapon or to you (talismans). Sooooo.... that was JUST weapons and that was a brief explanation :P. Theres quite a lot more to weapons, talismans and glyphs but this should be enough to get you started. Moving on to other things I love about this game... Crafting. Not a lot off players like crafting in the beginning of the game but thats only because its not easy getting materials early on. But you can craft any weapon, talisman or glyph as long as you have the materials. But crafting is a little different in The Secret World. You dont just click craft and voila the equipment is crafted, thats boring. Luckily we have a way more interesting crafting process which you will learn very early on in the game so im not gonna type up another essay to explain that, just know... they found a way to make crafting fun :D.PvP: PvP is again a lot of fun. There are 3 different battlefields you can fight on and each has completely different set of rules and objectives. So its not just 1v1 or team battles. The following site can explain PvP briefly or in detail a lot better than I ever could so make sure to check it out, https://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?60445-PvP-101-The-Beginner-s-Guide-to-TSW-s-PvP.Theres so much more I can talk about, relating to this game but it would all be but words you are reading, If you really want to know what the game is like you should play it :D. The cost is so meager compared to content of the game and its just a one time fee. Also theres no kind of pay to win scheme. The only thing ive ever bought from the store is boosts. Other than boosts theres not much that money can buy to give you an edge over others which is the biggest selling factor in my opinion. I wont deny that there are other mmorpgs with similar characteristics but I am positive that The Secret World is one of the very few (I can count them on both hands) that combine all these amazing features into one very very very amazing game :) If anyone needs any help dont hesitate to send me a message here on steam on in game (IGN: NexisX)			"

												Secret World is a very interesting MMO currently on the Market, for a unique still of game like this i would rather have a list of Pros and Cons for it;ProsAmazing QuestsThis game has some of the best MMO quest's i've came across they make you actually think and solve problems. You will need a Bible, know Binary, know Borse code and much more just to complete these quests.Interesting Story/ArtCurrently i can't find a good mmo with a story similar to Secret World it has a very interesting approuch to Mythology. Overall i enjoy the feel of the game.ConsBoring Animations/EffectsCurrently in the games current form the animations/effects are very basic along with the Combat System while i enjoy the idea of the game most of the animations are simple spins with colorful effects tied to them. Nothing to be impressed by and very dull to look at all day not to mention it doesn't give you that feeling of being a Powerful being when you are a ballerina 24/7Confusing QuestsI'm not asking the quests to baby-mode me and i do enjoy the overall idea of the quests however, while they are Amazing they are still confusing... If anyone spends too much time on on quest they will most likely lose intrest and just quit the game. The quests are a double sided sword.PvPPvP on this game is very boring in my eyes... The damage output on the game needs to be overlooked with a few other things to make this game be very successful. However, this could just be a personal opinion when i'm trying to be biased as possible.Try out the game yourself, Its truly something you should experience yourself (As i think almost every game is) Overall the Cons i listed are a few of the things i dislike about the game but you might not see as a Big deal or even enjoy			"

												Far and away the best MMO.An xp system that rewards creativity and doesn't punish mistakes. Quests that are varied and interesting.Voice-acting of the highest calibre and cutscenes and lore that make me care for the world and its inhabitants.A combat system that encourages you to always keep moving and adapt your strategy to the opponent.A diffuculty curve that leaves all but dungeons and raids (barely) soloable, but leaves every single fight enough of challenge that death is never far absent.And this game has no hidden charges or pay to win elements AT ALL., took me 400 hours !!! before I bought an expansion.Easily one of my all time favorite games, whether played solo or with friends.

												The weakest part of this game is the button pushy, clunky combat. I wish they'd taken a page (or the whole damn book) from Age of Conan when coming up with TSW's combat. Oh well, I live with it 'cause I love everything else about this game (and really, with the right key  mapping you can make the combat tolerable, if not particularly fun). Awesome story, modern times, conspiracy theories, occult themes and symbols, Lovecraftian horror, an outfit you can love and not have to change because it's gear specs, ability points (AP) and skill points (SP) that matter. I got this game shortly after launch but it did not play well on my old PC. With my new PC it's a thing of beauty...the Ultimate Edition comes with some nifty goodies. Get it! It's a great deal!			"

The game has a modern setting which is refreshing to say the least and also there are no levels. This is not the type of game you play and worry about grinding to catch up with the vetern player base. I  seriously recommend buying this game if you are looking for a change of pase from all the other MMOG's out there.			"

												Definitely one of the best MMOs out thereSure it's different, yes it's hard and it certainly makes you use your brain a lot. And why would that ever be bad?The story is absolutely captivating, the details put into every aspect of it are bound to catch any fan of horror/sci-fi and it is lovely, as a long-time fan of Ragnar Tornquist's work, to see tiny elements of The Longest Journey in there.It brings something new to the MMO genre and while it's certainly not for everyone, its uniqueness and niche content are certain to draw only the truly interested. It's never going to be BIG, but it's never going to suffer the social downsides of more generic MMOs like Guild Wars, Rift or WoW. TSW is a mature game catered to a specific niche audience, and it's great at what it does.As a downside, combat can and often is either repetitive or frustrating. Builds require a lot of tinkering and calibration to be made viable, but in the world of Google this can be easily by-passed by looking up various builds perfected by the community and just using those. Therein comes the second problem: repetition. Rotation-based combat works, but people are getting bored of it and many modern MMOs are doing their best to steer away from it. Not TSW sadly, and I often find myself pressing 12311111241111... ad infinitum until something is dead. Thankfully, the necessity for dodging out of the way of many attacks keeps me on my toes, and is one of the things keeping combat from being unbearably dull. But hey! Repetitve combat gives me the chance to spend my time admiring the awesome monster models, which are beautifully designed, crafted and animated.In all, fantastic game with some mechanical drawbacks, but as long as you don't mind mashing buttons, you're going to enjoy the hell out of it (literally, perhaps).

												After playing this for much longer, I am going to revise my review. If you want something thats just modern and kinda different in the MMO world, give it a chance. But only buy it if its cheap and on sale.  1.The story seems unimportant and the characters dont warrant enough energy to care about them or their stories. 2.The voice acting is okay and the graphics were nice but the game seems like it is lacking purpose. (I stopped playing it for a bit and tried again and I dont even remember why my character is out running around killing zombies.)  3.It is more like a single player run around and kill stuff type of game rather than an MMO. 4.The controls are clunky unless you can bind a script to handle a mouse free look camera control (i had to in order to play it)  5.The interface is weird and not easy to master.I will give it the thumbs up but only because it brought something new and interesting to my computer.

												This game is about the story. Such an awesome story. And puzzles, oh my. This game requires you to research everything from Hebrew alphabet to Egyptian mythology, translate Romanian, research pharmaceuticals...and so much more. Very dark horror themes. Play this long enough you WILL dream about it. And you will catch yourself humming the music. Especially a certain Lullaby. This is a damned smart game, and I love it.Mechanics - the combat doesn't suck. There are way better combat mechanics out there, and if that is a primary issue for you then you probably want to keep walking. The deck system is nicely complex and lets the biggest control freak and stats fan have hours of fun putting together builds. But when you hit Issue #8 in Venice they added a new mechanic that is really grind heavy and then becomes essentially useless when you hit Tokyo. I suspect player retention would improve if they stripped that out completely. The scenarios are a fun mechanic and nice for grinding for purple gear but don't spend a lot of time on the augment business - just get to Tokyo where the most recent mechanic kicks in. Game stability has been really good for me, plenty of tutorials and info out there from the player community and you WILL need those. So if you love a great story and some compelling content this is your game.			"

												Best storytelling and worldbuilding I've seen in an MMO, and I've played alot of MMOs.  Where most settle for excuse plots or contrived backstory for the PvP backbone developers hope will keep people interested once they've reached max level, The Secret World has a continuing story that's both brilliantly written and exquisitely voiced.  Even the intros to what would otherwise feel like 'filler' quests are made interesting by great writing and every one is fully voice acted.On the contrary, combat options are strictly limited during the fray, but needlessly complex during setup.  The most difficult achievements in the hardest dungeons are those which require all players to refrain from changing skill setups between bosses.  TSW is a great game for story, and absolutely worth playing for that reason, even if you're a single player without a group to run with.  Finding answers to the deeper mysteries will require the aid of 4 helpful folks, but helpful folks are easy to find in TSW's many custom channels.  I wouldn't recommend this as someone's first MMO, but I'd absolutely recommend it as a second, just to show players new to the genre what a difference a great story can make.			"

												Overall: 8/10This game is a lot of fun to play, and that's what's most important. It's a lot less focused on character class (In fact, there are no classes) and more focused on your particular play style. You can find what works for you, character customization is top-notch in terms of outfit options, and the game's story is deeply interesting.My personal favorite part of the game is the 'Investigation missions'. These missions require you to use your brain and think logically -- a skill sorely missed in other mmo's. Also these missions often require you to think outside the box and even outside the game-- they're very immersive. Combat took me a little getting used to but once you figure out how it works it runs fairly smoothly. Voice acting in the game ranges from decent to sub-par, nothing exceptional but nothing that has me scrambling to mute it either. The overall story is excellent but character dialogue could use a little improvement in its writing; for example, there are many quests where you'll approach an npc, they'll give you their life story without so much as a hello first, and then you're scratching your head as to why you now have a quest to kill 15 zombies.I don't know whether this is a pro or a con, it's up to you: This game does not hold your hand at all. In fact, it throws you into the deep end without even a 'good luck'. You're given a very basic tutorial and then pretty much sent on your way. You have to figure a lot out on your own and if you're like me you'll spend a lot of time on google during the first few hours of the game. There is a web browser built into the game but it's often easier to just minimize the game--the browser is slower than average, and it can't be minimized, only closed (though you can move it off-screen).I can't take any points off for this, but it is a con: Unless you know people who play the game it's a fairly lonely experience. I rarely see other players except in the capital cities and they're very very quiet. This is a great game and I think it deserves a lot more players than it has. Please give this game a try, it's totally worth it! And at $30 it's a steal! (I received it as a gift several years ago)Highly recommended.			"

												I have spent 90 hours in this game so far and oh, my, god. It's story is so vivid and involved, and while linear there are many ways to build your character and I've barely scratched the surface. I haven't even entered the third area yet on Soloman island, Blue Mountain! Kinda scared to, certain enemies may be easy when you figure out the best way to fight them, but there's a couple I have trouble with every time and sometimes run away when I get more than one on my tail! CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY MORE!			"

												This game is about the story. Such an awesome story. And puzzles, oh my. This game requires you to research everything from Hebrew alphabet to Egyptian mythology, translate Romanian, research pharmaceuticals...and so much more. Very dark horror themes. Play this long enough you WILL dream about it. And you will catch yourself humming the music. Especially a certain Lullaby. This is a damned smart game, and I love it.Mechanics - the combat doesn't suck. There are way better combat mechanics out there, and if that is a primary issue for you then you probably want to keep walking. The deck system is nicely complex and lets the biggest control freak and stats fan have hours of fun putting together builds. But when you hit Issue #8 in Venice they added a new mechanic that is really grind heavy and then becomes essentially useless when you hit Tokyo. I suspect player retention would improve if they stripped that out completely. The scenarios are a fun mechanic and nice for grinding for purple gear but don't spend a lot of time on the augment business - just get to Tokyo where the most recent mechanic kicks in. Game stability has been really good for me, plenty of tutorials and info out there from the player community and you WILL need those. So if you love a great story and some compelling content this is your game.			"

												Now that I've put some time into this game (The Secret World, not Secret World Legends) I think I can leave a better review.Pros:1) Amazing storytelling. It's detailed, creative, and always leaves you craving more.2) The investigation missions. These babies are hooked me into the game. They are challenging, require all sorts of random knowledge/skills, and they leave you feeling extremely satisfied if you solved them without refering to a guide for answers. 3) The environment. Personally I am playing this game on a POS computer, but even on low settings this game is beautiful and creates an atmosphere that draws you into the horrors of the events surrounding you.4) The skill wheel. While it was confusing at first, the freedom you have from being able to create and adapt your deck to your playstyle is a breath of fresh air from other MMO's where you need to take x skill over y skill or you're bad. 5) The community. The people in this game are kind, funny, and helpful. It is always a pleasure checking into #Sanctuary to see what those wonderful ladies and gents are up to.6) The lore. The lore in this game is detailed and feeds into your understanding of the world if you take the time to read it. It is also amazing when someone in your group finds a piece since it tends to lead to a loud ""LORE"" in the voice channel, followed by everyone else scrambling to make their way over to the lore.Cons:1) Jumping. This jumping mechanic in this game (at least from my experience) is not always accurate or consistant making certain missions that involve a bit of platforming more frustrating than they need to be. 2) Solo instances. While these are fine overall, it was frustrating encountering them early on while playing with a friend. We were building our decks around the working together which meant when we were not grouped that things became way more difficult and we would have to grind out some extra AP to fix one of our decks while the other person waited to progress further. So overall this is an amazing game and I hope that Funcom does it justice with their relaunch of Secret World Legends.10 out of 10. Would (will) eat the bees again.			"

												Set in the present day, players roll up the appearance of their avatars and pick one of three secret societies (Illuminati, Templars, Ancients).  A couple of short cutscenes introduce you to your new bosses and leads you into the tutorial section of the game.  From there, you're off on a journey to build your powers and your reputation within your organization that will take you from the nicest little island in New England ever go to Hell, to the sands of Egypt and a crazed cult ready to burn up the world, to the dark forests of Transylvania for a showdown with creatures of the night that put Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr. to shame.  But if you need to take a break from saving the world, you can always duck into El Dorado or Stonehenge to challenge other agents and take control of the mystical sites which help your particular society when you decide to go back out into the field.There are no classes in the game.  Your role is determined by your gear and your equipped skills, both active and passive.  Weapons are the base from which you build off of.  Thus, it's possible for two players to be using the same weapon family, but have considerably different roles when going through group missions.Funcom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors!			"

												It was subscription and is now free to play. It got my hopes up for it's a MMO with guns but I am not playing it right now. I guess it isn't winning me over. I wish they added more emotes for roleplaying. The charecter creation is horrabad. Most female face options made them look ugly, like witches. I did make one that looked ok but once in the game I realized I couldn't emote much. ...  sigh.... I even thought about reinstalling it right now.... and remembered the lack of emotes.... and stopped the installation again.			"

												This is perhaps the most inventive and engaging MMO out there. Like many, I first played this and treated it like any other MMO. I hit a wall, became annoyed and quit. After coming back for a second try I realised that so long as you get how it is different, and play it slow, it is by far the most rewarding MMO out there. There's nothing bad I could say about it.Aside from its mind-blowingly unique and varied mechanics and flexible play styles the number one thing I adore about this game is the story. It weaves together a diverse band of deep characters in fascinating environments. Each one memorable and multifaceted. I can’t count how many times they’ve made me laugh, shout and cry.			"

												If you're looking for a MMORPG with a good storyline and great environment this is a great game. Repeatable quests, immersive storylines, and rich environments really bring a lot to the table. As well as hours of customization in your character's playstyle and look. If you're looking for a MMORPG with good PVP, go play something else. The PVP in this game is so insanely unbalanced and even more unfriendly to new players. As a new player you will have to grind PVP through endless hours of getting one shotted to be able to get PVP suits to use only in PVP zones just to be able to contribute to your team in some way. Before that point you're really just filling up a slot on the team that a geared player could have taken and provided help in some way.This game could really use some form of balancing or some way for new players to get the gear that would make them capable of lasting more than 2 seconds against the players who are fully geared.

												I can see why some people would like it, I enjoyed the combat, and I really like the cinematics of the game, but I cannot recommend it. From what I played, most of the quests were puzzles that were very annoying to solve. You need to link obscure clues to obscure answers that lead to more obscure clues, and if you cant consistantly do that, you will be checking google quite a bit. For example, in one part of a quest you need to put ""...under fireworks set to my favorite composer"", ""music of the seasons"" and ""1723"" together, and get ""Vivaldi. So if you want a game that you can play without opening a browser and following a bunch of steps every couple minutes, this is not the game for you.			"

												One could argue that this game has a good storyline, but to me, the gameplay mechanics of a game are much more important than it's story, which is why I do not recommend this game.This must be one of the blandest MMOs I have played. The combat is simply horrible.The weapons (I am an FPS player so I have experience with good implementation of firearms) have no impact. They don't feel like anything, its all hotbar based, no aiming, no skill, just button mashing till oblivion.They sound bad, they look bad.Animation is really not one of this game's strong points either. They look very clunky and not at all fluid as they should.Graphics wise, the game is okay. This is one of the criteria I generally don't spend too much time judging, it's all right. It could be leagues better, but it's definitely passable.Customisation is one of the worst I have ever seen in an MMO. Customisation in an RPG is important. Customisation in an MMO is ESSENTIAL. Character customisation is what makes you unique. If you can only choose between 5 preset faces and 6 hairstyles, then there's no point.The only metric in which this game exceeds expectations is the voice acting, which is honestly baffling. Everything else feels so mediocre and then you hear movie quality voice acting coming out of people's mouths. Real shame that the animations during cutscenes (mostly) suck and that you're just another silent protagonist with no choices.As mentionned, combat is just plain.So much so that I can't in good conscience recommend this game.If you want a good MMO with some actual decent gameplay, look towards GW2, or TESO.I usually don't get sick of games this fast, but this just feels like a cheap browser game that you play for free for 20 minutes until you realise it is just another WoW clone.If only the combat held up, I would've probably been drawn into the story and lore, but there is a limit to what I am willing to subject myself to, and all this game did was bore me.I could recommend this if you really REALLY didn't care what you play as long as you have a good story, but even then, better games will do this for you ie: the telltale series.A disappointment, probably unjustified given the release date of the game and me treating it as if it was released in 2016. But now is when I bought it, and I regret purchasing it, even for the low price of 10 pounds for the ultimate edition.To me, this game feels like it should be free to play because of it's massive lack of certain essential aspects. I think it's too late to hope that the game will change for the better, because it's already been very long since release and it's base concepts are flawed.4.5/10 - a below average game that failed to captivate me even though I felt that the lore was well set up, because of bad design decisions concerning major gameplay elements.PS: I should probably also mention other small things about this:- The initial loading time is ridiculous. (like upwards of one minute from executable launch to game launching -albeit, without an SSD-), and you can add to that 30 seconds of logos before you get to the main menu, which won't remember your password, forcing me to alt tab out to get the password from my third party password storage software - it's a pain. EVERY game should have an auto login function (Warframe I'm looking at you!).- Servers aren't location based (which is afaik stupid af) So I was matched with a Canadian when I was playing, which in itself isnt much of an issue, because whatever lag there is, the combat is so approximate that it doesn't change much. in PvP though? I assume there will be some consequences.- The text is really small, which is frustrating when you're trying to read up pages and pages of lore. I'm half blind. I've looked through the options and for now I haven't found a way to increase the font size. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe the settings menu is badly designed... who knows?-The UI sucks so bad. and I think I know why. It's because it's positionning was badly coded. I think the issue is that it was hard coded and linked to a low resolution, and therefore, because im playing in 1080p, things that should be on the bottom of the screen are now in the middle. This is the first time this ever happens to me in a game.			"

												I actually have more than 3.4 hours, it's more like about 20 hours, anyway, this is an awesome game but I stopped playing because it kept crashing all the time. It's sad, but I will probably come back whenever they FINALLY fix all the bugs, etc. I love the character building as there is no limits to the amount of skills you can create/mix.			"

												The User Review on steam usually says 'very Positive' but of course, they're gonna get 'mixed' reviews. I mean, TSW, the sort of older twin of SWL, is a great game with amazing storyline and a combat that basically lets you be what you want to be. But It's not like we can give it a proper review anymore because The Secret World is dying, in comes this f2p Secret World Legends. Is it gonna be better than TSW? That's what the devs and players-alike hope for. Will it ever live up to TSW which many of us loved? Who knows.At this point, all we can do is hope that they made it better than before. I'll leave this review for others to see and read. This is one of the best mmo games out there. It's quite a niche game as is, but it has it's own perks that no other game has. For now, this is my review for both TSW and SWL. Because I don't have access to beta for SWL as of yet. May edit this in the future.			"

												I would hope that people are intelligent enough and research enough to know not to let personal prejudice or assumptions over business models influence their reviewing a game not even out yet. Even fans of TSW like myself, that have stuck with the game do point out it has many shortcomings and have voiced a desire for the game to update or fix these. It costs nothing to remain positive that these changes will be the driving force for TSW Legends. It being its own game could function similarly to the quite popular Path of Exile (which has shops but shockingly not seen as greedy or P2W, imagine that!), if the story and world narrative plus the investigative puzzles are kept as a core tenet, there is no reason to think this won't be a positive boost. The original TSW wills till be active in maintenance mode, which is a lot more merciful than a lot of developers have done with much healthier MMOs and their shutdowns.All in all, there is no need to be insult-slinging naysayers over a game not even out yet, if it IS indeed as horrible as prematurely stated, one would hope it is reviewed as such after actually having given it a fair shot and played it.(giving a positive in lieu of no neutral option, may change on release)			"

												I just got this game not too long ago, 2-3 weeks. Put in some time & while the leveling & story telling in this game is really in a league of its own in the MMO world I'm a pvp player and this game is prob the 2nd worst game I've played from a pvp view(ESO is the worst obviously).Basically you get 2 battlegrounds to que up in, which pop quick in primetime, not at all after 1A est. But when they do pop 1 faction always has a full raid and the other 2 have half a raid usually with no healers. Why the devs let a match start with such huge imbalance is lost to me, I'd actually be ok with this if it wasn't the same players every single match.. I swear during my whole itme I've seen maybe 50 or so different people in pvp. Pve Idk not into it so I didn't try any of the raids or whatnot. Not recommended if your a pvper UNLESS you like to completely dominate games with double numbers and stacked premades, in which case sign up and be sure to roll Templar!			"

												The game is... alright. It's honestly a pretty cut and dry experience, albiet with a fairly unique premise. It's not that the experience wasn't enjoyable, because the game IS well made. I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes or anything like that. It just failed to really hook me at all. The combat comes off pretty flacid, and the story and NPC's were far from engaging. On top of that, the character and rollplay lacked any real substance. Several hours in, I felt like I was just forcing myself to keep playing for the sake of my friend who purchased the game as well, and I realized that it just wasn't worth it. It's not good enough to be fun, but not bad enough to be funny. Doomed to fall into deserving obscurity.If you're that hungry to play an MMO, then I guess you could grab it on sale. Otherwise, just do yourselves the favor and don't bother. 4.5/10			"

												Although Funcom sucks bad at making PC games and has no idea how to make one correctly, this is a (despite its numerous technical issues) very original, very fun mmo that is set in the real world. It's game world is very fun to play in. Now that this went subscriptionless, it is definitely worth the one time cost of $30. It breaks away from the monotony that every new MMO brings by being unique in that unlike all other MMO's, it is set in our real world and every horry story is true: secret societies, zombies, vampires, werewolves, illuminati, gay marriage, all the nightmares are real. So unlike games like World of Jack Black Kung Fu Panda Craft, it is not a big looney tunes f--kfest. It also actually makes you use your brain sometimes to figure out tough investigative quests. There are also no levels in the game: you gain ability and skill points to use on upgrading your ability to wear higher quality weapons and armor and to buy new active/passive abilities.The dungeons in the game are the best dungeons I've ever played through in a mmo because of one thing: they don't ♥♥♥♥ around and waste your time. It's straight up boss after boss after boss fight with only a couple of filler mobs in between bosses, but mostly it's just back to back to back bosses. Dungeons are quick and rewarding, the way it should be. No ♥♥♥♥ing around with piddly little who-gives-a-♥♥♥♥ easymode mobs.The biggest drawbacks about the game are that combat is a bit on the generic side, the ability system is awkward and somewhat confusing for quite a while until you get the hang of it and ask a lot of questions about it in general chat, and the game, despite being out over 2 years now, is still buggy. I am always discovering some new bulls--t technical problem with it that I have to email their tech support about. I've never had the kind of odd problems I have with this game with any other game ever before, but they are not deal breaking problems; I can still play the game relatively fine. That is until I hang at a load screen and have to restart the game once in a while. Funcom sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at making pc games... The combat and ability system and technical issues are what I think to be the reasons this game went f2p in a year's time, but it gets a bit more satisfying the deeper you play into the game. The ability wheel system could have been done way better though. Groupmaking could be way better implemented also.Besides that, the reason it is for sure worth playing is everything else it offers. Its real-world setting and original story are a nice fresh take on an otherwise bogged down genre that has become way, way too over-cliched with the fantasy and dragons gimmick. I love fantasy and dragons, but God damn take it easy on that♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game could also be optimized much, much better so it runs better, but does not detract too much from the fun. A nice game, pick it up for some interesting fun. Unless you are an adult toddler queer who likes World of Jack Black School of Rock Kung Fu Panda Big Bird Teletubbies Craft.			"

												Unfortunately, I'm going to have to give a thumbs down for this game. I bought it on a discount for something like £18. I thought that was fairly decent for an MMO, they're usually games that soak up playtime like mad. But I regret doing so now.Side note: I am still only in the 'Lovecraft style' zones, so I never got to the end. But a game that won't keep me to the end isn't a game I'd ever recommend.Don't get me wrong, the theme is great. I love the whole urban legend, Lovecraftian, monster-world feel. But the gameplay is just awful. Every single fight is a long, drawn out case of spamming a few buttons. Dodging is alright but it's really just a bit of a gimmick, where most other MMOs will have the same thing of 'get out of the way of attack' without a dodge button.The mission pointer is also frustrating. I had one that pointed me in one direction, only to find it was sending me into primary teleport world (can't remember the name, it's where all the bees come from), to the portal that I hadn't unlocked yet. Other times it's pointed me right into a cliff, or on the wrong side of a building. It also fails to show the '3D' location, so sometimes the point is underground and you're standing above it thinking 'but I'm right where it says I should be'.The missions themselves are just generic quests of go here/kill this/gather these/find this/click this. The only twist they have is that some of them are complicated. They force you to have to look up things, like Bible passages, or co-ordinates, or binary stuff. That sort of thing, where the game alone won't suffice. The clue requires research, which I suppose is in-keeping with this sort of game.But this is where the downside kicks in: the playerbase is small. Which means there aren't a lot of guides out there. If you want to just save time and look something up, chances are you won't find anything about it. It isn't popular enough to actually warrant online activity, so there's not much information out there.What I can say is that this game really isn't very different to most other MMOs. It has the same sorts of quests, the same sorts of combat, the same sorts of interfaces (just re-named to other words to confuse new starters). The same things but they don't do it half as well as other games.Edit: I did miss something quite important. This game is marketed as one without levels or classes. This is actually a falsehood.Levels are still there, you just don't get a number by your character. Instead you get points to spend on upgrading your skills. The higher your level, the more skills you have, the better your character is. In fact, if you don't have enough points in some areas, you can't equip items. Your 'level' is too low for them.Classes are also still there, only they are tied to weapons instead of characters. Each weapon has a different role and has different skills to upgrade. A player can carry multiple weapons (so multiple classes), and if their level is high enough they will have upgraded multiple class lines.That particular dishonesty on the part of Funcom does grind a little bit on me.Edit 2: It's also probably worth mentioning that what few players there are in this game are rabidly fanatical about it. A harmless criticism of the game is equal to a racist killing spree for them. And they group together.Just check out the reviews for a slice of it. Go to positive reviews and look for the lowest rating you can find. Then look for the highest rating you can find in the negative reviews. You'll probably notice that even the lowest positive score will be 15-20% higher than the highest negative score. Why? Because they stick together.It's pretty apt that a game about cults would produce such a cultish mentality in its player base.			"

												The only modern setting rp. Combat is a mix of action combat with tab targetting. This means you need to face your target for your attack to connect. There is some dodging involved but combat is basically you turning and going through your number keys. The lore is fun. The game still looks pretty good and the models are interesting, especially the creatures you encounter. There are lot of references to HP Lovecraft's stories. The strength in this game is its quest. Besides story quest, there are investigation quests which require you to do research, solve puzzles. Do not look up the answer. When you solve, these you will be so proud of yourself! I highly recommend the game.			"

												Secret Worldis an mmo like never before set in a post apocalyptic modern day world you play as a special agent for one of three organizations, either Illuminati, Templars or Dragons, dragons suck though. Anyway when you join the game you choose between a variety of weapons since their are no classes to speak of, you can have magic to guns to swords and hammers choice is yours and in the game you can level up whatever skill you desire aslong as you ahve the weapon to use it for, this opens many combinations for your character and the game has 500 skills, that alot. The bad part about the game is its a slow start and you really have to think this mmo will not hold your hand like wow or guild wars but I think thats apart i enjoy. Another thing is its more casual mmo so its not too addicting as say guild or wow but its still real fun, if your a pvp guy though play a different game the pvp sucks here. overall this game is fun and creative, trying something new for once, if you play this game I promise you this is one you will remeber I give it and 8/10 "

But, in real life, there is a possibility you could get hurt by delving into the Unknown.The Secret World provides me with the oppurtunity to explore the Unknown unharmed and at a safe distance (behind my computer screen).+ The combat is engaging, immersive and fun.+ There are plenty of conspiracies, monsters, myths, secret socities and puzzles to keep you invested for hours and hours on end.+ The replayability factor is extremely high.+ There are plenty of customization options for clothing, such as hats, jackets, masks and pants/trousers+ You can build the character you want to build, as there are a lot of options you can mix and match within the skill tree- The Starter Character Customization is basic, bland and way too simplified- Not Optomised for low end computers- Can feel like a chore to finish a mission or quest "

												First off i would like to notice, that i like the premise and the style of this game. A bit gothic, a bit mythology and a bit sci-fi. Feels and looks great... but then the gameplay - especially the comba!Yeah there are no classes and yes you can learn every skill with one character... and while i get that many feel this is the strongest part of the game, to me it's the weakest (or most annoying, to be more precise). How do i explain...? Imagine you got a construction kit for a sword and the manual says ""create the ultimate sword of your imagination"" and you go  ""yeah, let's get this started! Here a bit aluminium, there some carbon and some iron... finished"". Then you start combat and your ""ideal sword"" get's wrecked instantly and you die. So think ""hm... well let's start over and be a bit more methodic. Less aluminium, more carbon..."" then again combat and while your sword does not break, it's as dull as it could be, does no damage and you get overwhelmed. So once again you start to fumble around with the kit. And again... and again... and again...Seriously, there're a ton of character builds and so many guides on the net. I tried over and over and yet never felt once optimal even though all i wanted was a damage build with shotgun for single target ans AoE-Elementalism. With all the cross-effects between active and passive skills, it gets confusing as HELL.Yes, i appreciate some freedom with my character-developement but when i can't even create an effective DD or Tank, then f*** this!And using the 1-7 number keys for a dynamic-combat-system is less than optimal. For exampel, Neverwinter's controls hold up a lot better. Furthermore, even though the Maps are huge, there are no mounts (except for those expensive ones in the ingame-shop) and no kind of fast-travel. Going from a to b  gets tiresome as hell. And with all those ""wheret he f*** do i go"" kind of quests, this game burned me out really fast. Sad, because i wanted to get into it... but every time i try, it takes about an hour and i'm pi**** off as hell. SO if you (like me) want some kind of red thread in your game, this is nothing for you.    "

												So, you choose the Asians, the Americans, or the Europeans.Then you spend 50+ hours trying to stop Loki from destroying the [secret] world with his keyblade.  After that, the setting, VA, and writing lessen in strength.It avoids many typical MMORPG conventions to give itself a niche and maintain freshness, but your mileage may vary.  The focus is more-so on gear and character building rather than leveling up, and you can change anything you want about your character at any given time.  Except: for your hair and face you'll need to see a barber and a plastic surgeon, respectively.			"

												On of the best MMO's in the universe. Past. Present. Future.The team behind the longest journey franchise.The writing is truly superb...some of the best i have seen in a video game.The  atmosphere is really astounding.It's pretty creepy form time to time too.There are these special missions called investigation missions...i love them...i really, really love this game. it's for hardcore rpg enthusiasts though, probably...if you like tabletop rpg's and you like call of chtulhu? this is basically that, only in 3D.EDIT!!!So I decided to venture back into Agartha and the universe of the Secret World.And this is what i have discovered thus far.It's been ca three years scince i last played this game, and...well, the bugs i encountered back then are still rampant. with some additional ones, it seems.nothing directly game-breaking though, at least not too much, but the 4th wall is being broken all over the place.missing textures, windows freezing up, dialogue options locked and frozen solid, the same odd look of the textures of a characters skin and sometimes they even have 4 eyes...weapons go completely black because of lack of textures. so you see, some serious texture problems in here, and guess what, they we're present three years ago. also there are some serious, SERIOUS latency and framerate issues. and what do you know, they we're there at launch. so obviously nothing has been touched or refined scince, at least, the effort was a waste, because nothing has changed.i know that they have been adding some content to the game, but come one, how about cleaning out the trash before you horde in new stuff? i don't know...seems lazy, and though i do not know the intricacies going on at the company (funcom) these days, and even though i ardently believed in them...it doesn't seem strange to me at all right now that the company if unravelling at the seems. the fundation was obviously poorly built, and thus, the building crumbles.all of this is a great shame. because the game has such incredible potential. It's the most unique mmorpg out there. with a heavy lovecraftian atmosphere and story, highly intelligent and crafty writing and some really great concepts and designs. i still love it...because it's redeeming features thankfully outnumbers the grotesque listlesness of the development team in regards to fixing things.having said all this, i still claim that this is one of the greatest mmo's out there, and even one of the most unique and interesting games of all time. so should you still play it? definitely.the bugs can be ignored, and the beauty of it absorbed. but if you are not into dark lovecraftian lore and stories of the grave...you might not be able to abide all the bugs.if you want to play a truly amazing and huge lovecraftian (how many times have i written lovecraftian at this point?) universe where all deep things sealed in ancient tombs have been unsealed, with some incredibly fun investigation missions, something that i completely unique in the mmo genre as a whole, then yes. buy it, and play it forever.

												Ok, how to put this, Ive been playing for over 200 hours now throughout the course of a year.  I say give it a chance especially when you get over $150 worth in content for $20 or even $60 when there is no sale, still worth it considering the price of each issue and side quest pack alone being almost $10-15.  This is how it works. There is no official class system, get used to it, you will never be successful using just one build literally.  You can solo the story content with the right builds, Pvp is decent, they have your straight Deathmatch, to capture points of interest to gain points, if your faction wins a Pvp match, you get a buff, World domination is key for a nice buff. The story is great, when i watch people on twitch who have never played skip some cutscenes, i laugh because its not that simple if your the type who doesnt use guides, the game is much more fun if you play it and actually figure the puzzles out for yourself, they even have an in-game browser, which for people running two monitors, doesnt matteer much, but still nice, add-ons become dam near essential later so pick up some mods when you start getting to the beef of the game, dungeons. Dungeons start like normal, though not centralized around dungeons or raids, they are practically necessary end game, because of the drops. I wouldnt be able to even put a dent in how much content there is in a short paragraph or two.  Lore is damn near endless and increasing, with the release of issue 13 in December 2015, you can tell Funcom does not ♥♥♥♥ around with this game, yes there are minor bugs here and there especially with one of the cutscenes in blue mountain the horror of this girls face is just awful lol her mouth is off set, but regardless, the game itself is not nice to people who think they can pull mobs and gain a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of xp, nono the game is much harder than you think, there are viable builds that can last throughout the game and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ builds like really why would you think thatd be good? But experiment with it, try making your own build after you read up on how penetration is almost the most essential for dps builds in the beginning, and how some specs like physical and magical defense are♥♥♥♥♥♥no matter what you try to accomplish lol.  As i said before i have not even scraped the surface of how big this game is, it starts slow, and progressively gets better.			"

												A great mmo rpg game dealing with the occult and the paranormal.  This game puts you in the shoes of an agent for one of the 3 main secret societies you can choose from.  Like any mmorpg, you pick up missions from NPCs or points of interest/objects scattered throughout this very huge world.  The more I play, the more I'm drawn into learning more about it's mysterious and intriguing storyline.  I came back to this game after not having played it for about a year now and I can honestly say that I'm still having a blast picking up right where I left off.			"

												My experience with this game is mostly positive, as a player of MMOs I have a good sense of what games should get right and what games do wrong. The good: This game is the best-looking, immersive, interactive games I have ever seen. Interaction goes way beyond interacting with objects and pushing buttons. It forces you to find clues and think like a supernatural investigator would. The leveling system is revolutionary, no other MMO lets you put points into skills this way. It's awesome.The Bad: It can be confusing at times. New players may not know what to do and have to feel around slowly at first. As you gain confidence, you get bolder and bolder, solving puzzles and finding secrets.The ugly: avoiding taking damage and aggroing patrolling mobs. Avoiding taking damage without aggroing non-target mobs is difficult and can cause wipes. The  mantra of ""the only way to stop incoming damage is dealing more damage"" only works in MMOs where you're sure you can put out more damage than your target. In an MMO where there are no Experience Levels, this can be difficult.Other thoughts: This game is very unique, features a customizable character thing, and lets you indulge in supernatural settings thought long lost. The investigative side reminds me of watching X-Files episodes, and some of the missions make me feel like I'm in a movie, scavenging supplies, forming a plan, and taking the fight to the bad guys. The best part is that it still is fun to me.			"

Product received for free
												I don't normally leave reviews for games (even ones I extremely hate; looking at you Dementium II), but since this game has been catching a lot of flack for some drastic development choices lately, I decided to give my own two cents. So here we go:(Please note this is mostly my review for the TSW base game with a few of my opinions for the upcoming remake. As for Funcom carrying over positive reviews from TSW to SWL, it hasn't even been established whether they will delete them all upon release or not. I think saying they're trying to deceive consumers on something that hasn't even been released yet is jumping to conslusions. If deceit is actually occurring, I do not condone it, but as of right now, without knowing the full scope of the situation, I will remain positive on the matter. It's not like anyone can buy the game right now anyway. Funcom at least had the decency to remove the ability to purchase the base game, so nobody would continue to spend money a soon-to-be defunct product.)I am fairly new to The Secret World, but I'm glad I was able to play a bit of the base game before Secret World Legends came out. I've been enjoying TSW greatly and although the gameplay can be janky at times, I've so far enjoyed it more than the last MMO I attempted to play. (I'm really glad that TSW doesn’t have a lot of lengthy back-tracking along with no ungodly long skill rotations.) The storylines in TSW are interesting and the large variety of enemies you can combat is very satisfying. Most, if not all, the characters are voiced (by very well-picked voice actors) and they are very entertaining to interact with. The ability of solo play and the freedom to choose whatever weapons and skills you want while not being restricted to a class is also very welcomed and appreciated. Overall, The Secret World universe exploits a lot a lot of the niches and themes I enjoy very much and blends them together in a new and unique way so it really is sort of a dream game come true for me; I really don't know why I haven't tried playing it sooner.As for Secret World Legends, I am actually looking forward to it. I am following  SWL's development fairly closely, and it seems like most of the changes are improvements on the base game. The Funcom dev team seems very competent and it looks like they know what they want to achieve to make the game more enjoyable as a whole for both new and veteran players alike. The main change I'm personally looking forward to is improved gameplay; the new reticle system looks like it removes a lot of previously-mentioned jank of the base game. There will also be a legitimate dressing room mechanic so you can see all the cosmetics on your character better. The only thing I'm a bit leery on so far is the use of keys to unlock chests in dungeons, but it's been said that you will get free keys daily and that you can also buy them with in-game currency, so I don't think that will be too big of a deal in that case. The skill wheel also seems like it will be simplified for ease of use while still allowing enough freedom to create your own unique build. I personally would recommend looking into the details that have already been released about SWL to form your own opinion before jumping to conclusions about the Free-to-Play formula. The Funcom Twitch streams certainly clear up a lot of the misconceptions and share some helpful insight on what to expect, so checking in on those is also highly recommended. (Also, check on them because Andy the community manager is a beautiful human being. Never change Andy.) If you also watch the streams when they’re live, there’s even a chance you could win a beta key to Secret World Legends in a raffle, so hey, you could potentially be awarded for taking the time to look into the development.I feel like I should also mention that I actually got The Secret World as a gift from a friend. I wouldn't shut up about how cool the game looked but I was unsure if I should buy it after my sort of ""meh"" experience with the last MMO I tried. Turns out, he purchased it for me like a week or less before SWL was announced and before the ability to purchase the base game from Steam was removed. At first he was a bit disheartened that he wasted money because SWL will be F2P but, after further research, it has been stated that returning players will receive rewards for owning and playing the base game (along with its DLCs), and most of the cosmetic items from the base game will be carried over. My friend only bought me the main game (without the DLCs), but I did plan on upgrading to the Ultimate or Complete edition later. It looks like I won't have to do that now, but I would have definitely done so if SWL wasn't announced. IF I play SWL (either in beta or when it comes out completely) and my opinion changes or if Funcom *is* actually trying to deceive by review swapping, I will either change or remove this review, but for now, I’m mostly happy with what I see so far.So, for anyone who has read to this point, I hope my overly long review helped some and I thank you for taking the time to read. I wish you all a good day and happy hunting.			"

												I have not played this title in so long...I pretty much quit playing after the game decided to drop me in the middle of nowhere and hide my main quest from me.When i came back after a year or so, the game was hacked or something, i found a ""Dress"" or some sort in my inventory, but when i put it on my character was naked except for panties, and two smiley face stickers on the nipples... Couldn't undo what had happened, so i quit yet again.With these MMO titles that offer character customization, i try my very best to get my sense of fashion translated into the game, so when this glitch/bug whatever it was happened, i was disgusted and lost all interest in playing it ever again.I am going to give this title one more chance, hopefully a large majority of the issues i had are a distant thought from the past now.Fingers crossed?  Will update later if anything is different, otherwise it's a great game!			"

												The Secret World.... where to begin?This game is basically one giant conspiracy ... theres millionsand yes you can play one the illumanati teamThis game is great in my opinion!  A good change from the average push a button and wait.You only have to pay once and you don't have to pay again unless you want premium features kinda like Guild Wars.The story is good.  Kinda repetitive with questsoh one thing... you don't have levels just skill pointsso if you wanted you could be good with swords and guns... maybe magic and swords it's up to youthis game is great with optionsone thing i dislike would be the fact that once you're done most of the story mission packs you have to pay for the rest of them... kinda sucks.... but that's what they had to do since they went Pay once Play forever.Overall I recommend this game!

												The original version of this game is/was one of my favorite games of all time, as my playtime would indicate. It had one of the best stories and communities ever, and took me from playing single player games only into the world of MMOs. I made many friends, killed thousands of monsters, and served as an officer in one of the game's largest guilds for a time. The original developers truly made something special in creating The Secret World.As for SW: Legends, only time will tell, but I am not holding my breath. I strongly disapprove of their actions in porting in the old reviews onto a new game, and what I am seeing thus far in rolling out the ""revamp."" Unless Funcom does anything to indicate that they will value their story, their community, and honest business practices moving forward, I do not plan to spend any time or money on their games ever again.

												*My review was marked as ""not helpful"" about 1 minute after I posted it, seems like the devs like to mark negative reviews as ""not helpful"" as soon as they appear so they don't show up by default on the store page*My experience playing TSW:-Buy game-Install game-Run game, it keeps minimizing-Run game in window to stop it from minimizing-Try to click ""create character"" but can't, realize that mouse pointer is offset from actual mouse click by about 500 pixels-Run game in borderless window as admin, mouse finally works-Create account, create character, get intrigued with genuinely interesting story and lore-Start playing, realize controls are a pile of ♥♥♥♥-Spend a half hour configuring controls so they feel more organic and natural-When using mouse targeting, aimpoint spazzes out randomly and constantly moves to the left slowly-Google the issue, learn that I have to enable some DPI setting in the compatibility tab of the .exe properties menu-Realize targeting with the mouse is useless unless you have one of those mice with like 200 buttons on them for macros because even though you have guns, you have to use like 6 different keys to shoot them-Play through 20 min and get to the part where you pick weapons for your character-Pick pistol and try out assault rifle-Game bugs out and won't let me progress because the mission requirements keep resetting after you complete them-Quit & reload game to see if I can go back or get around it, nope-Realize I probably have to create a new character for this, and you only get 3-Raged-Uninstalled-Refunded (first refund EVER)this game seems super cool and would be fun if it was actually functional. genuinely disappointed that it sucks cos it seemed really deep and interesting.2/10, not even worth $5			"

												Expect to be offered incentives to 'continue the story' only to discover that there is a huge hole in the progression tree for the story between zones 3 and 4, which you will have to then buy extra 'side' content to progress through, or play dungeons over and over for gear grinding.If you like grinding continually, get the game. If you like story and are a new player, the game is fine. Just don't expect to be treated fairly in future, and absolutely do not buy into any of their returning player 'offers' unless they're offering ALL the content. Which will probably just mean having to re-buy the whole game. Again and again and again.Game left me feeling I'm out of pocket for gameplay I can't access, while competing MMOs with similar business models are far more welcoming.Unless you absolutely love the setting, take your money elsewhere.

												I want to love this game, the concept is amazing, the depth to the lore exceptional, and the size of the world phenominal. However due to its glitchy nature, slow loading, and the terrible controls. I cant recommend this. The concept has so much potential, and If they could fix the problems, update the control interface, and put a little less focus on micro purchasing with no fixes to game play I could change my mind. I hope that someday they correct this or let the rights go to someone else and develop a sequal with a better interface.With its age and comparative to other MMOs this needs a major change that just isnt happening			"

												Funcom keeping the mostly good reviews for ""The Secret World"" when ""Secret Wolrd Legends"" will be the same story, but different gameplay is misleading to fraudulent in effect, if not intent. I am certain if Funcom is an honest business, they will agree to review wipe; I am certain if Valve is an honest business, they will do a review wipe irrespective of what Funcom wants.There, I have said my piece; hopefully it'll be lost in a review wipe. If not, it truly needed saying.Do not try to question why Funcom appears to be resorting to a deceptive, dishonest business practice anywhere they have moderation privileges (e.g. Steam community hub, Reddit, their forums,...). They will abuse those privileges to kill all mention of this issue. Valve/Steam apparently will not. Draw your own conclusions about whether appearance might be fact.			"

												I loved The Secret World, however, ""Secret World Legends"" looks like its shaping up to be very, very different and not necessarily in a good way. The lack of transparency in the use of the old game page to create the illusion of so many positive reviews before the new game is even released, is only adding to my doubts...With that said I'm still going to give to give Secret World Legends a go, but I'm already annoyed that I cant transfer any of my characters.

												May be okay for those who like the horror genre, since it has decent story telling.  However if you don't like horror or are in it for the game play, I would steer clear.  The skills, weapons, combat are poorly conceived and implemented.  If you don't like horror the story is also a complete nightmare to experience.  I had hoped this would be a game I would like since Ragnar Tornquist was one of the designers, but this game is nothing like the amazing The Longest Journey games he created.  If I were Ragnar I would be hesistent to count this as one of my achievements.			"

												I want to love this game. I REALLY do. And it provides so many amazing ideas about how MMOs could work. Integrating the real world in a semi-ARG is phenomenal. The setting of modern day instead of medieval fantasy is a brilliant move. Limiting quests and abilities is such a great design even if it seems counter-intuitive at first. But I just can't recommend it. There are so many problems from unclear storytelling to a really bad UI that it makes the game too difficult to enjoy. Ultimately it's a fantastic single-player investigation game wrapped in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO. Many people would love it, really, but most will not. I recommend you try it at least, because it really is worth it. Any attempt to change what we believe MMOs are supposed to do is worth it, IMO. But as it stands, I just can't recommend it to the general public.			"

												I realize that I have very little playtime in this game, but I really didn't need to for this review.   The gameplay is just...clunky. The character model moves around like an older, boxy game, when the game is clearly trying to be more. Although the gameplay videos make the combat look smooth, and smash-em-uppy, it's not. It's still the same tired old ""circle around the enemy"" formula. The game even has a targeting mode, which makes it to where you don't have to hold your mouse button down, and it gives you crosshairs, but it seems like the innovation for combat stopped there because they didn't do anything with it. Once in combat mode, my mouse buttons are useless (why can't I reassign combat buttons differently from non-combat controls?), and it basically just targets the closest thing most times, or in the case of you having a weapon that has a range on it, the furthest enemy possible so your attacks wont work. Lets not mention the whole micro transaction thing, and the fact that they're running a campaign on ""pay once play forever"" thing, but you have to pay more to advance and get more episodes to the story. Let me give a tip to any game developers reading this about micro transactions: DON'T CHARGE PLAYERS TO ADVANCE IN YOUR GAME. Charge me for cosmetics if you have to (and people will buy the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of cosmetics, i.e. every MOBA out right now), but don't charge me to keep playing your game, just because you came out with a bit more content.I really thought this game had potential, and when I saw it on a steam sale I grabbed it out of impulse. I'm regretting my purchase now, and refunding.			"

												The Secret World is difficult for me to recommend or not recommend, because its an interesting game to say the least. Overall, its a wonderful game, with terrific story and writing, great atmosphere, beautiful and creepy locales, wonderful voice acting in places you wouldn't normally expect any voice acting at all, and some great quests, including some genius investigation quests that sometimes require going outside the game to look for clues at fake websites made for the game. The problem with it is that its a lackluster MMO. Everything that makes an MMO good (in my opinion at least) is lacking. The community just isn't there for the most part, even on the most populated servers. Even if you can manage to get enough people to do a dungeon with, none of the different traditional MMO roles of tank, healer or dps feel that fun to play as, and everyone else is rushing through the dungeon so fast you cant even catch the story that frames what you're doing in the dungeon in the first place. I never got into endgame content but it doesn't sound much better. Some people say theres grinding involved, but I never got to that point. Never tried PvP because I never got geared enough to be able to compete, which is pretty crappy in itself. The Secret World is a great singleplayer game for the most part (combat feels a bit tedious, but I blame that mostly because its an MMO), and luckily most of the game can be played and enjoyed solo. But as an MMO, it just doesn't do it for me. So if you're looking for a fun single player experience and can deal with some tedious combat, I would recommend this game. But if you're looking for a good MMO to play, skip it.			"

												At first, I did recommend this game, with a ""warning"" about some aspects. However, as I poured more time into it, those aspects become more and more frustrating to the point that I doubt I will spend much more time playing this.Firstly, it handles fine. Combat is interesting, with different branching pathways and such.The community is very nice, and willing to help new players. The lore is great. This is one of the very few mmo's I've played where quests are completed more for LORE's sake, then for the experience or item rewards.What ultimately killed this game for me, was the guides. And Walkthroughs. Ultimately, I spent more time browsing the internet, looking at detailed walkthroughs/build guides/storyline guides to see what areas I should go to next, that in a 4 hour period of playing the game, I spent 3 hours of that looking at guides, with 1 hour of actual play time. That's not enjoyable to me. It killed any sense of enjoyment, of desire to keep playing.If you don't mind doing a LOT of research, then this will probably be fine for you. For me, personally, it gives me a splitting headache to try to play this for any length of time.			"

												i've played this one off and on for a few weeks, delving into it enough to ensure i hadn't wasted my money. The game itself is different than any other MMO i've played in the aspect of it's puzzles. Some of these are literally undoable unless you google the answer (which they actually tell you to do,even call the quest a ""google quest"") or if you happen to be a brain.Now in my opinion  that isn't a bad thing, it's a new form of challenge and a game without challenge gets boring easy.Gameplay itself is pretty nice. Not class based whatsoever. The weapons you equip decide your skills and there are many skills to unlock. If you get tired of a weapon and want another, you can switch anytime you want. You aren't restrticted.  You'll find out pretty fast the best gear comes from dungeons  (as with most games) but the playerbase is pretty low so finding a group for the dungeon can be difficult sometimes although i have to say the community is very nice. There is usually someone willing to run newbies through dungeons just for the sake of entertainment. Armor doesn't affect style. You can wear what stats you want while wearing a cosmetic style over it. Character creation is pretty lame. Not many choices to pick from and no long hair choices at all...well they say long hair but it's shoulder length..That's about as much as i can say as i'm still pretty new to the game still.			"

												This game is seriously THE BEST mmo game I've ever played and honestly mmo games USUALLY turn me off badly. The story in the beginning with the bug (literal), that freaky dream, then you with your powers, thats something you won't get to revisit unless you create a new character. The Three Story Arcs depends on the Faction you choose, but take a big note; There are NO Classes & seriously, NO levels. Don't bother creating a new character cause you THINK you screwed up, cause you CAN unlock every single skill in the game on just ONE character - How you design your character's build? 100% up to you.Now there's a number of things you SHOULDN'T expect from this game:1) For it to be Easy - if you're expecting that, you'll rage quit pretty quickly, this game is NOT easy at the start. First you have to build your character's abilities & create the best build suited for you, once you have it figured out & that'll take a while, THEN it might become easy (at least til you get to the harder areas).2) You wiped them out easily the first dozen times, next you change your build, you expect things to be the same - No, you change your character & you alter your pros & cons. Sometimes you'll find build set that feels better, just be sure it is better against everything.3) You expect to be a Legend real quick - Sorry, but thats not gonna happen. Maybe much later in the game, but not immediately after you start. There is no rush, pace yourself, and be smart. Otherwise, you could easily get yourself killed quick.4) You grinded on WoW an rose fast, this is no different - Actually it IS different. All enemies have difficulty tags, and they only change based on your build set & Quality Level (QL) of your gear. If you're expecting to slaughter Red Skull enemies (to WoW that's equivalent to Elites), you'll be slaughtered, also you won't gain much anyways - you'll spending most of your money on repairs than the loot these enemies will drop. 5) All MMOs are the same - Not all, sure there are many out there that are just copy & paste, but this game IS different. 90% of MMOs have Classes (Fighter, Archer, Mage, etc), Secret World has NONE. Most MMOs will restrict you because of your level, Secret World has NO Levels and lets you play any quest you want even if there's no possible way you could beat that quest, they'll still let you try. Most MMOs restrict abilities based on Classes, Secret World doesn't have that restriction, you can be ANYTHING you want and can use EVERY SINGLE SKILL in the game.This game is like Dark Souls in terms of heavy hitting enemies with very different abilities meant to destroy you. Even simple zombies if you're not careful or you're overconfident could easily overwhelm you. Many quests are pretty straight forward & direct, others expect you to literally use your brain cells & quick thinking, while some others require perfect stealth to get the best rewards. This game is also like EVE Online in terms of intricate character designs, great stories, and fully customizable ability sets  (heck you can even use a Passive ability from a Melee set to buff an Active ability from a Magic set - I'm not joking an yes it does work). Big Plus: Celebrity Voice Acting. EVERYTHING is voice acted! Such as: Laura Aikman, Jimmy Akingbola, Ben Aldridge, Adjoa Andoh, Leigh-Allyn Baker, Tara Lynne Barr, Tim Bentinck, Brian Bloom, Steve Blum, Steffan Boje, Nicholas Boulton, Bertie Carvel, Jeffrey Combs (Frighteners & Deep Space Nine), Jonathan Espolin-Johnson, Christopher Fairbank (Alien 3), Christopher Fairbank (Mass Effect 2 as Warlord Okeer), Camilla Frey, David Hoffman, Bob Joles, Irwin Keyes, Andrew Kishino (BulletStorm), C.S. Lee (Dexter tv show), William Mapother (LOST as Ethan Rom), Jenny O'Hara (Wishmaster), Tim Russ (Voyager as Lt Tuvok), Armin Shimerman (Deep Space Nine as Quark), André Sogliuzzo (Transformers Revenge Fallen as Sideswipe), Dennis Storhøi (13th Warrior), Peter Stormare (8MM as Dino Velvet), and many others.- Yes, you can invade Hell an you will feel like you walked in to DOOM's version of Hell. - Yes, you can not only fight the Deep Ones, but even Cthulhu himself!- Yes, you can join The Templars, The Illuminati, or The Dragon (not literal flying beast dragon, basically a Chinese Triad who is just as dangerous as the other two).- Yes, you can craft your own weapons, gear, and Glyphs (equivalent to Diablo's Runes).- What if you unlock every single skill? There's still more! You can augment your skills to make you character even more deadly & powerful, plus there's the Auxiliary Weapons (special very powerful weapons that will make your character even more unique & unstoppable depending on your build). - What if you want you character to look like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ Yup you can definitely do that, every faction has their own Faction Uniforms and you can buy other cosmetic outfits anywhere in the game. - Want to replay a quest to build up your character? Do it as much as you want (of course there is a cooldown), replay a quest however many times as you please an you'll still get experience for skills & loot regardless of how powerful you are.- Not liking the interface or something in the game is bothering you? Mods are fully supported in the game to alter the UIs and even make things easier to adjust, make quests easier to find, auto-upgrade your stuff, disassemble loot for you, help make crafting stuff easier, even mods to help you build a powerful character, yeah Funcom, the owners of the game fully support mods. Of course if you get/create a mod that acts like a cheat, those will not work (even if you somehow do get them to work, the cheat mod, Funcom can just as easily ban you, so don't try it).There's honestly too many awesome things that make this game THE BEST out there.I've played WoW, EVE Online, Guild Wars, ARK Survival Evolved, Warframe, Rift, Requiem Memento Mori, I lost interest in all of them - Secret World is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!

												The gameplay so far is *meh* but honestly the graphics are the worst part. I dont see how a game released in 2012 has graphics and animations this bad. They are terrible. It's mind blowing. I can't recommend this game because the graphics are so disturbingly, distractingly bad. I want to set my computer on fire.MAJOR EDIT: SO apparently this game does not auto-detect graphics and mine were on low. So there's that. They are a little better now (on ultra), still not great.

												(Played in the Beta, writing from memory.)It's an interesting MMO that had a few very clever ideas (ARG-sort of puzzles that encourage you to use real-world knowledge and resources to solve) and quite a lot of fun story that was engaging in an interesting supernatural-normalicy way.Now if only it followed through after the first area instead of more-or-less recycling the same thoughts and ideas. REALLY cool concept with great potential that just... doesn't stay afloat long enough to make a proper MMO.			"

												You find this written in micrographia on the side of a fire hydrant: ""File of cleric ran for pie sideways with a broken, bloody proboscis and nearby found the stars.""""File of cleric"" is an anagram of ""Circle of life,"" indicating that you need to walk counter-clockwise while quoting from the Necronomicon. ""Circle of life"" is also the first song on The Lion King soundtrack, and if we look at the 3rd letter in its lyrics (which is an o) and chop off 10% of it (thus giving us the 3.1 of pi) and turn it sideways it becomes a u. This tells us that we need to use an emote which has only now, and without announcement, been made available to us (/u) which contorts our avatar into the foetal position (also a u shape). If we then follow the direction in which our avatar's nose (proboscis) is pointing and drop all of our money (thus making us broke) at the end of the map, a vendor will materialise from the ether and hand us a scandalous article from a celeb (star) worship magazine, on which we need to wipe our blood. Given the scandalous nature of the article we have bloodied, this brings to mind ""blood libel"" indicating that we need to then translate the article into Hebrew. At this point the next clue in our investigation quest will have become apparent.If this (lack of) logic does not appeal to you and you don't get off on repetitive, undercooked combat, do not buy this game.

												I have a love hate relationship with this game.Pros:THE STORY: OH GOD THE STORY.  TRIPLE AAA STUFF RIGHT HERE.  Every singe cutscene is animated and every single mission has a cutscene to go along with it.  The writing is superb and I rate this as probably the best plot in any MMO.Attention to Detail:  You don't usually notice the little things in MMO's since they aren't the point, but this game makes them the point in some missions and with a setting like the one it has, it fits in exceptionally well, speaking of setting.The setting:  It's odd how few MMO's, or games for that matter (besides Deus Ex) have had any major foray into this kind of setting with multiple secret organizations in a modern/slightly futuristic world fighting for control.   Its great yet brings about a layer of familiarity.Clothing:  Yeah this is a pro because how many options you have.  No more is your armor cosmetic since its just talismans that dont show up on your model, instead you can truly decide how you look instead of being say a person in a can.The cons:Mechanics:  Read any review of Secret World and it will probably mention the god awful mechanics.  Combat feels sluggish and a chore, more so then other MMO's.  That and any group that is not a group mob will kill you with 100% certanty making progression fell dull.  Speaking of progression you dont really discernable grow in strength you just kinda end up stronger without knowing why (usually cause gear).  The big problem with progression in this game is that if you are going a one weapon build you can max out by the end of the 3rd area with many more to follow, meaning after that its just outfit collection.  The stealth missions made me want to kill myself IRL everytime I got one.  Not only is the stealth shoehorned in and terrible to begin with sometimes they shoe in another poorly done challenge into it that makes them so frusterating I nearly tore my hands apart at one point.Pacing:  Some points of the game feel exciting and feel like you are doing things, someother times not so much.  This wouldn't be unusual except for the fact its kind of a reverse curve.  I felt like I was doing less as the game area went on meaning every area had some good hook, but failed to keep it.  Lairs:  The biggest noob trap every which really just feels like they are there to kill noobs repetedly.  Lairs are essentially end game dungeons stuck in the overworld and can be found as soon as you reach an area.  This of course gets you curious so you investigate only to die to the end game level enemies you find.  There is one every area so that means you need to leave areas uncompleted in order to progress which, for completionists, is like cutting yourself.Die to quick travel: A small con but one you visit a lot.  In order to use the quick travel system you need to die.  Thankfully there is a suicide button in game but its still a pain and damages your equipement which you then need to get fixed before the overpowered enemies rip you to shreds.Overall: I really wanted to recommend this game, I really did.  I absolutly love the atmospere, I love the story and I love how its not another Fantasy MMO and tries to be something.  This game could probably be one of the big MMO's if funcom fixed the mechanics of this game as honestly, everything else is bearable except for the mechanics.			"

												A really well built setting doesn't make up for the tedious grinding.  The cutscenes and voice acted quests do help cover up the traditional mmo kill x of y or get b at c, but after two hours it get old.  The difficulty curve is all over the place, either the mobs are too easy or you are dead.  Combat consisted of trying to move your character backwards from the target, while, keeping the target in a narrow cone to the front of the character, all while trying to hit the key to activate your attack.  So you had one hand on the WASD movement, one hand on the mouse to align your character to the target, and then had to either select the attack with the mouse or move your hand off the movement keys to trigger the attack.  Either way, you will stop to attack and be eaten.  I can't move and attack effectively at the same time.  My character would randomly dodge at times and seemed in capable of properly aligning with targets.  The initial mission in the tutorial does not describe the frustration of combat.  I found myself hitting a wall of things that I couldn't fight.  Graphics liked to bug out once in a while, mostly artifacts and flashes.  And mobs will teleport in just after you cleared out an area and think it's safe to proceed with the objective.  Creating an account and registering my cd key was difficult and required reading the forum.  Lore was confusing and only distracted from the details that helped build the narrative and world.  The very atmospheric zones really help the story, but at the end the game is about playability and the only way I could advance was if I were to team up with other players.  In otherwords, expect to never get out of the first zone if you are soloist.If you are the sort of person that finds World of Warcraft requires too much skill or Eve Online too tedious, then skip The Secret World.  Also skip it if you have no tolerance for trying to register a game and the publisher won't accept your CD key and instead tries to get you to buy the game again.  Skip also if you hate games that try to sell you on being an empowered player and then says enjoy the corpse running.  A game almost 15 years old, Oni, did a better job at running and gunning, and it was fun.  I can't help but compare this to another flop that I wanted to like, ""Champions Online"".  It's pretty much that minus the travel powers, but with better story telling.			"

												Too much forced solo play for an MMO. I really wanted to like this, the lore is very Lovecraftian/X-files and the modern day setting was a breath of fresh air. Sadly, when I get the chance to play with friends, the last thing we want is to be funneled into our own instances, to play the content separately and in parallel. The game mechanics are very mmo-like and not especially fun of themselves, which begs the question why you'd play this rather than a more fun single player game. Not recommended unless you like to play MMOs by yourself.			"

												I wish I could write a review for this game. According to Steam I'm been playing it for some 97 hours... But that's not really true. See, I have never played it. Funcom's account management is not exactly easy to navigate... And when I finally got my account business all squared away, there is the problem with character generation... See, I get logged off the servers before even finishing the character creation. No other game does that, and I have a really ridiculously robust internet connection.Anyway, I hear it is a good. I look forward to watching videos about it on Youtube. But sadly, despite sinking a whole lot of dollars into this title, I don't get to play it.Caveat emptor.			"

												Im a huge MMO fan. But some of the popular titles just arent my thing. The huge NONO for me are the ones where you keep to spam one button over and over without any rotation required. This game falls into this category. There might be a pletora of skills. Sure, but if im limited to few on my bar i just dont care. If you get the Steam client, you are still forced to update the game on the laucher, wich disables you from trying the game before your time to turn it back runs out. Bought it on sale, so whatever, but its already gone from my hard drive. Graphics are outdated, animations are bad, story might be interesting, but combat ruins it completely for me. Cant recommend.

												I really love... errrr ""Loved"" this game, but i will be honest, unless you are willing to dish out a few hundread, Do not get sucked in. The issues cost about $25 each (You only get issues 1-5 with base game) unless you get the Ultimate pack (Which is $60.) I was really into this game  UNTIL THEY I DISCOVERED SOMETHING TOO LATE.  The cosmetics store stuff is over priced, and yes, I am a sucker for cosmetics, I mean who isnt right, but the way they get you is everything is CHARACTER BOUND!Sure, it says account wide, but there was fine print. Allow me to elaborate:* Clothing items are gender specific and will only be unlocked for characters of the same gender.In other words, if you buy an account wide item.. it is ONLY Account wide if you have ALL OF THE SAME GENDER! Yes, yes, I understand that it is my fault and what is a few dollars down the drain right? What ever happen to ligitament account wide items? I mean.. seriously, only unlocks for males on the account? GTFO with that.   /rantAnyways, the story is amazing, I will not deny that, but I feel like I got ripped off and I just do not like to condone that kind of stuff. I have dropped thousands of dollars to games simply because I want to support the devs (I am looking at you Riot and EnMasse) and have no regrets, but when you say account wide and then jip me for it.. na, ill pass.I guess this rant has gone long enough...Game: Solid 8/10Funcom: AnotherTrionDev/10			"

												The Secret World is a very close call for me.The NPCs, story-lines, dialogue, voice-acting, factions, and clothing-customisation are all great. I should really love to play this game.I do not.There are three main reasons:1) The UI is extremely frustrating, and borders on unusable. The widely varying font-sizes make it hard to read. The difficulty in customising the UI into a pleasing, or even useful, system is annoying, although getting a little better over the years. The various menus & windows are extremely unintuitive & hard to get useful info from.2) The combat. Oh, god, the combat. I find that every fight is you & the mob standing 1 foot from each other, and you're pushing 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2... or something similar until it dies. It might get more interesting later, but it's still likely to be just standing way too close to each other. Just some very unfun, irritating combat... and I actually often like tab-targetting combat in general.3) Many of the quests. Listen, a lot of the quests are pretty great when they're developing the story-line, and you're finding out about obscure NPCs, or interesting things that've happened, or general lore... but there are a pretty fair number of filler-quests that are ""Run down the block, kill 15 of __, come back, run back to the same spot, kill 20 of __type2"", etc.. There's enough of these that it gets annoying, because it seems that you're doing exactly the same motions over and over when you just want to get to the fun, interesting quests again.Now having said that... if you honestly don't mind having a frustrating UI, uninteresting combat, & repetitive filler-quests because your interest in story means more to you, then the rest of the game is extremely interesting and would be well worth your time. For me it was not, because I couldn't get over the frustrating elements.			"

												I'm running a 4790Kl @ 4.0GHz, 16GB DDR3, and a 270X which should be sufficient.I can tell that a lot of passion went into this project, but I feel like it was made by 100 people that have never met, released, and updated endlessly with band-aids rather than being fixed. I want so much to play and enjoy this game but my patience has been tested to the brink. It took a full day to download it and patch it. The patch tool bugged out (kept downloading even after it completed) and had to be restarted. Some of us still have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet (not by choice, but by monopolized service areas) and having to download 30GB and then 10GB and then re-download 10GB because the patch tool broke is really annoying.Then I finally started the game and all the intro screens glitch and stutter.LOADING...The videos for the factions stutter and I can't watch them.LOADING...Character creation: Oh wait, there is no character. All the squares are gray and there is no character present to customize.Restart.LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter.Look online for solutions: ""If you run it in a window the cutscenes work but the fps in-game are cut in half. Also don't use DX11.""OK, uh DX9 then. ""Must restart."" OK. Restart.LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter. No improvement on cutscenes with DX9. Turn back to full-screen.Character creation: Hey! Check it out! The character is not there but at least the gray squares have been replaced by actual images of reading glasses!::Google missing graphics in character creation... no dice::Still missing.5 minutes later, ""Oh wait, it popped up! Yay!""Wow, why does my character look like a dwarf girl with thunder-thighs? Why does everything look so PSONE?OK finally! I get to start the game!LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter... stuttering cutscene stuttering cutscene.COOL I get to finally play the game! Hmmm my clothes constantly disappear and reappear. I'm glad I picked the girl.Cutscene - she's bald and naked! Oh wait, there, her hair just popped in... OK now her clothes. Oh wait her outfit changed. Oh wait it is back.Finally - a day and a half in, actual gameplay. Wow, this really does look like a game from 15 years ago but the sound is good, music is good, seems like the story is going is cool. Oh wait. I'm lost. Oh, I can't accept this mission. Oh LORE! Oh wait, why bother showing the Lore detail text if it immediately flies off the screen. Wait, where should I go? OK this must be it. Oh no, this is a surgeon and I can't accept any of these missions. Ah I can't seem to skip his voice-acting. I'll wait. And wait. OK lower the graphics settings. OK zero issues with gameplay at the moment, just cutscenes (and they are everywhere).OK I made it to my destination. That was actually really cool. OK I met some NPCs and I finally have a weapon.Fight! Wait,♥♥♥♥♥♥I can't see anything. I appear to be fighting this monster while being inside it. OK tab shoot... tab shoot... I can't really see what is happening, everything is so dark. Ok next part. Uh oh, this is some kind of boss! Wait, glitch glitch... The game has gone black. There is a background noise and a black screen. I cannot do anything.Alt+Ctrl+Del - task manager > End task.Damn. So there you go. 9 hours of frustration, 20 minutes of gameplay and then a hard freeze.Imagine what I could be creating or what wonderful things I could be doing IRL instead of trying so hard to make this game playable.

												Seems like a promising game.  I am a fan of Funcom in general, I think theydid a great job on AO> However, the ""minimum"" requirements are prettymucha lie and total garbage.  This game will not run on older systems.  If you are evenanywhere close to the minimum specs, don't expect to run this game.  You candownload 40 gigs, play the intro, tutorial etc. but once you get to the first actuallevel with mulitple quests, tons of other players running around etc, just expectto crash constantly.  You need a solid rig, great GPU, 64 bit OS and tons of ram tobe able to run this game at all.   The game actually recommends you to get a 64 bit OS.  This might be fine if it were in the minimium reqs, but it's misleading as is.Hopefully the game runs great for those of you with awesome rigs, but for anyonehoping to run this game on the low end, forget it!

												I might recommend this if you just want a mediocre solo game.  The issue being there are much stronger solo games out there with much better storylines, graphics, and npc interactions.  I ackowledge that the story is ocassionally above average for an mmo, but I prefer social interaction and grouping in my mmo's... so as not to defeat the purpose of an mmo.  There seems to be a general reluctance to use any form of voice chat by players and a strong preference for solo play.  There is very little community and what little exists is largely relegated to build discussions.  If you want a solo game with in game forum accesss... have at it.  If you are seeking interaction with others, group strategy and mechanics... play an actual mmo instead.			"

												The atmosphere and narrative are great... but... there are some MAJOR flaws that need to be known.Really, this should have been a single player game - not an MMO. I have no tolerance for ""solo only"" instances in an MMO.  An MMO should never have less functionality than a co-op game.  There are no excuses.  I've heard all the malarkey about how making instances multi-player would ruin the narrative for some players.  These are all lies. You will have to endure instanced killing quests that are solo only as well.  Were is the narrative in that? What it boils down to is lazy design.  At the most formative moments you will be forced to disband and slog through instances on your own because Funcom didn't want to deal with the net-code.  This is not how an MMO works kids.  14 year old games like Neverwinter Nights did far better than this and it wasn't even an MMO.Also, at it's heart it's just another task running game.  Yup. There are really good cut-scenes and voice-overs but still it all amounts to a lot of task running.  To add to the monotony, there is a quest helper that tells you exactly where you need to go for those hundreds of task running quests.   So basically you've got your shopping list for a months long shopping trip.Instead of exploring the maps, you'll be starring at your quest helper...  but hey, you get some great dialogue along the way - and I do mean that.This would be a great single player game, or at least a good one...  but if you're looking to play with friends you will hit roadblocks.  Roadblocks that should never exist in an MMO.  It is absolutely inexcusable to have an MMO be cooperatively less functional than a multi-player game.Sorry Funcom.  Great effort but you need to go back to basics.			"

Making bosses that are extremely difficult and nearly impossible unless your a healing classs build....I do not exagerate this in the least....why is this?.....they make these boss fight's SOLO INSTANCES - you are by yourself even if your in a party. I run with two others that play it, one of us has made it, he is a blood magic/rifle build...a healer dps. I am a elemental/pistol build a dps tank. The third member is a shotgun/hammer build, a heavy tank.  Our healer has killed and surpassed every boss we have come across thus far....and we arent even off the STARTING area and we've been at it for 2 months. Me and the main tank however.....have not. Healing items are scarce and unobtainable outside random drops. Sure there is ONE vendor we know of who sells extremely weak ones, well below our levels but will only accept black bullion.....4 a piece and these bullion can only be obtained through completing quests, these are also used to buy the best ranked weapons and equipment for you at a time. At most you will earn 3-4 per quest that has 9-12 tiers to complete. I would be posting this on the normal forums however they seem to have been shut down or some such. My user name and password are no longer valid on them and I know I'm not banned as I've never recieved a notice nor have I ever posted before. They have disappointed me dearly, this could have been something epic.....sadly it has fallen short, one should not need veteran rated gear and weapons and or dungeon A+ grade gear and weapons to complete the task. They have decided to put raid bosses in the game without the choice or ability to have....ya know...a raid. A team of 8+ people. I have put money into this game past the initial purchase.....so I feel I have been ripped off and stolen from. I would rather see this game be done correctly....with the choice of having friends assist you...alas that does not seem to be the case anytime soon. Unless you plan on putting a butt ton of money into the game to get the high tier stuff early on.....I do not reccomend this game to you or anyone for that matter. - Correcting this two hours later after checking, chances are putting all that money in wont really matter either as the only usefull thing you could buy are more skill points.....which mean very little against these bosses.

												I wanted to like this game. The premise has amazing possibilities. But the execution ruins it.The combat system is bad-most of the time you'll be mashing the basic attack button while running in circles, hoping you don't get hit. Since the dodge move takes a while to recharge, you'll barely use it in combat, and most of the advanced attacks either take too long to prepare or are too ineffective to use against the majority of enemies. I haven't tried the PvP aspect, but if it uses the same combat system, it's almost certainly horrible.The quests range from ""meh"" to bad. Most of the time, they're simple: go here, get this and/or kill that, return. When they try to be more complex, however, they actually become worse- the stealth quests have you use tank controls mixed with some platforming to evade lasers and (erratic) cameras, while the research quests, aside from being convoluted in general, often fail in the actual research part: you are far more likely to find an online guide of how to do the entire quest than you are to find the answer you are actually looking for.The inventory system is also bad- the controls are wonky, the weapon upgrade system appears to be copied from Minecraft, and it appears as though you can't get more storage unless you pay for it through microtransactions.The story is better, but not by much. My biggest problem is with the intro- you gain magical powers and strange dreams by swallowing a random bee, then either (a) a representative from either the Illuminati or the Templar comes into your apartment, tells you that they're from a secret society, then hands you a either business card or a sealed letter; or (b) a representative from the Dragon comes into your apartment, knocks you out, kidnaps you, and dumps you on a random streetcorner in Seoul. Then, after some more visions, you join the faction and are sent to do their bidding. My problem with this is that, since your character never talks except for asking questions, you are seemingly ok with being kidnapped then ditched in another country (and possibly another continent, depending on where your apartment was).The factions are good, overall. The Templar and Dragon behave exactly how you expect them to (though I don't know how the Templar is a secret society when they have a building with their insignia plastered all over it). But the Illuminati? I don't feel like I just joined a secret society that is actually in control of the entire world. I feel like I just joined a corporation based in a sewer and composed entirely of the biggest morons on the planet.They have a trail of easily recognizable graffiti leading you to their HQ, Doc Brown himself as their chief scientist, and your boss? Within 5 minutes of meeting her she had told me her entire life story and made me wonder if my entire playthrough with them is going to be composed of jokes and references. Seriously, I don't know how they got the Illuminti so wrong, especially since all they had to do to make a good Illuminati is copy Deus Ex's.I'll admit that I haven't spent much time with this game, but I've seen enough to know I won't enjoy the rest. It had alot of potential, but it was wasted.			"

												Let's start with the fact that I really wanted to like this game. Pros: story telling, the world, and overall atmosphere.Cons: Combat feels disconnected, animations are a bit weird, hard to play with friends.I bought a pack that included the Ultimate Editon + 2 months of membership - If I had gotten the game and I didn't have to continue to pay the monthly subscription that would be one thing. However without subscription things like jumping around the game started to cost in-game currency.I was trying to play with a friend which was fun - until we got to dungeons. Most dungeons seemed to be solo instances. In one particular case I struggled for about 30 minutes while my friend just had to sit and wait if we wanted to progress together. No, being in a party won't save you from this fate. My biggest disappointment though was the combat. It seemed a lot of repeatedly pressing one key over and over without feeling I was actually doing much. There's no real substance to the mechanism and it makes it feel very disconnected. The animations for combat are poor as well. And the online store is horrible. Half the time I was on website, half the time since I had purchased through Steam I was on another.			"

												You know... if you're still okay with themepark MMORPG's then you might want to try it. I just think that this feels like a re-skin of WoW with modern clothes & sets. Mobs spawn in exactly the same place everytime... just like they did in EQ in 1999.Plus, the combat is just terrible. I knew that going in - but I thought ""hey, everyone says the story is great, so maybe I can live with subpar combat."" Well, I was wrong. The problem is that there is a LOT of fighting - and it is very dull, with stilted animations.The story is pretty cool - what little I saw of it. Maybe I didn't give this game enough of a chance, maybe the combat gets better later (but that's not my experience with MMORPG's, you're usually doing pretty much the same kind of fighting at lvl 50 as at lvl 5) - but I can't force myself to think the combat is fun when it isn't - and combat is 85% of the game.

It is not engaging at all. I would rather just grind monsters for hours than do these meaningless chores and the microtransaction shop ingame just added to my frustration. I bought the game but i dont get everything? At the time i bought it they did not advertise anywhere anything about a microtransaction shop. All that on top of being overly chore ridden, bad voiceacting, and a poor plot line. I would have to not recommend this to anybody.			"

												I had fun with this game for a bit.  You can greatly customize your character while playing, both in appearance and with the weapons and skills you use to play the game.  Unfortunately, I reached a point where I wasn't able to advance any further while soloing.  I wasn't interested in raiding or doing dungeons, so the MMORPG aspect of the game wasn't a big draw for me.  I still had fun while I played, though, and it reminded me of some aspects of Anarchy Online.			"

												I really really wanted to like this game. It's got a cool approach to the MMORPG, however it falls flat on its face once you meet 'end game'. Once you've finished the lore/campaign or gone as far as you wish to/can(if you don't buy the DLC you don't get more content) go. Your options are PVP or running instances of previously run instances on a harder setting... Now this in itself isn't too terrible, but the PVP is extremely boring. The instancing is somewhat better, but I prefer instancing to PVP anyway. Now add the fact that if you don't wish to PVP and want to do the instances, you'll be spending the majority of your time waiting for 1 of 4 roles needed for a 4 man group. You'd think a basic need for 2 dps, 1 healer, and 1 tank, would be easy to acquire. But more often than not I sat around waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Wondering why I was logged in when I could be playing some other game and actually PLAYING THE GAME. I was told the answer to this problem, is to join a cabal(guild/clan, etc.). So I did, and everything was great, for about a week. Then it was back to waiting to maybe, eventually, PUG(pickup groups)(with a few cabal mates if lucky). The major reason getting people to do these groups however isn't really the communities fault. The game bars you from doing the instances more than once every 24 hours or something like that. Which is beyond stupid. Ok, you don't want people without lives to grind to the top in no time flat, I get that. But here's something that many other games have employed, it's called loot-lock. The ability to still run the instance is there, but those precious loots you normally run for that drop off the bosses, don't drop for you. Why this is important, this allows friends to help out other friends who maybe couldn't run the instance when everyone else was able to. So they can help the friend out by running with the group, filling the role required, but not powerleveling/gearing through the game. Because this feature is non-existant, we come back to my biggest complaint, and really the only one that matters. I consider it a 'game-breaker', instead of playing the game, I am constantly waiting on 1 other freaking person to fill 1 freaking role just to run an instance I can only do every 24 hours. Everything up to that I enjoyed, the story telling and voice acting are masterful. The setting and atmosphere are true to the genre with great graphics to help bring the world to life. If you are looking for an MMO to get into for a while but eventually leave by the way side, this might be a fun trip for you, but if you plan on staying a while, you'll probably be disappointed with the end game or lack thereof. Also, I'd like to state that I wish this wasn't such a black and white rating system. I'd like to give points and credit where it's due, but my overall feelings are not recommended for someone who wants a new MMO home.			"

I have to say, I find the game pretty hard, especially when it comes to bosses you have to defeat solo, but there's so much good in this game that I can't stop playing. I play with my brother and I kinda feel like Sam and Dean from Supernatural. Hunting various monsters (of all size), resolving impossible riddles (Taking notes is back!), meeting other players (Great community)... It's pretty cool. Maps are great, at least the ones I've seen, there're lots of different things to do, though you pretty much always end up shooting things. I couldn't do it alone, but lots of people do, it's hard but It's addictive. One of my favorite game!			"

												The Secret World is an exercice in frustration.It starts with registering your registration key and opening an account and giving your personal info and e-mail address to EA/Funcom and going through several confusing screens and finally linking your Steam account to your Funcom account. After all, that you will have to enter a special password every time you wish to play even if logged in Steam.Then you have to create a character. Choosing a nickname is a challenge in itself ! The following resource was useful to me:http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com/ The third challenge is mastering the awful movement and combat controls using WASD keys for direction and hitting TAB to target monsters and hitting numbers keys for your attacks and X to sprint. Mouse is almost useless! The worst user interface I've ever seen. The combat system is basically like Guild Wars with character builds based on skills and equipment combos but more complex. This is not a game for people who like to move their character with precision and dodge attacks or outrun the enemies. Guild wars, WoW, Neverwinter Nights also use skill bars but the combat experience is much more pleasant. I don't know if this is the result of insufficient playtesting, insentitivity to player's feedback, or just the developpers smoking too much weed but this is what you have to deal with now. The fourth challenge is technical. I think the minimum specs for this game are inaccurate. I have seen many user comments that the game will not run well on a 32 bit OS. I am getting out of memory errors and screen freezes every 15-30 minutes with a high end Win 7 system  that meets the specs. I will try the game again in 1-2 years when I plan to buy a new more powerful computer because i'm interested in digging deeper into the story.So, why are there so many positive comments about this game?The graphics are nice but not cutting edge. It's the story, immersive and intriguing, that keeps people playing. There are places to explore, mysteries to solve and a Lovecraftian atmosphere and a Deus Ex feeling to this game and well-made cut scenes and I think this is why the game has dedicated fans. I have seen Youtube videos featuring late game players and bosses that seemed exciting but it may take a few years of grinding to get there. I'm frustrated but I have to stop for now.Shadow's advice:Do not buy- if you don't have a 64 bit OS and high end rig.- if you like skill based games (precise aiming, hitting, blocking, evasion)- if you are easily frustrated and impatient ( it's a bad prognosis if you haven't taken the time to read my entire review)- if your gaming budget is limited- if it is not a deeply discounted Steam sale- if you have had a bad experience with EA/Funcom in the past- if you value privacy and don't like to give out personal info to big corporations other than Steam- if you haven't read a few more of the negative comments ( I wish I had read a few more of those myself ) "

I play with my brother and I kinda feel like Sam and Dean from Supernatural. Hunting various monsters (of all size), resolving impossible riddles (Taking notes is back!), meeting other players (Great community)... It's pretty cool. Maps are great, at least the ones I've seen, there're lots of different things to do, though you pretty much always end up shooting things. I couldn't do it alone, but lots of people do, it's hard but It's addictive. One of my favorite game!			"

												After having played other MMO games like ''guild wars'' or ''Marvel heroes'', I find the interface terrible!I love ghost storys, mytholgies and scary monsters, but the gameplay and interface are just wrong for me.I guess the gameplay is do able with practice, but all the other stuff...There is almost no guide, or explanation of everything in the beginning. I don't know what to do, because missions are terribly given and there is mostly no information. In the start screen, the menu is ok. I know what buttons do, but in game. The menu is un user friendly to my thaughts. I tried to equip some clothes or something, ''for example'', now. I think the armor and items are gone or something! i could't find it anymore.I need some explanation and a guide in the beginning. Sure there was something i could say as an introduction, because it was skip able. In this cas rather, it was just you being trhown into the deep. Find stuff out yourself, know when you must equip stuff, know where you can upgrade or spend skills or something, know what every button does and how this game works, cause thats normal.Well. i quess what i am trying to say is:BUY AND PLAY IT,! ! !ONLY IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT AND HOW IT WORKS! ! !

												I'd love to like this and go into detail about why this is the best MMO, but it isn't.  Even if it was free, it has glaring problems with basic mechanics, progression, PvP, microtransaction bombardment, and even continuity (which is astounding for a game built on the premise of conspiracy theories existing). If the theme is something you love and you can overlook a lot of problems and a very small playerbase, go ahead and try this out but just be warned that the devs have a habit of forgetting to complete old storylines, ignoring bugs, and spending hundreds of man-hours developing content few requested.TL;DR Niche theme done okay.

												Swing and a miss. While this beautiful horror MMO has an engaging world, a fun character custumization tree, and fast-paced gameplay, it lacks one critical element: playability.  Multiplayer missions (which are optional) flow by quickly and are a blast to complete. Single-player missions (which are mandatory), by contrast, are three times as hard and painful to finish. While this may enhance the feeling of horror by occassionally forcing you to be all alone and out of your league, this makes it fail utterly as an MMO.  If I am signing on to play a few missions with my friends, and defeat a big boss, few things are as annoying as forcing the group to disband so we can each slog through the next segment of the mission seperately.  Since the single player missions are harder and therefore apt to take longer to complete, the result is that you sit around waiting for the one guy who is getting lost, or has a build that is all wrong for the misson to get through it, or to throw up his hands in disgust and log out. I want to like it, but I just can't.			"

												This is such an awfully boring MMO, I like the fact they tried to make it different, E.G. they made it set in 'modern' rather than old fantasy but that doesn't make it good. I'm used to the standard MMO controls but it just feels weird in this. Nobody plays it, the quests are weirdly hard sometimes, it's really dark (lighting not story) and overall not worth it. I recomend Guild Wars 2, or World of Warcraft if u want to pay £9 a month. Oh also, they customization and leveling up is so ♥♥♥♥ing complicated I just don't get it.			"

												While this game is rich in the way that it tells its story parts, there are three main problems with it. The first is that you really determine how in depth your character is going to be when running around and piecing together the plot. Normally this would be a fine example of roleplaying if it weren't for the second problem. The second problem here being that you don't really have a character in this Role Playing Game. Sure, you have an avatar, that runs around and does things and hits all the appropriate buttons and whatnot, but you aren't really given much of an option to say anything in conversation to any one of the seemingly infinite number of quest givers. You can 'ask' questions afterward, but they don't really have much of an impact with all the people talking either like sceptics, zealots, or inferring everthing in a way that nauseatingly reminds one of 'Wicker Man'. So without any real Character building, the only role that you would play seems to come from the Society you join, however... The third major problem comes from there being no real difference between the societies. Of course, your taskmasters are different, you have different cutscenes and different cities that you are based in, but they still all ask you go to the same places, to do the same things, and nothing changes.Aside from the lacking in character, the rest of the game holds up well. The enemies are varied and lean heavily on horror inspired literature, the difference between the gloom and harsh lighting in the game gives the palpable feel of hoplessness the game strives to achieve, and the combat mechanics are very MMO.A decent game, but not one I'm willing to sink my teeth into.

The combat is the worst thing i have ever seen, ever. you use wsqe (thats correct) to move with a and d to turn left or right and q and e to strafe left or right, the mouse must be on right click to actully move and controll your character. this sucks beacuase the combat is you standing 5-10 meters away from you opponent and then hitting 1-5, if he gets close to you the you run away, repeat untill there dead. its boring and repetive, what more could you want.

												Okay so the premise sounds good: modern day setting, H.P Lovecraft theme (amongst others), free class system where you can switch around any and all skills available till you get exactly what you want.So to keep it short I will list pros and cons.Pros:-Questing storys have great dialog and voice acting...I'm pretty sure the guy who was Tuvok in Star Trek voiced a random character but I could be wrong-Free class system really helps you understand there is no need to ever reroll a toon (Don't do it, I thought about it a couple of times then kept playing some more and ended up getting what I would have rerolled for without much effort)-Great atmosphere-Really in depth and puzzling investigation missionsCons:-Glitchy old combat system-Dated graphics (but graphics aren't everything)-Feels extremely single player for an mmorpg (after looking this up I found that areas are instance based so there are never a ton of people around to break the feeling you are alone) but with this also come the empty almost useless chat box.  I know I am not at the end game yet but I still see people running about .  I wave and try to talk but in 30 hours only three people have ever responded (and yes all my chat systems are working fine).  I do see people but I get the feeling that while the game may not be dead and gone it certainly is on its last leg as far as population is concerned.  All in all so far for the beginning part of the game it is pretty lonely for an mmorpg.-investigation missions: you don't have to do it, and while it is certainly cool some puzzles are down right time consuming for the reward you get when you could just be doing others and when you use the internet to help you with clues...and you will...you have to sometimes... you will be bonbarded with sites that just flat out telling you the answer. (Not gonna lie half they time i just click them to get the mission over with)All in all...The game is a great game that will give you great stories and a fantastic atmosphere and you can really easily sink your time into it as long as you don't care about teaming up that often.  I recommend the game if you have free time, love Lovecraft and don't really feel the need to have much of a community to be involved with.  I don't recommend it if you want: a solid always there community, a game that you can play without thinking too much, and the classic leveling/gear system.  Also don't buy the expansion until you are sold on the game, I did and hopefully I'll continue to make it worth the while.  Still with the mmorpg genre really decreasing its a good refreashing game I enjoy playing hence why I recommend it			"

												So I decided to give this game a whirl...  first found out that Steam's ""Ultimate Edition"" is NOT the complete edition.  If you have patience you can find the Complete edition floating around for $18 or so....  but that was not my luck.  I had to spend another $18 on top of the original payment to make it complete.  Thus my irritation with the way this game is handled began from the start.The game itself is great.  Intriguing stories, great innovative character customization and development... until you finish the third major story arc then it comes to a crashing halt and becomes a grind fest.  Getting to this point you realize that the game is unbalanced as you progress.... Yes, you have all this freedom for customization but there's many points where your leveling mistakes will bite your♥♥♥♥♥hard.The game already does very little to hold your hand to figure things out, which is good, but the sudden focus on grinding in the 4th act strikes me as a weak attempt to add more content without actually doing so.  Simulation scenarios....  Joy, because I'd rather be doing X-men training room exercises instead of solving a mission.  *sarcasm*  Cripes it's not like there's a famine on Occult Detective or Urban Fantasy ideas.... but I digress.Funny thing... I let it all slide...  Funcom's ""store"" is filled mostly with crap costume items.  What would I need there?...I was a happy little bee leveling up and knowing my ""membership"" that I got with my Ultimate pack was about to run out.  I was ready for the decrease in EXP, Bullion, and Cash....  the 8 hour mission cooldown didn't worry me too much because I usually get on a few times a day and the cooldown never bothered me.  It says ""No Subscription Required"" right?  I wasn't too worried.Membership ran out:JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST....  I found out the hard way that some mission cooldowns are almost THREE DAYS!!!  WTF! This is totally unreasonable.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Already forcing me to grind, but NO, I can't grind on the missions I like the most because, frankly, the others just aren't worth it or are boring.But wait... there's a 1 time use ""cooldown"" vial you can buy for about $5.... or just shell out $15 a month for 8 hour cooldowns.  Can I honestly reccomend this game?  UMMM..... NO.Overall...  Great game ruined by unbalanced progression and greedy game breaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.-------------------I'm adding more because I'm bored.  Why am I bored?  Loading screens.  Be prepared... to wait... and wait... and wait... a fourth of my entire time playing seems like loading screens.  Those missions that have problems?  The ones where you have to go to multiple locations are the worst because of the endless loading.Gaaahh.... just fix it.  Someone put some shine on this pearl in the muck.  Please?  OH... wait.  It had been staring at me the entire time, like a giant 666 on the forehead, until it finally hit me.  EA...  right in my face, but now it's sunk in... EA has marked it... thus it is only for the damned.			"

												Well - I have have only played one MMO before this game, and it was TERRA - which was a FREE skill based gameThis game is not skill based. I read online that the controls for this were 'typical' for an MMO - in that case, anyone who plays an MMO or thinks the controls for one make them good at gaming need to hang their head in shame.This is an interetive adventure, Monkey Island minus 5000 fun points. Utter, utter rubbish. Good story, wasted on a skilless cash grab.No wonder people say PC Gaming is dead, with this kind of carry on, I don't doubt it anymore.If you want to not use your mouse, play a console game, you useless gamers.

												Basically when this game came out I was like, ""that sounds cool"" but I didn't think it was worth investing into another MMO.  Then they took away the subscription fee and I was like, ""maybe I'll check it out"" and then it was on sale so what-the-heck.  Basically first of all the actual ""societies"" are not as cool as you think they are, they are kind of lame.  There are missions that do not involve combat, which are different and interesting, but the game is still combat-intensive and honestly the combat system sucks.  The game comes down to an MMO gearscore grind, while the combat system sucks.  Low level PVP is a complete joke, or at least it was when I was playing it a year or so ago.  While it is ""pay once play forever"" you still have to buy the DLC or maybe call them ""expansion packs"" so that's another $30.  It was originally concept-developed by The Longest Journey guy, which I didn't even know but there you go.  Honestly it is just not that great of a game.  I don't play it for different reasons not limited to needing a new video card.			"

You discovered some spesial powers, you were recruted. You chose a weapon (why I considered needing one in first place?). Then we jump straight into action...- No connection of player to the story whatsoever. Why are we here, why do we care? Should we stick around, do we need something something from this place in particular? Why people we meet trust us, tell us stories about what happened? There are no answers to these questions.- World feels unfinished, like a painting where leaves of the tree are fine-made, but the whole picture is absent. Why is Kingsmouth left to its own devices, why no help is coming? Is something amiss in in world, and they are all alone, or there is some mistery bubble around them? Why they do not just evacuate the few living people left alive?- Very fast enemy respawn, making solo playing rather hard- Subtle progress of character+ Only two ""major"" servers (makes difference for PvP only) which makes trade, chat and all other actions easy and seamless+ Quests tips include item interaction, pictures, etc. + Quests cutscenes are possibly one of the best around+ No subscription+ grim Lovecraftian world living up to its promiseNA Style can be seen on screenshots, they are pretty accurate.NA Leveling differs from most online games__________________________Bottom line - playing possible only on 64 bit systems, pluses and minuses are mixed.

												As many people stated, there are aspects of the game that are fun and exciting. Then, there are the terrible aspects that just make the game not fun. Everyone talking about brain testing, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They put an ingame browser in the game that you can access with the press of a button. This guide can access ANYTHING on the internet, so it's no brain teaser.Developing a character build is painful, because there just isn't a real point to building anything other than what you think would be fun. It is worth saying, the cookie cutter classes are kind of removed becuase you can actually master EVERY skill in the game. You're not bound to a specific set of skills. It's just mind numbing to try and mull through the days it will take to get the points needed.The combat system is just awful, and the lack of hotkeys makes it even worse. Every time you pull a mob, it always runs PAST you. This makes melee combat chains frustrating as hell. PVP is a joke, fighting over nodes and the normal song and dance. While not particularly exciting, the part that sucks is the combat itself again. You basically just have people who stand still and AoE because there is nothing to worry about. There is no skill or tactics, just spam your AoE and hope the other person dies first. The only part that is even worth looking into is the actual capture of the nodes, which is just more PVE.The conspiracy theory that fuels the game is interesting. The story drives you to want to play, it's just the other parts that make you stop. Lackluster character creation, inventory management, and a rediculous crafting system makes this game a no brainer. Find something better to play.			"

												The quests are interesting and the ideas are actually quite original and fun, but the combat and skills system lets it all down.I was horribly disappointed that you can only have one ""super"" skill equipped at a time, and the sameness of all the different attacks made combat dull, and that's a pity because combat is about 80% of the game.All in all I tried to love it, but just got bored with the fighting.6/10			"

												The writing and story in this MMORPG is superb. Top notch. I loved the storyline and plot twists. Unfortunately, the game's difficulty level shot upward WAY too fast. Read up on builds and synergies to no avail. The ONLY way I could progress was by ""outleveling"" the content....which shouldn't have been both possible and necessary. Possible in the fact that the game touts ""no levels""...which is true in a sense. You..the character have no level. YOUR GEAR DOES. If you don't have the very best gear(which takes an ungodly amount of grinding to get) you're not going to get very far. Necessary in the fact that despite the advertised ""create your own character""...if you don't have certain abilities and weapon sets, you're not going to be able to complete even the basic storyline. The loot system is an archaic and terribad need/greed system.Character models are clones of one another, with badly represented character models from Age of Conan copy/pasted over.The grind starts early and doesn't let up. No, what could've been a visionary and revolutionary game went the way of the dodo.			"

												This game struggle to know if it's a mmorpg or a single player game. If you want to play with friends be aware that in this game they have something called ''solo instance'' you cannot do them with others and some of them are in the main quests, so you will have to do it everyone in their ''space'' and then wait for everyone to regroupe at the end.  For me it's a major flaw for a mmo. If you love pvp be cautious, yes the game say that you can build your own skillset and no class exisst, but in pvp you gonna see the same combo OVER AND OVER.I really wanted to love this game. Great music, great setting , descent story. But the game mechanics ruined it for me.			"

												Ok before you read the rest. I am an MMO veteran of about 10 years.  Started with WoW and played pretty much most of the MMO's on the market up until a few years ago.  MMO's can be fun but take ALOT of time to progress through all the content.  With that having been said, TSW is a VERY fun game to play.  I couldn't put it down for about 2 weeks. My wife was hounding me to hang out with her but I was so addicted to getting as many skill points as possible to get all of the abilities, that I put her off that whole time.  The game is very addicting if you like to progress your character.  TSW has three factions.  As you progress through the story (which is pretty fun too) which entails alot of content from HP Lovecraft's Cthulu Mythos, you will obtain faction missions that eventually make you rise in rank to the point where you're like a second in command of that faction.  When I played TSW a year ago, the Dragons were the least played faction and usually lost PVP most of the time.  If you want to pvp and have all the locations under your control, join the Templars.  What Funcom got right with TSW:  fun exciting storyline with all fully fleshed voice acted missions. The missions are hard and require doing research on the internet to get the answer.   Engaging character progression with the ability to buy any skill, any ability you want.  Thats it!  What Funcom got wrong:  TSW is still EXTREMELY linear.  You cant go to any zone you choose like a sandbox mmo.  You go through the zones the game deems is your level until you level up your weapon skills and equipment skills so you can equip higher level gear...that determines your level basically.  You'll notice after the first zone, your skills in whatever weapon you want are at 1 and progress to about 3 or so.  All the mobs go from yellow to green, meaning they are easy to kill, just like any themepark MMO.  Funcom states you are free from classes and levels.  This is bull.  You still have a class per se with the many decks the game reccomends.  Your levels are basically the levels of skill you put into each skill so you can move on to the next zone.  Its an utter facade.  In addition, the combat is utter garbage!  The controls are so incredibly clunky and unresponsive that its a test in frustration every time you want to engange a mob.  You dont have 50 abilities to use like in WoW, instead you have 7.  Luckily in thisg ame you can assign hotkeys but the abilites are so boring, the animations so stiff, that it's just plain frustrating to play the game.  It's unfortunate that funcom screwed up such a great concept for an MMO.  Modern setting with Call of Cthulu elements mixed in.  If it wasn't so themepark orientated and had such god awful control's and animations, it could've been an real gem.  Basically Funcom is milking the idiots that buy crap from their online store before they move on to another game.  I don't think TSW will close any time soon as Funcom's first mmo, Anarchy online, is still going strong after 12 years.  I would wait until it hits a 75% off sale then buy it as there's no longer a sub fee.			"

												If you like doing modernday call of cthulhuish horror mmo this game is for you.  Though getting punched in the butt by zombies while trying to figure out a puzzle gets very old after the 15th time.  I'll summarize the game a bit more for those curious.Reasons to buy the game:Provides a unique atmosphere in a modern day enviroment.Several large areas to explore in various terrains.Decent graphics and good visuals.Provides several puzzles and stealth areas as an alternative to kill grinding.Tends to be heavy story focused and not grind focused.There are tons of cutscenes for every quest NPC chacter.Reasons to avoid the game:A lot of the scares feel lack luster and not very scary after all it is an MMO.Other players will be more then glad to pull you out of the immersion with their outragous outfits and actoins.Puzzles at times can not work for you and can break.There are a hand full of issues with the game that cause it to freeze and crash.Enemy spawns are built for groups so, soloing it will get annoying exteremly fast.There is a leveling system where you gain points and spend them to allow yourself to get better gear thus better stats and content to high level for you will be unplayable until you grind up points and get gear for it.Theres a death penalty for a game that requires you to die to complete quests.The acting in the cutscenes at times can feel very forced and many have unbelievable backstories.The combat is pretty standard MMO fair and gets repetetive quickly.So if you want a modern day horror game with elements of puzzle and stealth go for it.  If you are looking for an MMO to solo or play for combat avoid this title.			"

												I'm sorry but I just haven't enjoyed this game very much. Like any MMO, it can be fun with a friend but that's where the fun ends.Good:-Nice graphics with modern setting(something you don't see in typical MMOs)-Lots of different quests that come with cutscenes of very weird and mysterious NPCs-Lots of modern weapon options-Modern clothing customization is unique to this game- no other MMO lets you dress just as you do in real life!-Scary monsters that are fun to kill especially around Halloween season-No subscription requiredBad:-Players used to being told what to do will be completely lost in this MMO and its unique quest structure(kind that makes you try to play detective and decide on your own what to do next) (YOU WILL BE LOOKING UP HOW TO DO MOST QUESTS)-NPCs are mostly uninteresting and ramble around hoping you care to try to decipher what they are talking about-Community is nice, but mostly non-sociable and while you will always encounter people during your adventures, majority will not care to try to help you-Higher PC requirements than other MMOs(I can run WoW and GW2 just fine with my GT 555m but I struggle to run this game at a good FPS especially in highly populated areas)-Story(s) are mostly uninteresting-PVP is underwhelming-UI is still unintuitive to this date-Lack of direction early on in the game in what weapons and skills you should focus on could result in disaster(If you don't focus on just two weapons and instead try to be good at everything, you will ruin your character and will take a long time for you to get past many quests on your own)All this said, it's unique enough that I can see why most people recommend this MMO. I really have had some good times playing with others and I will probably continue to play this game to waste time. But it's definitely not my main MMO and I am not always having fun. At least not most of the time. Too many negatives for me to enjoy.			"

That or take up in three way pvp which isn't my fancy.  So here i am faced with three descisions that are semigly endless in possible outcomes, you ether enroll in a group and have to deal with that, go at it alone and hope to find some other people willing to go, or you perish and fade into nothingness.

												Your mission; to choose one of three maid services and clean up the filth pouring into this world.Welcome to the secret world of janitorial services.The 'choose your character' gimmick is actually a very standard level up system for MMOs. Most of the skill points earned while leveling will be making mistakes as like other open skill choice systems, there are more bad decisions to make than good. The punishment of choice escalates the further you progress, effectively bricking characters as you learn about the game and adapt.The puzzles are beyond obtuse. For example, no where in the game does it tell the player to kill themselves and enter ghost form to solve anything. How would you know if you play safe and don't die? So much dumb is included in the main story quests, let alone the side missions.Voice acting is very good and I only stuck around to see how bad the puzzles got. The writing is hit and miss though. I screenshotted about 12 scenes where the dialogue was rhetorical and needless for the sake of being cool. I would have more if I continued doing after the second hour.In case anyone thought a World Of Darkness MMO could be good, this game mirrors what that sort of game would be. Mostly flash, and a standard grind-a-thon MMO with heavy padding. I would loosely recommend this game when using a walkthrough. Without one, it's hell.			"

There is no reason to do dungeons until you get rank 8 in most of your gear. There is no good reason to party up with people for most of the content.

												If you have played a lot of MMO's before and are generally sick or burnt out on them and need something to grab you by the jibblies, TSW sadly isn't it. It's nothing new, there's nothing ground-breaking about it.  It has all the cookie-cutter attributes off all father MMO's, but less refined. The world atmosphere is okay, albeit generic and simplistic. The movement is wooden and rigid. Interacting with objects feels very cumbersome. The combat is not satisfying at all, there is no fluidity. There is terrible sound balancing issues and in general the sounds grate on the ears after 20 minutes. VA is pretty decent though. The mobs are incredibly generic and their placement comes across so intentional, that it diminishes the immersion factor. It's like every second all you can picture in the back of your mind is a developer tediously and randomly plomping down one generic entity after another. It does put a slight twist on the usual MMO quest formula, but about as much as the differwence between one FPS game to another. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it felt like a chore to play it for as little time as I did. 62/100 "

												First the positives; I thought the background had incredible promise. Um... I think that's it.You know, you can say a game shouldn't pander to the masses by making it too easy, so anyone who QQ's that this game is too hard can sod off. Well, that's the thing. Notwithstanding the fact that this game is all kinds of boring (unimpressive graphics, mind-numbingly boring combat, too much walking around), the quest items you have to find are too small making questing an innervating experience characterised by ""what the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to look for?"" Note I'm not complaining about the clues you have to find in investigations; its the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiny quest items you ""use"". Additionally, the fact that you'll probably have to use the in-game browser to find clues for investigations is immersion breaking. It got to the point where I was bored of questing and just used the in-game browser to spoil everything so I could speed the game along.And the gameworld? What kind of genius thought it would be awesome to have chapter 1 of the story set in the incredibly exciting and awe inspiring setting of... small town America, which looks strangely like the dullest parts of New England or Maine. Oh, how I indulged in the vivid hues of brown and gray, traversing down two lane roads on my way to a (wait for it) cake shop. So, packed with my spirit boosting memories of this town, I pushed forward into Savage Coast to find yet MORE ♥♥♥♥ING HUES OF BROWN AND GRAY. The designers really need to learn how to pace questing and environments - it gets incredibly dull after a handful of tens of hours, still waddling around the same place. WoW made sure that you saw something different just perfectly at the point when had enough of an area; TSW bludgeons you to death with tedium and does nothing in the way of variety.Seriously, what are the designers proposing in this exercise of tedium? What kind of players are still playing this and defending its game experience? Most probably a bunch of tragically clueless dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't buy.			"

I can only imagine when they were making the game (it was over schedule by years), play-test after play-test resulting in testers going out of their minds about how horrible the control is, and the devs ignoring them and saying ""you'll get used to the awfulness"". You just want to scream at the dorks responsible for putting this game together for ruining a great idea.PREVIOUS: WHY did I buy this game? This POS has the worst contols of any game I've played.

												If you have played a lot of MMO's before and are generally sick or burnt out on them and need something to grab you by the jibblies, TSW sadly isn't it. It's nothing new, there's nothing ground-breaking about it.  It has all the cookie-cutter attributes off all father MMO's, but less refined. The world atmosphere is okay, albeit generic and simplistic. The movement is wooden and rigid. Interacting with objects feels very cumbersome. The combat is not satisfying at all, there is no fluidity. There is terrible sound balancing issues and in general the sounds grate on the ears after 20 minutes. VA is pretty decent though. The mobs are incredibly generic and their placement comes across so intentional, that it diminishes the immersion factor. It's like every second all you can picture in the back of your mind is a developer tediously and randomly plomping down one generic entity after another. It does put a slight twist on the usual MMO quest formula, but about as much as the differwence between one FPS game to another. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it felt like a chore to play it for as little time as I did. 62/100 "

												I wanted to get back into the Secret World and after trying initially to patch to 1.9.1, it failed and got an error.  So I did a database repair, which took a fair bit of time and then it tried to patch again, onace again error..and actually close to finishing too.  Desperate at this point I deleted the entire game from my PC and started over, waited while it downloaded the entire game from scratch hoping there was a client that included all new patches, I was wrong, it STILL had to patch to 1.9.1.  Guss what happened next?  I got ANOTHER error only a few 100 megabytes from being finished.  I give up Funcom, I cannot in good conscience reccommend a game that causes such frustration and wastes so much of my time!!  But on the flip side I wanted to play it again because before thyis current problem I really enjoyed the game!  *Sigh*  Maybe one of your support people will read this and take pity and offer a solution!

												Old graphics on a 3 year old game.  If you decide to buy it, I recomend only get it when it's on sale.  This game,""the Secrete World"" isn't a secrete at all, unless you haven't bought the game. Surprisingly enough you hope for more than what it is.  Here's the breakdown of it:1. 3rd person shooter. 2. Zombies3 . 3 factions of play.Pros:Ultimate edition includes: free cat , outfit, 2 hats, and starter weaponsAll the previously released DLC'sCons:Graphics Rough UI tutorial Overall Rating:I would say 6/10.  It's not at the top of the list but, there are far worse games out there! To the DEVELOPERS,Please for the love of GAMING If you release new continent  UPDATE THE GRAPHICS ENGINE!  "

												I recommend the game but.....I dont understand what all the hype was about this game.Ive waited a few years to get it but was not impressed with it at all.Dont get me wrong, the game itself is ok.... just boring.By the time I had finished the first areas story line I had had enough.It is the same old grind.You find yourself skipping the cinematics because you just dont care.Character creation was bugged for me and I was unable to select any different eyes or facial details except eye color. ( solved this, graphics bug showing pointer higher than it actually was )This left me with a character I just had no real bond with........ ( character creation should be a great time for a new player ) ~even ingame with the plastic surgeon did exactly the same thing, you try to click on a different facial feature and the camera angle just turns or zooms..so frustrating.Skill table : Was just the same normal skills but made into a big pie chart, big deal. Again felt like no real path for your toon, just pick up any weapon and start to master it.Loot: Lack lustre, never got any good gear just bags of green vendor trash, no clothes items as rewards, nothing.If you want clothes, you have to buy them through the online shop ~ this was a big fail for me.You end up running a toon you didnt get to create at start up and then wearing the same look for 40+ hours. = boring.You need weapon craft tool kits to make new weapons, it took more than 20 hours of play to finaly get one by then I was over it.Combat: Boring, it is just a key mash, mash an attack, wait for it to build up 5 power then mash the power attack key, rinse , repeat. = boring.Mob AI is basic at best, I had no challenge whatso ever, at one point i just ran in a circle with my HoT on while spamming a sword AoE, everything died, even supposedly hard area bosses. It was a joke.Some monsters had telegraph AoE attacks you can jump out of but the lag and key mashing most of the time you just stand in it.Dungeons were dull, just the same random groups of mobs with a few bosses, no real challenge, just run the same one a bunch of time.Group dungeon finder is terrible. You have no idea what dungeon group to join because there is no item level guide to help. ( what dungeon drops what level of gear )Zone chat was dead, I came across 4 other people outside the starter area. Only time I really saw anyone was from dungeon finder or back in main hub where the auction was.Never saw any chat going at all in zones, asking questions was a waste of time, you are alone.This game should have been great.It was a nice idea but I can easily see why its not hugely popular.Even the graphics for character NPC faces looks bad, SWTOR which is an older game is way nicer.The music and dark scary areas are nice but the massive lack of excitement from character creation, loot , class skills just makes the game very boring.The game just never drew me in.I took sword and fist combo which allowed for heals and dps, making me almost unkillable.Game felt too easy and I was just waiting to see the next big role to play in the game, but it was ... go there, kill this, go there kill 10 more ( I thought we were over these types of quests? )30 hours game time max before the boredom starts to take over.Get it if you have nothing else to do.

												Does not work on 32 bit windows.Its a great game, by all means. But it was advertised as 32 bit compatible, and recently after launch a serious memory leak has been discovered. In December 2012 Funcom said they would fix the memory leak in a patch, its been two years now without any other contact from Funcom.Instead they ""encourage"" their customers to upgrade their computers to 64 bit (basically getting new computers with more hardware) instead of fixing the memory leak.That does not inspire confidence in Funcom as a company, you buy this at a great risk so dont bother paying full price.Its unplayable for a large portion of all players who first bought it.

												Played this game from soon after it started until mid way through the Tokyo expansion.  Loved the feel of the game and how you could be everything after you took the time to learn all the weapons and powers.  Sadly, after 2 1/2 to 3 years I burned out due to excessive grinding.  I've checked in from time to time and the game has continued to add fun stuff.   Will definitely be checking out Legends when it goes live.You really have to lol at least he butthurt crybabies handing out bad reviews like candy.  Try the game as it is now and see if you like it, but keep in mind Legends will have some differences, though (supposedly) the same kind of vibe.			"

It is píssing me off that funcom can't remove the characters which haven't been online for 3 years, and set the nicknames free again for those who actually want to play the game. you can't even use the most idiotic nicknames like ""bananafighter1234"". Some day you'll face everyone with ""awpfuq2ß3t69uzq"" as names, because nothing else is left. Really really bad regulation. Uninstalled because of that.			"

												TL;DR 50/50 Secret World tries something new in the MMo genre and I don't think it works too well. Its an MMo you're basically going to love it, or truely hate it.   My biggest problems with Secret World is that it tries something different from the traditional MMo genre and honestly, it just really doesn't work to well.   So many quests are downright stupid, the player has to constantly press (B) to open up the in-game web browser and actually search for hints and solutions to quests because most just don't offer you any information at all - so that browser becomes a huge crutch through-out the entire experience.   I found very few of the usual cookie cutter kill X amount of mobs, or typical fetch quests that most MMos have - The problem that secret world has, is trying something new other than the cookie cutter, and I think for most people - it doesn't make it fun.   Far too many quests which try to make the player actually think, or solve complex puzzles -  (one puzzle actually requires you to read the bible in RL ~ luckily the web browser can pretty much give you all the information you need to skip that) These issues basically create a massively steep learning curve thats exceptionally harsh without doing plenty of research first,  such as what build your doing to make - any DLC your going to buy into ~ how to craft, how to allocate your skill points.  Everything isn't very new player/newb friendly. I personally had graphical issues too, many quests especially stealth missions are so poor that most are trial and error, or again - look up that online guide how to do it.   The first few stealth missions, I died constantly due to near invisible laser tripwires - seems to be an issue with nvidia cards, also the game constantly crashes each time I exit the game. It seems the developer also has taken a nickel and diming approach to the so-called free to play method,  the item store is full of good stuff...of course if you want to pay for it,  the problem here are the issue packs which are essentially the expansions,  if you really want to invest time and effort into this game, then the ultimate edition is the only way to go unless you want to spend a small fortune later.  Also worth mentioning is if you buy the individual packs on steam, you only get the regular versions,  so if you actually wanted the cool items, costumes etc - that would cost you ""double"" the money.   Example, I purchased the Tokyo DLC and I originally assumed that would come with the school uniform, title and gadgets but no,  a 1620 point ($15) extra cost was needed on top of the $15 cost for the DLC, making the actual cost of the DLC $30 for one DLC...  Each issue has its own dedicated 'collectors edition' which has all the cool items and obviously a huge price tag to match.			"

You know how when you move the mouse, it moves your characters direction? Yeah, TSW doesn't do that. I tried for an hour an a half. I really did. But I don't think I'll ever come back to this game. As great as the reviews are, the controls are a game breaker. I've never played something so disorienting and backwards in regards to the controls. It's a bummer.

Attempted to log in through multiple accounts, finding that every single one was not connected to a Secret World account.Even my e-mail that had the receipt for the stupid game was no longer connected. No payment history of the subscription fees I paid. Now I have to go through customer support, show them that I bought the ♥♥♥♥ing game, etc. etc., if I want to play.Now that I've put this much time trying to play the game I own, I've completely lost interest.

												I loved it when it came out and was P2P, but like all F2P / B2P games it quickly turned to crap after the conversion. It used to have monthly content updates, but now they only come out every 6-8 months. Pass on it if you're a real M M O  g a mer, or get it if you are a mindless casual that likes wasting real money.			"

												Way to take a great game and Dumb it down to worthless.BTW I am in the closed Beta so YES I have seen the ""NEW"" game. The combat and the skill tree is far worse then the base game. They bowed to the whiners and in a last ditch attempt to save a failing company have put out a totaly worthless product.Just the fact that they Changed the name on the steam page so they could get all the favorable reviews of the original game shows you what kind of company your dealing with.

												When I heard about The Secret World coming out, I was pretty excited.  Finally an MMO where its modern day and you are thrust into a Lovecraftian style world with horrors abounding.  I was even more excited with I found out it was going free to play.  I happily coughed up some cash at some point when it was on sale and off I went.  While I have a big red thumbs down I want to list the pros to this game.  The story is fantastic, the puzzle elements are GREAT, the music is decent.  However, as I sat there and played this, I felt that it wasn't really good material for an MMO.  It felt more like a really good RPG than an MMO.  Furthermore, combat is kinda crap and your choices to wage war on the darkness are extremely limited.  Its sad to say but when the combat element of a game like this is unfufilling, coupled by the fact that enemies are everywhere swarming you, it just feels like a job.  And honestly as cool as some of the puzzles are, I'd rather there be more of those and less combat.			"

												I can't recommand this game to anyone. I know there are many positive reviews, but these people must be gettings something else out of the game. The first 2 areas of the game are poorly designed. There are many quest which are harder than the abilities you could acquire at that level. Unless you are one of the folks that like doing a quest dozens of times, eventually you just get tiered of repeating the same quest and getting no where. If I had not bought the game, I would have stopped playing it weeks ago. I'm at the point now that there is not enough fun in the game to justify continual playing.  Use my review as a warning save you money and buy a better game. You will thank me later and you mouse and keyboard will thank you since you are not beating them in rage.			"

												I don't get why people are going crazy about them keeping the reviews from TSW for Legends. Sure, it's a lot of changes, but it's intended to be more of a major overhaul, not a new game in itself (just a free to play ""re-launch"" of the existing game.) Sure, the changes may turn out bad, we don't know yet, but it's still the same game, just changed. You might as well say it's dishonest for ALL games to keep the same Steam listing and reviews when they're updated.			"

												Unfortunately no MMO has yet unproven that once you got tired of WoW it will be difficult to find any MMO enjoyable.The Secret World could have came close, since there are some things which are different enough (investigative quests and class builds), but unfortunately much of the content is still the same (go there, collect N of that, kill X of that, escort Y, etc.) and the combat is seriously repetitive, especially when you start off.The bigest problem though is the population. Very few players play this title.It might be your thing.It wasn't mine.			"

												If you like MMOs you should like TSW:UE. It is a little harder to solo after you reach certain levels in zones and has a slight learning curve for the slower learners. Graphics seem just fine to me for its age. You can level up by repeating quests which is nice because you can pick the ones to do over that you liked before. I am not sure if all are repeatable but most are. The story line for each faction is interesting as well. Who doesn't like the question or workings of secret societies? If the Ultimate Edition is on sale it is a no brainer to just pick this up to play alot or just occasionally for free. At full price I still think it is well worth the price. If there are any quirks in the game I don't usually worry about it unless it is a game breaker and I have not experienced any of those yet. I do have some videos of game play on my youtube with no sound or altered sound because of copyright music complaints so I am sorry about that. You can play your own music while watching. I say buy and enjoy whether you like MMOs or not since it has an interesting lore to it.			"

												For starters, it just didn't feel right. The second I started actually playing after all the cutscenes, I realized how awkward the controls were. Instead of the usual A and D strafe left and right, they turn you left and right, like how Doom originally was. You can rebind the keys, but it just makes things more awkward when you realize that you HAVE to use the turn function because thats the only way you can have your character face a differet direction, the mouse can turn the camera, but you have to hold down left click, and it doesn't move your character with it. Even though the controls sucked, I stayed to see how the combat was. I was dissapointed yet again. It turns out the combat is nothing like a shooter should be, like it was in the game Defiance. It was awkward also in how you have to press the number keys to shoot, instead of pointing and clicking with the mouse. I feel that this game would've been much better if it used more modern intuitive controls. I realize that this obviously wasnt supposed to be a shooter like Defiance was but I just find this type of cheapy MMO controls to be awkward, and unintuitive. I was expecting this to be like Defiance, but even cooler with different monster filled setting, but it was just a really awkward MMO that was nothing that I expected. I'm glad I got this when it was only 10 dollars, but I still want a refund. If your looking for a fun, actiony and quickpaced MMO, this doesn't seem to be it.			"

												I think if a male player character was forced to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from another man, as part of the player's intro to the game, and the male player's character saw it as sexy, then I wouldn't be offended. After all, that'd be fair play. Because in TSW, if you play a female Dragon, you get oral sex from another woman as part of your character intro. You don't have a choice. But don't worry, it's not♥♥♥♥♥♥ your character wants it. This is typical lesbian fetishism, which I find offensive. It trivializes female sexuality. If male characters had to have a homosexual experience, then things would be equal, but for guys, this is a ""no homo"" game. That's sexist, because over and over again in video games, women are trivialized. This is an extreme case.I've noticed that, on forums, fans try to defend what happens. They point out the one giving the oral is a kumiho. In addition, they proclaim, nothing's explicitly shown. But come on: an incubus or other creature could easily appear for the men. There's no reason for homosexuality to be mandatory for girls alone. The kumiho even has a mysterious, demonic dude with her. Considering popular past reactions to games, and other media, two men being sexual would make too many male gamers uncomfortable. Male gamers got offended with a bisexual man in ""Dragon Age: Origins"" hitting on them. You can imagine how these same guys' male characters getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from a male NPC, and making O faces in joy, as an intro to a game, would go over. It'd likely be hotter than ""Hot Coffee"" in the media, too. But woman on woman? Apparently that's seen as a perk for male players/sexy/easily ignorable, in comparison to man on man, and it doesn't get much attention. Meanwhile, people who protest are also often labeled as whiners, which is common for fans to do on anything. That brings up the next point the fans make: that nothing's shown. They try to say it's your own dirty mind assuming oral sex happens. When one person leads another to a bed, in a hotel, hovers over the person, moves his/her mouth seductively over the person lying on the bed, puts his/her head towards the person's crotch, goes on about giving, ""a moment of ecstasy,"" is a mythological creature all about sexual seduction, and your character makes an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic face -- that's not vague. That defense is like saying a box which says ""condoms"" might contain toothpaste, and you have a dirty mind for thinking otherwise.As for game-play? The idea of no levels is appealing, but it's moot. It supposedly goes off of skills instead of levels. Yet, the lack of levels isn't as imaginative as it sounds. The point with levels in tabletop RPGs is to gain experience to get better stats/skills. You get those stats/skills by leveling up, but levels are nothing more than exp markers, really.  So although you don't get a level number you can see in TSW, character levels aren't gone. Your gained experience points work the same as levels. They let you improve your skills and what stat-affecting gear you can equip. If you try to attack things which have more stat-power than you (aka are higher level), you'll lose. You won't do much damage and you'll take too much yourself. Essentially, this means that there IS a level system, but it's hidden. The only real difference is you don't see the exact level number on your character sheet.The skill tree looks like it allows for decent customization, but I wasn't terribly impressed with that. Most games allow for customization. And in most games, if you spread out your skill points too thin, then you're gonna have a bad time. So, TSW being classless isn't a big deal. Its point system is similar to many other games'. The skills available didn't look amazing, even when combined with others, but with the right tweaking you could probably find a play-style which would work for you.  Then there's the nauseating camera, which occasionally goes through the wall if you're in 3rd person-view. (There may be a way to lock it.)  Targeting was a little shaky but likely, once you get used to it, it'd be easy.The voice acting isn't great, either. The Dragon folks sound like they're straight out of a bad kung-fu movie. Unfortunately, the rest of the game's features, at least for the first couple of hours, lack enough awesome or corny to make this seem fun. It just seems lame.This means the real appeal would come story-side. That's why I originally wanted to get into it, too. However, the first two hours failed to compel me (I played 2, but I guess I went a little over since Steam's saying 3, and it's rounding up.) Instead, it bored me.  Before everything else, I was chasing butterflies, and my mute character listened to NPCs monologue boring dialogue. The script wasn't entertaining to follow. Since the game's story was pathetic right away, followed by it thinking it'd be oh-so-cool-and-kinky, I'm done with it. There are better games I'd to play, and the sexism was extremely off-putting.

												I bought this game during a recent Steam sale. I made a funcom account. Check.Funcom requested I link my Steam account to my funcom account. Check.I tried to log into the game and it wouldn't accept my password. I tried to request a change of password in case I messed up. Funcom's automated system can't even send a new password to my email address. The system CAN send an email telling me I should use the nickname tied to my email address. Useless. I really regret this purchase.			"

												This game is honestly terrible. To be able to play, you have to pay $7.49, ""Register"" (AKA leak your ♥♥♥♥ing address to Funcom), and then you finally get to play. Even when you play, the plot's terrible, Graphics are Meh, and God damn. Everything is just horrid. The plot, the Characters, the ""Massively Multiplayer"" experience is just ruined. I'm not returning to this game.			"

												First of all, ignore the hours played according to Steam. This game can be played while Steam is closed. I have played over 30 hours of The Secret World.That being said, I'm just not having much fun. Let me give some background and say that this is my first MMORPG. I have never played WOW or any other traditional MMORPG before. I have played many online, PVP and PVE games, but none of them were traditional MMORPGs. PROSThis game is beautiful and dark. The game world is experiencing a devastating apocalypse from the Lovecraft universe, with some of the coolest monsters and characters as I have seen in any game. The storyline is pretty average, but interesting. The side missions are really well thought out, original, and entertaining. The community is also extremely friendly, which is a huge plus.CONSDespite all of the good points, this game is just not very fun. First, the small points: though the story and side missions are nice, your character is a mute: literally. NPCs will straight out ask your character questions and you will just stare back at them. This quickly devolves a thrilling mysterious plot into a pathetic attempt at humor (but it's not even funny), when a character says something like ""how does that strike you"" and you numbly stare off into space followed by their response, ""I agree, it doesn't even deserve comment does it?"" They could even have just made your character gesture or something and it would make more sense!Also, getting around is a pain until you put in enough game time to save up a ton of money to buy the sprint upgrades. The fastest one being a long way into the game until you can buy it (somewhere around 50 hours).The worst offense though, is the combat. Granted, there are a variety of weapons that you can mix and match at will, however, regardless of whichever two you choose, you will be spamming the same moves over and over again to level your character. Your weapons and attacks seem almost completely ineffectual, slowly chipping away at enemy health. Even the weakest enemies (zombie hordes) will waste your time, because you still have to use your cooldown attacks (special attacks) to defeat them quickly. Any game worth a buck would allow you to kill the weakest enemies in only a couple hits.On top of the combat are the million and one stats that you have to juggle for each build. I have probably spent hours just moving attacks, passive abilities, and weapons around trying to find a combination that is more powerful or fun to play. However, they are all so well balanced (good I guess) that there is little change between build, and so I still spend hours grinding to complete missions. If you have played MMORPGs in the past, I'm sure you are familiar with DPS, Tank, and Healer, which, surprise, are the same three possible classes to create in this game. I know that there is a common jargon among MMORPGs with acronyms like ""DPS,"" but Secret World does the thing where they replace all the original, well-known, terms with new ones in an attempt at originality. So ""hate"" is actually ""aggro"" and ""afflicted"" is actually ""bleed."" Which is compounded by the fact that many of the community members, even those that write the wikis/guides for new players, use the old terms instead of the ones used in the game.All of this combines to create a repetitive process: you grind away at identical enemies for hours using the same attacks to receive some moderately better equipment and a level or two, to move on to a new area/mission that is more challenging, to then grind for hours until you receive moderately better equipment and another level or two, stopping every now and again to mess with your loadout for an hour and then repeat the whole process again. I realize that this all sounds like how MMORPGs work, but then would someone please explain to me what is fun about that? Doing the same attack for five hours on the same enemies cannot be defined as fun.			"

												DO NOT BUY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A 64-BIT OS.My system runs a 64-Bit, and I have little trouble. My wife, however, runs a 32-bit and crashes due to memory leaks less than every 10 minutes. While almost every game has memory leaks of some form, this one is very specific to 32-bit OS. Secret World loads massive amounts of memory at a time, more than the limitations of a 32-bit OS can handle.This is a known bug to Funcom, and while announcing that they will look into it, have done absolutely nil. This is a problem that has been present since beta testing. There is no know work-around. On the store page, they state a 64-bit OS is ""highly recommended"". They need to change that to ""required"" due to the memory management limitations of 32-bit OS.			"

												Pros The Unquie Story and Puzzles in an MMO  one the best thing about this game is the story and the puzzles that link you to real life events and puzzles that send you out on a hunt on the web. The story is supernartual and pulls from horror and many popluar folklore as wel as unpoplaur mysthicsCons, It's an MMO that should been fun but the combat and leveling system is the one that pulls it all the way to the crapper.you don't feel powerful as you keep leveling cuz the skills are equal to each other and based on weapons not acuall leveling. it's has a circle skill system with a pie of a circle for each thing and none of them feel any real differences when fighting monsters or humans players which is unforunate. The combat animations are off and you can't feel it impact the game .Overall if you can push through the boring combat it's a great story mmo "

												I personally found the game to be very different from the reviews I've seen of it.  Most of which describe the game as an adventure / puzzle sorta game.  In fact I would describe the game as ""creepy as hell"" and honestly did not enjoy it.  After spending the afternoon downloading it, and then playing it for most of the evening I wish I had not done so.  I'm not aware of Steam offering a ""money back guarantee"" which is a shame.In the spirit of fairness however the game play was fine, it was the content that i didn't like.  Those who are into the Resident Evil and Silent Hill type of games might enjoy this one just fine.			"

												The Secret World is an MMO for the masochist.During a quest, I was told to approach a black van and attempt to identify the people the van belonged to. In the back of the van, there was a laptop with a password prompt. The password's hint was 'my wife.' After some lengthy exploration, I was able to find two bodies not far from the van. They had ID cards, one was a man, and the other was a woman named Lucy. I returned to the van to type in her name, positive that I had the correct answer, and was met with an 'Incorrect Password' screen. I spent approximately 20 minutes running back and forth between the bodies 50 yards away and the van, inputing any combination of first name, last name, email addresses, and even the 15 digit number code on the ID. Nothing. I even realized at one point that they had different last names, so I tried Lucy's first name with the man's last name. Nothing.At long last, I had to Google the answer. In order to solve the puzzle, I was to:Go to the in-game web browser.Search the man's first name on The Secret World's site.Find a forum post by the man.Read that in the forum post he referred to his wife as Sally.Return to the laptop and type in Sally to complete the quest.While this is probably the most extreme of poorly designed quests, the game mimics these poor design aspects in nearly all of its facets. Very little information is ever given for any quest, enemies in the game are unfairly cruel, there is virtually no indication of enemy or regional level, and the puzzles are eldritch and backward.The final straw in playing this game was when I was oneshot by my companion 4 times in a row.I hope this review helps in your decision on The Secret World. Overall, it can be fun experience, just be aware that you need some level of masochism to enjoy it fully.			"

												This is probably one of the only games I've ever played where the developers managed to set perfect examples of both what to do -and- not to do in one game. Some of the design choices the developers made were absolutely phenomenal, and should set an example for future MMORPG's looking to add a unique twist to their quest design. The setting for the game was also very interesting. They successfully tied conspiracy theories, obscure mythology, and even lovecraftian elements into the game that made it a blast to explore and see what you were going to run into next. There was also a unique skill system in place, where leveling up did not particularly make you stronger. Instead, it gave you points you could use to purchase more skills or traits to use better equipment. One extra little tidbit worth noting is the fact that it has an in-game browser so you can look up different things in-game to help you solve puzzles or look up information, which really helps with the immersion when paired with the great quest design. Unfortunately, the game falls tragically short of what it could have been. To start, pacing in this game is extremely inconsistent, this is partly due to the odd skill system they implemented. There were times I would be progressing fine through the game, only to reach a main story mission or rank advancement mission that was nearly unbeatable. One would think to simply go and level up in this situation, but unfortunately that method does not translate very well into this game due to the odd skill and equipment system. Also note that these extremely difficult missions were not the unique stealth missions they implemented where the enemies are significantly harder forcing you to be stealthy, these were enemies I had to kill -alone- to progress in the story. Oh yes, there are solo instances as well. These solo instances are also some of the hardest missions in the game.       Overall I really want to like this game. Actually no, I really want to -love- this game. But unfortunately, due to the terrible pacing, senseless solo instances, and overall buggy nature of this game, the great quest design and setting cannot carry this game past its negative elements. I understand trying to be different and, ""shooting for the stars"" so to speak, but I feel the developers got too ambitious and ended up trying to make the game -too- different, which sacrificed solid game mechanics and ended up being a detriment. If it goes on sale and you really want to try it out or see an example of great quest design then go for it, but otherwise it isn't really worth the money assuming they don't fix the pacing and scaling issues that sometimes made it unplayable.

												Well, I played it four a couple hours now. I bought the Massive Edition. I can't get past the controls, The commands are all over the key board. I find it to be quite clunky. No team work at all, everyone one just ignores each other. Graphics are ok, But my god the camera gives me a headache. It would be better if you could move around with the left mouse button. WASD controls with the 1234 commands are all you will be doing. Zombies spawn out of no where, annoying. I hit T so switch to crosshairs, and its messes with the whole interface. The interface is choppy, I click on a button like 5-10 times before it registers. I can't say anything about the story line because I havent gotten very far. I dont think it's worth $30, Definetly not worth $60! I feel like they put some effort into the game, But the controls are a real let down for me.			"

												Generic MMORPG. It tries to be clever and different but ends up being clunky, awkward and uninspired. I don't hate it; it can be fun but often it's more of a grind. The final nail in the coffin to any would be buyer would be that this is an MMO yet most of the story missions are SOLO ONLY. So if you solo in MMOs anyway, this won't be a problem for you. For the other 95% of you that play MMOs you will need to bear this in mind before paying for it. It has a plethora of other issues too, like inconsistant aggro ranges, some mobs which are too hard to find and some mobs which are packed so tightly that you have to spend a ton of time fighting through them to do the many fetch quests, often fighting the same spawns more than once because the mobs respawn so quickly and are packed so tightly, so by the time you've killed something and are fighting the next mob, the previous one has just respawned. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's on sale. Luckily it doesn't have subscription fees anymore, so it's a pay once game, unless you want to pay for microtransactions, which I'm glad to say, aren't pay to win. All things considered: 5/10. Not horrendous but definately nothing to write home about. Far too generic and shoddily made for me.			"

												Can't recommend this garbage.It was on my radar since launch, but I kept holding back, not wanting to spend another monthly sub.  Once it went Free to Play, I had other games I was more interested in.  Had the chance to grab Ultimate Edition on Bundle Stars for 12 bucks and did so.  First sign of trouble - took a full - and I mean FULL - 24 hours to download the game.  Granted, it's 18 gigs but I get 5gig games down in 2-3 hours, so this was not a pleasant surprise.Played a little while, thought, well, it's ok, then the crashes started.  Drop into desktop for no reason and no error message.  The main transition hub where everyone passes through is a slideshow every time.  I was shocked at how un-optimized a game from 2012 is.  The final straw has been the sudden appearance of the infamous ""Loading Screen Freeze"" where a transition from one area to another leaves you staring at the loading screen, your HD spinning and the progress bar going nowhere.  You can leave it for 20 minutes that way and never get back into the game.  The only thing you can do is start task manager, kill the process and re-log.  Do that once every 30 minutes and you'll be to where I am, uninstalling and going to find something else that is going to work.  I'm sure it works for other people and my first 15 or so hours (after the 24 hour download) was enjoyable.  But the warts and problems soon were very apparent so I'm cutting my losses and dumping the game.			"

												DO NOT WANTBut seriously, this is the worst MMORPG I have ever touched, Do yourself a favor and shell out a little extra for a game like Guild Wars 2 or even WoW, this game feels like they didn't even try to polish the experience, The character customization is abysmal, the only noteable change is gender and shin color, and they try to coner up this oversight by letting you pick the color sweatshirt you want to wear. They decided it would also be super cool to give us a super janky web browser, even though both steam and oh, I dunno, OUR ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTERS already have web browsers! This game just tried too hard to pander to too many fandoms in a market the developers clearly know nothing about. They took an amazing concept with boundless potential, and♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. Please don't make the same mistake I did, do not purchase this.TL;DR.5/10 stars, and they only get that half a star because this game has Cuthulhu, or so I heard, I uninstalled this garbage before I could make any noteable progress.

												I don't usually review games with such little play time but I just can't play this game anymore than I already have. It just feels terrible for a B2P game. This wouldn't even be good for a F2P game. It's a tab target game with no auto-attack, what is up with that? I tried every weapon in the tutorial and I didn't like any of them. Maybe I'm just spoiled from all the fancy mmos I have played, but this combat is even worse than WoW. I see graphics glitches, poor performance, and this game still looks like garbage. The only positive I see to this game is the narrative. Maybe if this game had a different developer that actually cared about the game it would be good, but it doesn't even feel finished. I would think after 4 years this game would actually feel fun to play, but it just doesn't. I feel bad for not giving it a chance, but it's just not fun. If I by some chance manage to stomach the game a little further and my opinion changes I will update my review.			"

												Welcome to the atmospheric and beautifully written modern MMO! But first you must download it. 18 gig, no biggie. Then you need to patch the client. 35 meg. Easy. Right? WRONG! Top speed is 34kb/s so buckle up for a wild ride. You're all ready to play. But wait, first you need to patch the whole game! Yay for another couple of gigs at snail pace. Phew, that is over. Ready to kill some badass Lovecraftian themed monsters! But first, please create an account, which involved going to Funcom site. Good, I'm good to go! Urban legends and secret societies here I come! But no, first you need to connect your account to Steam, including their infamous security email, which sometimes doesn't get through. Now you can finally enjoy what little you have left of your evening off work. Ignore the awful UI, the completely pointless exposition videos about what secret societies are all about, and the most uninteresting character creation process I've seen in a video game. Let's rock and roll! Except you can't. Because you're stuck on a loading screen. Maybe the game is fun and atmospheric like the reviews say, but boy is it not worth the hassle. I might check it out later, but definitely not anytime soon.			"

												The most non-sensical mish-mash of randomness I've ever seen commited to code. The more you play the more confused you'll be. Nothing is explained, not even basic gameplay features like crafting. The world feels completely artificial, and its full of constantly copy and pasted mobs. Alot of quests require you to be solo, in a multiplayer game. Just everything bad bad bad 4/10 tops.			"

												Worst game I've ever purchased on Steam. I wasn't expecting a lot, maybe something interesting and new to pick up and get into or even just a whim purchase as I've heard so much about it however my 'whim' resulted in a wasted 25 bucks, it was absolutely mundane and quite frankly tiresome. It's a weird mixture and If you're intrigued I suggest you try to play it on a friends account (if they own the game obviously) or just be stupid enough to shell out the cash and witness the boredom.

												As someone with 0 MMORPG experience- this game is not fun at all. I like the concept but the controls are awful (especially in combat), the missions are tedious, and the interactions with other players are awkward and pointless. Seems like a work in progress. It was a great Steam Sale deal so I'm happy to support it's development. Improve character handling and give me something to do besides endless missions and I'll come back.			"

												I am very disappointed.I started to like the fabulous community, graphic, story, voice acting and ect. BUT after playing 30 hours and going a bit deeper through the story, i faced SOLO INSTANCES missions which were considerebly bothersome for me since i chose to be a full Healer (which is my only favourite class). Story short, the game will limit your playstyle to a more general one, as i've seen people are easily able to switch between full healer and tank unlike other MMOS (where they have to play ROLES, whitch are not switchable through the game)			"

												If you want to get oral sex in the very beginning of the game become a Dragon! You dont even have to wait or do anything to earn it! You just get  it straight away from some Korean hooker.Honestly, I find the dragon path a bit insulting of Asians. And its way more likely that females in the USA would suck you off before they know you at all. I think this is just someone wanting to live his/her fantasy through CG. Brings the value of the game down.*As soon as i started the game my character got oral sex and i didnt have any say in the matter, and it disconnected me from my character quite a bit, to the point im not even sure i will be playing her in the long run. Im aware theres sexual content in the game but i was not aware it would be done to or with my character and i had no choice in the matter, which is funny considering the context of the game being choice and free will and shaping your own character.I did make 3 characters, one in each faction, to experience each one and its storyline, and possibly chosoe one of the 3 to get deeply involved in. Though as far as I can tell, all of the factions are evil. There are no factions with good intentions to represent.I think thats important to know in the beginning of the game. And some characters are better than others. So far the illuminati has the highest number of lovable characters, for me. But I'm still not certain which faction i will stick with, if i continue to play this in the long run.The other two factions start off much better, which again is ironic considering the illuminati faction is meant to be the ones who desire power and control money etc so youd imagine them to be the more sleazy cult as well. But nah, its the dragons.And not only is this way out of context, its the exact opposite of actuality. The initial dialogue from the professor is very good but that girl opposes everything he says. But they make it seem as though it goes hand in hand. Sex does not make you more receptive to anything. Especially not on such a low level. It certainly doesnt bring you to enlightenment or make you more prophetic.You guys almost made me think youre intelligent, but then it just drops off the edge of the flat Earth.*From the very beginning youre left not knowing how to do what they ask of you, there are new concepts in this game, new names for things, and it would be most helpful if they explained the world youre in a bit more before asking you to use whats in it.I was lost in the training. Half of the instuction is dealt to you in quick fleeting boxes of text. Explain what we need to know, or let us opt out of it if youre concerned about people being bored from tutorials. Ive always used tutorials and ive been gaming for more than 25 years. I like to know the games im playing.And i really wish youd have told us how to Sprint in the very first moment we could contol our characters.*Also, youre going to have to deal with notifications being flashed briefly on the screen while someone is speaking or teaching you something so if you read that quickly and read/hear what theyre saying and process it all, youre good. Otherwise, youre going to be very frustrated.*The fighting so far feels a bit awkward to me, but ill give it time, wait until im more familiar with the gameplay.*Props for level design and dialogue, however. Both are top notch. This must be why the game has good reviews. I wish the rest of it matched this quality.And from what ive seen from before playing it monsters are designed very well, too. Ive been very much looking forward to encountering them.This is an early review, i will be playing this a bit more and will review it again to give it a chance to make good on some of the things i dont like about it currently. The beginning of the Dragon faction will never make good, however.More critiques since I wrote that stuff:I wish mannerisms were more specific to the characters. For example, Dame Beatrix of the Templars is communicating her concern for how one carries himself, is obviously concerned about being considered respectable, and yet shes cracking her neck and kicking the ground as idle moves. Not fitting at all and thus distances me from the realm. I would like to be immersed in it for the time im playing it, ya?Voice acting:Main characters seem to be well voiced, with interesting or fitting voices and good voice acting. All side characters, whether people on the street or bigger characters like NPCs in your factions, are not necessarily given fitting voices or believable voice acting.All the little things are missing in this.This particular review is a little messy i know, ill clean it up some other time.

												After only a few hours of gameplay I couldn't stand the terrible graphics and poor performance of The Secret World anymore. I bought it on an offer because I keep hearing people raving about how great the quest design, atmosphere, and character freedom is in this game. However, these things were not apparent to me in the first few hours of the game and the generally cheap feel of the product prevented me from sticking with it until it (maybe) would get better or more involved. If you're looking for something very different from all the other MMORPGs out there, then TSW seems to offer this, but beware, this game is very poorly optimised, runs like crap, and, quite frankly, looks like a game made in 2006.

												The progression and quest system is fairly confusing at first but once you get it its lots of fun. There this game is fairly old there is a lack of players but there are still enough around to keep you company.Edit: as a negative i have to say there are some seriously toxic and elitist people.

												I just love this game :) it has to be one of my all time favorite MMO's.This game is great for those who like a game with a fantastic story and don't mind having the pants scared off them once in a while.TSW is very casual friendly for those who only have  a few hours play time a week - which is me very often.There are often different events, new quests are added regularly and there are always new ways to work towards character advancement even without levels!There is an RP server with some nice RP communities around for those who are that way inclined. There are raids and dungeons for those who like the more hardcore side of things and these are challanging. In fact the game play over all is great for those who like a bit of a challange.			"

												Ignore the time spent playing as recorded by steam. I leave this game open and run it from the directory. This game is... well, it's pretty good really. It's not the most polished. It's not bug/glitch free. It doesn't have the best graphics, models, animations, or sound effects, yet despite all of that it has a very cohesive world and story line, and an deeply immersive experience.I've just hit nightmare dungeons, have most of my weapon skills maxed (only hammer to go) and ran my first scenario last night (we got our butts kicked). The thing is, this game is pretty much the only MMO entry in the sci-fi/fantasy/modern smashup RPG genre. Now that it is subscription free, you're only faced with the initial purchase cost - making the game much more pocket friendly.I was dubious at first, but honestly, I've already gotten my money's worth out of the game in terms of content experienced, time played, and enjoyment had.Are there things that could be better? Definitely. The dungeon queueing system has no automatic match making, and you can either queue for all dungeons of a skill level or one, not a specific combination. The head models are not the prettiest but they do the job and same for animations. The control system can be a little frustrating at times, but again, these are lesser concerns.			"

												Awesome! I was holding off purchasing this game because I couldn't test it out first and didn't know anyone who played it, but I'm SO glad I took the risk. I enjoy the difficulty of the puzzles (usually in the investigation missions), the amalgamation of various mythologies (Lovecraftian horror, secret societies, vampires, etc.), and the design of the character/class system. Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter/MMO/RPG/story-driven games.			"

												Best MMO I've played.Dialogue is fantastic, setting superb, not much hand-holding, gameplay great, music and art are grand... Really really worth getting.And it's by the same people and with a similar somewhat intellectual appeal as Longest Journey. References to literature and stuffs. Witty and downright hilariously smart commenting done by the voice-acted NPCs most of whom have an awesome personality to them (mostly speaking out of experience with Illuminati).			"

												This game is a real mixed bag. The writing and setting are all great, and tons of fun. The skill system is pretty unique and finding synergies between skills is really rewarding. It does have great puzzles, which range from interesting and difficult to ""how the hell am I supposed to know that, I should have looked up the solution ten minutes ago"". On the downside, it's not really intended for solo play - area difficulty spikes quickly, and most people seem to reccomend replaying the same low-level quests over and over again to get over the humps. If you screw up a build, there's no way to reset it. The dungeons heavily emphasize the ""trinity"" system, so if you're trying to PVE with a DPS build, you will be ignored in favor of healers and tanks. I would say give it a shot, especially if it's on sale. However, it may not be your cup of tea.			"

												First of all, it's an MMO. Like all MMOs, it is more drawn-out than single-player games. So, don't play unless you're OK with something thats going to take a long time to get through, and not really care about how quickly it gets there.That said, this game is better than most MMOs. There is a story, and it does evolve through a specific set of missions (slowly, and maybe a bit short on depth it forces on you). It doesn't require you to pay, but there are options that don't interfere with others if that's your thing. There are some opportunities to role-play, but you don't have to. The world has flavor. The power of your character comes from items, abilities simply provide a means to exprss that power. Grinding mobs won't help you very much, but missions will.I'm not a huge fan, but I can certainly play it with people, and it is actually quite good for an MMO.			"

												This is not the best game ever. It does not redefine the MMO genre. But I keep playing it. I keep wanting to see what will come next.The storylines are interesting, varied, and keep me wanting more. I love the writing for the quests, as well as the game as a whole. I could go into the core concept of not having levels for your character, but I feel like this is something that you should experience for yourself, as I will not be able to do it proper justice.If you like the MMO concept, and you like the horror genre, I would recommend getting this game. If nothing else, you can always come back to it, no matter how much time you spend away.			"

It has a HUGE player base and the game support is very active, and the content is massive and still growing. Granted it might be difficult for a lot of people coming from other MMORPGs to get into this game due to a character development system and menus which can be overwhelming at first, however players are very friendly and always willing to help and once you learn the basics you will find yourself matching skills from different areas of expertise in order to create that uber character taylored to your needs and playstyle, a level of customization unachievable in most RPG's out there.

												Great game with a lot of Lovecraft references. Progression system takes some getting used to, a little confusing at first, but when you work out it's all about synergy between skills it becomes a lot more rewarding. The depth of the storyline linking the main and side quests is immense, with fully voiced cutscenes for most quests. For those looking for an easy game, this might not be for you, the learning curve is pretty steep once you get past the first area, but is very rewarding when you work it out. I'd recommend deciding what role you want to play, then trying out one of the premade decks (weapon and skills combinations.			"

												If you like MMOs, this is a great game. You can tell that the developers have put in a lot of time and effort into the game and still are. Pros:1. Really great atmosphere - the little details they put into the game are really great. Areas can have odd visual effects, coloration, etc. Atmospheric music. 2. Lots of side quests - most are repeatable so you aren't stuck doing one quest line the whole time. The side quests can also be found everywhere! Explore the area and you will run into random quests you can get from NPCs or random objects laying on the ground. 3. Unique game structure allows for you to play anyway that you want. There are a variety of weapons which all have a variety of skills. You can have 2 weapons at a time (and a third auxillary weapon you can unlock during game play) and some of the skills can be mixed/matched between weapons meaning you don't have to be limited to the normal mmo roles. 4. Because of the structure of the skill trees, you can switch weapons any time you want. If you don't like the skills you were using, just swap them out. A lot of flexibility here. 5. So far, the community is extremely friendly and helpful. 6. If you are weird like me, some parts are actually creepy which makes it exciting. (The black house in Savage Coast for example had a nice creepy music to it.) Cons:1. The skill structure can be confusing because there are so many options. It can be hard to pick one way to play. 2. Can get a little tedious depending on your location/quests. Especially since, to level skills, you may have to farm for the points needed...especially if you change your weapon or decide to go a new route. Usually, this isn't too bad. 3. Can be laggy4. The fairgrounds have this effect that makes everything look hazy, which at first was really cool, but gave me a headache. 5. Sometimes you just want to finsih the quest but the mobs are so close together you have to keep stopping to fight. Pro and Con depending on your outlook:1. The game has no qualms about being offensive or using bad language, so if you are sensitive be prepared. Also, violence..but it is an MMO, you should already expect that. 2. The play area is large, but it is separated into individual maps that are all accessible from each other or one large connection point. This can either make the game feel tiny because you are in one map at a time, or huge because there is always a new place to get to and shows that there could still be possiblity for expansion. 3. Game has a built in browser to help solve puzzle quests (that rely on trivia.) 4. There is a main linear quest that tells you the story and helps give you a purpose and a role in it. So many mmo's, I end up mid-game going ""Wait..why am I fighting this guy?"" If you don't like cut scenes and don't care about the story, just hit escape and it'll skip it. You are, kinda, stuck going to the various locations in a specific order, but can always skip ahead if you want something harder.  "

												Best questing MMO out there.The Secret World unlike nearly every other MMO out their has it's core in the leveling, the game isn't a rush to end game. The questing isn't just kill blah or collect blah. The best way to describe it is that it is the Sherlock Holme's of MMO's. Tons of puzzle solving, a lot of mystery, and if you have a certain area IRL that your interested in wether it be art or music you will be able to use it in game to solve the puzzle's that it presents you with. They make use of the steam web browser in a new way with dedicated site's to certain group which you can use to help hack in to computers and so on. With all that said the combat is bad. It has a cool idea when it comes to dealing with combat but it is borring and no could say get the game because of the combat, to be honest you shouldn't buy this game for the combat. The combat works by having you chose between 9 weapons, equiping two, then using a talent weel unlock more abilities for that weapon with two different paths for each weapon. It isn't exactly borring but it is not something you seek after.The game runs ok at best, having played it with a few people there is many mixxed feelings. The most important thing i can note is that there is an issue were people feel carsick while playing it, i dont understand why but it does occour and you should be aware of that prior to purchase. It isn't really an MMORPG that your used to. The Secret World would be more similary compared to DND online, were there are people just never too many in one spot and most likely you will have just a group of 5.The end game isn't there, having not reached it my expirence is minimal but from talking to players who have reached end game i can say it isn't like other MMO's. You will not find some new expirence that if you didn't love the game prior to leveling will change your mind. The max level would be simmiliar to borderlands where all it means is you have max talents. Overall i would say this game has a lot of intersting machinacs and out of all MMO's currently released it does questing the best. Best to buy it in a bundle during a sale for you and a few friends. If you are combat focused avoid it, if you are someone who enjoys solving mysteries then this will be the best MMO for you.			"

												The Secret World is a very large MMO using a pay once, play forever model.  The additional content comes out somewhat sporadically but when it does its of high quality (side note: the new additional content is an extra charge).  The xp system goes out for years of play because its not a straight level progression -- every 40k XP you earn gives you another point that you can spend on skills or augments, skills can cost up to 50 points each and augment costs can go into the hundreds but that means there's always more to do.I highly recommend this game.  It's even better with a friend though.			"

												While the combat is nothing to write home about, the actual setting is what keeps me coming back. It also helps that all quests are introduced in fully voiced cutscenes, makes the npcs into actual characters and not just quest vending machines. The character progress is also interesting, making it very easy to switch builds if one isn't working for you.			"

The craft system is really nice once you get the hang of it.

												Great MMO that approaches questing and character progression in fresh, and effective ways. Modern horror setting is a welcome change of pace to fantasy mmos, and is backed up by a well written and voice acted story. Very much worth the one time purchase cost, as well as the issues of additional content. My only issues with the game is server lag, which is present, but not constant, as well as a disappointing selection of character customization items available through in-game currency. However, there are cool costumes you can unlock through deck building, which is a good way to motivate progression on different ability trees. A great game overall. One of my favorite MMOs of all time. Seriously underrated.			"

												Man, this game is fantastic, and I don't typically enjoy MMO's that often because I find it difficult to find people to play them with. TSW Doesn't force you into parties to complete quests, and the type of missions and stories are really interesting, though some sub-stories are sort of dull. I really love the investigation missions, too. It adds variety to the game, and the fact that they installed an in-game browser to help you research on the investigations is so cool. There are some negative aspects to the game, such as bugged missions, but can be easily solved. Also, some missions are a track and grab, and if there are a lot of people doing the same mission you'l; have to wait a while for the item to re-spawn in order to collect. I've only partied up a couple times, but if there were more people playing the game now, it would be much easier to do missions with others.9/10, beautiful game.			"

												Ignore the time spent playing as recorded by steam. I leave this game open and run it from the directory. This game is... well, it's pretty good really. It's not the most polished. It's not bug/glitch free. It doesn't have the best graphics, models, animations, or sound effects, yet despite all of that it has a very cohesive world and story line, and an deeply immersive experience.I've just hit nightmare dungeons, have most of my weapon skills maxed (only hammer to go) and ran my first scenario last night (we got our butts kicked). The thing is, this game is pretty much the only MMO entry in the sci-fi/fantasy/modern smashup RPG genre. Now that it is subscription free, you're only faced with the initial purchase cost - making the game much more pocket friendly.I was dubious at first, but honestly, I've already gotten my money's worth out of the game in terms of content experienced, time played, and enjoyment had.Are there things that could be better? Definitely. The dungeon queueing system has no automatic match making, and you can either queue for all dungeons of a skill level or one, not a specific combination. The head models are not the prettiest but they do the job and same for animations. The control system can be a little frustrating at times, but again, these are lesser concerns.			"

												Great game with a lot of Lovecraft references. Progression system takes some getting used to, a little confusing at first, but when you work out it's all about synergy between skills it becomes a lot more rewarding. The depth of the storyline linking the main and side quests is immense, with fully voiced cutscenes for most quests. For those looking for an easy game, this might not be for you, the learning curve is pretty steep once you get past the first area, but is very rewarding when you work it out. I'd recommend deciding what role you want to play, then trying out one of the premade decks (weapon and skills combinations.			"

												Despite being from Funcom, Secret World is a surprisingly great MMO. Unlike The Old Republic, TSW lives up to the promise of story centric MMO. In it, you are a member of one of three factions (Templars, Illuminati, or The Dragon) dealing with lovecraftian monstrosities as well as coming across well known conspiracy theories.  Another highpoint has to do with the missions, specifically the investigations. These often involve puzzle solving and can have you utilize internet to figure out how the clues relate to said investigation.Funcom did a phenomenal job with fleshing out the setting that hunting down all the additional lore pickups as well as exhausting all conversation options never seems like a chore.  The biggest surprise is the overall polish to the game, an example being the quality voice acting. Best part of all, there's no subscription requirement.			"

												So First let me say this game like all mmorpgs....is addictive. It's interesting how techincally there ""aren't levels"". But the fact of the matter is there are levels. If you've been playing the game for a while you will obvious be stronger then those that just start. Now there are also several different types of quests in this game. (Dungeons do exist) But we should focus on are the ""investigative quests"". They are a pain. You will actually need to investigate and I mean look on the wikipedia, go on certain websites, even read music, and bible verses. But the accomplishment you feel almost makes it feel worthwhile when you complete it....almost. The controls are pretty easy even though you kind of have to figure out some of them on your own. Like how changing from battle stance to running is x. Or how t changes the style of movement. But other then that this games a lot of fun! A pain at times. But fun :D			"

												Did you enjoy mysteries ? Conspiracies ? The occult and all manner of unknown things ? Then you'll love this game.The Secret World (TSW) starts the player off in one of three factions - Illuminati, Templars and Dragon. Although the three factions are enemies, you'll find that you will all unite against the monsters within the game world - in fact, the only time the factions are relevant is in PvP.The storylines and characters are very well developed, and the puzzles in the game will require some thought, if not frequent trips to Google.There are plenty of in jokes for horror genre fans, but with plenty of humour. It is worth noting that the game is squarely aimed at mature audiences.A community is what makes/breaks a game, and you will find that most players will assist you with quests and puzzlesA quick word on the soundtrack - I normally turn the music off on all games, TSW has such a good sound track, I'm listening to it a week later.A well recommended game.

												Bar none one of the best pay2play MMO games ever.  The setting and how the story is blended with the quests is remarkable.  If someone were to see me playing the game they could easily mistake The Secret World for being a highly polished single-player experience.   Many times i replay quests for the sheer fun of playing through them.  The quests are almost always unique and the quest givers are always a treat (Sam Krieg and Nassir are just two of many favorites).That said TSW is not without its issues.  The main one for me is the sheer install size of the game.  Its massive so it compllicates things for someone with limited hard drive space.  The second gripe I have is the performance and loading times.  That isn't as much a mark against the game as such it's just a heads up that an SSD and a relatively beefy PC rig would be helpful in getting to the game faster.  Believe me, when I get to fiending for TSW a 40 gig download with 1+ minute load screens feels like eternity.  Again, I have a poor PC setup so your mileage will vary if you have a computer from this decade.All in all, my decision to skip TSW when it first released with its monthly fee setup was a huge mistake on my part.  I would have gladly paid $15 per month for this game.   If you can get the game on sale, wonderful.  If not, dont make the mistake I did and take a pass on the game for ""another time.""   Its worth it.			"

												Kind of reminds me of Vampire The Masquerade a bit, it terms of atmosphere. Better modern day graphics though.Good:When you're following clues, solving puzzles, trying to work out how to grab a security camera from a roof you can't get up onto, delving into the story.Bad:fighting zombies. and more zombies. or fighting anything really. Combat feels really clunky. If you're buying this game because you like MMO combat and raids etc.. erm.. not sure. I see people rushing around, shooting things with dual weapons, not really reading clues or listening to conversations. It feels like they're playing a different game to me. This is more roleplay, reading, puzzle solving imo. Anyway.If you can get used to the controls, the bazillion windows for stuff, the way combat works, its worth getting and playing. If you want a game you can just jump into with your friends and go off on missions killing stuff, get Left4Dead or something.			"

												Having played pretty much all the popular subscription MMO's and F2P MMO's on the market over the years I watched the release of TSW with much interest as the premise of it's modern day setting and 'classless' levelling system seemed to offer a welcome change from orcs and set-in-stone tank/dps/heal building. It received a mediocre response at release but as I have only recently starting playing I can only judge the game on it's current stateI picked this game up in a steam sale over Christmas (paid £8 i think) so as far as value for money goes I can't complain as for a buy once play forever game that's pretty good value (there is a cash shop but after 106hrs of play I have had no need or inclination to use it - no p2p here)When I first started playing I naturally settled into my usual MMO play style as I expected this to be much the same - how wrong I was. Once the you get over the initially steep/different learning curve I realised that the usual MMO rules didn't quite apply. The combat, though hotkey based, has a fluidity to it that requires you to keep on your toes. You can dodge attacks and simply by keeping on the move throughout combat will mitigate damage. The skill and ability system is wonderful and once you start unlocking more and more abilities you will spend hours 'tweaking' that killer DPS/survival build or tank/healer. The variety of avaiable skills and powers means that you can refresh your playstyle at the drop of a hat so I never feel stuck in a playstyle and this flexibility keeps combat fresh.There are five different quest types: story, group, main, investigation, and sub-quest. There is no need to 'hoover' up quests in a quest hub the way you would in Wow, just pick one quest and if you follow it to its conclusion (quests are multi tiered) this will lead you to another quest anyway so it flows really wellThe story and mission cut scenes are all voice acted and I personally prefer them to SWTOR. The only criticism is that they are not group friendly.The locations are wonderfully represented. The starting area is a real treat for Stephen King/H P Lovecraft fans and there is a genuinely spooky atmosphere to many of the quests in this zone. The graphics are good. Characters and loactions are well done and the ambience (in part to good music and lighting) is pleasing throughout.The dificulty spikes rather badly in the third area of the first zone and I felt a bit defeated at first but once I had masterd tinkering with builds i was able to sail through (the right build is very important to success in this game)So far I have not felt bogged down in an area and thanks to the combat and varied abilities i have yet to feel like I am grinding.For a MMO the game is catered well (maybe to well?) to solo play but chat is very active and no one seems to have any major problems with finding a group (which is all done in chat and the game has a lot to learn from the likes of wow and gw about group finding)I have not played pvp so cannot comment on that.Overall I am really enjoying this game. It is a welcome break from orcs and elves and the freedom of class building is almost a mini game in itself (a good one i might add). As long as you enter the game on its own terms (and not on the terms of any other mmo) and follow the natural flow of the game it will hopefully suck you in the way it has done for me and many others.This is a AAA title worthy of your time and money and I wholeheartedly recommend you try it out "

												I like the premise of The Secret World. The story is pretty much the strong point of this game. The gameplay is typical MMORPG but I found that I can't solo the game after a while, which puts me off it as I don't have other friends playing it. And with dwindling player base the world feels rather empty, even in the city. If they make the game story completeable solo, I would play it again. Pretty graphic but the skills/abilities /magic could be more varied visually.			"

												This is great.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the X-Files and perhaps wants a break from their usual MMO.  The community as far as I have seen so far is helpful, although not huge.  It feels rather more like a single player game a lot of the time.  The combat controls are a bit like KOTOR and the game areas a suitably big so that you can get lost in them nicely.  The use of the in game web browser to help you solve investigation-type missions is a really great idea, but it seems to load very slowly, and I found myself just alt-tabbing and googling (not wiki cheats just the clues!).  The puzzles are really excellent and require some genuine thought to solve, and the fighting missions are challenging.			"

												It's the most niche MMO I've ever played. If you love adventure games, horror and intricate plots then get this. It's fairly expensive and it does require a monthly fee and a beefy rig to run it (This game on DX11 is arguably one of the prettiest games out there). The combat and PVP are not that good but the plot and atmosphere compensate it.One warning though, it does require a lot of logic, knowledge of everything related to horror, knowledge of history, the fricking bible, art, even music notes are used in one quest. I have to admit that while some of the quests are pretty hard and even though you might get stumped... at least the game comes with a browser to search for clues (The developers even created websites for some of the quests) or to google the answer if you are really stuck.

All the gear you could or would use has it's efficiency or even whether you can use it or not by how many points you put towards that specific type of gear. Abilities?

												I swear I honestly do love this game, I used to play World of Warcraft a ton but the combat doesnt compare to this but this game is amazingly fun it just gives so much to do and everything about it is rich, even the graphics, so many nice people aswell, I haven't experienced too much negativity and the dungeon finder isnt all that bad either, there are no levels in the game or classes but thats a huge aspect that shines about the game, it makes gear more worth it to work for, they do have skills but thats about 20% of your overall damage and your gear is more like 80%, armor doesnt do anything, clothes are just cosmetic but I like that aspect, yes there is an item store but its all cosmetic, you can invite people for bonus' that you can get from the item shop with veteran coins. You can get some really nice items but you need to skill points to use it to even use this amazing item which is a nice balance and its like that for all items. This game is amazing, get the 72 hour trial cause its not for everyone but if you like it after awhile in then pick it up, GREAT GAME!			"

												Let me say first I stopped playing MMO's a long time ago. The grind, the endless studying (mobs, dungeons, equipment, skills, etc.) and lack of entertainment were major factors. This game (from what little I've played) does not feel like a traditional MMO. The story is fairly well written, voice acting for almost every character (not Player Character), visuals, and a skill system that is fairly forgiving. Combat and controls are iffy at times but nothing horrible. Definately worth a look especially with no monthly charge. (Will ammend after extended play time.)			"

												You're thinking ""Another momurpugur? WoW already finished that genre"", but you are so wrong. It's not actually a momurpugur at all, it's a MMO-Point and Click-Adventure game (MMOPaCAG). Mopackagee. The main draw isn't to level up since there aren't classes and everyone can max every skill at once eventually, but the sweet quests, dialogue, voice acting and lore. My absolute favorites are the Investigation quests where you often have to consult blogs and websites on the internet for clues and information that you need to progress. And these things are HARD, like 90s adventure game hard. We're talking comparing ISBN-13 numbers on a person's favorite books to figure out his key code hard.If you're into self-flagellation via meticulous clue scouring and crazy connections, this is your game. Also if you're into urban myths, ancient horrors, Lovecraft, Poe, conspiracy theories, folklore, and dialogue so riddled with unexplained references to such things that it'd require a dictionary for the uninitiated.

												This game will forever stick out as one of my most favorite MMORPGs. It has the one of the most immersive story and environment that I have seen in an MMORPG. Everything is very hand crafted from the stories involved and each quest that you do. The voice acting is done on every single thing amazingly, sparing no loss of quality across the board. One of the things I especially like in this game is the quest system which doesn't use the typical go to x and or kill x. There are many different types of quest that are very intricate some of which will require you to really think outside the box and solve puzzles. Others rely on your stealth and the rest requires a good skill set. Of which, the skill system in this game is extremely fluid and offers a true multi-class system like never before. This game is especially fun when played with a friend.			"

												Honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time.  No restrictions to 1 class, freedom to mix and match as you wish since theres no actual character level but theres skill levels for talisman and weapons.  This game could be confusing at first but once you understand it, its a feeling of satisfaction cause I can tell you now, this isn't your normal MMORPG.  If you're not up for a challenge then i doubt this games for you but if you're ready for a different experience then The Secret World is what you been looking for.  On a side note, TSW has a Pretty helpful community thats very Noob Friendly.  Questions in general chat will ususally get helpful answers from TSW vets.  Good luck out there and have fun.			"

Fortunately, I still get by in combat using the shotgun and running around like mad. Starting a new character will feel a little overwhelming when you see the UI and all the things to do.Pro: If you are in any way familiar or a fan of Lovecraft, the setting and quests will suck you in and the time will fly.

												Some of the most compelling storytelling I've seen in an MMO. The lore is expansive, intriguing, and draws on a mix of real-world mythology and horror fiction to create an intricate tale of global domination and salvation. Aside from that, the class-less skill system is completely unique, if a little overwhelming for newcomers. It takes some getting used to, but the endless possibilities for developing a playstyle make this game incredibly enjoyable. It's a shame it's not more heavily marketed, because I feel there's a growing number of gamers that have become disillusioned with other MMOs, and this game is a breath of fresh air for those folks.

												Having played pretty much all the popular subscription MMO's and F2P MMO's on the market over the years I watched the release of TSW with much interest as the premise of it's modern day setting and 'classless' levelling system seemed to offer a welcome change from orcs and set-in-stone tank/dps/heal building. It received a mediocre response at release but as I have only recently starting playing I can only judge the game on it's current stateI picked this game up in a steam sale over Christmas (paid £8 i think) so as far as value for money goes I can't complain as for a buy once play forever game that's pretty good value (there is a cash shop but after 106hrs of play I have had no need or inclination to use it - no p2p here)When I first started playing I naturally settled into my usual MMO play style as I expected this to be much the same - how wrong I was. Once the you get over the initially steep/different learning curve I realised that the usual MMO rules didn't quite apply. The combat, though hotkey based, has a fluidity to it that requires you to keep on your toes. You can dodge attacks and simply by keeping on the move throughout combat will mitigate damage. The skill and ability system is wonderful and once you start unlocking more and more abilities you will spend hours 'tweaking' that killer DPS/survival build or tank/healer. The variety of avaiable skills and powers means that you can refresh your playstyle at the drop of a hat so I never feel stuck in a playstyle and this flexibility keeps combat fresh.There are five different quest types: story, group, main, investigation, and sub-quest. There is no need to 'hoover' up quests in a quest hub the way you would in Wow, just pick one quest and if you follow it to its conclusion (quests are multi tiered) this will lead you to another quest anyway so it flows really wellThe story and mission cut scenes are all voice acted and I personally prefer them to SWTOR. The only criticism is that they are not group friendly.The locations are wonderfully represented. The starting area is a real treat for Stephen King/H P Lovecraft fans and there is a genuinely spooky atmosphere to many of the quests in this zone. The graphics are good. Characters and loactions are well done and the ambience (in part to good music and lighting) is pleasing throughout.The dificulty spikes rather badly in the third area of the first zone and I felt a bit defeated at first but once I had masterd tinkering with builds i was able to sail through (the right build is very important to success in this game)So far I have not felt bogged down in an area and thanks to the combat and varied abilities i have yet to feel like I am grinding.For a MMO the game is catered well (maybe to well?) to solo play but chat is very active and no one seems to have any major problems with finding a group (which is all done in chat and the game has a lot to learn from the likes of wow and gw about group finding)I have not played pvp so cannot comment on that.Overall I am really enjoying this game. It is a welcome break from orcs and elves and the freedom of class building is almost a mini game in itself (a good one i might add). As long as you enter the game on its own terms (and not on the terms of any other mmo) and follow the natural flow of the game it will hopefully suck you in the way it has done for me and many others.This is a AAA title worthy of your time and money and I wholeheartedly recommend you try it out "

												Pretty cool take on the MMO scene. Mixes elements of horror(especially if you solo or two man) with movement based combat as well as puzzle solving. Some of the missions require the use of an in game internet browser that runs pretty well in game. Also, there is a non standard approach to builds and armour that is very unique. Allowing You to gear up the way you want to while looking like a fashion model. Fans of World of Darkness may enjoy this title. It's pretty fun with lengthy quests. Hit me up on Leviathan.			"

												Well first I'll start with something positive. If you have an issue in The Secret World the GM/Support system is pretty responsive and very helpful and the GM's are very kind and helpful even if your issue is a bit weird. That being said I will say I love the story behind the game but i find some parts of the game difficult and a bit frustrating especially if you cant find parties to do quests or dungeons with. They have a que system for dungeons where you wait until the party needed to do the dungeon is assembled and then you start however that can take hours and hours sometimes never happening in the short time I have to play.  So perhaps TSW should have an option to do dungeons solo with less loot? mobs? I find some mobs way over powered in the areas they are in and way too dense.It seems when you start to fight one many more are drawn to you in the process and you die allot...almost always. I think they need to space the mobs out a bit or make it possible skill wise to pull mobs from the herd  without attracting 10 of them.Quest are hard most all of them and yes TSW says they are hard when you select them but they are solo most of them and a bit too hard for solo. Weapon degregation is a bit crazy and really penalizes you every time you die your gear takes a huge hit down to eventually 20% which means your useless. You have to stop playing and find a vendor to repair at.I wish the pvp were more intuaive it's not easy to figure out how it works unless your read through wads of info.There's lots of information in the game but sometimes too much is not a good thing either. Puzzles are fun and some are real hard to figure out which is great for puzzle lovers. Movement is a bit goofy I feel like I'm crawling during combat the mobs just keep hitting you with movement impair until you almost stand still with all to do but die. I think that needs some tweaking. I think pots have too long of a cooldown and health potions don't do enough that needs work as well.The lore is awesome but there again you better like reading volumes and volumes of stuff  lol. For us old guys I recommend making the Lore dialog larger in the options so you can see the really small type.Combat actions are not real great in TSW  IMO, hard to control character movement while trying to activate the key combos for your attack at the same time it's like you ahould have 3-4 arms instead of 2. I don't know and haven't tried a gamepad yet to see it it might be better for combat.  I think its a great idea that TSW went subsription free though.All in all TSW can be fun but easily gets to the point of frustration for me anyhow which makes me go log into something else for awhile. It is worth the money though.			"

												After putting a fair amount of time into this game, I think I might be able to show others a fair picture of what to expect when you buy. As a preface, I am not really what you would call an ""MMO person"", in that I have only really played 2 in my life (SWTOR, this) so it might be that my insight into that particular field is lacking. That being said, here you go.1) While I have seen many say that the dialogue or cutscenes were/was ""cheesy"" or ""forced"", I couldn't disagree more. The story is a big part of why I play, and while certainly there are some moments of stupid humour or other such nonsense, I really got into the stories that were presented to me. The thing is, you HAVE to dig for the secrets (hence, The Secret World). Being the game that it is, it is an absolute must. It will not be presented to you in the main story like most games. You'll get the gist, sure, but it just doesn't feel complete. Finding the pieces of Lore and doing side missions are paramount to your understanding and involvement with the in-game world. Here's the kicker: you will most likely WANT to do all of the above. If the description of the game got you interested, I don't have much doubt that you would enjoy digging up info and solving mysteries WHILE killing lovecraftian monstrosities. It really is satisfying.2) I have to admit, I was frustrated with the character custimization for a bit. I am very much used to D&D ""class dictates everything"" rules, so having a game where you can, at any time, completely switch all of your abilities on the fly REALLY threw me. I like having restraints. Telling a noob like myself to just ""have at it, champ!"" without much help or guidance besides ""just pick whatever two weapons you like and go with it"" was annoying. However, I shortly got over it and began to appreciate the ever-flexible nature of the editor (though I rarely change much) and saw, in other players, the potential of it. You can use any combination of passive/active abilities from ANY weapon tree, which is just great. It feels like something you grow into, I guess. In SWTOR, I was straight DPS (I'm ALWAYS straight DPS), and the classes are pretty restrictive. Now you're telling me I can DPS during a wave of enemies in a lair, then SWITCH TO A HEAL BUILD BY PUSHING A BUTTON, and protect my group? Dude. Prayers answered. 3) I knew there would be ""Kill waves of enemies"" side missions. That is a given for every RPG ever (almost). So, when I discovered the stealth missions (which some are actually very hard), I was delighted. Finally, something to break the monotony of killing! Oh what fun I had, dodging camera drones and guards, sticking to the shadows like an alley-cat with a mouse in pouncing range!It was then, that I discovered what made this game for me. THE INVESTIGATION SIDE MISSIONS WOWI realize these won't be for everyone, but THIS is where the ARG aspect of the game really comes into play. You will find yourself doing things like digging through websites, trying to find a scrap of info that could lead you figuring out a password, looking on amazon for an ISBN number to the hardcover edition of a book that you've never heard of, all the way to breaking ciphers (I play The Black Watchmen, so I have some basic code-breaking knowledge), deciphering transmissions in morse code, and so much more.The holy grail is a mission entitled ""Immersion"". It has you play a series of freaking text-adventure games, where the ending of each clues you in to the location of the next game in the mission which is hidden in a completely different in-game region. ""What's so cool about text adventures?"", you might ask. WELL I'LL TELL YOU.While these are just short story TA's, they require a very good amount of trial and error unless you can somewhow guess the correct input (at one point, you literally have to type ""use bees"" I mean WTF), you are dead, just like the old days! It is called ""Immersion"" for a reason. You will be balls-deep in a game-within-a-game, trying to find where the two intersect. It really is a blast, unless you just hate fun. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I realize this is a long review, and I'm sorry for any typos in it. If you need me to elaborate on any points, feel free to let me know. TL;DR If you like ARG's, lore-heavy MMO's, or just solving puzzles, give this game a try. No subscription required!			"

												LOVE the lore (Especially the New England references) that alludes to some of my absolute favorite authors. The character advancement mechanics are not the norm of most MMOs, and I honestly feel that many more games could learn from TSW.The Base Edition gets you pretty far. I still haven't bought any story edition addons and have tons of progress to make. If there's ever a free weekend or something in the near future, some players may feel overwhelmed, but the playerbase is actually really amazing and helpful, as well as anything you have questions about can be researched with a native in-game browser (not just the steam overlay) which also functions as a tool utilized for in-game missions. Nobody should ever miss the chance to try this game if they're able, and I encourage anyone who can relate to this review to buy the game.			"

												Just started playing TSW, bought it in the sale (10,19 euro).Pro:+ Refreshing environment (not another fantasy world, like we've seen many times before)+ No predefined classes, so play how you want+ Nice sounds/sound effects+ (For now) nice story, good voice acting. Weird story though.+ No subscription needed!Con:- The charactermodels look terrible- A ""hard"" quest really doesn't seem so hard. At least for now (didn't play very much yet)- Assigning Ability Points not so trivial- Aggro range of some mobs is way out of proportion (so prepare to use the X key)After playing WoW, Rift, GW2, AION and the like, I needed something different. TSW is different. In a good way. But it takes getting used to. Where the others are just like a new glove made of a different fabric, TSW is more like a hand augmentation.			"

												The Thinking Man's MMO. Picked it up in the Xmas 2013 sales and have been enjoying it ever since. Whilst there's still plenty of 'go there, kill that' type quests the investigation, and to a lesser degree, story missions provide a welcome change of pace from the usual MMO fare. A word of advice before diving in - take the time to read up about the levelling and combat systems. They're not complicated as such, but it's very easy to waste skill/action points early on if you haven't grasped (as I didn't) how cleverly the various trees complement each other and where the key synergies lie.Overall, I expect TSW to keep me busy until Wildstar comes along next year and maybe beyond, the hour I spent using the in-game browser translating latin clues into a runic alphabet was one of my best gaming moments of 2013, even if it wasn't the most action packed...

												As a junkie for conspiracy theory and urban fantasy, I've been waiting for this MMO a long time. The initial release was buggy, but after almost 2 years in operation, the game runs just fine. There is plenty of depth here, and PvP is lucrative, encouraging players developing characters to get into PvP early. There are two downsides here. First, the game requires some significant hardware to run properly, and second, the server propulations are currently low. In spite of the imperfections, I've been very happy with the current version of the game, and I plan on continuing to focus on playing this game. I recommend the game for those interested in the themes it covers, and also for those who love MMORPG's in general.			"

The main story lines that you take part in throughout the games series of different areas are all very engaging and genuinely entertaining and enjoyable to play and discover more about. It also has an amazing atmosphere in some areas, especially the darker ones, along with the choice to seek out Lore in order to learn more about the zone you are roaming or its inhabitants.

												The atmosphere, sound effects, music and the numerous cutscenes in this game combine to make it a fantastically immersive experience for me.  I love the fact that I can explore and complete missions in a vast landscape without having to rely on other players constantly to get through things.  Some missions even require the player to research outside the immediate game for clues and it has its own built in web browser with which to do that.  The npc dialog is engaging and there are many different types of npc characters,  none of which sound like they are reading from a script when they speak. I value that a lot, since badly acted dialog can yank me right out of that immersive feeling when I'm playing a game.Players can choose from one of three factions when they create their character, all of which are human. It is sort of refreshing not to be innundated with choices of elves and dwarves and other mythical creatures as a ""hero.""   Each faction starts the game in a different area, before moving on to to investigate the goings on in Kingsmouth, a fictitious New England town.Overall, the atmosphere coupled with the necessity to use both brain and brawn to get through the missions makes for a great game and its well worth the price I paid for this MMO.

												I really recommend this game if you like to slowly build a character.  Everything you know about the MMO world sort of gets tipped upside down with this one.  You don't need to look up builds on the internet, they have what they call Decks, which are builds that you can build towards that give you certain skills and even an outfit.  There is always something to build towards though, as you can just stay in the starter area and farm up points and can actually get every skill in the game.I like it as a game to just hang out in.  It is a great game to get friends into and work together with them towards the quests, which start off as ""Hard"" ranked.The no levels, freedom style is very nice, but makes it hard to know if you are going to get your butt handed to you or totally slaughter a mob.  Speaking of which, mobs come in two flavors, groups or singles.  Groups do less damage, but there are more individual mobs.  Singles are stronger hitters but there are only one of them.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it's a combat style that encourages you to be moving at all times, which can be hard sometimes to be moving, and using your abilities to take the mobs down, when there are mobs all around you.  It does not work to try to just run through a lot of mobs between quests, which you pick up and complete pretty much on a one at a time basis.  I like the game, but it can be a little frustrating to get into if you are used to other MMOs like WoW or Guild Wars 2, or their like.			"

												I was pretty excited about this game but I'm a little disappointed at the lack of UI scaling options.  Quite painful at 4k and even not ideal at other resolutions.  If they added support for UI scaling/movement then I'd probably consider playing it again.It is still very original gameplay with a great plot/setting.  It's darker and more mature then other online games which is refreshing.  The quests were also much more interesting the the typical MMO ""FedEx"" quests.  I also enjoy the fast paced combat.Just bummed about the UI as I feel it's something that every MMORPG should have nailed down.			"

												Really want to play this game, however, this game does not work correctly on my rig with Windows 10 Professional. The Patcher application fails with a fatal error. Now, I don't blame Funcom for this as the specifications do not mention Windows 10 and they recommend Windows 7. So while the game is free once you've purchased it, I have wasted the purchase price. There seem to be a lot of forum chatter concerning the problem I'm experiencing with fixes available which only work for some and not others. So would I recommend this game, not for Windows 10, if you have Windows 7 and this type of game appeals to you then go for it, despite real world financial transactions, this is the type of game I would have lost many hours to, now it is an uninstalled game in my Steam Library. I don't request a refund as it serves to remind me of my mistake so next time I'll be more careful in assuming that games will run on my OS and Rig. The next time, I'll think twice. For those who are able to play the game, lucky bast$%ds ! :-)			"

												Love the game, huge fan. Despite what the fact that the playerbase is not as big as in some other games it seems they make it up on activity. The community is just great 200 hours it and I never had a problem with another player. Never tried the cabal system which I hear is like guilds but pugging is possible for everything and you will never have a hard time gearing up if you put a bit of effort in. The cash shop is invisible as far as im aware only cosmetics but I can't say for sure as I'm a lifetime subscriber. Anyways I would recommend this for anyone who wants to play a great game with good story and an amazing community.			"

												This game is all about questing. Most of the time you're playing solo, which is why it's buy to play. The focus isn't about getting to the 'endgame', but to just enjoy building your own class and seeing what works for different situations and what doesn't. The instances are short, but enjoyable. A lot of focus is (even from the early dungeons) on boss mechanics. I've heard a lot of problems about the game-store and Funcom, but never experienced any myself.Also the servers suck sometimes.You'll easily get your moneys worth here though.			"

												I purchased this game during the Steam Sale and it's one of the best recent decisions that I've made. ""The Secret World"" combines the atmosphere of the ""Silent Hill"" games with the open world mentality of an MMO, and all of the major mission chains have full cinematics and voice acting, immersing you in both the storyline and the game's universe. It also benefits from a Mature rating which means that they don't hold back, whether it's a possessed woman swearing at you whilst attacking with the tentacles which used to be her arms or showing a man being ripped open from the inside.At the time of this review, I've played just over thirty hours and have barely scratched the surface as I'm still in the game's opening area, attempting to unravel the mystery of what happened to the fog-shrouded town of Kingsmouth. As a big fan of H.P Lovecraft, I've fallen in love with this game of mentality-shredding monsters; there are some fantastic creations in here and I hear even Cthulhu might turn up at one point. The character progression is also quite interesting as you don't 'level up' as such; you merely earn points to increase either your skills or your abilities. Despite being an MMO, ""The Secret World"" is heavily geared toward solo play. This isn't to say that you won't meet others and possibly defend the world from evil together, but there are a lot of instanced levels where you'll be solving puzzles to advance the storyline. ""The Secret World"" even gives you an in-game browser to help you with those puzzles, allowing you to look up Latin translations or searching for fake websites created purely for providing puzzle answers. Or, I guess, even just looking for the odd walkthrough!At the moment, the player base is fairly small and it would be nice to see a few others take a chance on ""The Secret World"". There's a lot to love about this game and there really isn't anything else like it out there. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the expansions but, first of all, I have to head over to a shadow dimension and destroy the Bogeyman whilst freeing the souls of dead children. All in a day's work on ""The Secret World""...			"

												          Seriously addictive mmo that reminds me of a cross between Guild Wars and Dead Island. It does have minor issues in its lack of explanation to beginners and a lot of the puzzles I find myself using the ingame browser to guide me through. That also happens to be one of its strong point. The game is mission based reloving around quests more similar to Fallout than your typical mmo like SOF or PWE as there isnt the tedious grinding, killing a million of some enemy or needing to return back to your quest start point. The investigation quests are not like anything I have ever seen before. It claims to not have a leveling system though this is only partly true. It doesn't have a traditional level system with your skills and equipment roughly defining your progression. The ingame shop is good as it doesn't give big spending players a major advantage. PVP currently suffers major balance issues. I wasn't overly interested anyway as the storyline is right up there with Deus Ex.           Its a buy once like Guild Wars with subscription being optional (minor discount outfits and non fighting pets). You get one month subscription on purchase with a free pet. I do get server lag in heavily populated areas though living in Australia with crap ADSL wouldn't be helping and I rarely find it interferes with gameplay or killing. Message me your email addy if you want a 3 day trial key. And entering agartha can be a pain the first time. Do a 360 if you cant find it.			"

												Abandoning the RPG-typical class system and even the ageless numerical hierarchy of leveling up, Funcom's The Secret World is a bold and refreshing MMORPG experience. TSW demands players' attention not only in the heat of battle, but also in the cold depths of investigation missions. This is an online role-playing game for the thinker (or Google monger) in all of us. Its world's most cryptic mysteries are bound to challenge even the most intelligent and well-rounded minds. The familiar leveling system that seasoned RPG players are accustomed to is replaced with the soothing (yet at times intimidating) freedom to create any type of character you can imagine using Skill Points (SP) and Ability Points (AP). Consequently, players are no longer bound to specific weapon and armor types from the moment you choose a class. Instead, character customization is simplified down to the decision between three factions (Templars, Illuminati, Dragon), and the seemingly endless clothing options. Knock yourself out, and then indulge yourself into a world in which every urban myth and conspiracy theory immediately come to life. The recent drop of any mandatory subscription fee eliminates the worrisome pondering time on whether or not to commit to the experience. Give it a shot if you have the dough for the initial $30 entry fee!			"

												Secret World is a fresh take on MMORPG's, Today 95%  of MMO's are just fantasy and or WoW clone’s, and Around 4% are Sifi and or space based. The remaining 1% are truly original works and here is where Secret World falls. Now the percentages I have listed are just ball park percents but most all would agree there fairly correct.If you like Resident Evil yet prefer a MMO this one is for you, other than a linear main quest line (but show me a MMO that doesn’t have a  linear main quest line, there aren’t many) I haven't found much fault with this game. It has great graphics, a totally new take on charterer progression, great voice acting and story line. For $30 and no subscription,  I highly recommend this game.			"

												So, I got through my FFXIV: ARR trial month and had to debate whether I really wanted to continue enough to start subscribing. In a way, I was surprised that there was any hesitation on my part, because I'd been having a great time with the game; but I guess that I always uneasy with the fact that I was playing a really pretty, polished, and well-balanced WoW TC. Unlike FFXIV my time with WoW way back when was anything but enjoyable. What I hated about it most of all was the unvarying quest/mission structure: enter quest hub, talk to all the NPCs with floating exclamation marks above their heads, collect the requisite number of beetle asses or moose pelts for each one, turn in quests for XP, gold, and level-appropriate gear---repeat ad. infinitum. The moment-to-moment gameplay in WoW was garbage, but its secret lay in making sure that there was always a sufficiently-tantalizing carrot being dangled in front of the player's face in order to induce them to keep slogging through the rote content (and to keep those sub fees coming in): a new pet, a mount, l33t-looking duds, etc. To me, it was nothing more than a ruse and I ditched the game at around level 20 or so.I had to wonder, then, why I was enjoying FFXIV so much, given that it doesn't depart in any significant way from WoW's structure. The first thing that comes to mind is that FFXIV is just so much more charming. Blizzard games have always rubbed me the wrong way; I don't like the aesthetic, it seems cheap and cheesy for the most part, and the Warcraft universe is one of the most derivative and least-inspired  (is that a tautology?) I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. I remember the writing for the the Frozen Throne (or whatever) campaign literally making me feel nauseous  FFXIV, on the other hand, is filled to the brim with witty, imaginative writing, and beautiful locales, music, and characters. In fact, I think one of the chief lures for me was just how awesome my character looked (with a minimal amount of effort on my part ).There's also no doubt that FFXIV is great at coming up with inducements to endure the grind. There's the campaign and class quests, which feature better narratives than the last several Final Fantasy games, joining one of three interesting factions, getting interesting gear, unlocking prestige classes, etc. etc. But again, what are you doing to earn these rewards? Without exception you're: running instanced dungeons, running about picking shiny things off the ground, running between dudes with exclamation marks above their head, running to map marker x to kill y number of infinitely-respawning mob r, and so on. Just like WoW, Rift, ToR, and GW before it, FFXIV's unyielding structure precludes surprises of the naked Nord in Morrowind sort, discovery of the ""I can rob this insane wizard blind and he won't do anything about it"" in Divine Divinity sort, or multiple resolutions of the ""you know what, I think I'll just join up with the Powder Gangers and kill everyone in Goodsprings"" in Fallout: New Vegas sort. As charming as the world is, and as much as I enjoyed taking it all in, it did just boil down to navigating a sea of !s sprinkled with (admittedly well-written) flavour text.I've tried a bunch of different MMOs in recent (like two or three) months, and the only ones that managed to hook me even a little bit were The Old Republic and FFXIV; both very much WoW clones, even if they do the whole interesting narrative and characters thing a lot better than WoW ever didn't. My hope was to find a good non-WoW-like MMO, but there are very few of them, and none of them, with the exception of EVE Online---which just ain't my thing---are any good. After pretty much deciding not to keep playing FFXIV I still wanted to play an MMO, because this is one of those PC-exclusive genres which seems to hold so much untapped potential and which I hadn't been able to partake of while sticking to console gaming for the last several years, and began to see if maybe, just maybe there was a ""different"" kind of MMO that didn't completely suck.In my searches I kept stumbling on the same few answers to the question of ""are there any worthwhile MMOs doing something different?"", namely ""wait for Archeage/Black Desert Online/Everquest: Next, EVE, or... The Secret World. Now, as you can see in my previous post I didn't think very much of TSW after my brief time with it, but I began to read through some of the Massively articles, forum posts, etc. proclaiming its brilliance. They seemed to make a pretty good case for the quests in this game being different (even if the ones I had completed pretty much fell squarely into the aforementioned ""collect 5 beetle asses"" category), and I already knew that the storytelling, setting, and characterization were all top-notch. So I ended up giving it another chance, reinstalled it from Steam, and... sat there as it refused to start up. Hours of forum trawling and another reinstall later and I got the damned launcher to work and jumped back into the game. A few hours after that and I understood what they---the people who praised the game---were talking about.			"

												I really recommend this game if you like to slowly build a character.  Everything you know about the MMO world sort of gets tipped upside down with this one.  You don't need to look up builds on the internet, they have what they call Decks, which are builds that you can build towards that give you certain skills and even an outfit.  There is always something to build towards though, as you can just stay in the starter area and farm up points and can actually get every skill in the game.I like it as a game to just hang out in.  It is a great game to get friends into and work together with them towards the quests, which start off as ""Hard"" ranked.The no levels, freedom style is very nice, but makes it hard to know if you are going to get your butt handed to you or totally slaughter a mob.  Speaking of which, mobs come in two flavors, groups or singles.  Groups do less damage, but there are more individual mobs.  Singles are stronger hitters but there are only one of them.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it's a combat style that encourages you to be moving at all times, which can be hard sometimes to be moving, and using your abilities to take the mobs down, when there are mobs all around you.  It does not work to try to just run through a lot of mobs between quests, which you pick up and complete pretty much on a one at a time basis.  I like the game, but it can be a little frustrating to get into if you are used to other MMOs like WoW or Guild Wars 2, or their like.			"

												Very, very fun game. The main story lines that you take part in throughout the games series of different areas are all very engaging and genuinely entertaining and enjoyable to play and discover more about. It also has an amazing atmosphere in some areas, especially the darker ones, along with the choice to seek out Lore in order to learn more about the zone you are roaming or its inhabitants. The combat feels very smooth and well designed, and despite seeming a bit overwhelming at first with all the choices you have when it comes to designing your personal character, once you figure things out and learn the basics it can be incredibly addictive eating up hours on end of your time.

Better modern day graphics though.Good:When you're following clues, solving puzzles, trying to work out how to grab a security camera from a roof you can't get up onto, delving into the story.Bad:fighting zombies. and more zombies. or fighting anything really. Combat feels really clunky. If you're buying this game because you like MMO combat and raids etc.. erm.. not sure. I see people rushing around, shooting things with dual weapons, not really reading clues or listening to conversations. It feels like they're playing a different game to me. This is more roleplay, reading, puzzle solving imo. Anyway.If you can get used to the controls, the bazillion windows for stuff, the way combat works, its worth getting and playing. If you want a game you can just jump into with your friends and go off on missions killing stuff, get Left4Dead or something.			"

												I have somewhat mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, it has an amazing story, perfectly crafted settings, and a fascinating cast of characters. Only on these merits, essentially those of a single-player RPG with some occasional multiplayer, it would be 10/10 in my book. However, TSW is also an MMO. Unfortunately, this means that after an all too brief story campaign (with a host of repeatable content on the side, some of which must be bought separately as DLC), one is mercilessly thrown into incredibly unforgiving dungeon-grinding, which is where you will stay until you have saved up for the same gear sets as all the elitists who have been putting you in your place the whole time. If you can stomach that, you may enjoy the end-game a lot more than I did. Oh and a note on PvP: It's a very unbalanced set of minigames, but at least there is some build variation.Story 10/10, Characters 10/10, Lore 11/10, PvE 7/10, PvP 6/10, Community 4/10 = Overall 8/10			"

												It's not easy.  Nothing's handed to you on a platter.  You get unique cutscenes, awesome characters, and an entrancing storyline that evokes your imagination, and allows you to paint your own interpretation of it.  There are several different types of missions (Quests), which are: Investigation (Usually involves researching, using google, or just your wits and own personal knowledge), Sabotage (Lasers. Cameras. Avoiding them. Avoiding being seen.)  Normal. (Kill things, collect things, or just scout around and look at things.)  Group (Akin to dungeon missions, usually.)Scenario. (Interesting addition-- Kinda like the Danger Room in X-men, or the Hologram room from Star Trek.  You go through different simulations in order to train.)You can open up all skill points and ability points in the game-- Nothing is barred from you.  This is both awesome and intimidating, because you create your own 'deck', or in other MMOs, 'build'.It has its flaws.  It may make most people tear their hair out.  But, if you like a good story, good characters, a challenge, and actually having fun while immersing yourself, then I couldn't recommend this game more if I tried.  If you like adventure point and click games, you'll have the patience to love this game.			"

												For those of you who don't know too much about my gaming history; I played almost every MMORPG on the market. EQ, EQ2, Asheron's Call, World of Warcraft, Aion, Rift, Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, SWTOR and even as far back as Ultima all on endgame/competetive levels. Never have I been so eager to play a game as The Secret World. This game is definitely worth purchasing now that it's moved from a subscription based model (still available if you want the extra shinies) to a buy to play model like Guild Wars for instance, with less annoying cash shop extras. If I honestly would have known this game was this good I would have been playing it the entire time it was a subscription MMO.The game plays like a classic adventure/mystery game with added in puzzles and non-forgiving combat. That's one of the major perks. I almost died...on the tutorial level. The puzzles range from finding artifacts scattered in the zone to extremely complex music puzzles, multi-language puzzles, and skill jumping puzzles. The 'B' key (open internet browser) built in the game will be your best friend throughout.+ Challenging both mentally and phsyically, but still very fun+ Very good graphics+ Great plotlines/story- Combat can be a little wonky- Running everywhere gets a little tediousOverall: 9/10			"

												This game has a great theme, lots of content, excellent graphics, and solid gameplay.  It is pretty rough around the edges in some respects.  But it grows on you and keeps drawing you in.  The writing is excellent.  I also enjoy the fact that it is set in the modern day.			"

												This is truly a unique MMO Considering the fact that there are no classes to be found, in this game, you build your own class. Pick a weapon type and level it up to equip better weapons of that type. You keep getting XP to level skills, and it challenging to choose the right ones. I would say if you got some free time to screw around, you should get it. It's cheap, and its a buy to play MMO, so your good!			"

												For an MMO, this one is surprisingly engaging. The ""buy the box"" entry fee keeps most of the trolls out while the micropayment store keeps you from having to get a subscription. The classless skilltree system means you can play however you want though the main meta-roles (DPS, Tank, Healer) still apply to a degree inside team instances and raids.			"

												I stopped playing after a week or so but that doesn't mean it's not completely loveable. This game will always have a nostalgic feel to it and its unique take on the world around you really is marvelous. The whole game feels like you really are a part of it. The RPG elements are more in-depth than that of any other MMO's I have encountered (which I have played a lot of them.) The graphics aren't the best but that means you don't need a great computer to run it, either. It's extremely in-depth when it comes to the class system, anyone can be anything and if you're only willing to try out one thing then you are going to have a hard time. Something many games fail at, making you feel like you're stuck to one job forever this game truly makes you feel like a part of you is deciding what to really do.Why did I stop playing? I took a break from gaming and didn't have anyone to play the game with so at times it felt like a single player MMO even after meeting people for some reason I just felt like no matter what I would be playing completely solo until end game which took a while to get to.

												Solid Horror MMO with a huge amount of available playtime. Even if you don't get hooked, you could very easily spend 40+ hours on this game just messing around with a single character. Memorable NPC, all fully voice acted, mission cinematics, 3 unique factions and a compellingly dark story. It's worth it at 30 dollars, but anything less then 20 would make it a must buy in my opinion.			"

												Did you enjoy mysteries ? Conspiracies ? The occult and all manner of unknown things ? Then you'll love this game.The Secret World (TSW) starts the player off in one of three factions - Illuminati, Templars and Dragon. Although the three factions are enemies, you'll find that you will all unite against the monsters within the game world - in fact, the only time the factions are relevant is in PvP.The storylines and characters are very well developed, and the puzzles in the game will require some thought, if not frequent trips to Google.There are plenty of in jokes for horror genre fans, but with plenty of humour. It is worth noting that the game is squarely aimed at mature audiences.A community is what makes/breaks a game, and you will find that most players will assist you with quests and puzzlesA quick word on the soundtrack - I normally turn the music off on all games, TSW has such a good sound track, I'm listening to it a week later.A well recommended game.

												Bar none one of the best pay2play MMO games ever.  The setting and how the story is blended with the quests is remarkable.  If someone were to see me playing the game they could easily mistake The Secret World for being a highly polished single-player experience.   Many times i replay quests for the sheer fun of playing through them.  The quests are almost always unique and the quest givers are always a treat (Sam Krieg and Nassir are just two of many favorites).That said TSW is not without its issues.  The main one for me is the sheer install size of the game.  Its massive so it compllicates things for someone with limited hard drive space.  The second gripe I have is the performance and loading times.  That isn't as much a mark against the game as such it's just a heads up that an SSD and a relatively beefy PC rig would be helpful in getting to the game faster.  Believe me, when I get to fiending for TSW a 40 gig download with 1+ minute load screens feels like eternity.  Again, I have a poor PC setup so your mileage will vary if you have a computer from this decade.All in all, my decision to skip TSW when it first released with its monthly fee setup was a huge mistake on my part.  I would have gladly paid $15 per month for this game.   If you can get the game on sale, wonderful.  If not, dont make the mistake I did and take a pass on the game for ""another time.""   Its worth it.			"

												Now that this game's gone Buy2Play, I really can't recommend any other MMO higher than this. As far as standard PvE and PvP combat goes, it's not too special. Combat and Skills work similar to Guild Wars 1, with an emphasis on moving during combat to avoid special attacks. Builds are very free-form and allow much more experimentation than other MMOs. Most of the game can be played solo as well, although it will be tough.What sets The Secret World apart is it's very unique and interesting setting, and a large emphasis on actually telling a story rather than just stringing along quests. There's a large overarching plot that is genuinely interesting. Great voice work and lots of it helps make every quest feel important and less of a grind. There are a ton of missions based around solving ARG-style puzzles, and for those who enjoy doing research to solve things you'll absolutely love it. There are even stealth missions. The in-game lore you can collect and read are actually really well written, like the story itself, and help immerse you into the pseudo-horror setting well.Be warned, there are a promisingly large number of bugs. It's a real shame, as they often directly get in the way of finishing major quests. The game still holds up even with these though.As said, if you have to start a new MMO, please give this one a shot. It's fantastic and really under-appreciated.			"

												This is an intriguing MMO-RPG, that's the shortest I can say.Below is a very lengthy review, opinion and recommendation of why for the game itself.I say this because as an MMORPG, this isn't exactly a typical MMO.You play as a character belonging to one of the three different factions: The Illuminati, The Templars and finally The Dragon, each of these three factions are all against one another for what is presumed to be dominance over each other. The Secret World is a Dark Fantasy themed universe in which there are heavy references and inspirations from mythologies and universes such as H.P. Lovecraft.Of course this is information you can simply figure from reading the wikipedia, here's the part you actually want to read into thoroughly.This game is pretty decent for those who are intrigued by playing a story and narrative delivering game in a MMO setting. It is an MMORPG that emphasizes more on the RPG than the MMO and I say that it is pretty well done in that respect. If you're looking to know how the combat is, playing through it is pretty different, considering you don't pick a specialization, you more or less make one of your own, meaning your abilities are rather skill based more than anything, for if you've played Guild Wars 2, you will know what I'm referring to is how each weapon type you possess has its own set of skills, but The Secret World goes a little bit further by making it where you can have two different weapons, practically a Main and Secondary weapon, but the interesting portion about this is that essentially you can get each weapon type (up to 9) and learn different skills from this weapon style or that weapon style, which shall carry over provided you don't require to have the weapon equipped to use it, meaning for example if you are using Blood magic and decide you want to use a fist weapon, but only for skills, you could be a blood mage who deals ranged magic damage and every hit due to Licking your Wounds from Fist Weapon type will give you a 10 HP per second heal with 5 stacks of the buff up for a few seconds that can be refreshed throughout combat, but there's going to be different and possibly better combinations for you to choose and this is what makes the combat and development of characters in this game's universe so interesting and fascinating. Now let's move onto the quests themselves, this is where the story driven narrative delivery is along with miscellaneous cutscenes that are pertinent to the story lie, imagine when you pick up a quest instead of having to read through a paragraph or two of dialogue that you actually watch and listen to these characters come alive before you with their dialect and personality right before you. I personally believe that it's the small things like this that realistically make The Secret World at least a good game. The game is so large, you will probably spend a couple of days easily in just the first area with how large the area itself is, which can easily be a good or bad thing dependant on how you desire your stories and adventure, just to make it easier on you, the reader, this game is extremely lengthy, I spent my first day in the first area with little to no finishing in sight. You simply play through the story quests, but I'd say you'll be tempted to do side quests and believe me, I saw a good 12+ side quests at least and they're far from short for most of the ones I've done.Overall, I'd say if this game is on sale for 50% to 75% off, I also would say to get this game while it's up for sale, because you will enjoy the game for the price of $15 to $7.50 very, very easily. It is ordinarily up for sale for $29.99, which is fine if you Really enjoy this kind of universe and game, but not everybody will, so my advice is pick it up when it's low and you'll have a very, very enjoyable game for the money you spent.My only advice is when you play this game, keep the volume low, it seems to be naturally very loud compared to other games.

												I am impressed so far.  I have only been playing for a week or two but this game actually has promise.  I have not tried the PvP as I am a PvE player for the most part but this game has a bunch of Pros and only a few Cons that I have found so far.Pros1.  This is a MMORPG in a major way.  The quests are very well done.  They are puzzles and are difficult.  The game has abuilt in web Browser to help google things and find answers to the puzzles.  Seems Funcom went and put hints all over the internet and has you find the hints in the real world and apply them to the game.  It keeps the quests entertaining and fresh.  No more just hitting escape to avoid the dialog and reading kill X/X of this monster / badguy.  That is not to say that there are not kill X/X quests but they are NOT the only thing and are actually the most infrequent type.2. Your character can be anything they want.  Want to be a Jack of all trades then go right ahaed.  Want to just be a caster who can CC and Heal and DPS?  Sure thing.  Want to dump everything into Assault Rifles?  Go right ahead.  You can actually with enough time fill every role completely (that would take a huge amount of time but it can be done and you get a special outfit for it).  Character development is entirely up to you.  3. This game is NOT for children.  The theme is VERY dark, the first quest area is right out of a lovecraft novel (No really Kingsmouth is Innsmouth).  The language is harsh and the subject matter is R rated (a guy telling his female sidekick that she needs to keep her legs open to draw in more followers).  Cons1.  The game is difficult.  This is one you may want to play with friends.  The game is not unsoloable but it is tough.2.  The quests are HARD.  Some of the puzzles are pretty tough to get through.  Expect to use a lot of Google.3.  There is a very poor tutorial on the character skills aspect of the game.  There is no respecs.  You put points in Blood Magic and they are there forever.  Which is more realistic in terms of if you learn a skill it stays with you you don't just forget it but it leads to a LOT of grinding for AP and Skill points.  That being said you can do almost every quest over and over again (after a slight time delay).  I recommend reading about the Character Decks (sort of a guided template with a reqard for filling that role).4. It is a F2P title which means that after your first 30 days your going to have to either subscribe or your going to miss some of the features.  Some potions only work on subscribers/  I don't mind the F2P format so far as it really doesn't effect the early game so much.Overall I think the game has a LOT of potential and I hope that further updates and mandates from Funcom's EA overlords don't ruin a very unique gaming experience.At the time of this writting I have had the game less that 2 weeks and have logged 35 hours in game.

												Pro points:Great game, great ambiance, nice community, great dungeon, varied quests. B2P, so no monthly fee.The tutorial is a bit light so do not hesitate to ask people for more information in game.Also do not ragequit because of the infamous investigation missions (Green mission icon), as even if they bring a nice change in mmo (you need to think, look for info on the net, and solve riddle), they are not mandatory to go on. At worst, you can get solution on the net, as these missions can bring nice background information for you to understand better the story or the land.Minus:To be frank, the game Editor does not have so much money, so update are (very) slow.However, for less than 30$/€ (I do not know the current price), you can already have fun for hundreds of hours.After that, if you like the game, you can buy the extensions/missions pack. They are usually quite nice, but can be considered a bit ""expensive"" (around 10$/€ each)  compared to their size. But if you played a few hundred hours for less than 30€, you can give a bit more to participate ,) "

												The mechanics and setting of this game are noteworthy in and of themselves.  There are no races (everyone is human); instead you choose one of three organizations: Illuminati, Templar, or Dragon.  These have cosmetic differences as well as limit travel in one of the three hub cities, and some cinematic differences as well.  There are no strict classes; you will spend points on skills freely as you level up, and no ability is off-limits because of other choices.  Of course, some ""classes"" have abilities that feed into others in the same set, but just as many have broad boosts.  The world itself is a notable departure from the typical fantasy/sci-fi settings in that it takes place on a present-day Earth where monsters are real.  Yes, there are zombies, but they're early fodder and certainly not a focal point of most of the game.Most quests are repeatable, so you can keep playing a particular moment over again to get achievements.  There is a cooldown though, so you can't just grind one quest ad nauseum.  Many of the quests are quite a bit more interesting than the stereotypical ""bring back some of a thing"" fare that saturates the genre.  A lot of that is helped by the moody atmosphere of the maps, including some bizarre monsters.  The sense of exploration and discovery is palpable when questing.The quests are either going to be wonderful and engross you or frustrate to the point of abandoning the game.  Quests may have you following esoteric clues that require actual thought and investigation, including switching over to a browser window to figure out who a particular person, how long a song is, or what a verse says.  Figuring out these clues is fun and feels immediate and real.  Some will stretch your patience until you get used to not being spoon-fed everything.I'm sad to say it isn't the most polished of games, and there isn't much in-game assistance if you can't figure out how to do something.  (Like the particular pattern for manufacturing a specific type of gear.)  Platforming is unfortunately awful, but you'll have to use it to reach some of the lore items and for some achievements.  The stealth achievements are also twitchy, and the wait to redo quests makes actually achieving achievements a somewhat tiersome process.  An option to restart a quest in the event of a blown optional goal would be most welcome.The absense of classes can also make grouping a bit tricky; I've never felt really comfortable or competent in group dungeons.  One nice thing about definitive classes is getting to know the role and playstyle.  When everything is an option, some truly bizarre builds can result.  You can, however, save skill sets and switch out on the fly, making it easier to build and refine your own classes.  There are ""decks"" in the game as well that will guide you to making worthwhile skill choices; decks also unlock unique costume options to show off what you've done and help inform others of where your focus lies.In short, this is a beautiful mess of a game.  The quests, leveling mechanics, and setting are all amazing.  Unfortunately, and largely depending on how accustomed you may be to typical MMO games, figuring out the mechanics can be a bit ungainly.  In-game achievements are often more frustrating than fun, especially when requiring stealth or agility.Oh, and I have yet to see anything that shows subscription players have a distinct adavantage over non-subscription players.

												This game stands out from the rest of the MMORPGs on the market in so many ways. It's well worth the time to look into, and has so much more to offer than collecting 10 bee's knees to give to the local blacksmith for no good reason other than he asked you (and every other adventurer) to. Furthermore, the implementation of a unique rank up system that doesn't become more difficult to obtain AP and SP as you progress through the game means that the game's pace doesn't slow as with many other MMORPGs. Overall, it's a unique experience that one simply has to try.			"

												I have played TSW for 400+ hours now, gone through the story for issues 1-10 as of the time I'm typing this.-Building your ""deck"" or skill combinations  can be fun and keeps me always reviewing my setup.-Aegis could use a bit of fine tuning as a tank  and even duoing with my wife we found it tedious to kill some monsters but      that could be due to not having full 10.4 gear yet.-The main story arcs are very good, (I won't spoil it for those who haven't been through it yet,) I like the references characters will make covering how a player resurrects after death, and the voice acting in issue 9 and 10 especially were very good.Have since Lifetimed the game, and recommended to many friends.    I'm very excited for issue 11!			"

												have this thing 1 day, played 8 hours (+ 2 hours patching). I think that is a good sign.Cinematic missions, Good combat (for a auto-attack-ish system), Funny factions (just read after you finished a mission).Missions can be long, in those 8 hours i was buissy with 8 side quests and 1 main quest and the main quest is not done yet.And it is quite laggy for me, so I hope you have a bulkier computer then me.After playing 60 hours I noticedGood:Cutscenes are well acted, missions are diverse, there is no max level (if you put enough time in it you can have every job maxed), combat styles are varried, instances are great, community is friendly (the low amount that there is...), factions still cool, level only dictates abilities, but not stats, monster are well designed and are different (begin is mostly zombies though).Bad:Still laggy, patching is not often, beginning is boring (you have to take a bitter pill with nice effects), combat is auto attack, fetch quests are common, main quest progression is real slow (60 hours in, at tier 13/18 (because did alot of side quests, which are needed!)), low playerbase on server, most creatures attack you on sight (90% of them) and there are certain missions where you want to eat your keyboard with frustration thanks to instakill traps.If you have 30 $ to spend, it is worth a buy, if it is on sale with 20 $ then this is a good game to spend it on!

												After a year, I can't recommend this game. It seems like they're trying to challenge players who have been there from the start, but are doing it in the most ridiculous way possibe. FunCom fiddled about with some settings, making the game's enemies more robust in newbie areas. Robust as in, you're not getting past the third game setting without buying XP levels to get there. There also appears to be more techinical issues than last year, to the point where it obfuscates co-op playing. FunCom are fiercely protective of their game balance. Everything went belly up when their Krampus 2013 event occurred - dozens of Krampuses would spawn in one area where only one should. This never seemed to get resolved, as you can be mobbed absolutely anywhere.Even tested this balancing issue on a new character, and the enemies you're supposed to grind can kill you in two hits on the first level. The first level meant to break you into the game world. As it is, there is no way you would be able to quest solo without dropping serious coinage to skip levelling, or be content stuck on the same boring quests on the first level for about six months of daily grinding, dying about thirty times a half hour.Sorry, but this game is no longer fun, and I will miss it greatly. It's a gem of a game plot trapped in an unbalanced wreck.Here's the old review. I really wish it would go back to being that way. {January 2015}~~~~~~~~~~One note: your character's super power is dying and being reborn. There are no penalties for dying, and some quests actually require you to die. If you feel like rage quitting because you're dying, please don't. It's the way the game works; embrace it.An excellent MMORPG. It's got a deep and intriguing story, you can craft your character to whatever specs you desire, and it's huge. Funcom have also gone into great detail with the Lovecraftian elements, and it really does feel like you're fighting eldritch creatures.There is a learning curve though. This is my first MMORPG, and it's hard to get the hang of, but I've heard it's not like other games of this genre. Also, the difficulty does spike crazily in the second area, and it seems to require a lot of grinding. There are in game purchases, but it's become a big thing for all online games now. However, they're not essential to follow the main plot.You will need to look up crafting guides, because it's not very well implemented. It's not a huge part of the game, and there are free community mods to help make it easier for players. But all in? It's great! The sidequests are enjoyable, and the co-op works really well. Find some pals and enter The Secret World.			"

												Been playing this since BETA off and on. Let's keep this quick...The depth of missions is great. Any game where you have a built int browser for mission research is excellent to me. The variety, the graphics, the theme, all top notch. However, solo at the upper levels is possible, but very thin on content. Groups for PVP and nightmare level raids/dungeons is really the optimal way to play. And it takes some dedication to get involved in all that.Even with that, which only some might consider a drawback, this game is well worth your time.			"

												Casual, easy to play MMO with all the intrigue of a Modern Day RPG setting like World of Darkness. No classes or levels so you can build the character you want to play with. There is some structure such as builds (Tank, Heal, DPS) and the Ability Deck system allows you to construct prefab builds if you wish. Easily soloable, but always more fun in a group. From the same team that brought us The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, and Dreamfall: Chapters. They are excellent storytellers and this game is no exception!			"

												I have many things to say for this game:I bought it October last year, and I played probably 8 hours of it. My initial thought of it was ""Waste of £20""There's stuff this game does right, and it's own unique aspects;General Creepiness: 8/10 Running around this dark forests by yourself you'll notice goosebumps on your arms.Combat: 5/10 The combat is overused in the society of MMO's and is just super awkward, nothing spectacular. But it feels okay after a while.Solo'ing: 8/10 I don't have a clue of what being in a group is like in TSW, but I never truly feel bored or ""lonely"" and I can say: If your smart, you'll survive.PVP: Never tried it, I have no care for killing other people as it is, but from the way the combat feels I can't say it would be that good.Presentation: 6/10 The whole ""Three Factions, No Classes, No armour, No levels, horror"" appeals to a gamer like myself. Usually classes in games don't balance out that well. Some classes feel super strong while others hang off to the side like bones on your plate. So in most/all MMO's your a pile of nothing in a barram wasteland of 3 million players. While that's probably also the case in TSW, it's your abilities that make you strong, not that your a level 80 Assassin with a seemingly overpowered pair of daggers. Story: 5/10 While the story is pretty decent, a lot of it feels stereotypical. Some ideas are new, and some make you yawn. The whole ""Your a normal boring human being UNTIL!! a magical bee floats into your mouth. And now your a speechless lunatic who's going to save the world from a bunch of egotestical (That mispelling is on purpose, there's a lot of 18+ stuff in the story *cough* Dragon introduction *cough*) knuckleheads who only want power and to rule over all the other countries that are soooo far apart from one another"" makes me want to whack Funcom with a large frying pan like an old batty grandmother. Overall: 7/10 if you have a spare sum of cash, and your looking for a mmo to spend it on, and you like being wigged out a little and generally just being incredibly amused then this is a game you should get. Research the game before you get it. ~			"

												If you like the genre of horror-occult-action, you will like this game. The worlds are vast and exploration is the best part of the game. Biggest downside is that it's very grindy. You might have to spend a few hours in the same place and replay several missions so that you can tackle missions in a nearby realm. The repetitiveness saps all the fun out of the game. The system for making runes and items can be confusing, and really is just needless. I'd rather collect rare items than collect 100 items to make a rare item I don't want. There are rare item drops too, but usually, you will have to trade or collect to get what you want. Nice character customization system. Enough clothing options to keep you grinding for the cool stuff, but once you get rich enough, there is nothing left to get. It can get confusing to level your character ""correctly"" because there are so many powers you can get and you may never know what the best build and attacks are to make unless you read a ton of forum posts about it.The holiday special missions are awesome, but you usually need a high level character or group to do them. Despite all the downsides, why is this a good game? The stories, atmosphere, and creatures.			"

How to build, what to do, how to manage your character, what spoilers to spoil yourself to.200+ hours and I'm nearly 75% of the way through the skill tree. Once I finish, I might go through again, make different choices, get different things. I'd say go for it. Game's a one time payment unless you want the extra content - just buy the ultimate or massive edition and get the stuff. Hell, I want the ultimate edition for the costume.

												Totally different. Totally awesome. I am having more fun in this MMO than I have had in any other GAME (much less an MMO) in a while....other than Shroud of the Avatar, in all fairness I must disclose that. TSW has also KEPT me interested...lots of games are fun for a little while but they just become a grind pretty quickly. I am still trying to figure out what in hades is even going on in this one...and I am many hours in. That's a GOOD thing. I hate having a game beat but still having 100 hours to go to finish it.TSW comes HIGHLY recommended. I started out testing this game as something to play while SotA continues through its Alpha process but now looks like they are going to have to share time.The Secret World gets 4.75 Dancing Disco Monkeys out of 5.... Good job, Funcom....I didn't think you guys had it in you but you proved me completely wrong!! Thank you :)			"

												Well. I have MANY words for this game. Many of which are the opposite of abismal. Let's start our Journey into this beautiful game.When you first enter the game, you are immersed with a white screen and amazing music. All great games have amazing music. Then you are given a choice: Factions. There's 3 of them; the Templars, Illuminati, and Dragons. Personally, I chose the Templars. Reminded me of Assassin's Creed. Then you construct a character. Not way too many choices but still able to create a unique one.  And then you're thrown into a confusing cutscene since your character cannot speak as it is an MMO. The cutscene for the opening is quite long, but gives you a good opening.Now the cutscenes are over and you enter The Secret World. When you first take a step, I felt the animations were a bit choppy and rushed. This is something they could DEFINATLY improve. Make the animations flow together and instead of pressing W and immediatly walking, they have a transition animation, kind of like Tera.That's all I have to say as I want to let you play the game and see what happens for yourself.Pros:Variety of weaponsImmersing story for an MMOPretty graphicsAmazing music and soundCons:Choppy and rushed animatonsSkill system took a few minutes to figure out, but a pro on the unique skill and AP system.

												I have played MMO after MMO over the past 10 years. I was a diehard wow-head for much of that time. That being said, I've tried everything from EVE to Everquest. I had even previously tried The Secret World when it first came out and, for whatever reason, I just didn't buy into it. Fast forward to 2015. I had just given up playing wow for the third time this year, I was looking for something easy to get into but complex with a rich world full of adventure. I remember trying this game when it first came out and I remember never truly hating it. I noticed that the price was $30 bucks so I bought it.... let me tell you now, I do not regret it one bit. In fact, I converted my wife and friends from being wow-heads to being addicted to TSW. That's not to say that Wow and TSW are similar. They have a thing or two that are alike but the games are super different.In a nutshell: If you like vampires, werewolves, ghosts, ZOMBIES and all things that dwell in that kind of world of horror mixed with HEAVY theorycrafting (I HATED the fact that Blizzard removed talent trees from wow!) then this game is for you!!!! BUY IT!			"

												The most unique MMORPG I have ever played. If the combat was better I would say this hands down the best ever made but sadly the combat is among the worst. Still it offers a stand alone experience you will find in no other MMO  and even most RPG's. If you like story and to carve your own story this is for you!

												I'm not going to lie. I love the hell out of this game. I wish I could devote more time to it, but I sold my soul to Guild Wars 2. :(Awesome puzzles, helpful people, engaging world, and a uniqueness that has me thinking about it long after I've stopped.			"

												Casual, easy to play MMO with all the intrigue of a Modern Day RPG setting like World of Darkness. No classes or levels so you can build the character you want to play with. There is some structure such as builds (Tank, Heal, DPS) and the Ability Deck system allows you to construct prefab builds if you wish. Easily soloable, but always more fun in a group. From the same team that brought us The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, and Dreamfall: Chapters. They are excellent storytellers and this game is no exception!			"

												I walked into a highly used roleplay on Arcadia when first playing as a noobie and proceeded to get yelled at in private messages to ""PUT MY GUN AWAY"" and ""YOU'RE RUINING PEOPLES IMMERSIONS"" while snowflakes had their characters be werewolves and other♥♥♥♥♥♥Avoid the terrible roleplayers and find yourself a group.Other than that, The gameplay is great, you can do the whole story line single player style, for added fun the tokyo expansion is a must buy and the side stories are fun and give some neat items. (They're called 'issues'.) You can be a shotgun magic wielding psychopath with a chainsaw if you set your skill points first into that.8/10			"

												Where do I start with this game? Well lets start with the intro, the game has a great premise for why you got pulled into this war, one day your just another average joe and the next you got super powers, great huh? This game just feels great to play the customization is amazing, the fact that you don't have to commit to a single build is great too! I know a lot of other MMORPGs have it so you can have different classes but I feel this game does it way better. Say you go damage and 20 hours in you think ""Damn...I wish I went healing"" Well now you can just keep playing and you will get the xp needed to get a full on healing set of abilities I know I know this game is really grindy but doing all the quests in everyone area should give you enough XP to make at least 5 decks. The Missions are not boring they are actually really interesting theres three different types of quests, I forgot the name of the red one but its basically kill these things grab this, Sabatoge, investigation and side missions. If you are sick of quests where you just go here kill these guys go there kill these guys then theres investigation quests for you they are really cool, actually make you think outside the box and even then you gotta double check your facts, theres missions where they want you to decode, or find a missing piece of the puzzle with vague clues, overall its a really fun time and makes you think, Investigation missions also give you more xp then your average red missions the slaying ones. The story is great you are basically a nobody whos given tasks from your secret group whoever you chose, and while on those missions you slowly start to discover that something else has taken an interest in you as well, and lets just say that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you interact with them, I don't want to spoil too much. Overall this game is really great and does not get the credit it deserves i'd give it a 10/10 and reccomend it to all my friends who like MMOs, at first the game is a little confusing but once you learn the basics it gets easier to play.

												Great MMO and better yet experience.I've owned TSW for years now and only after re-purchasing via Steam [for the updatability as well purchasing new chapters]  it's been great.  No better stories, characters and sometimes Lovecraftian tales in another experience let alone MMO.Community is great, albeit less than should be for this gem of an experience, and while higher level than myself were always willing to help on questions, hints on missions and whatnot.  It's rough after being top level as many of the leading community are to lower ones self to doing the past years content, again and again for us noobs so there are things that you *must* find others at the same level to work with.  I don't think that's a bad design or plan because the game itself is better with others or friends.It's tech is aging, it's community is small but strong and the stories and experience are still one of the best, if not the best, out there.  No more killing 10 Elves for ears and turning in to get some worthless tidbit and once you've cracked the codes on some of these missions you will clearly see the intellect and dedication the dev's go for each and every update.While I cannot play more than I already do I always want to play more than I can.  It's that kinda game for me at least and being free  you should have zero issues setting up an account and giving it a test run.  I've even, among purchasing the Massive Edition as well the Ultimate, subscribe monthly for a few perks and extra Store cash.  It's my way of helping keep this online as long as we can.Cheers,~Icky			"

												LOVE the lore (Especially the New England references) that alludes to some of my absolute favorite authors. The character advancement mechanics are not the norm of most MMOs, and I honestly feel that many more games could learn from TSW.The Base Edition gets you pretty far. I still haven't bought any story edition addons and have tons of progress to make. If there's ever a free weekend or something in the near future, some players may feel overwhelmed, but the playerbase is actually really amazing and helpful, as well as anything you have questions about can be researched with a native in-game browser (not just the steam overlay) which also functions as a tool utilized for in-game missions. Nobody should ever miss the chance to try this game if they're able, and I encourage anyone who can relate to this review to buy the game.			"

												Admittedly I'm very new to this game, but so far it has amazed and enticed me. So much so that I spent about 11 hours straight playing it after I started. The best parts for me are the investigations and puzzles that have no indicator in the map, just a clue and a goal, and the rest is up to you. But I also like that the players are... More civilised? More mature? Then other MMO's. One of the earliest things I noticed was that in the General Chat, people were asking questions and getting help. No one was ♥♥♥♥♥ing, raging or complaining, and everyone was using correct Grammar and Punctuation. That's not something one see's in MMO's today. Or games in General. While we have evolved past 1337 5P34K, we gamers, as a generalisation, still speak like ""12yo AOL's lol wut.""  and for the most part, we love a good troll, but at least in my first 11 hours, Everyone was sincere and polite, and the humour was general, and not at someone expense. Truly a nice contrast to what I am used to in games today. I'll expand on my thoughts toward the game as I continue to explore it, but for now, these are my first thoughts. 8/10 - A great gaming experience, and truly seems to be the best case scenario for a gaming community.

												I play games for their entertainment value, a new one every once in a while, just for kicks. This game, The Secret World, has occasional moments of otherworldliness and genius. The atmosphere and story lines left me waiting for more, on pins and needles. I never felt like I was grinding - especially the first time through. Even after completing the first 3 chapters, I go back to gain some points to fill out my decks/builds. I'm glad I got to experience FunCom's vision of a truly unique MMO. I anxiously wait for the other chapters and the ability to  play them with my family. 4.5/5 over all. Some moments are brilliant, other parts - some of the interface, the double-clicking on items - not so much.			"

												This game isn't quite what's advertised.  The game's tone is all over the place.  In only a few instances have quests been dark and mature.  More than 75% of the time (through 15 hours) the quests play EXACTLY like a Rockstar game.  Think GTA or Bully.  Quests are introduced through a brief cut scene with the NPC.  The NPCs are glib, overacting stereotypes, generally unphased by the horror supposedly swirling around them.  I'm positive they did the voice acting before actually scripting the quests because the NPCs often don't even discuss the particulars of what they want you to do.  That makes the quests both unengaging and confusing.The tone also suffers a lot because there's no pretense that you're a shadow agent.  A large minority of NPCs recognize that you have special powers or even outright acknowledge that you're a member of a secret society.  The rest of the NPCs assume you're there to help them and send you on bland good guy missions, to shore up junk walls or collect supplies, which shatter the tone of you investigating paranormal forces for your own shadowy ends.I wish there was something between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended.""  I know of very few games that even occasionally strike the tone this game is going for, so if you're looking for something like this, it's pretty much the only game in town.  For an MMO, it also has the freedom of class building and some combat mechanics found in a much more polished game, Elder Scrolls Online.  If you can get the Ultimate Edition on sale for ~$20, you can easily get your money's worth from this game.			"

												Tl;dr: my hour count on this game is as of six months ago, when Steam decided to stop counting the patcher and the game as one program and thus stopped logging my hours. So, that's how I feel about this game.Pros of the game:1. Genuine moments of horror. There's missions that people laughingly state they will never replay, not because they didn't enjoy them, but because they scared them too much.2. Beautiful ambience (if you can play with headphones and without the music on, I'd recommend it, because the game has some of the loveliest background noises I've ever seen and it really enhances the game. From the distant sounds of the wailing damned to the ominous whispers of blood magic, it's all 10/10 guarenteed to creep you out).3. One of the friendliest online communities I've ever seen (aside from a few jerks). Even if you don't have a cabal (guild), you can ask the custom chat channels like sanctuary and noobmares for help and, as long as you're willing to accept advice, they're always willing to give it.4. Deep lore. Seriously, this is a game that was originally launched with an ARG (alternate reality game). There is a complex mythos behind every zone, and in many cases it's connected. 5. Something for everyone. Do you want to kill zombies? Got it. Play Indiana Jones (but with more mummies)? Got it. Psychological horror? Got it. Feel bad about playing the tutorial a few hundred hours into the game? Got it!6. Interesting missions. There's your standard kill quests, but also puzzle and stealth quests that require you to brush up on a rather esoteric skill set. If you're really having trouble you can look up a guide, but you can also learn morse code and research translations from Arabic, Latin, Romanian and more.7. The skill system. This is both a pro and, for some people, a con. Rather than having levels and locked classes, you can unlock every single ability on every character. Most people eventually learn how to do every dungeon role, unless they really dislike one. This means that you really get to play around with skills, and also that no ability point is ever wasted. However, it also means that the game expects you to be able to build your deck to suit the situation, so if you're not willing to tinker this can get distracting. The tutorials in game aren't super (though they've improved), but there's a lot of intense theorycrafting online.Cons:1. The game has some bugs. Some are amusing, such as the fact that you can stack the /smile emote to become an eldritch horror. Some are less so, such as a necessary mission item not being usable. Thankfully, GMs tend to respond quickly, but sometimes it can get frustrating.2. Up until about a year ago, content updates were slow. This has improved lately, with missions being released on a fast timetable, but be aware that there will sometimes be lulls in content. There's lots and lots to do, and this is also a non-subscription game, so this isn't really something that should be a deal breaker, but it is something to note.3. Confusing optimization. My computer, by all rights, should not run this game. But it does so with few hiccups. Higher end rigs sometimes cannot run this, though usually PCs (rather than laptops) are exempt from this. The optimization is not super, so make sure to keep an eye on ping and lag when you start so that, if you CANT run it, you'll have time to return it.4. Lackluster tutorials. This is somewhat mitigated by the friendliness of the community and the online resources, but the tutorials aren't the best. Optimal stats and weapon synergy aren't really explained, and there are a couple spots where the game goes from allowing a lot of messing about to expecting you to have your build together quickly.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game if you're into complex lore, challenging missions, a weapons system that requires flexibility, and a small but friendly community. If you do play the game, I'd recommend going to curse.com for mods and tswdb.com for tutorials, walkthroughs, and builds.			"

												Okay so this is not going to be a long review or anything. The game is fantastic and i am absolutely loving it. I definetly think it's a game you should try out if  you like mmo's that are heavy on story and mystery etc. It's just lovely.There is just one thing i know that might annoy alot of people including me. Some areas of the game has truely horrific optimization. So for starters. I can play MGS V, Mad Max, Realm reborn and all of these new games on max settings with way over 60 fps constantly. This game on max usually lays around 70-90 fps depending on which areas and how many mobs etc like all mmo's it can change alot. But just some areas of the game is terrible. Let's take for example ""The Blue Mountain"" area. I went in there with a steady 70+ fps at all times. After a few hours however it started to drop from 70-90 to 16-18 fps when i turned in different angels etc. But i thought okay i guess just some areas have poor optimization. Then however.... I went into a cave and as expected in a enclosed small area the fps increases way higher usually. But when i went out of the cave i was now at a constant 16-18 fps and now only in different angles 70-90 fps and then after awhile it was just more or less constantly at 17fps. Tried decreasing settings, did absolutely nothing, still stayed at constant super smoooooth 17 fps. untill i restarted the game. Now everything works 70-90 as usual with small dips to like 30fps 20fps etc at random areas and angles. So far i have only ecountered this terrible optimization of a heavy dose in this area ""The Blue Mountain"" and a very small bit in previous areas. I am not sure how many other areas have it. But i have a feeling there are quite abit more areas like this.Now as i said i love this game and it definetly dosent discourage me in any way from playing it. But i know that some people including me can be extremely annoyed with fps drops for no apperant reasons and poorly optimized games etc.I am not discouraging one from buying this game, i really think you should try it out. I was skeptic for months about this game but then decided to buy it and loved it. Just a friendly pointing out something that might annoy alot of people.(and sorry for my poor english)			"

												Thoroughly enjoyable realistic world but one with a twist.  I really enjoy the history in the game as a whole and I feel the secret societies are depicted well.  I especially like how you can build your character any way wished and am not necessarily tied down to one particular weapon or skill set.  The NPC are great to listen too, and I would not recommend skipping their dialogue.  Some of it is hilarious (hello, Dr Zurn and your tripping leopard, LOL)			"

												The Secret World is a world rich in lore and story, coupled with one of the worst sets of game mechanics ever conceived. Whatever the developers were thinking, it wasn't making a user friendly gaming experience.You must pick one of three factions before you even create your character. That's not bad, but there is little difference between factions, you perform the same missions, get the same rewards, use the same weapons and spells, in other words, factions are a needless division invented by the game devs who wanted to have opposing factions but weren't interested in making you do anything different. So one faction is as good as another.Crafting. It doesn't exist, don't look for it, don't ask about it, don't even wish for it. What passes for crafting is cumbersome and about as smooth as an 18yr old virgin begging for a date to the prom. You're supposed to place raw materials into a crafting window in specific patterns in order to get what you want. There's a pattern for everything and unless you're a genius, you better bookmark a website that shows you the patterns.The game is hard and doesn't get much easier. There's no real starter zone, you're pushed into the deep end of the pool and expected to swim. Fortunately death is temporary and other than some gear damage, really doesn't mean much in TSW. You don't level up like you do in a regular game. Instead you are awarded ability points and skill points which give you access to new abilities or enhance what you have. Skill Points serve only one function, they give you access to better gear. They don't scale up your abilities, just give you access to gear and are probably misnamed. They should be called gear points.There's a lot to be said that I don't like about the game, and a lot to be said that I do like. Unfortunately the good stuff, is  over-shadowed by the stuff that really irritates me. This game is an MMO, but you rarely see people. You rarely hear any chatter on the channels. I know they are out there because I have had 2-3 conversations in the nearly 40 hours I've played. Unlike other games I have had no unsolicited requests to join anyone's guild/cabal, I haven't even seen anyone promoting their guild/cabal. Soooo that being said, it's an MMO that has a lot of SOLO instances and a lot of content that can be done solo.Travel between zones is just stupid. There is this place called Agartha in which you can travel from one zone to another. But since the ONLY mailbox in the game is in london, even if you teleport back to Agartha you are still 2 cut screens from that mailbox. There is no way of setting a return point and jumping back to your home city, or to the city of your choice. YOU HAVE TO GO TO AGARTHA, which only slows down the whole travel experience and makes it a bothersome chore instead of a quick hop.Would I recommend this? Perhaps. If you don't mind a steep learning curve, an overly complex crafting system, and an MMO that doesn't have a lot of people, come on down! This is one of those games that you love and hate at the same time. I would love to see the devs beaten to a pulp for some of their substantially stupid decisions, but yet I still play.One thing this game has going for it, is that PvP is tightly controlled. No one is going to gank you and camp your corpse UNLESS you enter their pvp areas. And is a major plus in my book.EDITED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING.Once you hit the Tokyo expansion the game goes into nickel and dime mode where you end up having to buy extra quest packs to get stuff done. Additionally they impose a fundamental change to game play that turned me away from the game entirely. Suddenly you had this shield thingie that needed to be correct for every fight, but the controls were bulky and awkward. When I complained about it, I was told to install a 3rd party program that took care of that problem. Excuse me? Fix the problem and you won't need to rely on a 3rd party addon.In any event I gave up then, 300 plus hours of game play and I couldn't see a reason to continue. There aren't enough people playing this game for the social aspect to kick in, and the constant buying of quest packs became really annoying.			"

The community is really nice and more mature than in most other MMOs and this is also a great added value to the game. New contents are regularly added which keep the game rich and surprising. Definitively one of my favorite games. The only disapointing point is that the addons are always in english while the rest of the game is in french for me. It would be nice to release the addons in french or at least with french subtitles.			"

												I have many things to say for this game:I bought it October last year, and I played probably 8 hours of it. My initial thought of it was ""Waste of £20""There's stuff this game does right, and it's own unique aspects;General Creepiness: 8/10 Running around this dark forests by yourself you'll notice goosebumps on your arms.Combat: 5/10 The combat is overused in the society of MMO's and is just super awkward, nothing spectacular. But it feels okay after a while.Solo'ing: 8/10 I don't have a clue of what being in a group is like in TSW, but I never truly feel bored or ""lonely"" and I can say: If your smart, you'll survive.PVP: Never tried it, I have no care for killing other people as it is, but from the way the combat feels I can't say it would be that good.Presentation: 6/10 The whole ""Three Factions, No Classes, No armour, No levels, horror"" appeals to a gamer like myself. Usually classes in games don't balance out that well. Some classes feel super strong while others hang off to the side like bones on your plate. So in most/all MMO's your a pile of nothing in a barram wasteland of 3 million players. While that's probably also the case in TSW, it's your abilities that make you strong, not that your a level 80 Assassin with a seemingly overpowered pair of daggers. Story: 5/10 While the story is pretty decent, a lot of it feels stereotypical. Some ideas are new, and some make you yawn. The whole ""Your a normal boring human being UNTIL!! a magical bee floats into your mouth. And now your a speechless lunatic who's going to save the world from a bunch of egotestical (That mispelling is on purpose, there's a lot of 18+ stuff in the story *cough* Dragon introduction *cough*) knuckleheads who only want power and to rule over all the other countries that are soooo far apart from one another"" makes me want to whack Funcom with a large frying pan like an old batty grandmother. Overall: 7/10 if you have a spare sum of cash, and your looking for a mmo to spend it on, and you like being wigged out a little and generally just being incredibly amused then this is a game you should get. Research the game before you get it. ~			"

												Been playing this since BETA off and on. Let's keep this quick...The depth of missions is great. Any game where you have a built int browser for mission research is excellent to me. The variety, the graphics, the theme, all top notch. However, solo at the upper levels is possible, but very thin on content. Groups for PVP and nightmare level raids/dungeons is really the optimal way to play. And it takes some dedication to get involved in all that.Even with that, which only some might consider a drawback, this game is well worth your time.			"

												I'm not a big fan of leaving reviews or comments when it comes to anything but in this case its not an option. I've had the game more or less 5 months now and I'm already in The city of the sun god, deleting a couple characters over time and finding one I'm happy with ( Because I do that with my MMORPG's, bad habit I guess ) I ended up being a Templar. I've clocked nearly 300 hours in total to this point and these two weeks alone I've put 70 hours in.I have no regrets about this game at all and the only criticism I have for the game is that solo play is a pain ( But it is a multi player game so they can have that one off ) and that can just be resolved by some extra missions.If you are considering buying this game just make sure you have the time to put in because it sure is addictive.Its probably bad to say this, but this is the game I've spent my life searching for.

												Yes! but with caution! Great game in terms of story. The gameplay is pretty standard in a sense but it does have some interesting features and building up energy to use skills as opposed to the standard ""mana bar"". A very good change if you want a break from the high fantasy or Scifi mmos. However, make sure your system can run this game. My computer can run the game on the minimum specs and it has problems so make sure you have a very strong computer before purcahsing. I can run mmos such as Guild Wars 2, any free to play mmo, Diablo 3, etc... just fine but this game really pushes my computer to it's limits.Some parts can be frustrating such as the stealth missions but they add a new flavor to the game which most mmos don't tap into.

												TSW now works off the GW2 model; cash shop for consumables, dressup dolls, and new content, but no subscription needed.This is basically X-Files:The MMO. Pick one of three secret societies, and play a pleb who woke up one day to realize they had superpowers and that literally every conspiracy theory and paranormal thing ever is real.Combat is fun and semi-active; sort of proto-GW2. I'd explain the class system but that'd take pages. There's a big learning curve here and it's really easy to ♥♥♥♥ up and make a character who can't solo some content. It's worth the time investment though. There's stealth missions, combat, investigation missions that will require actual investigation and thought, lots of voice acting, and if you play Illuminati a lot of great humor.Lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥to download, but worth the try.

It's unique and fun to combine unconventional weapons with tried-and-true RPG concepts. (Fascinating Ability Wheel to conquer)-Experience from quests is unlimited: you can repeat a quest each day-No leveling system, just faction ranking and abilities + skills earned-More mature and friendly community-A LOT OF FUN.

												Pro points:Great game, great ambiance, nice community, great dungeon, varied quests. B2P, so no monthly fee.The tutorial is a bit light so do not hesitate to ask people for more information in game.Also do not ragequit because of the infamous investigation missions (Green mission icon), as even if they bring a nice change in mmo (you need to think, look for info on the net, and solve riddle), they are not mandatory to go on. At worst, you can get solution on the net, as these missions can bring nice background information for you to understand better the story or the land.Minus:To be frank, the game Editor does not have so much money, so update are (very) slow.However, for less than 30$/€ (I do not know the current price), you can already have fun for hundreds of hours.After that, if you like the game, you can buy the extensions/missions pack. They are usually quite nice, but can be considered a bit ""expensive"" (around 10$/€ each)  compared to their size. But if you played a few hundred hours for less than 30€, you can give a bit more to participate ,) "

												If you like the genre of horror-occult-action, you will like this game. The worlds are vast and exploration is the best part of the game. Biggest downside is that it's very grindy. You might have to spend a few hours in the same place and replay several missions so that you can tackle missions in a nearby realm. The repetitiveness saps all the fun out of the game. The system for making runes and items can be confusing, and really is just needless. I'd rather collect rare items than collect 100 items to make a rare item I don't want. There are rare item drops too, but usually, you will have to trade or collect to get what you want. Nice character customization system. Enough clothing options to keep you grinding for the cool stuff, but once you get rich enough, there is nothing left to get. It can get confusing to level your character ""correctly"" because there are so many powers you can get and you may never know what the best build and attacks are to make unless you read a ton of forum posts about it.The holiday special missions are awesome, but you usually need a high level character or group to do them. Despite all the downsides, why is this a good game? The stories, atmosphere, and creatures.			"

												Just to make it clear, DO NOT believe all the negative feedback all over the internet about this game, 90% of it are from whiney BETA players and the other 10% trolls who never actually played the game at all. TSW is about surviving regional folklore in real places which tie a grand, well written story together. This is not a grindfest or a race for levels as there are no levels. Players have everything available to them. over 500 different skills and abilities and the developers are adding more. The combat is fluid and easy to get used too, but hard to master. Unlike most MMO games, in TSW you cant just walk up on your enemy and expect victory by simply button mashing skills. The Story is well written, every npc has a voice and a personality relevant to the area they are in. Quests are not ""fetch this for a reward"". Expect to use the in game browser to find answers to questions you never thought to ask. The crafting system is addictive and intelligent.			"

												This is a must play MMO for anyone that is a fan of RPG's and looking for something very different in the MMO space. I'm unsure how a game like this came to be, for the budget worked with when compared to much large developers and the content presented is stunning. The cinematography during quest pick-ups and the overall writing and characterizations are on par with great single player experiences and very reminscent of the GTA series. The characters are funny, interesting, a tad over the top, and above all else, memorable. There is a lot to do here in game, and the skill system is the best deck building MMO I've seen. They took chances with this game, and sadly that means it has only found a niche market, but at least they commited with being original and complex. I'm never bored playing this game, and after 60 hours, I'm just getting out of the first major area because I refuse to leave until I've done every available questline in the area. I have to see every NPC's story all the way through, and I've never been captured by an MMO like that outside of Star Wars, and unlike that game, TSW is complex and interesting in its game design and quest design as well.

												You're thinking ""Another momurpugur? WoW already finished that genre"", but you are so wrong. It's not actually a momurpugur at all, it's a MMO-Point and Click-Adventure game (MMOPaCAG). Mopackagee. The main draw isn't to level up since there aren't classes and everyone can max every skill at once eventually, but the sweet quests, dialogue, voice acting and lore. My absolute favorites are the Investigation quests where you often have to consult blogs and websites on the internet for clues and information that you need to progress. And these things are HARD, like 90s adventure game hard. We're talking comparing ISBN-13 numbers on a person's favorite books to figure out his key code hard.If you're into self-flagellation via meticulous clue scouring and crazy connections, this is your game. Also if you're into urban myths, ancient horrors, Lovecraft, Poe, conspiracy theories, folklore, and dialogue so riddled with unexplained references to such things that it'd require a dictionary for the uninitiated.

												Smartest game I've ever played. Storyline is thick 'n juicy, and the writing style is everything I look for in a novel. I just love moving about in the world, especially grabbing and reading the incredible Lore. This universe is fleshed out and amazing, the fiction thorough and researched.I can't stop playing it.BTW: I recommend the Illuminati for the sheer fun of the mission reports followed by the mysterious Dragon, where you are made to feel like an important cog in a twelve-dimensional mathematical machine.

												This is a fun MMO with a storyline that just makes you want to play more. Not only that, but the side-quests tend to be just as rich. Though most story missions end up taking place in solo instances, I would still recommend this to players looking for a casual story-driven multiplayer experience.			"

I thought it might be a little tricky to get in to, but even though it's described as non-linear, I do find there is progression, and the story has been fantastic.  If you're into puzzle solving, or working out how to complete quests without the game blantantly giving you the answer, there is tonnes of content here to enjoy!			"

												TSW now works off the GW2 model; cash shop for consumables, dressup dolls, and new content, but no subscription needed.This is basically X-Files:The MMO. Pick one of three secret societies, and play a pleb who woke up one day to realize they had superpowers and that literally every conspiracy theory and paranormal thing ever is real.Combat is fun and semi-active; sort of proto-GW2. I'd explain the class system but that'd take pages. There's a big learning curve here and it's really easy to ♥♥♥♥ up and make a character who can't solo some content. It's worth the time investment though. There's stealth missions, combat, investigation missions that will require actual investigation and thought, lots of voice acting, and if you play Illuminati a lot of great humor.Lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥to download, but worth the try.

												This game is just completely amazing. Doesn't matter which server you play on either, play in one, play with people from others! I havn't found a single player with a bad attitude, and I've been playing almost every single day for the past few months or so. :) There are no levels in this game, you earn what you want. You ""level-up"" your weapon skills and abilities, rather than your character level so say you want to be an Assault rifle user with a secondary of elemental magic, you rank up those, but you will still be lacking on hammer/blade/etc.. Play how you want and have fun! :DIf you like games with a great community, amazing gameplay, and one of the greatest storylines I've seen so far in my time as a gamer, this is the one to play! See you in game! :D			"

												Thanks to great writing, attention to detail, and ingenuity in the field of MMOs, ""The Secret World"" gives life to gaming in a way many companies wouldn't dare attempt.-Writing is very well-done; very ""Twin Peaks,"" and ""X-Files""-Unafraid to delve into the darker areas of humanity and ""morality""-Campy and creepy come together to create horror hilarious and haunting-Genuinely funny characters/dialogue-Great voice-acting-REWARDS THE CEREBRAL; investigation quests give you far more experience than a round of hack-n-slash, (though that's there, too.)-Combat's a bit clunky, but you tend to forgive that flaw. It's unique and fun to combine unconventional weapons with tried-and-true RPG concepts. (Fascinating Ability Wheel to conquer)-Experience from quests is unlimited: you can repeat a quest each day-No leveling system, just faction ranking and abilities + skills earned-More mature and friendly community-A LOT OF FUN.

												I had some heavy doubts on this game. I was a bit surprised by this game, though it doesn't seem to hit certain things right either. It's got a lot of familiar MMO qualities to it, which may make it feel kinda stale after awhile, though for the most part its a bit TOO soloable in some instances. What I really liked though is the lore. If you enjoy Lovecraft, conspiracy theories, and so on... You'll prolly fall in love with this game. The Lore is the strongest point this game has thus far... I hope they can touch up other parts of the game. I havent gotten that far though so who knows. I'm a noob and a lot of things confuse me right now in this game. Also there is no sub fee required now.			"

												This is a very different approach to MMOs, and I heartily approve of the directions in which it's dared to be different. Some missions are investigative in nature, requiring a good deal of research on cryptic clues. And combat? Forget burning some blue bar to expend your more powerful skills: abilities are divided into generators and consumers. The weak ones produce resources (up to 5), and the stronger ones consume them, giving fights a tactical ebb and flow.			"

												I'm an avid fan of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, zombies, and all things that go bump, and I was immediately drawn to The Secret World because of the obvious influence the horror genre has had on its sensibilities. I'd never played any MMORG's before TSW but that didn't hinder me from immediately becoming immersed into its elaborate world.The game proper begins in Kingsmouth, Maine, an isolated community on Solomon Island (although one can travel to any map from here provided they know the way). Once idyllic, this Arkham inspired New England town is now overrun by zombies, sea monsters, and cosmic horrors. The few remaining holdouts provide the lion's share of the quests available on the island, though there are plenty scattered throughout. The individual quest lines conjoin to build an encompassing island narrative of what went wrong in their community, and there is so much that did. Solomon Island is a haunted, insane place, and I've greatly enjoyed uncovering its' secrets.The strong emphasis on story telling and NPC personality really shines in TSW and the voice acting is always top notch. One of my favorites is Hayden Montag, played by Jeffery Combs, who you may recognize for portraying Herbert West in the cult horror film series Re-Animator (Re-Animator was based on H.P. Lovecraft's famous novel). Many of the characters are very aware of common horror tropes, and will casually refer to them in a very self aware, wink to the audience, breaking the fourth wall kind of way that I find incredibly endearing. This is one game where I really pay attention to what every character has to say; every single idiosyncratic word.I am also very pleased by how much TSW plays like a dedicated adventure / survival horror PC game. There are the riddles, puzzles, and the exploration familiar to adventure gamers and they are all intelligently designed and well presented, many of them requiring research, for example, into Latin, Morse code, Medieval history, even musical composition. If you take the time to figure out things on your own, you can actually learn a lot!Having never really played any on-line cooperative games before, I really wanted more of a solo gaming experience going at my own pace, instead of a group one just running around from one checkpoint to the next, but with the option of testing the waters of team play once I had some time under my belt. So far I have been able to do exactly that. None of the initial missions are too difficult to be done alone, and once most quests for one map are completed my character was well developed enough to go on alone to the next map. There are missions that are impossible to be done single-handed, but nothing that would hinder the player from progressing from area to area and going back later with a group for the rest. And missions that were first done in a group can always be replayed solo - after a cooling off period - if you are so inclined.The Secret World is huge. At the time of this review there are maps in Maine, New York City, Seoul, Transylvania, Egypt, London, one in Tokyo being released soon, and more, with many locations having multiple maps themselves. They are constantly expanding their universe and it is safe to say there is enough content to last for months or years. I've played for about 60 hours so far and I haven't even made it out of New England yet!The game does have its annoyances, but most can be resolved during the learning curve. Read the stickies in the Newcomer forum on The Secret World message board as they can cut that curve in half. http://forums.thesecretworld.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6 My only major complaint about the gameplay is that when sticking to the same weapons, which you must do in order to level them up, the fighting can get very repetitive.I have thoroughly enjoyed The Secret World. It's fun, imaginative, ambitious and unpredictable. Now that it's gone free to play (no monthly subscription) I highly recommend it to anyone who loves adventure games, horror stories, or role playing. In The Secret World, death is just the beginning.			"

												Fun game, with lots of flexibility for playstyle. your gear has no effect on your appearance, and you can look however you want- although some of the clothing choices need acheivements to unlock, while other outfits can cost a half-million in-game currency to buy from the vendors. still others would need real money, but its a valid approach to monetizing a game. the monetezation of this game is done reasonably well, and you only really have to pay for content (new missions), of which only issue #9 is what i would consider mandatory for play in the long run. the game also gives you enough bonus points to get one of the issues for free (you should get #9 the black signal). most of the other choices for spending money are vanity (clothes, pets, ect) or mid-game equipment. there is a lot of mechanics from WOW that are very visible in this game, mainly in how groups work with loot rolls, and running back to your corpse. on the upside, you only take 10% equipment damage per death, and some types of death dont count for this. downsides to the game- the UI is kind of crap, a lot of features are counterintuitive, and the later zones have lower quality research missions compared to the newbie zone. there is too much platforming in some parts of the game- some quests mandate being able to make a tricky jump just so, without falling. some boss fights use cheap tactics where you must do X or else you die. also some bugs cause the game to crash, and sometimes the servers will DC you for no reason. overall a good game with a few bugs. its 2 years old now, with a decent community if you look for it. once you reach the end of the issue 9 storyline it gets a bit grindy for gear, but this should take over 200 hours of play to reach. and best of all? you can join a group with anyone, regardless of server or faction.

												I have many things to say for this game:I bought it October last year, and I played probably 8 hours of it. My initial thought of it was ""Waste of £20""There's stuff this game does right, and it's own unique aspects;General Creepiness: 8/10 Running around this dark forests by yourself you'll notice goosebumps on your arms.Combat: 5/10 The combat is overused in the society of MMO's and is just super awkward, nothing spectacular. But it feels okay after a while.Solo'ing: 8/10 I don't have a clue of what being in a group is like in TSW, but I never truly feel bored or ""lonely"" and I can say: If your smart, you'll survive.PVP: Never tried it, I have no care for killing other people as it is, but from the way the combat feels I can't say it would be that good.Presentation: 6/10 The whole ""Three Factions, No Classes, No armour, No levels, horror"" appeals to a gamer like myself. Usually classes in games don't balance out that well. Some classes feel super strong while others hang off to the side like bones on your plate. So in most/all MMO's your a pile of nothing in a barram wasteland of 3 million players. While that's probably also the case in TSW, it's your abilities that make you strong, not that your a level 80 Assassin with a seemingly overpowered pair of daggers. Story: 5/10 While the story is pretty decent, a lot of it feels stereotypical. Some ideas are new, and some make you yawn. The whole ""Your a normal boring human being UNTIL!! a magical bee floats into your mouth. And now your a speechless lunatic who's going to save the world from a bunch of egotestical (That mispelling is on purpose, there's a lot of 18+ stuff in the story *cough* Dragon introduction *cough*) knuckleheads who only want power and to rule over all the other countries that are soooo far apart from one another"" makes me want to whack Funcom with a large frying pan like an old batty grandmother. Overall: 7/10 if you have a spare sum of cash, and your looking for a mmo to spend it on, and you like being wigged out a little and generally just being incredibly amused then this is a game you should get. Research the game before you get it. ~			"

Its reminiscent of Ultima Online/Matric Online and Champions Online although none of these MMOs are hugely successful compared to some of the titans today.. they where all ground breaking.

The crafting system is simple, but suprisingly interesting and fun.Interface could use some work though. Trying to click items will frustrate you; just keep thinking about the positives really....I wish you could freely attack enemies while still being able to target instead strictly targeting.Overall amazing and I'm going to be playing this game for a long time.

												I have played MMO after MMO over the past 10 years. I was a diehard wow-head for much of that time. That being said, I've tried everything from EVE to Everquest. I had even previously tried The Secret World when it first came out and, for whatever reason, I just didn't buy into it. Fast forward to 2015. I had just given up playing wow for the third time this year, I was looking for something easy to get into but complex with a rich world full of adventure. I remember trying this game when it first came out and I remember never truly hating it. I noticed that the price was $30 bucks so I bought it.... let me tell you now, I do not regret it one bit. In fact, I converted my wife and friends from being wow-heads to being addicted to TSW. That's not to say that Wow and TSW are similar. They have a thing or two that are alike but the games are super different.In a nutshell: If you like vampires, werewolves, ghosts, ZOMBIES and all things that dwell in that kind of world of horror mixed with HEAVY theorycrafting (I HATED the fact that Blizzard removed talent trees from wow!) then this game is for you!!!! BUY IT!			"

												Basically if you liked X-Files, Guild Wars 1, and City of Heroes (or 2 out of 3), then have i got a game for you... 4.5/5.0, one of my favorite games.PRO's:-Skill-based combat, challenging skills test your limits.-Challenging missions of all flavors, from intellectual puzzles like no other mmo, to some really crazy scenarios.-Some of the most unique and epic story quests and monsters I have ever seen.-No subscription, paid expansions.CON's:-MMO's are MMO's. Still grindy and require more time than ideal to handle higher level content.-Some missions require internet googling, and indeed are designed for that purpose, which is offputting at times.-Frustrating, but in a good way. And sometimes bad.-Some content is solo only.			"

												This has to be one of THE best mmos I have played to date. The world Is amazing, as Is the content. The missions are diverse. You have your normal standard missions, go here and do this for me...But there's non of that go here kill 15 ants, come back hand in, to then get told, oh I need another 50 killing! Once you complete a mission you get a pop up box, job's done. Then there's stealth missions, obviously the aim there is to not actually kill anything, or be seen while doing them...tricky, but fun! Then, in my opinion...The best ones, investigation missions, where you will need to dig deeper into all the information you're given and use the games, in game browser to solve mysteries and puzzles.Because it's not your average, power level blast to end content mmo...By bashing everything in site, and does require some in depth thinking, the player base is quite mature and extremly plesent!

												I love this game! Funcom unlocks a whole new world of mmorpg's with it's unique style of completely custom class creation. With over 500 Active and passive abilities assorted through an array of weapon's the possibilities are endless. And passive abilities can be used with any weapon's no matter which ability tree they are listed under. The grind is exactly that though, a GRIND. However, having the highest ability in a skill tree doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. Lower leveled and geared players should be totally capable of holding their own in PVE. Finding groups is not an issue. Cabals/Guilds are prominent and PUGs are easy to create and find. Running dungeons is difficult at first due to the fact that skill is based largely on gear ranking you're likely to run into a few elitists that wont play with lower geared players, despite the fact that helping those players would only serve to create more higher geared players they desire to play with. But with the command /chat join noobmares you open yourself to a world of players on equal footing with yourself looking to grind their way to the top. I recommend this game to everyone and only suggest that more people choose to tank at first as the game is largely overpopulated with DPS characters and underpopulated with tanks and healers. This choice would only serve to allow you to level up considerably faster than myself as I find trouble grouping up as a character that can only DPS as of now.			"

It's a very difficult title to review. The story is great, maybe the best ever in an MMO, but really, it becomes very tedious.

												I suppose my playtime may indicate quickly if I am going to recommend this game or not... I defintiely am.  I bought it back when the Steam Massive Edition was on sale but currently with the Ultimate Edition at discount, there is absolutely positively no questions asked better time to start playing this game.Why would you play TSW?  Great community, intresting setting, complex puzzles, deep storylines, and much more.  Playing as one of the three factions (Illuminati, Dragon, and Templar) of the secret societies that covertly control the world through agents that... no, I won't spoil anything.  Some of the storyline is straight from a David Lynch fever dream.  Heck, even the TSW Support is incredible, anytime I had to put in a ticket it was always resolved in 15 minutes or less.  There are a few things that I wish they did better but it swiftly becomes overshadowed by the rich atmosphere this game exudes.Hope to see you in game.			"

												Only the NWO could concoct a plan as devious as creating a classless, atmospheric, story-driven MMORPG set in the present day and pull it off this well. The Secret World is a... that thing I just described, with a fascinating occult horror/urban dark fantasy setting that's basically Call of Cthulhu or World of Darkness with more firepower. It's a world where all urban legends are true, H.P. Lovecraft wrote nonfiction and the Illuminati are not only real but protecting us from a greater threat. There aren't many players but you can also approach it as a really hard, mostly single-player open world game where you occasionally run into other survivors who you can go around killing zombies with for a while. Expect mad ARG puzzles and some degree of confusion. It's kinda inaccessible (I still feel pretty clueless) but something of a marvel when it comes to worldbuilding, storytelling and quest design (oh lord the quest design). Give it a try if the aesthetic appeals to you.			"

												Combine a great skill/ability system, fun character outfit customization, amazing atmosphere and probably the best writing in an MMO to day and you have The Secret World. Choose between the Illuminati, Templar and Dragon factions and begin your journey into the world of monsters and conspiracies. The game's lore is based entirely off of real world myths and legends that provide a familiar yet gripping story. The combat is relatively standard MMO fare but that is more than made up for with the fantastic locales and genuinely engaging story. Each quest (called missions) is fully voice acted and accompanied with a small cut-scene and the characters strewn throughout the game are fun to interact with and listen to. The best part is that its a pay-once-to-play game, very much like Guild Wars 2, and doesn't lock you out of content if you aren't a subscriber (there are small paid expansions that are pretty much self contained stories but they aren't expensive). If you're in the mood for a great atmospheric, and often times challenging game (the investigation missions are particularly difficult in a very fun way) then The Secret World is worth your attention.

												The Secret World is a flawed gem. It is, however, the best MMO I have ever played, in my opinion. The balance between the solo aspects of play and the cooperative challenges is a very subjective thing in MMOs, and for me TSW hits it just right. Story-wise, it is enthralling, misterious, chock-full of dark humor and goosebump-inducing scenes. It is a true delight unveiling the obscure snippets of lore scattered throughout the world, not to mention the great mission story-arcs, given life by generally excellent voice acting and writing. The only game I can liken the solo TSW experience to is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. And that is truly high praise. Overall, the main strength of TSW is the narrative, followed closely by the tremendous freedom and versatility awarded by the classless (and peerless) ability system. It truly forges a powerful bond between player and character to be able to switch roles when needed in an MMO context. No need for alts here - one character, properly developed and geared, can handle any situation. It's wonderful.I could go on for hours on minutia, but I must say that the flaws of the game are truly unfortunate... TSW is poorly optimized and resource-hungry. This is by far most evident in PvP, where even on medium-low settings, a pretty good computer (i7, 8 GB RAM, 2 GB Video-RAM) will often yield under 25 frames/second, sometimes to such an extent as to make PvP unplayable. These problems are hugely exaggerated during special events, where Funcom's philosophy is to unleash enormous world bosses, needing over 100 players to defeat. It is not fun having to basically hack the game and disable a myriad graphic effects and functions, only to render the world bosses barely playable. The difficulty curve can be regarded as pretty steep, but the effort is well-worth it. Just a warning.I don't wish to speculate too much on the direction Funcom is taking the Issues (expansions to the original content and mechanics), but so far it doesn't seem that they're on a very good vector, simply because they're focusing a lot more on mechanics tweaks and aditions, while somewhat neglecting the main attraction TSW has to offer - immersion and narrative. It feels as if the game is becoming less of an MMO-RPG, and more a complex tactical and number-crunching grindfest. This is probably my main concern with TSW at the moment, but that's still not enough to keep me away.Give it a shot, it's truly in a leage of its own and a singular experience. For me, the pluses were enough to drown out the drawbacks.			"

												Have really enjoyed this, If you're looking for something a bit different from your standard mmo's this might be up your alley. Most quests feel fleshed out and significant, Npc's with real character. However the game can be a bit more on the difficult side with quests that make you think and some rough enemies if you dont pay attention, so may not be for all.			"

												It's the most niche MMO I've ever played. If you love adventure games, horror and intricate plots then get this. It's fairly expensive and it does require a monthly fee and a beefy rig to run it (This game on DX11 is arguably one of the prettiest games out there). The combat and PVP are not that good but the plot and atmosphere compensate it.One warning though, it does require a lot of logic, knowledge of everything related to horror, knowledge of history, the fricking bible, art, even music notes are used in one quest. I have to admit that while some of the quests are pretty hard and even though you might get stumped... at least the game comes with a browser to search for clues (The developers even created websites for some of the quests) or to google the answer if you are really stuck.

												Its a nice mutiplayer that is open to adventure. It has many weapons and differnet was to player your character. The classes are what you want them to be. Their are no set classes like a mage that can only use a wand or a rogue that can only use blades. You can run around this giant map with what ever weapons you want and with as many people as you want. I love playing this game.			"

												Fun game, with lots of flexibility for playstyle. your gear has no effect on your appearance, and you can look however you want- although some of the clothing choices need acheivements to unlock, while other outfits can cost a half-million in-game currency to buy from the vendors. still others would need real money, but its a valid approach to monetizing a game. the monetezation of this game is done reasonably well, and you only really have to pay for content (new missions), of which only issue #9 is what i would consider mandatory for play in the long run. the game also gives you enough bonus points to get one of the issues for free (you should get #9 the black signal). most of the other choices for spending money are vanity (clothes, pets, ect) or mid-game equipment. there is a lot of mechanics from WOW that are very visible in this game, mainly in how groups work with loot rolls, and running back to your corpse. on the upside, you only take 10% equipment damage per death, and some types of death dont count for this. downsides to the game- the UI is kind of crap, a lot of features are counterintuitive, and the later zones have lower quality research missions compared to the newbie zone. there is too much platforming in some parts of the game- some quests mandate being able to make a tricky jump just so, without falling. some boss fights use cheap tactics where you must do X or else you die. also some bugs cause the game to crash, and sometimes the servers will DC you for no reason. overall a good game with a few bugs. its 2 years old now, with a decent community if you look for it. once you reach the end of the issue 9 storyline it gets a bit grindy for gear, but this should take over 200 hours of play to reach. and best of all? you can join a group with anyone, regardless of server or faction.

												This game will forever stick out as one of my most favorite MMORPGs. It has the one of the most immersive story and environment that I have seen in an MMORPG. Everything is very hand crafted from the stories involved and each quest that you do. The voice acting is done on every single thing amazingly, sparing no loss of quality across the board. One of the things I especially like in this game is the quest system which doesn't use the typical go to x and or kill x. There are many different types of quest that are very intricate some of which will require you to really think outside the box and solve puzzles. Others rely on your stealth and the rest requires a good skill set. Of which, the skill system in this game is extremely fluid and offers a true multi-class system like never before. This game is especially fun when played with a friend.			"

												Honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time.  No restrictions to 1 class, freedom to mix and match as you wish since theres no actual character level but theres skill levels for talisman and weapons.  This game could be confusing at first but once you understand it, its a feeling of satisfaction cause I can tell you now, this isn't your normal MMORPG.  If you're not up for a challenge then i doubt this games for you but if you're ready for a different experience then The Secret World is what you been looking for.  On a side note, TSW has a Pretty helpful community thats very Noob Friendly.  Questions in general chat will ususally get helpful answers from TSW vets.  Good luck out there and have fun.			"

Do you want to fight these enemy's or just run past them? Do you just want to nopethe♥♥♥♥ out because you THINK you're going to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥wrecked? On top of how dynamic the game play itself feels it's made even better by the class system. What is the class system? Whatever you want it to be. There are no true levels in The Secret World and it's done perfectly. All the gear you could or would use has it's efficiency or even whether you can use it or not by how many points you put towards that specific type of gear. Abilities? You can pick essentially any one of them you want. Granted there are some setbacks to the more powerful things, but getting the points to get to those doesn't even begin to feel tedious.Overall 10/10			"

												Ok this game is quite uniqie never in a mmo have i had to do so much thinking, research into history, people & places just to compleate a research quest O.o there are other types that are more standard like: go kill this thing! lol, but games really good, story driven with voice acted cutscenes plays alot more like a co-op singleplayer rpg than what you'd expect from an mmo. the areas are large to explore & loads of side quests & missions everyware (you actually have to come acrossthemin the wilderness like... you find a dead body with its guts eaten out & a blood trail go track downclues to what could have done this etc.... or you come across an abandoned police car with ammo in the trunk but no officers in sight so run the supplys to the police holding the town and so fourth.Watch some lets play vids on youtube b4 u think about getting this to see if it's somthing you'd like but id reccomend it, i mean a dedicated horror mmo in modern day setting kinda sets it apart from the others out there. also if ure worried abt the store page on the site, i assure you it's either all cosmetic items or boost stuff, not anything u need to play the game past a certain point or anything so no worries! :)			"

												The investigation missions are unlike anything I've played in a videogame before or since, and make it worth trying the game alone. Literacy and attention to detail (and google) are your friends here. Story is engaging, and dialogue and VO's are actually good, which is a first in an MMO in my experience. The setting is sort of a cross between HP Lovecraft, White Wolf games and the Illuminati card game by Steve Jackson, so the game doesn't lack for style either. The rest of the game is more-or-less standard MMO fair, sadly. Controls are stiff, combat is lackluster, grinding is an issue, and not to mention the god-damn cash shop nonsense you seem to see in every multiplayer game these days. But hey, no monthly scrip, so that's something.If this were a single player A-RPG with a more fluid and engaging combat system, it would be one of the greatest games of all time. As it stands it's still pretty decent. Recommended to conspiracy theorists, mystery/horror buffs and fans of the MMO genre.			"

												Had to give this one some time. Graphics arent bad, gameplay is similar to WoW, but with more of a focus on gunplay than fairys and trolls, and least so far. Second character now, making more sense. Interesting story, really like the world tree concept, opens it up for a lot. First major mission- Zombies. Overall if you are looking for an MMO but dont like fantasy, Id say give this a try. Nighttime player base seems to be fairly decent. There doesnt seem to be anyone on at other times, almost playerless. This game is a grinder, though, no doubt about that. Not much for instruction on crafting and stores dont seem to sell anything worth buying.			"

												Secret World is a great MMO with a lot of content to explore.  It has a definitive feel to it unlike any other mmo on the market with challenging and engaging quest lines.The combat system is easy enough to figure out and has a rotation system similar to most mmos.  The versatile skill tree allows for you to ""eventually"" branch into every weapon style available.  While allowing for this versatility from the beginning can seem very beneficial it is not something you want to dabble a couple here and there with.  I recommend following a pre-designed path and adhering to it for content quest purposes.  Although they are continuing to work on the pvp scene, I find the battlefield clunky and really wish they had set this down as a more traditional pvp field seen in other popular mmos.  The few encounters I ran in it just seemed unfilling to my taste, but everyone should try it out as it may be the style they like.Of the few dungeons I ran it was in my opinion that ranged dps was the most effective after healer/tank.  Melee dps just got aoe'd or engaged way too much to be effective as constantly having to kite out of the way or avoid damage deterred the ability to distribute dps effectively.  However, maybe a ranged/melee hybrid would be effective here and that is very possible in the flexibility granted in your skill tree.If you can hold out to buy the main content on sale I would do that, but it is even worth the full sticker price since this is essentially a buy the game you get the mmo no strings attached situation like guild wars.    A lot of reviews will cover everything I just said but not many mention the fact that older gen computers will struggle to run this game.  I rarely find games where the FPS fall below 30 for me, but in this one(on my normal settings) it initially ran at an unplayable 8 FPS until I adjusted down.  My computer isn't old or brand new but a decent gaming machine purchased two years ago.  Like any games you have this trouble with, just lowering the settings will allow you to find a comfortable fps to play at but I imagine any PC four-five years old or more will find this game a nightmare to run so invest in the game wisely.Storyline gets a 9/10Gameplay 8/10PVP 5/10Dungeons/Raids 7/10			"

What sets it apart from others is it makes you use your brain, a rarity in most games, nevermind MMOs. I've had to brush up on mythological information, learn a bit of Morse Code, dabble in cartography, and so on, just to solve the riddles in some quests. To this day, there is no other game that's done that for me. Thanks TSW, for being the best MMO I've played.			"

												You can read any number of reviews that will give you insight into the settings, gameplay, etc.  I recommend the game, but with one caveat - combat is laborious.  Each fight feels more like a war of attrition rather than a visceral experience.  And that's going one-on-one.  If another monster wades into the fight, then it's pretty close to 'game over'.  In fact, it is the somewhat tedious combat that caused me to stop playing.  There's only so much grindy combat a guy can take before his mind starts wandering.			"

												Not your usual MMO, TSW is conspiracy theories and horror tales rolled up into a hot mess and tosses you right into the center of it. The quests and missions require some critical thinking, the stories are engaging and the voice acting is superb. Content is King and The Secret World seems to have plenty of it. Pros:- Engaging story- Interesting game mechanics- No GRIND... none unless you want to of course- Interesting quests and missions that break the mold of the ""usual"" kill quests - Some very engaging level design- Strong Character Customization Capabilities- Horizontal Growth rather than Vertical so you don't outlevel your friends. Have uber gear? You can still join them and fight alongside each otherCons:[update after weeks of playing]- The new Aegis system of shields and attacks introduces a new game mechanic in the last DLC. Currently the Aegis system is not available if you have not bought the DLC so it limits those players from advancing this mechanic which will be used in all future DLC.-Introducing a new mechanic like Aegis is awkward and personally I hate it. It suddendly changes gameplay and you find yourself having to learn a new mechanic on top of all the power changes- The end game has turned into a gear grind. To me gear grinds are the laziest form of game design since they basically are a way to make people have to work harder just to enjoy new content there by increasing the shelf life of said content... - (And this is sort of a big one. It almost made me not even try the game and I am very patient)Just to get this game registered and to create an account took over 2 hours. That may should like an exaggeration however it isn't. In order to play the game you have to first create an account on Funcom, the page refreshes at each step to create an account is anywhere between 3-10 minutes each and your account name must be unique so the chances of doing multiple refreshes is great. Then, after creating the Funcom account you must actually create a game account but this is not obvious. You see a place to enter a key to ""register"" it. Once you do that, (the refresh this time took over 7 minutes) you must click on this button that says ""Create Account"" with no mention of the game at all, so it is not very clear this needs to be done to play the game. You might think at this point that you are free and home clear... but no. Now you must link the Funcom/game account with Steam... In the end with the confusing and redundant registration, the frustratingly slow refreshes that often timed out, and the horrible support (Live chat put me on hold after taking a lifetime to fire up and eventually I just gave up on that option)I just wanted my money back at this point. What a terrible user experiance. It is a wonder anyone ever actually registers and plays this game. Even if the servers did not take so incredibly long to respond the registration process is tedious and extreme.			"

												I've put more hours into this MMO than any other MMO. The combat takes some getting used to, but it has the best atmosphere of any lovecraftian game I've ever played.The combat system is difficult. It requires you to seriously think about what skills to put onto your bar. What skills you pick will mean the difference between steamrolling through content with zero effort and struggling so hard you rage-quit. I enjoy that the game encourages you to experiement until you find the optimal way to pewpew your way through each area.Anyways, I can't recommend this game enough. My Girlfriend and I spent eons on this game together.			"

												The Secret World is the best MMORPG I've ever played and, quite possibly, one of the best games ever. It's original, clever and engaging. The setting is a breath of fresh air amidst a genre dominated by pseudomedieval fantasy or action sci-fi. The whole idea of secret societies battling classic monsters like zombies, vampires and werewolves, along with more disturbing Lovecraftian monstrosities and mythological creatures is simply awesome. The writing is very good and the game is full of little nods, homages and hidden depths that feel very rewarding when you see them. The gameplay is complex and smooth. TSW is an MMORPG that has no classes in the real sense of the world, instead granting players the freedom to create their own builds according to their own individual styles and preferences. The overall difficulty of the game is challenging, especially if one is used to being coddled and held by the hand like many other MMOs do. Here you have to be very careful of your surroundings and to really know what you're doing - especially in dungeons. The graphics are beautiful, and the overall design of the game is very nice. The style is gritty and realistic, and a lot of the monsters are very memorable. The sounds are solid as well, though the music is somewhat lacking. Overall, TSW is an incredible game, and I think that everyone who loves MMOs and is somewhat tired of the cliches of the genre should give it a try.			"

You could play it alone and still enjoy it or partake in Lairs/Dungeons/Group content. The cash shop is only for aesthetic purposes and XP boosts, no epic gear to be acquired for money.I recommend it especially at the 20$ price mark since you'll get far more than a few hours of enjoyment from it.

												For those of you who don't know too much about my gaming history; I played almost every MMORPG on the market. EQ, EQ2, Asheron's Call, World of Warcraft, Aion, Rift, Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, SWTOR and even as far back as Ultima all on endgame/competetive levels. Never have I been so eager to play a game as The Secret World. This game is definitely worth purchasing now that it's moved from a subscription based model (still available if you want the extra shinies) to a buy to play model like Guild Wars for instance, with less annoying cash shop extras. If I honestly would have known this game was this good I would have been playing it the entire time it was a subscription MMO.The game plays like a classic adventure/mystery game with added in puzzles and non-forgiving combat. That's one of the major perks. I almost died...on the tutorial level. The puzzles range from finding artifacts scattered in the zone to extremely complex music puzzles, multi-language puzzles, and skill jumping puzzles. The 'B' key (open internet browser) built in the game will be your best friend throughout.+ Challenging both mentally and phsyically, but still very fun+ Very good graphics+ Great plotlines/story- Combat can be a little wonky- Running everywhere gets a little tediousOverall: 9/10			"

												The Secret World is one of the best MMOs I have ever played. it'sThe game's main strength is its setting: it's a refreshing change to be able to attack communist vampires with M16s, or fry hordes of 28 Days Later zombies into a crisp with cool fireball powers. Never skip a cutscene, you will miss some of the best dialogue in video gaming, and make sure you collect the lore! The combat mechanics are decent; the fact that your overall level does not corralate directly to your skill level, combined with the fact that classes do not exist in this game (you choose from 9 different weapons, filling out 7 active abilites and 7 passive buffs + wearing 7 pieces of armour) results in you being able to be very flexible.Downside: You have to spam number keys to attack. Quite irritating. Overall, I give this 10/10. Illuminati is genuinely confirmed for this one.			"

												Ok this game is quite uniqie never in a mmo have i had to do so much thinking, research into history, people & places just to compleate a research quest O.o there are other types that are more standard like: go kill this thing! lol, but games really good, story driven with voice acted cutscenes plays alot more like a co-op singleplayer rpg than what you'd expect from an mmo. the areas are large to explore & loads of side quests & missions everyware (you actually have to come acrossthemin the wilderness like... you find a dead body with its guts eaten out & a blood trail go track downclues to what could have done this etc.... or you come across an abandoned police car with ammo in the trunk but no officers in sight so run the supplys to the police holding the town and so fourth.Watch some lets play vids on youtube b4 u think about getting this to see if it's somthing you'd like but id reccomend it, i mean a dedicated horror mmo in modern day setting kinda sets it apart from the others out there. also if ure worried abt the store page on the site, i assure you it's either all cosmetic items or boost stuff, not anything u need to play the game past a certain point or anything so no worries! :)			"

												I've tried a couple of MMO's but I'm a bit hard to please when it comes to MMO's. The Secret World  (TSW) isn't perfect, but it does a couple of things ""right"" (and in my opinion better then other MMO's).AtmosphereThe Secret World is just great when it comes to pull you into a different world.The Non-player-characters (NPC's) in most other games are boring stereotypes with no real life to them. The NPC's in this game feel like real persons. It's also worth noting that is features many strong female characters that are believable and not just ""hot chicks"".Same goes for the story. It's presented in a believable way and (literally !) forces you to think outside the box (which can be difficult at times).Game MechanicsThe combat feels at least a litte more ""active"" then many other MMO's. Most of the time your free to stand around and activate your abilities but at least sometimes it pay's off to evade enemy special attacks. There is surely room for improvemend here, but it's way better then JUST standing around and mashing buttons all of the time.I'm not a big fan of class systems. Especially when there is not much of a difference between two members of the same class. No classes in TSW. Your free to build your fighting style the way you like it using a combination of up to two active styles and all the passive ones you can learn.On the downside there is no character development besides fighting. There are no craft skills for example (anyone can craft anything right from the start).DLC's and the shopYes, there is stuff you can buy for real money which some people may find annoying. What TSW does well about this is that it doesn't rub it in your face all the time and there is a big selection of stuff you can buy with gameworld-coins.The game has enough content to keep you occupied for a while to come without ever touching any DLC's. As for the vanity items (clothing, pets, etc.) there is a big store in the game where you can find a lot of different clothes for in-game-money. So the only thing you might need to buy would be a pet if you have to have one (it does give you any bonus anyways).VerdictMight not be a game for everyone, but of all the MMO's I've seen so far it's the one that fit's my needs best.Edit:PS: Many people noted bugs. I've played it for a while now and I would guess that they got rid of the bugs since I didn't encounter any.			"

The quests actually allow you to find out more about this deeply detailed world and draw you deeper within it.  It's more than just ""kill 5 monsters and bring me their heads"".  I will say that without a guide it can be difficult to build a successful character, but thankfully there's all sorts to be found on the internet.  :D			"

Illuminati and templars are awesome and Funcom has made it so easy to get lost into solving mysteries what sometimes take ages to crack. This game is like a revived but modern version of the old hardcore RPGs which were hard as hell.

												This is great.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the X-Files and perhaps wants a break from their usual MMO.  The community as far as I have seen so far is helpful, although not huge.  It feels rather more like a single player game a lot of the time.  The combat controls are a bit like KOTOR and the game areas a suitably big so that you can get lost in them nicely.  The use of the in game web browser to help you solve investigation-type missions is a really great idea, but it seems to load very slowly, and I found myself just alt-tabbing and googling (not wiki cheats just the clues!).  The puzzles are really excellent and require some genuine thought to solve, and the fighting missions are challenging.			"

												Bought this game a year ago and now I'm back. Damn how I've craved to play this again. The quests are amazing, the storyline is incredible, and some of the puzzles that you need to solve are just brain stomping. This is game made for people 17+ and it shows in it's style. (No nudity, sorry pervs, but some characters are pretty damn sexy) This is exactly how MMORPG's should be for adult gamers. It's perfect in its execution. It's not a game you'll get immediately attached to, but grows on you slowly and innevidable draws you in.The dungeons are amazing, I love them. You can play them when they're difficult, or you can play them when they're easy. You never have to worry about the game being too hard or too easy, it seems to be right inbetween of whatever your style and the style of those around you.Trust me on this, if you're into Dark and Eerie themed games, solving mysteries that make you feel good when you solve them, and/or into games that just overall rule reguardless of their genre, this is the game for you. The game gives you so much control over who you are and can be that it's just one of those games that makes you feel at home, even if you're not.Take my advice, if you're low on money find it on sale and GRABGRABGRAB IT!

												A game with a very solid atmosphere, the Secret World is excellent in building an interesting and captivating world. The quests are some of the best there are and you will definitely find figuring them out a challenge. Building a character is fun and allows for one to be immersed in the many abilities and talents. Combat is the weakest side of the game, and it is unfortunate. The animations don't feel very rewarding and packs of monsters in every areas makes it hard to cumbersome to travel quickly. The quests can also be spoiled if you look them up on the internet, I'd definitely recommend NOT doing that!			"

												Like any MMO... it's still an mmo. There is still grinding and stupid pointless sidequests that just waist your time telling you to do menial tasks.But you can clearly tell that this was made by the people behind The Longest Journey. There is a significant amount of voice acting and it's not there just so that the game may be touted as being ""cinematic"". It's there because the characters are worth it. It's there because the world is beauiful and very unique compared to other MMOs, if only just because it's set in the modern era. Even though there are a lot of quests that are pointless, this is not a Korean MMO, there are not that many quests and I can say that at least 1 in 3 quests are geniunely interesting. And I say interesting not just because of the story given by the flavour text or the dialogue you get when you accept it. Some quests have very different mechanics, an example would be a quest where you hack into a radio anthena and record a transmission that is in morse code. The game afterwards gives you NOTHING to help with that, the only thing that you can do is learn morse code and decode the message yourself, which feels amazing because it's not as easy as you'd think (took me about an hour).As many people have said already this is an MMO for people that don't like to play MMOs. So if you don't usually play MMOs you are probably also suspicious of trying this... because it's an MMO. So you should read some of the community guides written for it and you will get to know what kind of mechanics you'll be dealing with and what you will be spending your time doing in this game.			"

												Okay so this is not going to be a long review or anything. The game is fantastic and i am absolutely loving it. I definetly think it's a game you should try out if  you like mmo's that are heavy on story and mystery etc. It's just lovely.There is just one thing i know that might annoy alot of people including me. Some areas of the game has truely horrific optimization. So for starters. I can play MGS V, Mad Max, Realm reborn and all of these new games on max settings with way over 60 fps constantly. This game on max usually lays around 70-90 fps depending on which areas and how many mobs etc like all mmo's it can change alot. But just some areas of the game is terrible. Let's take for example ""The Blue Mountain"" area. I went in there with a steady 70+ fps at all times. After a few hours however it started to drop from 70-90 to 16-18 fps when i turned in different angels etc. But i thought okay i guess just some areas have poor optimization. Then however.... I went into a cave and as expected in a enclosed small area the fps increases way higher usually. But when i went out of the cave i was now at a constant 16-18 fps and now only in different angles 70-90 fps and then after awhile it was just more or less constantly at 17fps. Tried decreasing settings, did absolutely nothing, still stayed at constant super smoooooth 17 fps. untill i restarted the game. Now everything works 70-90 as usual with small dips to like 30fps 20fps etc at random areas and angles. So far i have only ecountered this terrible optimization of a heavy dose in this area ""The Blue Mountain"" and a very small bit in previous areas. I am not sure how many other areas have it. But i have a feeling there are quite abit more areas like this.Now as i said i love this game and it definetly dosent discourage me in any way from playing it. But i know that some people including me can be extremely annoyed with fps drops for no apperant reasons and poorly optimized games etc.I am not discouraging one from buying this game, i really think you should try it out. I was skeptic for months about this game but then decided to buy it and loved it. Just a friendly pointing out something that might annoy alot of people.(and sorry for my poor english)			"

												Magnificent game. Waiting to get a new graphic card so I can play it a bit more fluidly. The trailer with Bitter Earth... Dinah Washington with Max Richtor on violin. One of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written, in my opinion, brings tears to my eyes consistently and perfectly suits the dark tones of this game.Sincerely can't recommend it highly enough. The fighting and mechanics, exploration of the complex and breathtaking world, character development; masterfully executed. Feels like an MMO for slightly depressed adults; right up my alley, in other words. Get this game. Trust me, you will be glad you did.			"

												I've put more hours into this MMO than any other MMO. The combat takes some getting used to, but it has the best atmosphere of any lovecraftian game I've ever played.The combat system is difficult. It requires you to seriously think about what skills to put onto your bar. What skills you pick will mean the difference between steamrolling through content with zero effort and struggling so hard you rage-quit. I enjoy that the game encourages you to experiement until you find the optimal way to pewpew your way through each area.Anyways, I can't recommend this game enough.

												I have to start by saying I have never been a fan of MMO's. Ive always been most fond of adventure and roleplaying games, typically single player mainly so i could spend hours turning over every rock and opening every door, etc. MMO's just dont normally cater to my idea of a fun game. However, TSW is different. This game is so rich with content and story, it took me by storm. It carried me away like no game has done before. I loved Elder Scrolls series, Ultima series, Fallout series, BioShock series, etc. but TSW takes gaming to a whole new level. Right from the start, you jump into a world of modern realities with fantastical occurences, mythical links and historical tie-ins. The investigations, the manner in which the content actually is written so that you are expected to do research on the internet while ingame is awesome. The combat system is fun, the crafting system is good. The mix of necessary combat, and other times you just have to sneak thru this, the single player adventure storylines amazing, while there is still an awesome mix of multiplayer dungeon adventures that make the game even better. Oh, and not to mention the ingame clans that also end up in pvp and pve scenarios. All I can say is, I think TSW may just be the greatest game ive ever played, and i'll be playing it for years to come, im sure. I have to conclude my review with the one knock i have against it. It doesnt have controller support. The keyboard/mouse layout is abismal. if it were not for XPadder, I wouldnt be able to play it really. But XPadder works nicely, alongside putting the game in ""target"" mode. Give it a free month try out, you'll love it!			"

												This is great.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the X-Files and perhaps wants a break from their usual MMO.  The community as far as I have seen so far is helpful, although not huge.  It feels rather more like a single player game a lot of the time.  The combat controls are a bit like KOTOR and the game areas a suitably big so that you can get lost in them nicely.  The use of the in game web browser to help you solve investigation-type missions is a really great idea, but it seems to load very slowly, and I found myself just alt-tabbing and googling (not wiki cheats just the clues!).  The puzzles are really excellent and require some genuine thought to solve, and the fighting missions are challenging.			"

												It's the most niche MMO I've ever played. If you love adventure games, horror and intricate plots then get this. It's fairly expensive and it does require a monthly fee and a beefy rig to run it (This game on DX11 is arguably one of the prettiest games out there). The combat and PVP are not that good but the plot and atmosphere compensate it.One warning though, it does require a lot of logic, knowledge of everything related to horror, knowledge of history, the fricking bible, art, even music notes are used in one quest. I have to admit that while some of the quests are pretty hard and even though you might get stumped... at least the game comes with a browser to search for clues (The developers even created websites for some of the quests) or to google the answer if you are really stuck.

												Visually impressive with a great storyline. My problem with this is the fact that it's sometimes to hard to complete solo for a casual gamer. Works great if you have a friend with you, but I felt like it was a grind when done solo. Everything else about the game, the storyline, characters, graphics etc is spot-on!			"

												I really like the concept of this game. I didn't know exactly what to expect, but have been plesently surprised by it. After only playing a few hours I am alrady hooked on the much more story and atmosphere centered game play.Took a little while to get use to the interface and terms for mechanics. My only complaint thus far it that the engine feels a little clunky at times. I will update this after some more time in the game.I am so sorry I waited so long to purchase this game and play it.

												First review here on Steam, but for this game, I just can not resist.The Secret World is not your usual MMORPG. It feels like a mix of a shooter with a nice bit of RPG elements (skills/talents) and a really sweet portion of games like Silent Hill when it comes to atmosphere and storytelling (and this is where TSW absolutely shines).The character creation is okay'ish. You don't really get that many options when it comes to face- and bodymorphs, but then again you get quite some clothing options. The models still look nice and the item store offers some sweets for a fair price. Also you get lots of clothing items when progressing with the storyline and with your skills.Graphics - oh well, to be honest when I entered the tutorial I was a bit disappointed. Even for a game that was released in 2012 the tutorial doesn't really make up to what you will get in the later gamestages. I only know Kingsmouth so far, and this place looks awesome, even if there's surely better looking games out there... and that brings us to the next point:Atmosphere: holy cow, together with the story and missions the atmo of TSW is fantastic! It reminds me of my first time playing Resident Evil 1 (yeah, I'm that old :P) or Half Life 1. Back then, these games really gave me the creeps. And TSW also succeedss in doing so. Great job, graphics & sound team!Combat felt a bit clonky for the first minutes, but as soon as you get the hang of it, the game has got the right balance between fast paced and tactics. Not the best I've played so far, but surely not the worst at all.Missions/quests: though you get your typical MMO ""kill x enemies at location z"" quests, most of the missions go far beyond your usual MMO-questing: if you don't pay attention and listen closely (or read the notes you get), you will easily find yourself in a dead end. So my warning to those of you who like their quests served as no-brainer-stuff: play some other game. For those of you who like detective's work and even check historical data, solving puzzles that are not meant for 5-years-olds: welcome to paradise. Personally I like what the devs did there!Skillsystem/Craftingsystem: complex, but not too confusing to not understand it. The game claims you can have all availlable skills maxed if you only play long enough. Can't tell if that's true, but as there seems to be no way to reset skillpoints I kinda believe that. Can't tell you much about crafting, need to get myself into that yet.I only played 25 hours when writing this review, and I can't wait to ramp up more hours in this game. So my thumbs are up, love the game so far and feel bad for not trying it out much earlier (like, in 2012 at release ;) ).Hope this review helps... enjoy your time in a secret world.			"

												It breaks away from the traditional MMO model of get quest X, do quest X, turn in and find next quest giver.   All the little details matter which in other MMOs are often cosmetic, here they can be clues or key pieces of information to solve puzzles.    Highly recommended.   The mood and tone, the atmosphere; drawers you in and you become part of this world, in ways that other MMOs simply fail to do.			"

												Differant than your average MMO. If your looking for kill this and go get this quests, you can do the side quests. If you want a prety desent story, you have you main and story quests. You can do dungeons and raid, their are no set classes that you have to play as, and how strong you are is dependent on your skills and items. The cash shop is also purly cosmetic. Its a great game, but you need a half-way desent computer to play it, because its an MMO, and there can be alot to process.			"

												I suppose my playtime may indicate quickly if I am going to recommend this game or not... I defintiely am.  I bought it back when the Steam Massive Edition was on sale but currently with the Ultimate Edition at discount, there is absolutely positively no questions asked better time to start playing this game.Why would you play TSW?  Great community, intresting setting, complex puzzles, deep storylines, and much more.  Playing as one of the three factions (Illuminati, Dragon, and Templar) of the secret societies that covertly control the world through agents that... no, I won't spoil anything.  Some of the storyline is straight from a David Lynch fever dream.  Heck, even the TSW Support is incredible, anytime I had to put in a ticket it was always resolved in 15 minutes or less.  There are a few things that I wish they did better but it swiftly becomes overshadowed by the rich atmosphere this game exudes.Hope to see you in game.			"

												Only the NWO could concoct a plan as devious as creating a classless, atmospheric, story-driven MMORPG set in the present day and pull it off this well. The Secret World is a... that thing I just described, with a fascinating occult horror/urban dark fantasy setting that's basically Call of Cthulhu or World of Darkness with more firepower. It's a world where all urban legends are true, H.P. Lovecraft wrote nonfiction and the Illuminati are not only real but protecting us from a greater threat. There aren't many players but you can also approach it as a really hard, mostly single-player open world game where you occasionally run into other survivors who you can go around killing zombies with for a while. Expect mad ARG puzzles and some degree of confusion. It's kinda inaccessible (I still feel pretty clueless) but something of a marvel when it comes to worldbuilding, storytelling and quest design (oh lord the quest design). Give it a try if the aesthetic appeals to you.			"

It is a very interesting game, but you need to know that you will need at leat 1 of thse following basic two traits of a common human being, googling and thinking. Yes this game requieres some level of thought because there are a lot of puzzles, which is great but i have seen people that really dislike it.Other than that with my noobishness all that i can say for now is the following:PROs- Great lore, enthrailng, mysterious, and above everything else absolutely immersive.-Great ""quest"" system, the best out there, really im not kidding, at least they have voice acting in every semi-mportant mission, thats a thing-Great ambience, the enemies are quite disturbing sometimes-It will get you hooked, somehow i know it-Innovative design of character progression, which is unrivaled yet, really ive seen people saying its a bad system, that it is no ""MMO"" that is called fear of change.-Good gameplay, really fluid id sayCONs-Rather lacky regarding character creation (but customization is awesome)-Graphically its quite normal id say-It may be hard for controller users to adapt-It will create addiction inside you-Has a somewhat more difficult learning curve, but hey cmoen11/10 buy it			"

												I was really put off by this for a long time. I refused to even look or read up on it. I filed it under ""hipsters do videogames"" and was done with it.I was wrong.I respect this game because it respects me. The game has not once insulted my intelligence. The gameplay mechanics, the story(for adult audiences by the by)/quests/writing/voice acting - all treat me like an adult.I don't have much patience for mmos in general, since I expect a certain amount of polish and I have a low tolerance of people in general.You can play solo if you desire. You can play with friends. The community is helpful and polite.The store is never ""in your face"" and after the first 30 missions you get a free one time 1200 ""points"" to use.The story is right out of your favorite horror genre with better writing and characters.No levels. No respec (no need since the ultimate goal is to unlock all the weapons and make a build that suits you)^ A unique rpg experience that is unlike any other game on the market to date.The graphics are dark, gritty and crisp.The voice acting is possibly the best I've heard and gives the characters depth. (better than SWTOR)I loathe the quests in rpgs. This game made me enjoy the experience and may be the best part about the game. They are fun, different and often times challenging. Again, this is due to the story and empowering you as the player. Never have I once felt as if I was doing menial or ""busy"" work.Simply put, this is a great game.You deserve this game you sexy beast, you. "

												I have to start by saying I have never been a fan of MMO's. Ive always been most fond of adventure and roleplaying games, typically single player mainly so i could spend hours turning over every rock and opening every door, etc. MMO's just dont normally cater to my idea of a fun game. However, TSW is different. This game is so rich with content and story, it took me by storm. It carried me away like no game has done before. I loved Elder Scrolls series, Ultima series, Fallout series, BioShock series, etc. but TSW takes gaming to a whole new level. Right from the start, you jump into a world of modern realities with fantastical occurences, mythical links and historical tie-ins. The investigations, the manner in which the content actually is written so that you are expected to do research on the internet while ingame is awesome. The combat system is fun, the crafting system is good. The mix of necessary combat, and other times you just have to sneak thru this, the single player adventure storylines amazing, while there is still an awesome mix of multiplayer dungeon adventures that make the game even better. Oh, and not to mention the ingame clans that also end up in pvp and pve scenarios. All I can say is, I think TSW may just be the greatest game ive ever played, and i'll be playing it for years to come, im sure. I have to conclude my review with the one knock i have against it. It doesnt have controller support. The keyboard/mouse layout is abismal. if it were not for XPadder, I wouldnt be able to play it really. But XPadder works nicely, alongside putting the game in ""target"" mode. Give it a free month try out, you'll love it!			"

I like the idea of another world lying alongside our own and the use of London, New York etc makes a nice change from the medeaval worlds I have been immersed in recently. The inventory system of free additional bags, ability to chenge the size of them etc ia a real boon at lower levels. Still getting a hang of using a sword and spells at the same time but the storyline is engaging, there are some humerous moments and honestly, who doesn;t like kicking the crap out of zombies??			"

												The best part about this MMORPG is that it isn't in the same predictable fantasy or sci fi setting that most of the others seem to land in. I really enjoy the conspiracy, cthulu and new agey crackpot setting they've devised. They worked hard on setting up everything with voice actors and interesting plots, the only thing that brings it down is the fairly standard world set up with a lot of creatures just kind of standing around until you aggro them. It doesn't really feel alive. I played with friends, but I couldn't help wishing this was a single player rpg in the same setting. Still, totally worth messing around in especially now that there's not a subscription fee. I got this on release and got it again on steam and enjoyed it both times.			"

												Before I linked my Steam account to this game, I probably had another 100 hours into it.  By MMORPG standards, that might not be a great deal of time, but it is certainly enough time to say that there are a lot of things this game does right.  The atmosphere and story of this game are excellent.  There's more effort put into the storyline of the starting area of Kingsmouth than most MMORPGs have in their entire game.  The puzzles, the writing and the humor are clever and refreshing after slogging through yet another online game that promises you ""hours of customizable character options"".  Yes, being able to customize your character is nice, but I like to have a storyline to go with it.  Call me crazy...Gameplay wise, this game is solid.  Rather than lock you into a single class like a lot of games, TSO will alow to essentially explore all the myriad combinations with just one character.  The skill system can be a bit confusing at first, as you try and work out actives and passives, combinations, etc, and I heavily recommend you grab a guide to help you understand the basics, but you're not going to be heavily penalized early on for not understanding everything- and you definitely won't have to re-roll a character because you didn't choose correctly.  Similarly, the crafting system is a bit opaque until you get the hang of things.  It doesn't just hand you a list of stuff and let you click a button, but some basic research will get you going in the right direction.  In a lot of ways, this game won't hold your hand.  You're meant to experiment and figure out things on your own.  Get too frustrated and there are plenty of sites and guides, but if you like some problem solving and detective work in your games, put down the guide and try to figure it out on your own, first.  Success earned is sweet indeed.Give the game a chance, there's plenty of content in the F2P model to enjoy, and if you're hooked, all the additional stuff that they have out and the new stuff they continue to put out, is inexpensive.  Or go the monthly fee and get some useful bonuses in addition to all content.  Either way you'll enjoy the game.			"

												One of the few MMOs that truly builds upon its storytelling ability to carry the game, it blends elements of horror, fantasy, and sci-fi into a cohesive plotline that, if you're interested in any of those things, then this game will do it for you. Combat mechanics are interesting and being able to create your own build with alot of mix and matching is really interesting, and even during the grindier parts of the game I never felt that fatigue that comes with doing something repetitive. Also, investigation missions are the best thing since ""questing"" was invented, bar none. All that good stuff being said, the game has its flaws, while you can make your own build, when doing certain content high levels of optimization are required, and being able tot tell the difficulty of an area is not as clear cut as it should be. I'd have also liked if the player character themselves had a bit more personality beyond the clothing options. And for how good the story of the game was, there will be some quests that feel like they never got fully resolved. You complete them, recieve your goodies and maybe a pat on the back from your boss, but your left standing there feeling like there was meant to be more that just didn't get finished.			"

												This was a game that I had been extraordinarily hyped about back when it was first released. It took four years for me to actually get around to playing it, but let me just say that I am not disappointed. Character customization is fairly decent, the quests that you can embark on are all unique, and I've found myself amused by a good number of NPCs, their dialogue, and general antics. I love the nods given to Lovecraft and other known authors, particularly in the first region you visit, Solomon Island. But where I think this game truly shines is its lore. That has me coming back for more, staying up later and later each night to uncover and grasp the full extent of it. It honestly is like falling into a whole new dimension.			"

												I have only begun playing this game at the time of writing this but I have already put 15 hours in and plan for more. That is a solid amount to give my impressions.Con: The game mechanics are a little cumbersome and at times over complicated. Fortunately, I still get by in combat using the shotgun and running around like mad. Starting a new character will feel a little overwhelming when you see the UI and all the things to do.Pro: If you are in any way familiar or a fan of Lovecraft, the setting and quests will suck you in and the time will fly. Eventually I got used to the mechanics and have been able to really enjoy the setting and narrative. "

My only complaint, really, is how geared you have to be in order to even *think* about entering PVP.

												This game is consuming my life and I have no problem with it~Super unique skill system that allows one character to switch between tank, dps, and healer as needed.  No skill or ability points are wasted and there are no skill builds as such.  The world is awesome, and it can really pull you in.  Quests are done so well that you'll find yourself wanting to complete them not solely for experience points, but because they flesh out the world.  Usable ""Lore"" objects can be found hidden around the game world that, once used, unlock lore for you to read at your leisure.  There's no subscription required, but additional content can be downloaded in the form of ""issues.""  Best of all, this game is not pay-to-win!

												I do not know how the game was in the early games. I am just beginning my journey.Yes, that's what it is all about: Exploring. Every single detail is thrilling. I find it highly impressive and of all the MMOs I've seen, the most original, being the least copy-cat to WoW (which in turn stole from Everquest and so on)To details: You choose your role ingame, so you enter as a generic character. So the  three-slot-limit (across ALL servers) shouldn't hurt. But as there are three distinctive factions with differing story lines, and a great way of visually customizing your char I guess it will hurt.To this point it feels very much like a solo game. Although exploring the world together should be even more fun.Character build seems complex though I am not very much into that now. Great voice acting with every even slightly important NSC help creating an awsome atmosphereBottomline is, I am awfully impressed and I have to go back to the game right now :)Glad I bought my ultimate edition on steam sale last week for 16 Euro for having experienced the game now, I'd feel compelled to shell out 54 Euro today ;)Since writing this review yesterday the game has grown on me even more... One reviewer said, ""it's like playing Sherlock Holmes in a Cthulhu-World killing Zombies."" Yeah, but as a dual sword/AK47-wielding Ninja-marine Sherlock!Those Zombies are scary...and fast!

												After my first Review on this one i have to edit it. Apparently Funcom decided to to screw their whole playerbase so i have to change it. We knew about the relaunch for some months now but nobody expected them to just spit in every single face they could possibly find. We expected the game to be relaunched, with better animations, combat system ect. Instead we get a ""brand new"" game that is EXACTLY the same with the same engine, stories ect. Only that we have to level new characters, can't keep all of the clothes we bought ingame or in the shop, mounts, sprints, gear... And if that is not enough we won't even get new content. We won't even get all of the old content at relaunch. No nightmare dungeons, no tokyo, no raids no nothing. Only useless elite dungeons that basically don't have any difficulty whatsoever. That being said, after everything they promised over the years we can't even tell if there will be any new content at all. And even if something new will come, it probably won't come before 2018 given the fact that Funcom broke pretty much every promise they made. And if all of that wasn't enough, they used a word that makes me want to hit my head against a wall as hard as i can; ""Streamlined""... Basically meaning we dumb down the game so even the stupidest kid with an iq lower than room temperature can be the king of the world in this game. Oh and i forgot about the combat system... with its more ""action like"" feeling. What actually means they will turn it into the same pile of s**t as all those boring action rpgs that are flooding the market with their disgusting smell. I always had a bad feeling about this whole relaunch nonsense, but how the most loyal community you can possibly have got treated here is just pathetic.			"

												I have been a fan of The Secret World since launch.  I preordered and eventually purchased a lifetime membership.  What ever is on this page is no longer the MMO those of us so rabidly enjoyed.  This is a ""relaunch"".   The plan is to revamp the combat system, update the graphics (albeit with the same engine), and try to appeal to a broader audience. In the process of doing so, they stabbed their most loyal fan base right in the back.  Characters cannot be transfered from The Secret World to Secret World Legends.  All the time spent raiding, dungeoning, grinding, crafting, upgrading, etc. was all for nothing.  We have been waiting over a year for a major content update.  We were ready for a big one this year.  We didn't expect to be completely disregarded and♥♥♥♥♥♥on.  Funcom says that we can play our old characters on the old servers.  But guess what?  There will be no new content.  No support.  All new content will be released on the Legends servers.  For free mind.  After we have sunk money and time into the game we all cherished.   If we want we can transfer over our memberships and vanity items.  It has yet to be described what vanity items we can transfer.  We lose all of our achievements, all of our gear, all of our progress.  I once wrote a very positive review for The Secret World.  Well, they just put the ""F U"" in Funcom so I have since deleted that review and came to write this one.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  Do not be fooled by the positive reviews.  Those are only the ghosts for a game that has been killed.  ""Rotting alive"" so to speak.			"

The next chapter of the game is supposed to be coming down the pipe soon, and we are eagerly awaiting it. Until then, I just stick my head in to dink around and soak up that TSW atmosphere.But the game rocks and is worth playing through.And remember, sweetlings, don't do anything Saïd wouldn't do...			"

												I've been playing MMOs since 2006 or so and I have to say this game is a gem.  You get to break the fantasy mould without losing game quality.  The game is engaging and fun to play.Pros- Great storyline- Lots of variety in play style and skill progression- Learning curve - experimenting early on won't ruin your character later on- Friendly community- No subscription- Zombies and secret societiesCons- Graphics are well done but not astounding- Systems can be tricky to learnAll in all, I recommend anyone who enjoys a good MMO but who would like a break from the typical fantasy or sci fic tropes to give this game a try.  And everyone else, too.  It's a fun game.			"

												The most unique MMORPG I have ever played. If the combat was better I would say this hands down the best ever made but sadly the combat is among the worst. Still it offers a stand alone experience you will find in no other MMO  and even most RPG's. If you like story and to carve your own story this is for you!

												The characters are phenomenal, great voice actors including Peter Stormare ( The Big Lebowski ) that add much life to TSW. A Majority of my time spent playing, was through the original client, despite purchasing TSW here, It's helped me hide my free time spent. And there are so many wonderfully imagined places to explore in TSW, some based in reality and others based on the reality of a dream/nightmare. + No pre defined classes to get locked into+ Above average difficulty ( wisdom and random knowledge is vital )+ PvP is fun, despite the seniority issues and limited areas.- The very few bugs i've come across are some of the worst kind ( 19fps while facing SE to NW on the coastline )- DX9 crashes often and DX 11 while stable, tends to under utilize hardware, causing low frame rate.-/+ Less populace than many other MMO's  "

												The Secret World is like an extra stout beer. At first, you're going to hate it. It will taste bitter and you won't be able to drink it long enough to get past the rough flavor. But if you've had other alcohol before, or you manage to stomach it through the unfriendly forward flavors, then eventually you'll discover a rich and complex beverage that's a pleasure to drink in front of the fire on a winter's night.Okay, so the metaphor isn't perfect. But the elevator speech is this: The Secret World is an Massively Multiplayer Online Adventure/Puzzle Game RPG. It feels a lot like what Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines Online would be if anyone ever tried to make that game. It has a relatively freeform combat system that feels open and customizable (even when it actually isn't sometimes), and the quests require a lot more investigation and thought than any other MMO. The story is well written and playing through the zones you'll experience a lot of ""a-ha!"" moments, which are the best part of the game. The only real downside is that the game is very, very bad at teaching you how to play it. Be prepared to do a fair amount of research on the wiki, especially regarding combat and builds.If that doesn't sound appealing, then it's not your kind of game. If it does, then as long as you're prepared to give it some time and do research on how to build your character and what order to do quests in, you'll have a dark, mysterious and wonderful experience.

												Totally different. Totally awesome. I am having more fun in this MMO than I have had in any other GAME (much less an MMO) in a while....other than Shroud of the Avatar, in all fairness I must disclose that. TSW has also KEPT me interested...lots of games are fun for a little while but they just become a grind pretty quickly. I am still trying to figure out what in hades is even going on in this one...and I am many hours in. That's a GOOD thing. I hate having a game beat but still having 100 hours to go to finish it.TSW comes HIGHLY recommended. I started out testing this game as something to play while SotA continues through its Alpha process but now looks like they are going to have to share time.The Secret World gets 4.75 Dancing Disco Monkeys out of 5.... Good job, Funcom....I didn't think you guys had it in you but you proved me completely wrong!! Thank you :)			"

												TSW has often been called a totally different/unique MMORPG. I would disagree, I think it is rather similar to most MMORPGs, but differs in execution. The most obvious pro is the setting. I used to adore the d10 system, especially Vampire: The Masquerade, and always dreamt I could have an mmo in the modern/steampunk world. Funcom gives you a boner with the factions (temps, illus and dragons) and the starting locations (NYC, London, Seoul), but then dilutes it to the point where the flair is much gone. The starting zone drags you through hours and hours of dark forests of [insert zombie game here], killing several different types of, well, zombies.  In that way, I don't see much of an innovation or a different feel to the game than other MMORPGs (yes, there are puzzle quests and fun quests as well, but largely it is the same concept). However, what the game does do better, is character writing. The little tidbits you get are enjoyable, sometimes macabre, and immersing. And that detail is what sets this game apart, creating a world where you roleplay and enjoy the experience. The ability wheel is an odd concept. You get points and spend them on different abilities - that is kind of straightforward - but it feels as if I can just collect points and master all the weapons, which for me takes a bit away from the meaningul decisions you have to make in other games (at least in the early iterations). I am a Paladin on Wow and I know I can do Plate, not Leather - here, you can do everything, which actually flattens out all the corners for me. I genuinely enjoy the factions and the lore. It is perfectly gloomy and the factions are over-all well-shaped: the dragons are the order in chaos, the templars are the ""keep up appearances"" and the illuminati are the crazy Anonymous/joker types. This is reflected quite well in the starting areas, although Seoul and NYC are rather disappointing, especially NYC, which is actually just a block in Brooklyn. London seems to be the biggest and, for me, with the most enjoyable aura.  It is well-designed, I especially like the Darkside and the nifty comments by the guards. Overall, I enjoy playing The Secret World, but I play it together with my friend, so half of the fun at least comes from that factor. It certainly feels refreshing after years of WoW and it does utilize several distinct methods, but I would still argue that the no-level concept is poppycock. It doesnt really matter if you stick a number to xp points or not, you still do get new abilities and better gear as you go along and some zones are unavailable until you have completed parts of the game. So initially, the level system still exists, just without level numbers. I believe it is a must-play game if you are trully in the gaming scene, mostly because of the settings and the factions and the very enjoyable writing. Stick with it through the first zones (the zombie slaying might feel a bit uninspired) and get through the learning curve - then it will be a most enjoyable experience7/10			"

												I bought this game way back when, when it first came out and honestly I couldn't get into it. Here recently tho I decided to give it another try and wow has it changed and for the good in my opinion. This game has a very good story one that I find very interesting and fun to play through as well as it's buy to play now and no longer a pay to play game which makes a world of a difference. If you like mmo's give this game a try just keep in mind it's not like your standard mmo this game has ""classes"" but you don't choose one and build your character around it. You ""level up"" and gain AP and you buy skills and eventually you own every skill and you can make whatever build you want.			"

												I never liked Everquest.   WoW did not hook me even with a free week of play.  Secret World... At this time, I have just under 800 hours played and I still think it's amazing. Yeah, it's got the 'Kill X Monsters' and 'Find the lost thing'  and 'Escort the annoyingly slow NPC to another place' missions, but where it shines is the puzzles.  From classical music to math and science, from medicine to one involving an old Marx Bros movie, the 'Investigation' missions are all knowledge/logic/reason based puzzles and questions, and the really unbelievable part is, it does not repeat much at all.  Early on, you are deducing a password is the name of a composer based off the subjects musical choices, and 400+ hours later, you're in a medical tent, provided a list of medicines and a list of patient symptoms, and the medicines in the game are real-world medicines, so, you have to look up what they do to match the cure to each patient's condition. Given in-game access to a browser for looking up this obscure stuff. Seriously, if you've got enough knowledge memorized regarding crime scene forensics to solve a puzzle about it without looking things up, you scare me.			"

												I've been a fan of the game designer/writer since The Longest Journey, and the writing in this is fantastic.  Super imagintive.  One of my favorite games.  This game has puzzles and imagination oozing out of it.  But it takes some patience to play.  And it has a really great mature and hardcore community who love the game.  It's a gem in the world of MMO's.It does have a couple crappy things for me.  The combat just dosn't feel good.   It's clunky, and pvp performance isn't great.  Also there is a web browser in game to use to solve puzzles.  But the web browser closes everytime u load, so it ends up being easier to alt tab all the time.  But when I'm in a game I dont want to have to alt tab.  So either the puzzles could be more solveable or the browser could be better.  This game should be enjoyed for it's puzzles, awesome universe, community, and writing.			"

												This game draws you into its world like no other.  All of its flaws (which are plenty) fall away as you go deeper into its atmospheric, spooky rabbit hole.  I'm an action gamer normally and don't really like MMOs, yet TSW is one of the most played games in my steam list and I've barely scratched the surface of it.  Amazing.   By the way, while the engine is buggy and outdated, the environments in this game are among the most realistic that I've seen in any MMO.  They are lovingly detailed and crafted and have the best lighting & atmospheric effects (fog, clouds, changing sunlight) system that I've seen in any game, MMO or not.			"

												> A MMO where conspiracy theories about secret societies and the supernatural are real> Includes ARG elements via an in-game browser to help assist in Investigation Missions> no character classes or levels; the term ""character customization"" is very high in the Secret World.  Builds known as Decks exist to help players get a good feel of what kind of character they want to build.All in all, probably one of the best MMOs I've come across and have been enjoying.  Would definitely recommend if this is right up your alley.			"

												The secret world.... what can i say about it ....Its not easy theres minimal hand holding in this . Theres a mission in the first ""act"" where you litarly have to look up latin and have it interpretated on the internet / google just to progress 1 step.Mobs / npcs / monsters ... they want to kill you ... i know what your thinking, ur thinking ya all mobs in all games wanna kill you this fkn game goes oh ... so you can handle 4? , here have eight ... aw ♥♥♥♥it i think 12 ya 12 will ♥♥♥♥ ya lolz. now heres a mob that can 1 shot you hahahaha eat it :PI have never ever raged at a game so much and just when you think you have a decent build the thing throws a curve ball at you like mobs your build not only cant kill but never could .By now your probly thinking aye dam hater , you would be wrong i love this game its a wierd circle of ssweet jezuz run away , or wtf what do i do now google where are you to mixed in with the odd go here get this , kill that  and stand on x switch  (opps you died ya forgot to mention theres a gas trap just infront of  there and it can kill you LOL).The only issues i have with it the inventory / crafting system while complex to a degree is somewhat have to google just to see figure it out and after a month you might have a couple scematics memorised , you can create new bags which helps seperate things but still its 24 or so items which can be combined in a formation each formation creates something different different levels require different levels of same item while you look west and hop on one leg  (look out for that creepy child buy the way opps your dead). The other issue is the ""buying "" of issues to progress i haave brought a few and will more then likely end up with them all but the whole issue thing can be annoying i brought issue 5 and 9 before i knew they were kinda designed as end game things / end game kinda .. end game as in requirering ql 10's but not end end game which to say is something like ql 10.5 or something which despite the "".5"" i would assume is a stupidly huge increase if the dirrerence of 10 and 10.1 is anthing to go by .I swear i have never ever ever died so much in a game and yet theres a strange feeling or solice knowing im not the first quite easily a hundred people have probly gone before me and died at the same spots with the same noob god complex i have. I was with a group the other day and while i was rageing at myself over an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trap the guy who i was with said .. i died on it 19 times before i got through  it the first time. Ive been threw that trap 3 times now and the last time i only died once,  i feel a strange feeling of accomplishment from it.I Swear dureing the event i went to today i took a wrong turn and ended up in a lava trench .. growling at the map and my stupidness of thinking it was just a quick jump that way..... i had a thought while i stood there dieing , i was wondering who else has fallen down here and then 3 more joined me haha ... If you love the hand held heres power go 1 hit armys games , try this one :p rage a bit and facepalm at your own stupiness and revel in the oh my gawd what the ♥♥♥♥ moments its surely great for that.If you are the min maxing parse does radera x y z BIS only PROOOOZ desearve respect elitist type ya there alota guys like you on this youll be at home :p.not to mention the good storyline ... no speaking yourself which bugs me but i guess they have to cut back on something the storyline is better then 80% of whats out there.7/10 If i have to rate it looses points on the bad looting system and as a result horrible inventory system and forced team     play it annoys me that once i pay for something i cant complete it for 2 /3 weeks - might be impossible to i do not know theres no real ingame help about whats doable solo you have to go googling to find that♥♥♥♥♥♥It should be on the purchase ticket that you will more then likely need friends to complete it, im just glad i didnt buy the collectors editions id be a bit more frustrated at it then i am now and ill have to google everything before i buy to make sure i dont just walk into a wallet snare and ignore those which are :p .

Why? cause it adds some rlly amazing stuff to see to do also some weapons and y will save some money like this cause purchase them 1 by 1 might be kinda much more expensive .... and believe me this game is gorgeaus.

												I can recall the first time I saw this game on the Steam page. The name of the game and the picture was intriguing to say the least. Iinitially thought that it was like all the mmo's out there with nothing to set it aside. I was surprised once I did start playing it because it is indeed unique from other mmo's out there. There are so many different things to try out once you play. You get three different factions that you choose from. The Illuminati, Templars, and Dragon are the three. Once you choose one of them you are brought to the character creation screen. The options for customisation aren't huge but enough that you can flesh out your avatar to your liking. The fact that you can purchase clothes and other things in the game makes up for the lack of extra customisation. After all of that you are shown the begininning of your journey in a beautiful cinematic introduction. Just sit back and watch it. All three factions have their own intro so try all three to see the difference for yourself. Once you gain control of your avatar you can start playing the game and fear not...you will not be left in the dark if it is your first time playing. You have helpful hints pop up on the side of the screen that are non intrusive and guide you along the way until you feel comfortable enough to go it alone. The community of players in the game are also a vibrant bunch. So many people that are willing to stop what they are doing in order to answer a question you may have. You might get the rare player that says nothing back but mostly you get a response. The players who have been on the game longer and have more experience are always willing to help you out. I know this from personal experience and from word of mouth. The game also features a cabal system which is another term for guild. You can join one of many guilds within the game and start building friendships with your fellow guildies. There is way too much for me to cover in here but I would definately give this game a 4 out of 5 stars. I would give it 5 stars if there were more realms to play on and if the DX 11 version of the graphics were properly fixed. Other than those everything else is perfect to me. Give it a try and definately bring a friend because it will be that much sweeter!			"

												Well...What to say about ""The Secret World...The best thing about the game is the friendly community it has. Almost everyone would respond to your call for help whether it is regarding the build you are trying to form (you gonna need help), a quest npc you just cant beat (You gonna need help), or even when you open a ticked to GM regarding a problem with the game itself (Doesnt happen a lot but when it does, you gonna need help). Besides that, the combat system is quite unique. It keeps ypu on the edge all the time unlike many other MMORPGs such as WOW as it constantly requires you to jump, dodge, run or even change your build for a specific encounter since you gonna need to remove that beneficial effect on the boss or need to free yourself from some root spell before the npc in question would come close and ♥♥♥♥s you up good. Besides there is only 8 skills you can equip at the same time and, again, unlike many other MMORPGS like, again, WOW, your screen is not flooded with dozens of skill buttons.The problem with the ""Secret World"" is that you really need to spend some serious time to get used to it. Everything from crafting to finding a passcode is a challenge in the game. For some it might be fun to search the net for lyrics of a song which would give you the clue for a safe password, but for the rest the ""investigation"" quests might be a nightmare. In other words, if you really like a challenge, give The secret World a try. But again, you are hereby wanred, it will be a tough journey. Even finding the right channel to talk about ""stuff"", (/chat join sanctuary) took me some time.			"

Which is awesome, because due to the fact its not FTP, pretty much everyone that's playing too busy wanting to be playing and having fun with the game that they spent money, instead of being jerks to everyone else.Tl;drGreat Quests, Amazing Amount of Content, Great Community			"

												I played this in beta and really enjoyed it, but i wasn't ready to commit to a monthly sub fee when the game went live so i moved on and forgot about it. Until recently. Feeling frustrated with my usual MMO (rhymes with swirled of borecraft) i started looking around for an alternative. remembering that TSW had gone free to play, i thought i'd give it a chance.i am not disappointed.The game is not witout its flaws. It's pretty buggy and the graphics looked dated three years ago, but if you can set aside those two flaws there's really a hidden gem here.the storyline is creepy, engaging, and develops organically. the quest design in TSW is pretty much the best of any game i've played.you have a lot of freedom as far as how you develop your character. With nine weapon specialties (each of which can fill two roles) you can create a unique character or choose from pre-formatted decks.The three factions are distinct and play off each other well. while characters from different factions can chat or group together and much of the content is the same, the flavour text you get when completing missions is tailored to fit the faction style. there are faction specific quests as well.even with the dated graphics, the camera work in the cutscenes is pretty great. the camera will zoom in so that youre in or close to first person and the NPC speaking to your character will ""break the fourth wall"" and look directly at you. Engaging and unnerving perfcet for this game.i could say a lot more, but i really want to go back and play. ^_^TL;DRCons: Buggy, Dated graphicsPros: A+ quest design, engaging storyline, versatile character creation, unique blend of modern urban and fantasy horror.

												Very interesting MMO, I've been playing it for one week and I enjoy the setting and the leveling experience, in particular the cutscenes when you get the main quests. The UI is very good and I haven't experienced any major bug so far; the skills system is not very easy but it gives you so many possibilities, I still can't figure what kind of build is good :)Of course I have no idea about end-game content...

												Where do I start with this game? Well lets start with the intro, the game has a great premise for why you got pulled into this war, one day your just another average joe and the next you got super powers, great huh? This game just feels great to play the customization is amazing, the fact that you don't have to commit to a single build is great too! I know a lot of other MMORPGs have it so you can have different classes but I feel this game does it way better. Say you go damage and 20 hours in you think ""Damn...I wish I went healing"" Well now you can just keep playing and you will get the xp needed to get a full on healing set of abilities I know I know this game is really grindy but doing all the quests in everyone area should give you enough XP to make at least 5 decks. The Missions are not boring they are actually really interesting theres three different types of quests, I forgot the name of the red one but its basically kill these things grab this, Sabatoge, investigation and side missions. If you are sick of quests where you just go here kill these guys go there kill these guys then theres investigation quests for you they are really cool, actually make you think outside the box and even then you gotta double check your facts, theres missions where they want you to decode, or find a missing piece of the puzzle with vague clues, overall its a really fun time and makes you think, Investigation missions also give you more xp then your average red missions the slaying ones. The story is great you are basically a nobody whos given tasks from your secret group whoever you chose, and while on those missions you slowly start to discover that something else has taken an interest in you as well, and lets just say that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you interact with them, I don't want to spoil too much. Overall this game is really great and does not get the credit it deserves i'd give it a 10/10 and reccomend it to all my friends who like MMOs, at first the game is a little confusing but once you learn the basics it gets easier to play.

												This game isn't quite what's advertised.  The game's tone is all over the place.  In only a few instances have quests been dark and mature.  More than 75% of the time (through 15 hours) the quests play EXACTLY like a Rockstar game.  Think GTA or Bully.  Quests are introduced through a brief cut scene with the NPC.  The NPCs are glib, overacting stereotypes, generally unphased by the horror supposedly swirling around them.  I'm positive they did the voice acting before actually scripting the quests because the NPCs often don't even discuss the particulars of what they want you to do.  That makes the quests both unengaging and confusing.The tone also suffers a lot because there's no pretense that you're a shadow agent.  A large minority of NPCs recognize that you have special powers or even outright acknowledge that you're a member of a secret society.  The rest of the NPCs assume you're there to help them and send you on bland good guy missions, to shore up junk walls or collect supplies, which shatter the tone of you investigating paranormal forces for your own shadowy ends.I wish there was something between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended.""  I know of very few games that even occasionally strike the tone this game is going for, so if you're looking for something like this, it's pretty much the only game in town.  For an MMO, it also has the freedom of class building and some combat mechanics found in a much more polished game, Elder Scrolls Online.  If you can get the Ultimate Edition on sale for ~$20, you can easily get your money's worth from this game.			"

												Tl;dr: my hour count on this game is as of six months ago, when Steam decided to stop counting the patcher and the game as one program and thus stopped logging my hours. So, that's how I feel about this game.Pros of the game:1. Genuine moments of horror. There's missions that people laughingly state they will never replay, not because they didn't enjoy them, but because they scared them too much.2. Beautiful ambience (if you can play with headphones and without the music on, I'd recommend it, because the game has some of the loveliest background noises I've ever seen and it really enhances the game. From the distant sounds of the wailing damned to the ominous whispers of blood magic, it's all 10/10 guarenteed to creep you out).3. One of the friendliest online communities I've ever seen (aside from a few jerks). Even if you don't have a cabal (guild), you can ask the custom chat channels like sanctuary and noobmares for help and, as long as you're willing to accept advice, they're always willing to give it.4. Deep lore. Seriously, this is a game that was originally launched with an ARG (alternate reality game). There is a complex mythos behind every zone, and in many cases it's connected. 5. Something for everyone. Do you want to kill zombies? Got it. Play Indiana Jones (but with more mummies)? Got it. Psychological horror? Got it. Feel bad about playing the tutorial a few hundred hours into the game? Got it!6. Interesting missions. There's your standard kill quests, but also puzzle and stealth quests that require you to brush up on a rather esoteric skill set. If you're really having trouble you can look up a guide, but you can also learn morse code and research translations from Arabic, Latin, Romanian and more.7. The skill system. This is both a pro and, for some people, a con. Rather than having levels and locked classes, you can unlock every single ability on every character. Most people eventually learn how to do every dungeon role, unless they really dislike one. This means that you really get to play around with skills, and also that no ability point is ever wasted. However, it also means that the game expects you to be able to build your deck to suit the situation, so if you're not willing to tinker this can get distracting. The tutorials in game aren't super (though they've improved), but there's a lot of intense theorycrafting online.Cons:1. The game has some bugs. Some are amusing, such as the fact that you can stack the /smile emote to become an eldritch horror. Some are less so, such as a necessary mission item not being usable. Thankfully, GMs tend to respond quickly, but sometimes it can get frustrating.2. Up until about a year ago, content updates were slow. This has improved lately, with missions being released on a fast timetable, but be aware that there will sometimes be lulls in content. There's lots and lots to do, and this is also a non-subscription game, so this isn't really something that should be a deal breaker, but it is something to note.3. Confusing optimization. My computer, by all rights, should not run this game. But it does so with few hiccups. Higher end rigs sometimes cannot run this, though usually PCs (rather than laptops) are exempt from this. The optimization is not super, so make sure to keep an eye on ping and lag when you start so that, if you CANT run it, you'll have time to return it.4. Lackluster tutorials. This is somewhat mitigated by the friendliness of the community and the online resources, but the tutorials aren't the best. Optimal stats and weapon synergy aren't really explained, and there are a couple spots where the game goes from allowing a lot of messing about to expecting you to have your build together quickly.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game if you're into complex lore, challenging missions, a weapons system that requires flexibility, and a small but friendly community. If you do play the game, I'd recommend going to curse.com for mods and tswdb.com for tutorials, walkthroughs, and builds.			"

												Great MMO and better yet experience.I've owned TSW for years now and only after re-purchasing via Steam [for the updatability as well purchasing new chapters]  it's been great.  No better stories, characters and sometimes Lovecraftian tales in another experience let alone MMO.Community is great, albeit less than should be for this gem of an experience, and while higher level than myself were always willing to help on questions, hints on missions and whatnot.  It's rough after being top level as many of the leading community are to lower ones self to doing the past years content, again and again for us noobs so there are things that you *must* find others at the same level to work with.  I don't think that's a bad design or plan because the game itself is better with others or friends.It's tech is aging, it's community is small but strong and the stories and experience are still one of the best, if not the best, out there.  No more killing 10 Elves for ears and turning in to get some worthless tidbit and once you've cracked the codes on some of these missions you will clearly see the intellect and dedication the dev's go for each and every update.While I cannot play more than I already do I always want to play more than I can.  It's that kinda game for me at least and being free  you should have zero issues setting up an account and giving it a test run.  I've even, among purchasing the Massive Edition as well the Ultimate, subscribe monthly for a few perks and extra Store cash.  It's my way of helping keep this online as long as we can.Cheers,~Icky			"

												I have to start by saying I have never been a fan of MMO's. Ive always been most fond of adventure and roleplaying games, typically single player mainly so i could spend hours turning over every rock and opening every door, etc. MMO's just dont normally cater to my idea of a fun game. However, TSW is different. This game is so rich with content and story, it took me by storm. It carried me away like no game has done before. I loved Elder Scrolls series, Ultima series, Fallout series, BioShock series, etc. but TSW takes gaming to a whole new level. Right from the start, you jump into a world of modern realities with fantastical occurences, mythical links and historical tie-ins. The investigations, the manner in which the content actually is written so that you are expected to do research on the internet while ingame is awesome. The combat system is fun, the crafting system is good. The mix of necessary combat, and other times you just have to sneak thru this, the single player adventure storylines amazing, while there is still an awesome mix of multiplayer dungeon adventures that make the game even better. Oh, and not to mention the ingame clans that also end up in pvp and pve scenarios. All I can say is, I think TSW may just be the greatest game ive ever played, and i'll be playing it for years to come, im sure. I have to conclude my review with the one knock i have against it. It doesnt have controller support. The keyboard/mouse layout is abismal. if it were not for XPadder, I wouldnt be able to play it really. But XPadder works nicely, alongside putting the game in ""target"" mode. Give it a free month try out, you'll love it!			"

Playing Secret world is very often like watching movie, a good movie.  For some reasons its not that popular as most of us who play TSW would like to and I think that because of that the game doest generate the amount of money to speed up new things that coming in to the game. But still the game has much to offer for PvE players.			"

												Really want to play this game, however, this game does not work correctly on my rig with Windows 10 Professional. The Patcher application fails with a fatal error. Now, I don't blame Funcom for this as the specifications do not mention Windows 10 and they recommend Windows 7. So while the game is free once you've purchased it, I have wasted the purchase price. There seem to be a lot of forum chatter concerning the problem I'm experiencing with fixes available which only work for some and not others. So would I recommend this game, not for Windows 10, if you have Windows 7 and this type of game appeals to you then go for it, despite real world financial transactions, this is the type of game I would have lost many hours to, now it is an uninstalled game in my Steam Library. I don't request a refund as it serves to remind me of my mistake so next time I'll be more careful in assuming that games will run on my OS and Rig. The next time, I'll think twice.

The focus isn't about getting to the 'endgame', but to just enjoy building your own class and seeing what works for different situations and what doesn't. The instances are short, but enjoyable. A lot of focus is (even from the early dungeons) on boss mechanics. I've heard a lot of problems about the game-store and Funcom, but never experienced any myself.Also the servers suck sometimes.You'll easily get your moneys worth here though.			"

												I have been a fan of The Secret World since launch.  I preordered and eventually purchased a lifetime membership.  What ever is on this page is no longer the MMO those of us so rabidly enjoyed.  This is a ""relaunch"".   The plan is to revamp the combat system, update the graphics (albeit with the same engine), and try to appeal to a broader audience. In the process of doing so, they stabbed their most loyal fan base right in the back.  Characters cannot be transfered from The Secret World to Secret World Legends.  All the time spent raiding, dungeoning, grinding, crafting, upgrading, etc. was all for nothing.  We have been waiting over a year for a major content update.  We were ready for a big one this year.  We didn't expect to be completely disregarded and♥♥♥♥♥♥on.  Funcom says that we can play our old characters on the old servers.  But guess what?  There will be no new content.  No support.  All new content will be released on the Legends servers.  For free mind.  After we have sunk money and time into the game we all cherished.   If we want we can transfer over our memberships and vanity items.  It has yet to be described what vanity items we can transfer.  We lose all of our achievements, all of our gear, all of our progress.  I once wrote a very positive review for The Secret World.  Well, they just put the ""F U"" in Funcom so I have since deleted that review and came to write this one.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  Do not be fooled by the positive reviews.  Those are only the ghosts for a game that has been killed.  ""Rotting alive"" so to speak.			"

However, Funcom decided to rebrand it, and stopped future content updates for the original TSW.I'd supported them so much, but I'm glad I wasn't one of the unfortuantes that bought Lifetime for a lot of money, and now cannot get anything out of it.

I'm an action gamer normally and don't really like MMOs, yet TSW is one of the most played games in my steam list and I've barely scratched the surface of it.  Amazing.   By the way, while the engine is buggy and outdated, the environments in this game are among the most realistic that I've seen in any MMO.  They are lovingly detailed and crafted and have the best lighting & atmospheric effects (fog, clouds, changing sunlight) system that I've seen in any game, MMO or not.			"

												This mmo rpg wont hold your hand at all. Some of the quests are hard to understand and get a hold of since they require you to think. dont go into this thinking that only doing the main missions is enough. you'll actually have to do side quests and other missions to level up to get better and to have more skills. This game is not the best but it is an amazing game			"

												I have been playing this game for a short period of time, but it is easy to understand how much good game design it involves. All quests seem real and part of the world, there is always something to be searched and found to reach the object. You do not need the markups and pathfindinds to find your way. Everything is embedded in the map and carefully designed so that the player can explore and learn about the world.It has been an impressive fracking experience and a lecture about good game design.

												Very good game. Well worth the price, very good to play with a few friends. Played through to end game content (no dlc) and defo reccomend. If you play this game, dont rush, take your time and listen to the story - do all the investigation missions and story mission. There is a lot of lore hidden around the place which is really interesting. I usually hate lore, mainly like good gameplay and fast paced games but this game gets it perfect.			"

												Quite possibly the best mmo I have ever played, ever.Pros The story and background to the game is fun and very interesting. Character development is great! I have never played a game with a skill tree that works quite like this one, it allows great diversity of character builds. Great diversity of environments and enemies throughout keeps it interesting The story missions almost all have fully animated, voice acted cutscenes that develop npc's with real personalies and mave me feel more involved in the story A player could feasibly solo the entire game sans the raid dungeons, with the strong atmosphere direction that this game has I think this is very good.Cons Cost, this is not a cheap game, and then if you spring for the edition with more episodes it costs even more...  The player base can sometimes be thin in areas, it makes raid dungeoning hard The combat is fairly standard push button-use power, not too inovative, but not bad. "

												About 15 hours in at time of writing, what a hidden gen of a game. Billed as MMO with all the normal PvP etc but I have been doing solo and great fun, it does work as single player game.Only in first area at the moment, 14 more to go then all the meta combat between factions etc. Ultimate at 70% off when sales on is bargin. Been out a few years but still looks good maxed and plenty active as many player are not steam people.UPDATE: I am now 65 hours in, been through 3 areas and completed the first main story mission, Now on the next and in Egypt. There is so much to do in this game, still only scratching the surface of all the content. Story is good, lots of different combat styles to explore and not tied to a set character, you can change styles as you progress and open up the ability wheel.Update2: 127 hours in and it was a great ride but then I hit the wall that is Tokyo, this appears to be where the game becomes a grind fest and it has killed it for me, new combat mechanics and whole new set of gear to get with no real introduction on what is expected of you. The main story though has been an epic journey well worth the time invested but now done with it			"

												If you're like me, and weren't particularly impressed by TSW on release, do yourself a favor and give it another shot.Things have improved significantly. I picked it up after over 4 years of not having played it, and now I'm having a blast. No end-game yet, but the leveling experience alone is worth the price of entry (Yeah, I said it). The care and detail Funcom have put into everything shows. Hopefully there's still legs in TSW for some time to come, as it's a fantastic experience.			"

												Where do I start with this game? Well lets start with the intro, the game has a great premise for why you got pulled into this war, one day your just another average joe and the next you got super powers, great huh? This game just feels great to play the customization is amazing, the fact that you don't have to commit to a single build is great too! I know a lot of other MMORPGs have it so you can have different classes but I feel this game does it way better. Say you go damage and 20 hours in you think ""Damn...I wish I went healing"" Well now you can just keep playing and you will get the xp needed to get a full on healing set of abilities I know I know this game is really grindy but doing all the quests in everyone area should give you enough XP to make at least 5 decks. The Missions are not boring they are actually really interesting theres three different types of quests, I forgot the name of the red one but its basically kill these things grab this, Sabatoge, investigation and side missions. If you are sick of quests where you just go here kill these guys go there kill these guys then theres investigation quests for you they are really cool, actually make you think outside the box and even then you gotta double check your facts, theres missions where they want you to decode, or find a missing piece of the puzzle with vague clues, overall its a really fun time and makes you think, Investigation missions also give you more xp then your average red missions the slaying ones. The story is great you are basically a nobody whos given tasks from your secret group whoever you chose, and while on those missions you slowly start to discover that something else has taken an interest in you as well, and lets just say that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you interact with them, I don't want to spoil too much. Overall this game is really great and does not get the credit it deserves i'd give it a 10/10 and reccomend it to all my friends who like MMOs, at first the game is a little confusing but once you learn the basics it gets easier to play.

												LOVE the lore (Especially the New England references) that alludes to some of my absolute favorite authors. The character advancement mechanics are not the norm of most MMOs, and I honestly feel that many more games could learn from TSW.The Base Edition gets you pretty far. I still haven't bought any story edition addons and have tons of progress to make. If there's ever a free weekend or something in the near future, some players may feel overwhelmed, but the playerbase is actually really amazing and helpful, as well as anything you have questions about can be researched with a native in-game browser (not just the steam overlay) which also functions as a tool utilized for in-game missions. Nobody should ever miss the chance to try this game if they're able, and I encourage anyone who can relate to this review to buy the game.			"

												I play games for their entertainment value, a new one every once in a while, just for kicks. This game, The Secret World, has occasional moments of otherworldliness and genius. The atmosphere and story lines left me waiting for more, on pins and needles. I never felt like I was grinding - especially the first time through. Even after completing the first 3 chapters, I go back to gain some points to fill out my decks/builds. I'm glad I got to experience FunCom's vision of a truly unique MMO. I anxiously wait for the other chapters and the ability to  play them with my family. 4.5/5 over all. Some moments are brilliant, other parts - some of the interface, the double-clicking on items - not so much.			"

												The Secret World is my the most favourite MMORPG. Every mission\quest is far more interesting than in the most of the mmorpg games today. Playing Secret world is very often like watching movie, a good movie.  For some reasons its not that popular as most of us who play TSW would like to and I think that because of that the game doest generate the amount of money to speed up new things that coming in to the game. But still the game has much to offer for PvE players.			"

												Secret World Legends Update:I bought all the issues and put over 600 hours in to this game, I don't care about the money, What I care about is that I will have to start from scratch, We should be given an option for an equal high character to carry on where we left off, Until that happens I change my review to negative.This game is the one MMO I keep returning to over and over again, Sometimes I get kinda tired of it when I seem to hit a brick wall, But then I play other MMO's and then I realise what I am missing, And that this is one of the best games ever devised in this MMO genre, It breaks the rules of MMO and re definess the boundaries, With well told story driven quests that are actually Interesting, Involving things that are on the dark recesses of our minds, Stuff we may of heard about is brought into a vivid colourful reality and slapped in our face as we struggle to grasp the meaning behind the myriad of strange stories this game unravels, Buy it and play it, An MMO with shotguns that will not dissapoint.

												FIRST MMO I HAVE TRULY GOT INTO.This game is brilliant for people wanting a little bit more than the traditional fantasy MMO with the classes you have to stick with. In The Secret World the setting is modern day as you work for 1 of 3 factions; Templars, Dragons and the Illuminati. Classes are build up from a skill tree which you can interchange along with 2 weapons, experimenting with the weapons and skills means you can be a DPS one dungeon then switch to tank the next without having to start a new character. If you are a fan of monsters this MMO has you covered as you battle things rangin from zombies, vampires, werewolves, wendigos as well as massive demons and cthulu. In my opinion missions are alot more fun as ""kill x amount of mobs"" are fairly rare and instead are replaced by thought provoking tasks (which sometimes require ARG segments). The story is engaging and with it being in a modern setting, the aesthetic is very pleasing to roam around in.			"

												This is a really incredible game that takes a lot of really good ideas and combines them into something unique.1. No classes and low level abilities are cheap, so no need to reroll: go from swords to lighning bolts to pistols and barely slow down your progression.2. Combat system is based around picking two weapons and finding synergies between them. Combined with the classless system this means that your character really feels unique and custom built. 3. Quests are usually well written and are genuinely interesting and challenging a large part of the time. The best ones involve puzzles and riddles that are both challenging and immersive. I definitely never expected to have to go to a fake company website and look up some employees from some badges I found so I could figure out their password.4. Story is immense and engaging. It's a game about secret societies and hidden plans and man does it feel like it! Every story or interaction builds up the world and its history. The NPC interactions are also very well written: its funny when some NPCs acknowlege that you never seem to talk, but I was blown away when a villain said he wouldn't kill me because I would just revive (of course, I'm a PC in an MMO...) so THAT's why he was going to knock me out and escape. Little details like that mean that the game almost never breaks immersion which I never thought I'd see in an MMO. (Afterwards the quest-giver told me that the villain was wrong and I CAN in fact be killed. No idea what that means but I sure hope I don't find out!)This game didn't seem to get a lot of press, but I got quite a few friends into it (come on, Steam Award!). On that note, solving quests with friends is some of the most fun I've ever had in a game -period. However, unlike many MMOs many of The Secret World's quests are based on puzzles so replayability is limited after you solve them. But making new builds and beating up on bosses is endless fun. I haven't joined any groups or tried any of the raids yet, but I'm looking forward to it.			"

												The secret world is one of the best mmos, and one of the few mmos that is somewhat original.I personally have a bit of a love/hate relationship with funcom as at their best they are one of the most interesting game developers, but sadly they tend to release games too early in a broken state. The secret world is a great mmo, especially the leveling aspect when you run around doing quests. The storytelling is great and original, and there are quite a few very memorable characters populating the game. While you will do most of your ""leveling"" solo, the community in this game is one of the best i have ever experienced in any mmo. Most players are really helpful and kind.That said this game is not without its weaknesses but you only really notice them in the ""endgame"". Once you have finished the main storylines and all the quests in the different zones, the game ends up beeing too repetitive but that can be said for most mmos. You will have many hours of fun before you reach that endgame boredom. "

If you don't cheat and look it up online you could sit there for hours trying to wrap your head around it)-Can be played solo(generally doesn't take long to find a group for the group missions)                        -Nice Queue system for the group missions, lets you play main questline while waiting.Cons:-A lot of what your used to in an MMO is different or not here (no skill respec, actually have to think in a lot of the quests)-No class system can be daunting (because most games force you into one role, the freedom sometimes is too much to take in.)-Isn't enough story deviation from character to character(but what MMO does really?)Final Comments:-Loved the game and was invested in my character so much that I cosplayed as him at a Convention in Seattle.

												Pros:The setting of Modern Horror alone makes thisone of the best story-driven MMOs I have ever played. The innovative Questing and classless system can be confusing for most people, but you pock up on the basics pretty fast. While  there are no structured Classes to progress on, your basic Roles (Tank, DPS, Healer) are very much in force, and the pletthora of 500+ abilities spread across 72 possible weapon combinations makes for thousands of possible combinations.Cons:The combat system is quasi-action based, and not very tight or responsive.
