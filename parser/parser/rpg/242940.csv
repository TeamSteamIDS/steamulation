												There is no other game quite like this. I have been playing it since its first release in 2001 and have yet to become tired of it. It's an RPG with great characters, plot deveopment and both outrageous and sophisticated humor. It leads you on from one story development to another, and just when you think you have a handle on what's going to happen it throws a curve and you're off on another tangent. I guess you could call it a role playing, film noir satire and space opera. This 12 year old  game looks great.The attention to visual detail is admirable. The music as well is inspired and puts a spin on each level. Don't forget side quests and areas to explore. It's quite possible you'll find things (or characters) on a subsequent playthrough you missed the first time which will add to the experience.			"

												9/10+ fantastic atmosphere, sci-fi fantasy setting, this game is all about the atmosphere and originality, it makes you think where all this creativity has gone in todays games, even indie games, which are so repetitive and pointless+ great story, great characters, great missions, great dialogues+ it plays more like an adventure game with lots of exploration+ battles are complex, you need to master them to progress, turn-based, you have to make strategic decisions especially at the beginning when you are still weak+ fluid controls, widescreen resolution (with a hack)- too much back tracking at the beginning, but you will need it to get to know the place- the ending.....

												Yes, it's old. And yes, it's totally worth it. Anachronox was intended as the first chapter of a trilogy (the game has a proper ending, but it's a ""chapter"" ending, not a ""series"" ending) and is affected by mild glitches, like falling out of the bounds of the map in some particular places, but nothing game-breaking. Also, you may have problems running it with the more recent systems.BUT, if you can overlook these minor faults, all that is left is a really good game. It plays like a third-person adventure game with   RPG elements and turn-based combat, with skill-related (like lockpicking) and story-related (and skippable, if it's a hassle for you) minigames. The combat is pretty much the less interesting part of this game, but the story, oh, the story.Story, setting, writing, character development, dialogues and voiceovers, they're excellent. Lots of humorous moments, the game delivers without being too cheesy. The background music makes a bit of atmosphere, but that's it, nothing really outstanding.The difficulty levels just define how spongy the enemies are, you can make it through the entire game without grinding levels, controls are ok, plenty of secret bits. You can watch again every cutscene from the main menu, very low replay value. Be sure to install the widescreen fix.It's also pretty cheap, even cheaper during sales. Definitively recommended.			"

												They really knew what they were doing there. Despite the low-res graphics, the game looks pretty darn good. It's like they actually used everything they could from the engine to tone up the atmosphere and details. Heck, the game's even got modding support. Too bad not much is done with it.One downside is that the game's a little slow at the beginning. And for some odd reason the camera pans out extremely slow when changing locations or switching combat turns.But the story's really worth it. Crazy characters, good dose of humour, and interesting places to explore.			"

												Anachronox is a cool console-style RPG, made with Quake 2 engine. Borrows heavily from classic JRPGs, such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6 and 7, etc. It is very good, but hard to recommend. Here's why:Pros:Great story, lots of awesome cutscenes, weird, but loveable characters, decent voice acting, good writing and sense of humor.Cons:BUGS! I don't believe you could even finish it after the initial release. Even after several patches, official and fan-made, it is still riddled with bugs. When playing for the first time I got permanently stuck in scenery soon after watching intro animation. Had to restart and watch it again (it is unskippable).Hyperactive, nauseating camera can be very annoying.Battles are nearly broken - very awkward interface, long repetitive animations, camera so busy flying around, you can't see what you are going to do. Only hardest skill level is somewhat challenging.Lots of backtracking. Just to switch characters in your party you have to literally leave the planet, by running through empty locations, going through several elevator animations, many loading screens, and then go back.The game was obviously rushed, some locations still have crude, unfinished look, some animations don't work. The graphics did not age really well and frequently looks dated even for 2001.Music is average. Moody, atmosheric synth stuff. Some tunes are good, most are bland and repetitive.My advice for those who still plan to play:Launch the game through ""Anachronox GCT setup"" app(already present in installation folder), DO NOT launch through Steam, otherwise most animations will be broken. Basically, the game will be unplayable.Use fast-forward button, it is '\' by default, I think. Or you'll go mad. Rebind to more accessible key.Enable ""save anywhere"" option and use it. It is not game-breaking and can potentially save you some more time.Make notes. The game is not able to track side-quests, only the main ones. Remembering side quests, hints and secret locations is up to you.			"

												I love this game. It's a western made jrpg on the quake 2 engine. It's pretty much a spoof on the save the world plot most rpgs have. Ya, it's old as ♥♥♥♥, the camera gets jerky, the combat anit too hot, and there's some bugs like falling through the world in this specific spot that was never fixed in patches, but everything else about the game is fantastic. Great world, great characters, and great ost. The written dialogue in this game is on another level though. Not many games have as much charm, attention to detail and self awareness in its dialogue like this game. Plus, it's dynamic. Talk to most npcs with each of your party members. Not only will you get a different response, but they are treated as a different character all together. Many lines had me laughing which is rare in an rpg. It's just the game really throws some curveballs at you with its delivery. You will run into some weird random dialogue, and it will come at the perfect time. It's just unpredictable, and it's refreshing because of it.How does the game play outside the combat? It honestly plays like an adventure game where you explore the world with your party members. You pick up items, interact with npcs, and use your party members to interact with certain world objects. Each party member has a world skill and can be only used when you have the member in your party. Most of the interactions are mainly minigames. Some of them are simple like picking a lock which becomes a game of hot and cold or opening a hidden lock by throwing a coin at it, and the mini game is lining up the coin with the switch x amount of times (not my personal favorite). There's some other ones that are goofy, but I won't spoil them or the other party members you get because that's one of the best parts!    Here comes the biggest flaw this game has: Some times you'll come across a world interaction such as a computer screen or a terminal lock, and you'll not be able to interact with it unless you have that party member. While most aren't mandatory, you will always run into them one way or another. So what do you do? You have to go all the way back to your base of operations and pick up that party member and backtrack all the way back to the interaction. It's a common problem that the metroidvania genre faces, but it adds a lot of depth and replayability incase you miss them. The backtracking becomes tiresome. However, luckly one of the programmers for the game added a speed hack button to speed up running everywhere in one of the patches. It makes things less tedious.Oh, and you will miss stuff in this game. Completionist be damned, because there's no way you'll find all of it without a guide (especially the PAL items). Even certain cutscenes, and areas because one section of the game has three distinct branching paths. It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to side quests at all. Once you find out that there are two npcs that work together it becomes a little easier, but early on you will have no clue who the hell some of these named characters are. The names in this game are completely out there, and some of them you wouldn't dare try and pronounce. Thankfully the side quest directions that are given are pretty clear so it's not some cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you will bang your head on a desk over and over for. Also, there's items you can only get after certain parts of the game. So the game encourages you to retread ground and retalk to every npc hoping you get some new item or some new side quest. None of the optional stuff is required of you, but you will be get much more powerful battle skills, and other equipment if you do so.Last but not least there's one mechanic of the game I didn't quite get. The Elementor system. It's supposed to be a way to customize your MysTech to be more powerful, but it's very complicated. You need different color beetles, flower petals, cobalt crawlers, and function hosts. You insert beetles on grids while given it a flower petal to level your beetle up, and using different color beetles to offset opposing elementals. Or something like that... I don't know, I just don't know! I don't even know what cobalt crawlers or function hosts do, but you need them! I did some small reading on it, and it involved math, and some other explanations on other things like grid layouts that made me go ""right....."" I didn't quite comprehend any of it. I ultimately gave up on the mechanic simply because the game gave such a small explanation, and that's it. You can beat the game without ever using it. However, it's power for your party that you'll never be able to access. This game came out in 2001. Obviously overshadowed because that was the year where so many great games came out. This one was buried among them all. Which is ashame because it's somewhat forgotten, and only really discussed among rpg enthusiasts (which is how I learned about it). There isn't anything quite like this game to this date. I know some of the things I mention might sound pretty cumbersome, but they are minor issues at best, and never really hold the game back. It's both bizarre, strange, compelling, and a lot of fun. It's the second best Ion storm game, and if a sequel (which was planned at some point) was kickstarted, it would be quite the task to make a game quite as crazy as this one. Give it a shot. It's pretty great.			"

												This is the best computer game in existence.Subtle drama. Subtle comedy. Brilliant each way. Gorgeous use of shape and colour coupled with such attention to detail that surpases the technical limitations and speaks directly to the imagination, making you forget how many polygons there are. Beautiful, epic, truly mindblowing story with vivid lovable characters and unforgettable twists. From every random NPC you can chat up to the major quests, it's infallibly fun and charming. It's a true masterpiece. Do yourself a favour and play it.			"

												I first played this game about 10 years ago and by the time I only had the demo version of it. But since then, I've always wanted to play the full game and now Steam's brought this opportunity! The game itself is much more than I expected, it's comedy, drama and many different places and situations. For those who are also fans of Deus Ex and Mass Effect, I'd strongly recommed this game because it's both of these games in it.			"

												This game is a real gem of a nostalgia. They don't make games like this anymore, and I mean that quite literally.This game took some serious risks in terms of design and originality, and pretty much all of them paid off. It takes a darkly comedic approach to science fiction, and manages to create a rather believable universe in the process. The seamless blend of rpg, sci-fi, and clever writing make this a game worth playing.However, the combat is abysmally slow and unavoidable; and much of the early game's experience is marred by pointless fetch-questing and backtracking. This can be aleviated by using the ""\"" key to fastforward the game, a fact which I was not aware of on my playthrough. I am glad I muscled through it however, as the game is quite remarkable in its presentation, and still holds up after all these years. If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, sci-fi, and dark humor, you'll really appreciate what this game has to offer.			"

												Anachronox. Think of Blade Runner mixed with KOTOR but without Lightsaber and religious nonsense.The game isn't very serious and most of the time leaning more towards comedic approach. And it works.Gameplay is separated into two categories, exploration and spelunking.1. When in exploration parts of the game there is almost no battles involved. Mainly running around the cities looking for clues.It runs very similar with KOTOR but with more interactions.+Story is great. Interstellar detective in action? Count me in.+Bizzare and yet unique characters. (A PLANET!!)+Dialogue are witty but sadly most of them aren't voiced (except cutscenes).+There is some degree of customizations. Espescially around the middle of the game when you found a certain ""magic.""+Cutscenes are a bit lacking for an RPG, though all of them are very well made and satisfying. (some really made me laugh so hard)-Lots of missable stuff. Reading walkthrough is recommended.-Steam overlay not working.-Some areas are too dark. So you will be playing with full gamma setting most of the time. It's annoying.-The camera is bad. When interacting with stuffs most of the time there will be a short cutcsene with camera panning around giving a cinematic feels. Unfortunately, this coupled with how small the areas you explore (forcing you to move around the camera lots of time) can easily cause motion sickness to some people (like me). This can be remedied with playing in short session.2. The spelunking part is your typical dungeon run in RPGs. Here you will be battling most of the time.+Enemies are placed on spesific parts on the map and you can see them so you can prepare yourself before battles.And they'll only respawn when you leaves the dungeon. The dev's are pretty generous with exp and item drops too.+Battle is your standard turn based JRPG style with ATB like in Final Fantasy titles.-Sadly the flow of battles are very slow thanks to the camera panning around whenever anyone doing something. And you'll have to wait until the camera slowly back to the default position before the game continue with the next set of commands. Oh and skill animations are pretty long too.Thankfully this version has the fast forward button implemented. It's like playing emulator with the throttle on.-The game is one hell of a BUGFEST. So save often in different save slots.Okay so overall this is a solid RPG. The only issues i have is the camera and the bugs.It's a bit sad actually that not much people knows about this game existence back in the day.It's even tops KOTOR in some aspect IMO.-------Score 8/10--------			"

												 I remember running across Anachronox when it was first released years ago. Magazines hailed it as the PC's answer to Final Fantasy VII and, as a huge RPG fan, I really wanted it. It even had 'Chrono' in the title. Chrono Trigger is my favorite game. Ever. Sadly, my PC was only good at playing the odd Sierra game and it wasn't until around a year ago that I finally got to play through it. Color me surprised when I found out Anachronox has more in common with those point and click adventure titles than a traditional RPG. And you know what? I love it. Anachronox is one of the best game ever made for the PC and I was so happy to see it brought to Steam that I bought it twice in the spam of a year and a half. It's that good. Without giving away too much of the story, I can tell you that the game holds one of the most memorable casts in the genre, backed up with some great (for the time) voice work. Battles are the standard RPG fare, but you'll be spending most of your time exploring the large worlds and taking in every aspect of history and lore. And that world they give us. Boy, it's a beauty.  If you're hungry for a RPG and looking for something just a little bit different, you won't be disappointed in Anachronox. It's got more than enough to interest you through it's beefy playtime, though I could see how it lacks in replayability. But after that first time; after that first taste; you'll realize that you're playing an overlooked classic. Hopefully this game finds the audience it's always deserved. (9/10) Recommened If You Like: JRPGs with a point-and-click adventure twist Witty humor, fantastic writing, and memorable characters "

												Amazing west made JRPG. WRPG? WMJRPG? ZOMGFBBQWMJRPG?Whatever you wanna call it, this game is absolutely fantastic, it was made by ION Storm (the Deus Ex team, not the Daikatana team), the story is both depressing and incredibly funny and optimistic at the same time, you meet tons of whacky and unforgettable characters along your journey, for example, your mouse pointer is a small ship housing the AI of your sarcastic dead secretary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Keep in mind though, mechanically speaking, it has quite a few problems that are more outdated stuff than anything.The graphics is the first thing that comes to mind, personally I don't mind a classic looking 3D game from the late 90's / early 2000's, especially if antialiasing is added through the drivers, but these might be a massive turn off for some, also there's no easy way to run this in widescreen aspect, so unless you look how to unlock widescreen resolutions *cough*[pcgamingwiki.com], you're mostly stuck with 4:3 aspect resolutions.This being a JRPG style game, means that the battles are naturally turn based with your party of characters and that's great really, especially because there can be a surprising amount of strategy to kill certain enemies and bosses. The only thing that it could've improved over it's japanese counterparts, is the overly long animation sequences, those can get under your skin if you see the same long animations over and over for a long game like this.Outside the battes though, it's just a wonderful fully realized massive 3D sci-fi world(s) to explore, it kinda reminds me a lot of Mass Effect for the many friendly (and non-friendly) alien races you get to meet, it also reminds me of a traditional point n' click adventure games, there's a lot of stuff to see, tons of people to talk to, tons of places to explore, it's just good stuff.So yeah, in conclusion, this is quite a fun west made JRPG with a few problems, but overall, I highly recommend it.

												It's an inventive and fairly original RPG that falls apart completely in the final third. More importantly though, the version on steam CANNOT BE COMPLETED, and will never be patched.

												Anachronox is my favourite JRPG.I'm not a fan of the aesthetic of many Japanese games, the animu nonsense does nothing for me. My favorite Japanese games are ones that bring a crossover of western and Japanese influences; like Deadly Premonition and Dark Souls.Similarly I'm not a fan of JRPGs, no game in the genre has really sold the mechanics of them to me in a way that I remember them fondly.Until Anachronox, which mixes JRPG mechanics with a western aesthetic, and I loved the result.I did not expect to love it, and the early part of the game probably put off a good many people, but it really picks up, I loved the humour of the game, and it contains some of my most memorable moments in video-games.

												Full disclosure: old friends of mine from art school worked on this game at ION Dallas back in 2001.  Courtesy of them a few of my jokes made it into this game.Anachronox was a labor of love for its team, the kind you rarely see today, and it shows in hundreds of small touches.  Unfairly dinged on release for using the aging Quake 2 engine (which didn't keep it from having excellent artwork and level design) and the team's proximity to the high-profile flop Daikatana, it's a vast and beautiful thing, with a tone that manages to encompass both warm, strange humor (Tom Hall is a loveable goofball) and universe-spanning epic seriousness.  We'll probably never know how its cancelled sequel, Anachronox Prime, would have wrapped up the story.Also one of your party members is a planet. So there's that.			"

												I've just started the game since I'm going to give a go at playing some of the best PC Rpgs from a list I read somewhere. So far it's got a really interesting setting and writing. I can imagine it being a big thing compared to console quality graphics at the time. I saw that Square-Enix had listed this as one of the games in it's Collective initiative that can be used for crowdfunding, so my hopes are the original devs will jump on it. Maybe they wanted the IP for themselves. Who knows.Use ""\"" if you need to speed up the combat or any other long scenes that seem to be marveling at the once great graphics.

												This is perhaps the single most amusing and entertaining old school RPG I have played. If you like tons of humor, including referential humor, and you also like going on a quest to save the galaxy with the most ragtag band of misfits imaginable, then this is the game for you.The game's story is simultaneously engaging and outrageous. The gameplay is a little clunky but it controls just fine. Mostly my issue with it is it is counterintuitive; to interact with your environment, you have to move the mouse around until a little icon pops up, and you move the camera by mousing to the screen edge. I'd rather play with a gamepad, but it isn't supported. The graphics are really, really, REALLY old school but they get the point across. If graphics are an important thing to you, don't expect much from this game. The sound is surprisingly good for its time; I particularly like that most of the game is fully voiced. I don't find the game to have much replayability, however, although it can be worth it to find what you missed. Irritiating as it is, I recommend playing this game with a guide for all the side quests. Many of the side things you can do in Anachronox do not appear in your quest log, and it is vry easy to miss content. In my case, I probably will play Anachronoc again every two years or so. The story is that worthwhile.Oh, and don't wprry about leveling up, the game auto levels you to the 'minimum level' when you reach certain areas, which makes a good tactician very unlikely to lose the game. Especially if you keep items on hand for healing and so forth. If you want grinding, exhausting challenge and the need to level up as much as possible, play it on hard.(Overall 9/10, Story 10/10, Gameplay 9/10, Graphics 4/10, Sound 9/10, Replayability 7/10)			"

												Fans of Old-School RPG fans, this is a must must buy on sale. Less than two bucks for 20+ hours of entertainment? You'll be hard-pressed to find that anywhere else.I mean yeah the controls are kinda awkward, but it's a 2001 game. You'll have to give the graphics a pass, too. What's timeless and the strong suits of the game is the turn-based play-style, the intricate environments and the collectables/quests inside of them, but above all else some of the best humour dialogue ever written in a game. It will have you laughing out loud and talking to NPCs. There's a LOT to miss in this game, so playing with a guide is essential to keep you ahead of the curve. It's a very tough game, so first timers should really play it on easy to get a feel for everything. The soundtrack is also stellar. Some of its issues would be a lack of a working Steam overlay and resolution issues. Luckily, my boy Wolfenstrike's got the hookup to fix it. As a guy that never plays RPGs, this was a real treat. If your backlog isn't too long, I'd put this on the shortlist.			"

												Another Cult classic! Superb story and gameplay is above average even compared to games today, sadly the graphics are dated, meaning players will not have too much eye-candy, but I would personally say the whole immersiveness of the story will be more of a distraction. What we have to remember is this is a very early game, so give it some credit and try it before you knock it.What I like:*Gameplay, the storyline and missions are entertaining as well as a challenge.*Unique characters, and their abilities have to be used strategicaly, to unlock hidden areas, and somtimes even progress in the game.*Side quests, and character development will keep the player occupied for many hours, revisiting old locations etc.What I didn't like:With the exception of the (hive) there are few areas where hostile NPCs will spawn and this can affect how fast the player can level up and gain expereince.Character abilites are not deveopled with exp points, but rather encounters later in the game. (have to speak to the correct person etc etc before you get master level in the ability).Overall:Despite its dated graphics, and the few bad points, its a game that should be played at least once, and you will probally come back to it again and again as I have, the immersion in the game is still there even today.

												I remember when this game came out in 2001. Eidos and Ion Storm were similar to what Ubisoft, Square Enix and Bethesda are today. I just got done playing Deus Ex which I consider to be one of the best FPS RPG of its time and considering this game was made by the same company I was excited to start playing it. I was pleasantly surprised by this game..The story has a unique sci-fi story as well as hilarious character interaction. ""Sly Boots"" is the down and out bumbling detective looking for work and stumbles upon a series of events that threaten the universe. Playing this title now in 2014 definitely shows its age because of its graphics, but not really a dealbreaker because it's artistically done well with a top notch music score.I would still recommend this game overall because the developers definitely took the time to craft a unique creative experience, but this game is mostly for people who have the nostalgia for old school story driven games. It is much more of a cerebral experience with hilarious character interaction. Otherwise you're just going to get bored after a few hours of play and move on.			"

												Contrary to the general comparison, I'd argue this is less like FF7 and more like Grandia, if set in an Omikron style setting.  Needless to say, it's smaller in scale than the megabudget Squaresoft title, but far more enjoyable and rewarding to those who prefer humor, tactics and exploration over grinding and gunblades.  Being over a decade old, it's dirt cheap (unlike the re-release of FF7's PC port) and can often be found on sale for a low 99 cents.  Are you too cheap to part with 99 cents?  GFC what?  Stop living in that poison from the past, it's time to live in the future!  With Anachronox, (a.k.a. 'poison from the past')!			"

												Anachronox is an active time battle sifi CRPG.The plot of the game is simple enough to understand, The main character, Sylvester ""Sly Boots"" Bucelli, is a run down drunken private detective living in the gutter. Until one day he decides to get his ♥♥♥ in gear and actually take a job from someone, that person being grumpos, a crazy old coot with an obsession with mystech. From there, they follow the mysteries of mystech and gain a number of weird companions along the way as they try to solve its meaning, all while space time itself begins to distort and warp around them.Gameplay is split into two parts, combat and exploration. The exploration is simple enough, you can only have three characters in the party at any given time, each one being able to have unique interactions with the world and use special abilities which allow them to access items and areas otherwise impossible to get to. You mainly run around areas talking to NPC's until you move on with the story. While exploring, its possible to unlock your characters personal abilities by doing certain actions, or obtaining certain objects. You can also shop for mystech and other items, or try to collect random items for a completion bonus.Combat is similar to the final fantasy series in that every character has a gauge which fills up, eventually allowing them to take one of several actions.  Attack (which is modifed not only in damage, but range, depending on the weapon equipped), use item (pretty obvious), use ability (each character having access to several unique ones which use bars of a special gauge, which fills over the course of the battle), move and use mystech (each mystech has a special effect and can be cast as if you were using a spell, with upgraded versions of the same spell costing more power to cast. power is a static number, only recharged by sleeping or using an item). Each battle takes place on a grid, with nodes on it that can only be occupied by one unit at a time. This allows you to position units between another and an enemy, preventing that enemy from targeting them, at the risk of putting the one inbetween in danger and so on. However, moving is a single action, so you could waste a chance to get a good hit in.Now, this game is deeply flawed, on many levels. It runs perfectly fine, but everything is so slow, not due to the engine or performance, just because of how it was designed. Battles take an extremely long time, even short ones, to the point where you will be spending about two or three minutes just going through one encounter, with very little actually happening. Walking around the world is also painfully slow, it takes forever to get anywhere at all, making a simple trip to the shops, from one area over, a real pain. There are also needlessly long cutscenes, not like metal gear solid where its all talking, just long pauses of silence as you go up and down a lift, or through a door, and they happen every time you use them. The only reason i didn't put this game down was because i found a mod that allowed me to speed everything up by holding down a button, which makes the game bearable.It also has an extremely confusing system with mystech. At first you just get simple lumps, which are fine, but later on you get these multi mystech objects that require you to slot bugs into grooves, feed these bugs flower petals and try to figure out a good combination. It does try to explain this system, but it was so utterly confusing that i had to look up how to even get it to work properly. The mechanic isn't broken, just very badly designed. The thing is, if you do crack it, you've won the game, its very easy to make really powerful mystech spells with this system and spam them repeatedly, just by stocking up on items to restore your power.Then there is the side quests and collecting random objects for a big reward near the end. alot of them are very easy to miss, as are the items that grant your characters new powers, unless you have a walkthrough, you are not going to be able to get half of the abilities and weapons in this game, because some of these could only be found by talking to every NPC as every character and stumbling upon the things. You also cannot go back to many areas in the game, meaning that if you missed that one ability earlier on, you can never get it again, even if you do return to the area, it'll have changed, so that NPC you needed to meet is now gone.The game is also meant to be very funny, but i can only think of one or two times where i actually laughed. Its humor is really simple and often times just really weak, alot of the time its too childish for my tastes as well, and at its worst, totally brings me out of the game and just makes me want to do anything else but keep listening. The game looks nice enough for the time when it came out, and with the mod that allows you to speed things up, its an enjoyable sit, but there are many other titles that are far better than this, each one worth your time more than anachronox. If you are a fan of Ion storm and its very off the wall humor, you may like this, and final fantasy fans might find something to enjoy from the battle system, but beyond that i can't see too many people getting through this without a guide.

												Despite not even trying to understand or use the bugs and elementor hosts, I massively enjoyed this game.  The last boss was very fun because he actually required strategy - something very rare these days in games.  Also, there is no way of skipping cutscenes or exiting battles.  Most times force quitting a game ever.  This was a must when you get to the final boss and realize your party is horribly equipped for the battle.  Sylvester ""Sly"" Boots carried the group throughout nearly the entire game.  Is that a sign of bad game design or good gaming skills?  Only Buddha knows.			"

												This is a game that gets better as you play it.  When I first started playing I was a little skeptical about Anachronox being a decent game because the first 5 hours or so are pretty lame,  It is a lot of go here and talk to this person and then go and do this etc.  The battle system is kind of generic feeling, at times the game may get a little buggy, but if you can look around some of the games rough edges the games storyline picks up and things you have to do are more enjoyable.  A lot of people enjoy this game because of the humor element it has as well.  If you can get this game cheap and want to play a sci fi type of rpg game I recommend picking this up.			"

												An inter-galactic evil threatens to destroy the multiverse and only this universe’s B-Team stands in its way in Anachronox, a sci-fi RPG with an unlikely cast of characters including a washed up detective, a snarky robot, a miniaturized planet, and a former superhero. Their adventures take place inside Sender One, a humongous space sphere containing numerous planets inside of it and which is also the means of transport between them using FTL devices called sender spikes.One of the things I really liked about this game was how it didn’t take itself too seriously. Many other space-opera games like Mass Effect typically have a constantly sobering or depressing doom hanging over everyone’s head and light moments of humor often come off as sarcastic. Instead, Anachronox presents a theme that could have been pulled straight out of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, rife with random quirky and satirical humor.  Even your crew is ridiculously assembled with each member getting their own unique mini-game ranging from telling miniature council members to shut up or pressing the right buttons to fill a character’s lungs with air so they can move people aside via long-winded arguments. Combat in this game features a Chrono Trigger style encounter system where you see the baddies in exploration mode before you encounter them at which time everyone moves into place for turn-based combat. Speaking of placement, you can move freely across empty grid points to get line of sight to a target or to close the distance for a melee attack. There are also sometimes environmental switches that players can activate as a means of blocking routes or damaging enemies. Eventually you unlock a kind of equip-able magic similar to Final Fantasy 7’s material system except with each character having a unique affinity allowing them to cast higher levels of specific elements while still being able to use lesser-attuned magic if desired, albeit at lower levels.Of course even an AAA production like Anachronox has its faults. At its release date in 2001 the graphics were a bit dated with blocky character design that has gotten even worse with age. The music is often repetitive and level design feels empty with many long vacant hallways and sparsely populated cityscapes. Thankfully, most of the annoyances are mitigated by a patched-in taxi system and fast forward option. Pressing the backslash key at any point in time produces an effect similar to increasing speed in a console emulator on PC. Boring long corridors? Fast forward. Slow Elevator? Fast forward. Spell animation taking too long? Fast forward. The ability to fast forward at almost any time allows you to cut out all the “filler content” in this game so you can get right to the good stuff, something I wish I could do in many other PC games. Anachronox is a welcome change from your typical cookie-cutter RPG and despite its age I still found myself enjoying brief moments of amazement and amusement. My only real gripe is that the game’s ending leaves it open for a sequel that was never made due to the dev team closing shop before it could be completed. One can only hope that this would-be series catches the eye of a new developer capable of treating the IP with the respect it deserves.  "

												Before starting, I bought this game out of nostalgia and because I never came to possess a legal copy in the past since it was never sold officially in my home country. That explains my low playtime, but I did at least 1 full playthrough. This game needs (and deserves) a remake, plain and simple.Maybe Nathan Fillion should do voice acting for Sly Boots, since his Firefly character was obviously inspired by this game. Heck, he even looks like him. Add a little bit of Lexx and Andromeda and you get the humour and artstyle. Only that this game does it MUCH better than the aforementioned three.Want an example? The mousepointer in this game is a real ingame object. It is a flying saucer containing a hologram of your former secretary that died because of one of your many mistakes. So the game starts with your mousepointer reminding you what a worthless bum you are.I always gripe about the ridiculously predictable plots in modern RPG games...Well this will certainly not happen in this game! There is NO WAY you will anticipate whats coming next, trust me!!! This plot has no twists, it has black holes sucking you in and spitting you out on the other side of the galaxy. And this is no spoiler, black holes are beneath the weirdness of this game.I always gripe about the ridiculously superficial stereotypes posing as real people in modern RPG games...Not in this game, you and your allies ""stick out"" of the masses, so to say. Well I really don't want to spoil all the fun, but you never found allies like that in any other game, and never will afterwards, GUARANTEED!Everything else is shoddy, sadly.Graphics may be just bearable for old-school gamers like me, but the combat scares away even me. Combat is an obstacle you will have to take to reach the cutscenes, dialogs and the puzzles.If I could interest you in this flawed gem of a game, maybe you should check out some youtube vids concerning gameplay. If you can live with it, than get it. And if you are an experienced modder, maybe write a mod to tweak combat somehow? There is a SDK out there...			"

												Anacrhonix is a good game.  Unfortunately it may be more accurate to say that this was a great game in the early 2000 when released.Its a bit awkward to play by today’s standards.  First, there is no widescreen support.  Luckily, someone smarter than I made a config file that will let you run the game in 1080p or whatever you would like.  http://www.wsgf.org/dr/anachronox/enThe controls are also a bit challenging.  The game uses a mixture of awkward mouselook controls without strafing mixed with point-and-click adventure mode when your character has stopped.  Dedicating the controls to one of the other would have been much better, but it is what it is.The graphics are challenging.  True, getting the resolution corrected helps, but everything is just so ugly.  For its time it was good, but other games of the era such as the original half life look much better.But it is a good game, so good that some people will even watch a 2 hour youtube “movie” of Anachronix.

												If you love saving the universe with a collection of reluctant oddballs, the balls don't come odder.  A sci-fi noir that feels like Deus Ex written by Douglas Adams. and indeed Anachronox was developed at Ion Storm Austin.  As you can see from the pictures it's not just Sly's hair that's late 90's and it is built on a modded Quake 2 engine which was pretty old even in 2001.  Technical Issues - Bizzarely 5 minutes into the game getting trained to fight I experienced a glitch which causes me to drop through the world while going through a repeat of the second cutscene from a minute earlier.  I had to find the noclip cheat and fiddle my way back in (it wasn't even that easy with noclip) and drop down to the training arena thing.  It was odd, I was using a machine with a XP OS, but it was the only single technical issue I had (apart from some of faces which were downright ugly).Setting - Despite the aforementioned ugly, the setting was pretty varied and pretty fun.  Another late 90's-early 00's thing was the reward for (and desire to) talking to everyone and snuffling around every alley and corner.  It was a golden age for persistent people-poking and cupboard raiding.  This includes weapons, cash and TACO's (Totally Arbitrary Collectible Objects).  I laughed, I totally got the tongue-in-cheek meta irony....I went on hunting them regardless.Combat is semi-turn based, where the cooldown between actions makes it turn based but if you hang about eating a sandwich the enemy will keep taking turns.  This style of combat suffered from getting a bit tedious early on before having a party, then slid (over many hours) to too easy before a sudden notch up of difficulty requiring collected objects at the end.  The little cutscenes for dramatic weapon actions were nice, but I could have done with being able to press space and skip them after 200 times or something.    The story world is immersive and as you can only have three party members at a time, there are things that happen and dialogue that only happens (and even a special short level for one character which depends one a character taken along somewhere earlier) depending on your choices.  None of them are epic or world breaking, but if you like a character and keep them around you get to see/hear more of them.  Different characters also had powers accessed through minigames, which broke up fights/wandering and it (of course) opened up new areas in places you had been before.  But the story did make me laugh in quite a few places and was engaging.Overall if you like your RPG singleplayer, not taking themselves too seriously but still with a world to get stuck into, I recommend this game.  Despite my comments on combat for every minute spent being slightly mildly irked there was an hour of exploring and laughing.  So go for it.  Especially given it's only a fiver.			"

												I've been reading some negative reviews of this game and most of them seem to refer to the 'Whackmaster Jack' bug. Yes there is a bug in the tutorial. Just suck it up, reload your last save and play it again, because once you get past that you will discover one of the funniest stupid Japanese style RPG's you have ever played. The game has a great sense of humor, the story is amazing and the settings are interesting. If you are a patient person take the time to talk to the NPC's because they will often have a fun and interesting story to tell.  The atmosphere of each of the locations in the universe is very diverse and draws the player in this world like no other game I have ever played. I can only imagine how it would have looked if it was made today.The main plot line very engaging although you will have to get through a lot of wacky adventures to finally hear it. This game may not be polished and glossy and it does contain some bugs and problems, but if you are able to get past that you will enjoy it thoroughly for its humor, emotion and rich story lines. You can feel the passion, love and ingenuity the creators poured into this game and that it what makes it great in my book.5/5 Brebulan Bongo Gems			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.  An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given.  Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 8AnachronoxPurchase Date: 7/23/2014Anachronox came out back in 2001, but I wasn't interested in it at the time.  But over the years I have heard good things about it, so I didn't hestitate to get it when I saw it as part of a Humble Bundle.  Now that I'm 8 games in with my series of reviews, I'm starting to realize just how many games I've picked up this way.I admit when I first hopped into the game, it was a little jarring going back to graphics based on the Quake 2 engine.  Everything has a low poly count, because of course this game came from an era where 3d graphics was still in it's infancy.  And yet, I found I got used to it really quickly.  The characters in particular I felt like they did a great job with given the limitations of what could be done at the time.The main character in this game is Boots, a down-on-his-luck private investigator who happens to owe a lot of money to a crime lord.  I find this out immediately as the game opens with Boots getting the crap beat out of him.  I definitely got a sense of the game's charm right off the bat.As for the gameplay itself, primarily Anachronox plays like a role playing game, but it also has some adventure game elements to it.  It has a pointer which will animate when you mouseover an item of interest.  So while I am moving around like I would in a typical first person game, I'm also pointing and clicking things to see what they do.  It took me a bit to get used to it at first, because the mouse doubles as both moving the pointer and the camera.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it cumbersome to use, but it took a little getting used to for me.Like any role playing game, I found myself interacting with various characters.  I felt the writing was pretty good here, but the conversations are also fairly basic.  Don't expect huge branching dialogs here.The game works in a combat tutorial by having Boots go to a trainer.  The combat is pretty straightforward.  Combat is turn based, and plays much like most JRPGs, with options for a basic attack, using items, and launching a special attack.  Some fights will add movement options as well, but this varies from fight to fight, so it's not like a tactical RPG where the entire battle takes place on a grid.I didn't make it very far into the game in the first hour, especially since I spent most of my time running from point A to point B.  I didn't see any kind of in-game map, although at one point I ran into a little robot who offered to lead me to a place of my choosing.I ended my playthrough inside of Frank's Flophouse, trying to find someone who was staying there.  I figured out what room they were in, but when I clicked on the door, the game would just say ""Seems Interesting"".  It seems like this is the game's generic message for when you click on something that is clickable, but it doesn't do anything right now.  Not sure why I couldn't just knock on the door.  I get the feeling this is one of those games where I'm going to have to find a walkthough to help me get past the occasional spot where I get stuck in.All in all though, I had a lot of fun in the time I spent in Anachronox.  I think if you are willing to look past the aged graphics and occasional clunkiness of the game, there is a lot of fun to be had here.			"

												I only vote positive because this game is from the golden age and at the time it was great.  And it's from Eidos, and Eidos can do no wrong.The combat system takes forever.  Back then I was young and had endless time for gaming but now I don't, and it deters me from playing.If you are a young person playing this, I salute you for going back (most young gamers I've met don't go retro) but I assume most people re-playing are going nostalgic.  I never played it in the heyday, so now that I'm busy it's kind of a chore to finish.  The story is really good, the gameplay is fun, but the fighting system is depressingly slow.  No glitches as far as I've seen.  Great if time is not a factor.			"

The characters are briliant the story is grand and the setting is always changing. The combat is easy to understand and master (With the occasional headaches of the enemy attacking you before you can move/attack or item use.

The combat system is classic jrpg for the most part and it's not very exciting but the game is packed with snappy dialogue and a ton of minigames and quests to go on. Very fun and enjoyable game that also holds up quite well even a decade after release. Well worth the 7 bucks.			"

												I was genuinely surprised at how entertaining this game is. I have no history of ever playing it prior to a week ago when I tried it for the first time, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me. This game retains a lot of quality story telling and game mechanics that trumps many of today's story-heavy AAA games. The turn-based battles will remind you of earlier Final Fantasy at first, but you quickly will find them to be a bit unique and perhaps even more entertaining. I'd like to point out at this juncture that the backslash key (\) will help you speed up the game clock and can make slow battles or travels pass a bit quicker.The visual quality has aged quite a bit, however I found a guide in the community hub to patch the game with a custom and modern resolution and even add some opengl enhancements like bloom and SSAO. Just be careful with the bloom adjustments as they can make the LockPicking widget UI very difficult to see.I've ran into several little bugs and glitches already, but nothing that has been truly upsetting yet. Mostly I've been breaking out of map boundaries and getting stuck, almost each time while i was trying to speed back and forth between distant locations on a map while holding the \ button down to travel around faster. Difficulty wise, this game is quite comfortable - I found I like the casual playstyle of Easy mode for this title, but the normal and hard modes seem to add a bit of noticeable challenge during battles, if you are in for more than the story. I've also found multiple text walkthroughs and guides available on the Internet still to help me when I get stuck with an actual quest/mission.I would recommend this game if you enjoy sci-fi stories that take place in space. I can't think of any particular other franchises that this reminds me of most (meaning it comes across to me as a pretty original piece of work), however the protagonist character immediately reminded me of Nathan Fillion playing Captain Reynolds in the Firefly tv-series. The player character's attire and game ambiance led me to that conclusion very quickly and stuck in my mind as I found the cutscene humor to also remind me of the character, in a way.			"

												An interesting (but very old) sci-fi adventure game. Its age really shows in the graphics, UI and controls. The world and the plot seems somewhat interesting, but the game has a very dark and gloomy atmosphere to it, which feels depressive and made me put down the game after half hour.But I recommend it for trying out as a very old game with some intriguing elements. Try to get it on a sale or bundle though, I don't think it's worth £4.99.			"

												I played some into the game - and I really, really like it.I never really played Anachronox back in the day. But lo! With the modern convenience of Steam, now I can, super easily.For $7 you could do worse. I would say, despite all the bugs, despite all the downright WEIRD behaviour of the game at times, it is DEFINITELY worth picking up. Even as just a token purchase, showing that you're totally in with the cool kids who play old games or whatever reasons you've got. I'm already in love with the characters.And I'm only an hour into the game.There's ways, I hear, to get the game working properly, but I've not got around to trying to fix it yet.			"

												This hurts, because it has humorous and intelligent writing, but time wasn't a friend to Anachronox. We're seeing a game that you're rooting for lose the good fight here.I'll start with the graphics. You know, graphics aren't everything, but...YOWZA! It's almost terrifying, at times, how truly bad its graphics are, even with low expectations. ""Buzz, your girlfriend... WOOF!""Still, graphics are graphics. However hideous, if there's great gameplay, like a good combat system, you can find the good game hidden underneath. Anachronox's combat is just as bad as its graphics; I'm a fan of turn-based combat, but this is too dated, even for me. It has no depth and takes too long. Makes you wonder what you're doing with life. This is an easy nomination for game most in need of a remake -- said as a compliment, in the sense that it deserves to be remade. Well, reworked too. Rework its combat and update its graphics and it will deserve high praise. As it stands, I respect its wit and its style, but Anachronox didn't make it out of 2001 in one piece.For alternate suggestions, I highly recommend Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Similar game that has held up far better.			"

												The game started off so so good, but never really took us anywhere. It's like a great joke lead up that never gets to the punchline, never a crux, and there was so many game breaking bugs that really spoiled the whole attraction.One bug (right on the last boss) stopped me from completing it, due to a glitch which didn't allow my people to move into the inner circle. I tried restarting many times, but the bug was always present, no matter which save game i used.Highly disappointing from a developer that i loved, it feels like it just needed another 6 months in tweaking bugs and story to be a classic like Deus Ex.

												I first heard about this in an article I read about the 100 greatest rpgs of all time. It looked really interesting, described as a cross between JRPGs and CRPGS, and it seems to have quite a cult following.   And I’m glad it only cost about £1.50 coz it just didn’t gel with me.I’m not saying that this is a bad game; it’s just not my cup of tea. I actually really wanted to like it....I didn’t get the humour very much.  It’s very in your face and unsubtle, and overall I felt like the game designers were trying too hard.  Then, the combat just really bored me, and I game to loath the slow-paced, unexciting battles.  Mixed with a slow start to the story, I just couldn’t be bothered playing anymore.I might be in the minority here, as many people LOVE this game, but it just didn’t click with me.  Maybe it’ll click with you though. "

												I really want to like this game. I saw that it was cyberpunk/film noir inspired and got really excited for it. But pretty much everything about it is absolutely abysmal. For starters, you're never really given an explanation of HOW to play the game. I spent a solid half hour trying to figure out the controls. The graphics were understandably made in 2001, but they're so bad it makes the game practically unplayable. Battles are slow and the story isn't that great in my opinion. I barely even understood the story because there was no background. The opening cutscene is a bunch of spaceships flying around and all of a sudden you're some guy named Boots getting punched in the face and falling off a building. And apparently you're just supposed to know what to do from there. That's literally all the information you're given at the beginning of the game.Unfortunately, I'd say this was a total waste of my money.This game needs a reboot with less glitches, proper explanations, and graphics that are at least decent enough to make the game PLAYABLE.

												This is a hard pass. I heard decent things, but never played it when it came out.+Cool-ish universe. Couldn't get over the controls, so I can't elaborate.-Hilariously bad graphics. This makes the Final Fantasy 7 ""Lego"" models look stellar. A lot of the angles/framing is very cinematic, but it's completely wasted by the dated (and warped looking) models.-Abysmal controls. There is almost no rhyme or reason to them, they have a mouse cursor, but your mouse also controls your camera? It sounds okay, but WOW this got ♥♥♥♥ed. The idea of playing even a few more minutes of this is making my wrists seize up.I guess another positive is that in this day and age you can just watch a playthrough if the story is really interesting to you, but this is a great example of a game that has not aged well at all.

It's an old, somewhat experimental game, so I can deal with all that.What killed it for me was the interminable, unskippable, painfully boring combat. Imagine the worst possible version of Final Fantasy style combat and you're probably close. Then add a half-baked, grid-based positioning system that tries to be tactical, but really only exists to waste your time. Even the fast-forward function isn't enough to save it.			"

												I'm writing this review with only a few hours playing because I think in my profession it is important to save people from undue psychological stress.  Anachronox is a stressor to the Nth degree.  However well the developers made the game they wanted to, however well the outcome came for them, however on time and on budget it was; the game still will kill someone with certain somatic disorders because of its execution.  In Anachronox you move a few characters around to interact different ways with the 3rd person explorable world.   This world you move in is guaranteed to give a heart condition to someone who already has a marginally stressful job.  While exploring you will be met with transition event after transition event, and a quest every step of the way that will bring you back through every event you saw while getting to the point you were supposed to be at.  Does the way I explain it sound confusing?  It is and it isn't.  You will remember how to get around, but will you like getting around? Maybe if you're a kid without any problems in the world or someone who was able to retire sitting on enough money to never worry about being a member of the working poor you would be such a person to like venturing around in Anachronox.  When it comes to someone like me (and most likely someone like you) “no” you will not like venturing around the city planet that is Anachronox despite it having all charm of 90s cartoonary or a JRPG interface with many colorful party members. Skip this game and save your blood pressure medication for something else more important in life than a videogame.  Anachronox will drive you nuts.			"

EFF NO! this game is doesnt even tells you anything you have to figure out all by your freakin self. this so bad Ion storm studios is one of the worst studios ever. and that a surprise cause that includes jhon romero wich made Doom and Quake wich are one of the best games of all time. so what the EFF got wrong!if you want to play a bad go play Alien: cloniel marines or even Ride To Hell youll have more fun at them than this piece of crap!FINAL VERDICT: 2/10! must NOT own! and im glad i didnt spend money on it cause i got it through a humble bundleso please do yourself a favor and dont pick this up!

												Never in my life have I seen such a piece of sh** like this.. the textures are worst  than the first 3D games made 15 years ago.. second WTF man why do you force users to watch your crapy really-really-long intro? I just hate that, it's disrespectul to the users, if I want to skip the damn intro I should be allowed to.Second, when I got bored (in about 5 mins of gameplay) of this crap, I went back to windows only to deal with windows in 640x480 resolution.. yeah, the game doesn't change it back when you quit it..Sucks.. SUCKS!!!! I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game even if it was at 1 cent.			"

												An absolute classic. A JRPG designed by one of the 2 out of 3 good teams at Ion Storm. A funny game with terrific voice acting, characters, and plot. Highly recommended and maybe we'll get a sequel before I die which is just as good as the original.			"

												Plotwise it's a good game, the game has a colorful cast of characters and it's filled with hilarious and sad moments. Then there's the rest, lots and lots of bugs, overly long sidequests that will make you go insane, you'll hardly be able to get everything by the time you get to the last area and some bosses were more tedious than hard. I still enjoyed it though.			"

												I love Anachronox. But I love it despite itself.Be warned- The game starts with a very slow first act. I estimate that it's about three to five hours of plodding around. Once the game gets going, it explodes into a wonderful funny and surreal sci-fi epic that managed to surprise me several times with  depth and twists.			"

A super good old school sci-fi RPGI have to say, when I tried this game for the first time, I had doubts. After I got used to the game, I fell in love with it. It has a really good story, the combat system is super as well. Don't look at the graphics, you will get used to it, because the story and the game in overall makes up for it. "

												I love finding discovering old games from the past, especially ones I had heard of as a kid just never played. While being a big fan of late 90s/early 00s games and the Dues Ex franchise I had to check this out. It's briliant. I can't say I'd played a turn based RPG on the PC before, so that was interesting to see. As a guy who loves games filled with narrative this was right up my street. Talking to every NPC around gives you loads of bits to explore, stories to hear and more items to acquire. The humour is a key factor in this, and it really brings the game to life. Although the story takes a while to take off, once it's going it really sucked me in. The only let down really was the combat, even with the ability to speed up camera changes, it didn't feel like it had a massive impact on the story. I know that sounds ridiculous, but the majority of the battles didn't feel as impacting as the puzzle solving you had to do. Well worth getting though, there's alot of gameplay here!			"

												Made by the development company responsible for Deus Ex (Ion Storm), this game is utterly enjoyable on many levels. It brings to the table an RPG-style system similar to FF7 and combines it with an epic plot, lovable characters, and wonderfully-written (often hilarious) dialogue. Also, in true RPG fashion, there are many side-quests, mini-games, and easter eggs to be discovered.If there are any criticisms I have, it's that the game progresses in a very linear fashion from one ""hub"" to the next; you have lots of freedom on each world you visit, but little choice in where you go next. Plus, because the game is quite old, the graphics will seem pretty dated (think Quake 2 era graphics). If you can set this aside, though, it's some of the most fun you'll have playing an RPG/adventure game.			"

												No matter what recent developments have been made in gaming, Anachronox will always stand out from the rest as a truly unique experience with a satisfying story, well-executed combat, and an immersive world.

												Dark witty humor, creative ideas, varied and colorful gameplay and some of the most brilliant characters to ever grace the medium. You cannot skip the cutscenes. But why would you want to do that.Classic, forgotten piece of alien art.			"

												Anachronox is an enjoyable game where the main positives are that the characters and story are well written. Developed by Iron Storm and underperforming on the market, this game is a hidden gem of the past. It takes the inspirations from JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and gives it witty story telling with some hilarious references and mockery. Negatives:1. Poor level design - Levels are designed in a very long linear fashion and often you are required to backtrack several times to complete objectives.2. Animations are SO slow, especially during combat as it is turn based. Just having the 3 of your party do their attacks can take over 30 seconds.3.  Unskippable cutscenes4. The game does a terrible job at describing Mystech effects, skills and several important items such as the Elementor (Main damage dealer requiring specific combinations to deal different types of effects/damage).*1-3 can be semi-remedied by pressing (\) to fast forward animations.All in all the game was enjoyable to a degree. It has that old-school feel of classic story telling of likeable characters and a well written plot. I would not replay this game at all due to the problems above though, as it made the game feel like a chore in a majority of playtime. It's great for a single playthrough if you're looking to kill time.			"

												Anachronox is a game I have fond memories of, I enjoyed to story so much as a kid I played it multiple times, most were attempts left unfinished but I still remember my reaction to finishing it the first time.I wont spoil anything here.The story is very good, not perfect, its mostly text on a screen with a few cutscenes that arn't pretty. it even says on the back of the box, that this game requires a sense of humour, if you let your self become absorbed you won't regret the experiance. it is one of a kind in my mind and even now I feel an attatchment towards the characters who I can't really forget.

												I lost my Anachronox cd in the past, and I got a key from Humble Bundle. Man!!! My past was brought back! The slapstick comedy has aged, but it classically keeps the story going. It's a reminder of an age when games couldn't have powerful and realisic graphics, but had to have a fleshed out and solid story to tell.Anachronox is a slow start for an RPG, but always puts a smile on gamers who give it a chance. It's graphics haven't aged well, but it's story still works from start to finish. Re-live a classic and when you get the time, give this a chance.			"

												This game. THIS game, is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. A fun combat system with big spells, great characters and even decent humor. A fun and cool sci-fi universe. This game has it all. The only problem is the ending. It's not a bad ending by any means, but the problem is the ending is too good! Which leads to *SPOILER*. The game was meant to be the first part in a, two part or triliogy, so it leads into a sequel that will never be. Other than that I can not recommend this game enough.			"
