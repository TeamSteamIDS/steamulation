												10/10This game is amazing. It is different from most games out there, which may bother some people.You run your own super sentai studio. which involves the management stuff: hire actors, buy/craft equipment, upgrade studio, take care of your fan base, hire marketing agencies. And of course, there is the action: fighting monsters, mecha battles. The pros:- Amazing soundtrack. Really, really, really amazing. You'll feel like a child again watching power rangers, black kamen rider or your favorite super sentai show.- Beautiful graphics. The very best 2D Pixel Art style.- Humor everywhere. A lot of hidden references. Pretty cool!- Great squad customization. You cannot create your own character. You assign actors to squad's roles and you can choose their color, name, skill, equips, weapon. You can also choose the name of the squad, the name of the mecha, the catching phrase.- Solid combat. Very fun, specially if you follow the director's instructions. - Lots of content. This game is huge. You can have 15 hours+ of gameplay. The cons:- Can't stop playing it!			"

												Enjoying turn based roleplaying? Enjoying squad based character control? Enjoying Sentai?Get this Game, Now! You don't even need to read further.A long, long time ago, when I first heard about Chroma Squad, I instantly backed these lovely people at Behold Studios and read every single update they came up with. Seeing this game progress over time was just amazing. Especially to see, how the developers sometimes struggled, but what they have now delivered is really big fun.You play as a 5 people stunt crew that worked for a very mad producer but decide to quit and create your own show.The game basically exists from 3 parts:- Studio management (Buying Props, handling Marketing, dealing with spam mails)- Episode recording (fights of your squad agains a bunch of enemies, kicking butts)- Mecha fights (mini game type 1-on-1 fights)The mechanics of the game seem to be very simple, and I guess they really are. But the gags that have been hidden everywere are just great (I guess, a lot of people might miss a lot, as they are too young).There is only bad thing I can tell about the game:@DEVS: Please add that the virtual keyboard pops up, when I play on a Tablet on my train journeys :)			"

Chroma SquadDeveloper: Behold StudiosPublisher: Behold StudiosNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review. No other compensation was given.Introduction==========Back in the old days there were a flood of Sentai TV series: Power Rangers, Sailor Moon, Beetle Borgs, Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, Samurai Cyber Squad, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc etc. The list goes on for quite a while. Sentai translates to ""Task Force"" or ""Squadron"" and is usually a team of heroes wearing color coded outfits or uniforms. Basically superheroes...Japanese style! Generally they come with a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation of the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a standard powerup pose is often used in many Sentai works during the transformation sequence. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together. Chroma Squad is directly inspired by Saban's Power Rangers, and capitalizes on most of these concepts from the Sentai genre but takes it a bit further in that you are actually managing the studio shooting the TV series!Gameplay==========Starting up the game you are introduced to your team of actors/heroes, as they are in the middle of a shoot for a TV show, taking a lot of crap from their director in the process. By the end of the shoot, the actors decide to ditch their jerk of a director and start their own TV studio and sentai hero show! One of the actor's has an uncle that lends you an old warehouse where you setup your new studio. At the start of your new career, you get to customize your team of actors, choosing what color their suit will be, the actors themselves, and change their names. You are then able to choose your studio's name, and some various phrases that will you used throughout the game, such as when your actors ""morph"" into their hero suits (""Chromatize!""). As a studio manager, it's your job to choose which episodes get aired and in what order. At the main screen, you can choose to buy equipment/props for your actors that boost their stats in battle scenes. You can also check yoru fan mail, which you will recieve regularly and are able to choose differents responses to. Sometimes depending on your responses you will lose or gain money and/or items. Items can also be crafted using materials you find in combat, such as duct tape and cardboard. The main draw of Chroma Squad is in the action scenes - combat. Chroma Squad utilizes a very simple tactical RPG system in which you can move your team across a grid on the battlefield. During your ""Phase"" you can direct any of your actors in any order you choose until they've all had an action, then it's the Enemy's ""Phase"". Each character has access to a limited set of skills, and the number of skills you can use increases as you shoot more episodes and as you wrap up more seasons of the show. Your team is able to use special ""Teamwork"" actions, which can be very, very useful in dealing damage or traversing the battlefield. For example, one actor can toss another one, enabling them to cover more distance. Another example is having 2 or more adjacent actors attack the same enemy in a team attack. Lastly, if all 5 of your actors are adjacent to an enemy, you can use a Finishing Move, dealing massive damage to your target! FEAR THE POWER OF TEAMWORK! Each scene also has special challenges in the form of Director's Instructions. These can range from reaching an objective within a specfied number of turns, or defeating a certain number of minions before attacking a boss. Completing these orders rewards you with extra points that are converted into fans and money at the end of every episode. Most sentai shows had giant mech suits...such as Power Rangers' MegaZord. Chroma Squad has a similar feature! Perhaps one of the best things about Chroma Squad is the enemy designs. Early on you meet a fellow named Transitmancer -- a mage wield a staff with a traffic signal attached to the top of it. You will also meet enemies like ""The Boxing Box""...which is literally a cardboard box with arms, wearing boxing gloves. There's way more creative ones and even some cameos, but I don't want to spoil too much of the fun!Graphics==========If you have played Behold Studio's previous game, Knights of Pen and Paper, you will be familiar with the art style used here. It's slightly more advanced than KoPaP, with even more details on each sprite. Combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are very well animated and look really nice. Props look great, and like I said before character designs and enemies look amazing.Sound and Music==========This game has one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in quite a long time. The best tracks are the battle tunes by FAR. Just let a battle start and leave it there for a few to take it in. They really get you pumped up for any challenges you are faced with! I have added most of it to my YouTube playlist reserved specially for great game music! The soundtrack is available for purchase on the Store Page for $4.99. Well worth it! Seriously, just give this a listen:

The sound effects are pretty minimal, but they do their job. I can't fault the sound direction here, as it's pretty well done despite being fairly minimal. The soundtrack more than makes up for any shortcomings!Performance==========Chroma Squad runs like a dream. No crashes, stuttering, framerate drops, or any weird glitches were encountered during my playtime so far, and I really don't expect to see any. Behold Studios is usually really good about the quality of their games, as we've seen so far. I didn't think to test the game with my controller, as mouse and keyboard worked extremely well. Probably best for this type of game anyway.Final Thoughts==========If you are looking for a fun tactical RPG that's a bit different and has a ton of humor, Chroma Squad fits the bill perfectly. Such a great little title, and a complete joy to play. You should not hesitate at all in buying this, it's quite the gem! The soundtrack alone is enough to justify the purchase.

												Behold Studios, the developer behind the fantastic Knights of Pen and Paper, have moved from an RPG about basement Dungeons & Dragons nights to an SRPG featuring a homemade super sentai TV show. It's not a massive leap in premise or design but that's not necessarily such a bad thing; KoPaP was a fantastic comedic RPG with enough depth to enjoy as a straight-forward game if humour isn't what you're seeking. While the visual design and menus are immediately familiar for players of the previous titles, I found Chroma Squad to be far and away the more enjoyable game; something I don't say lightly.The main meat of Chroma Squad's gameplay comes in the form of grid-based tactical combat where you lead your five person (and the occasional beaver) troop against generally overwhelming odds. It plays out like any game from the genre only fairly simplified. Streamlined is probably the more apt description though as you can easily find yourself tested, especially if you aim to complete the director's requests that come in twos for every single scene. Each character has their own class with subsequent perks to choose from so there's still plenty of strategy involved and the teamwork mechanics add a unique flavour with finishing moves and movement-extending throws.Like Knights of Pen and Paper, the simulation elements are quite light and serve as an outlet for cash to earn minor bonuses to certain stats. This isn't a business management sim like Game Dev Tycoon and while there are some moments of behind-the-scenes finance fiddling, it's more of a small taster between battles to break up the action than a full-blown hybridisation. However, there's no shortage of options for customisation and you can quickly build up a studio almost as unique to you as one you'd built yourself. You can enter personal phrases to be called out during gameplay, choose your actors, their suit colours and names, not to mention all the visual elements that come with stats like studio upgrades and equipment.Missions are varied affairs, with hostage situations, survival challenges and races against time thrown in to vary the typical back-and-forth fisticuffs. Early on, you unlock mecha missions which simulate Kaiju battles, these are mostly luck-based fights in the sense that you can keep up a combo as long as you want with the accuracy odds dropping with each successful hit. They can be frustrating but it offers a huge change from the basic battles and looks fantastic in action. It's likely the fights will be divisive with players but they're a great opportunity to see the huge robot you've been constructing from custom parts. At worst, they're a blip in an otherwise fantastic product but I enjoyed them at every occasion.I'm aware I've talked of the simplicity of the gameplay a fair bit and that it might put a lot of people off but it's been done to remove the chaff and alleviate the grind. There's still a wealth of stats to monitor, equipment to maintain and entire mechanics to indulge in should you so choose. The crafting adds an alternative to buying from shops with rarer and more effective items requiring that you deconstruct spare costume parts. Marketing options grant a huge range of bonuses upon finishing each episode and completed seasons create branches on the skill trees. It's not a slow-paced tactical XCOM clone and it's better off that way, instead it's a unique amalgamation of the best parts of so many different games and genres.The most obvious trait of Chroma Squad though, is it's humour. If you don't appreciate games that take a tongue-in-cheek poke at their subject matter then you might be disappointed; but really, what else would you expect from a game starring a homebrew TV setup where the costumes are made from cardboard and sticky-back plastic? A lot of the storyline doesn't really make that much sense, but again, neither did that of most live-action kid's TV shows. The script is mostly fluff and it's unlikely you'll be playing through each episode out of plot intrigue, but that's exactly what the stellar gameplay is there for. You'll still get laughs aplenty playing through the campaign and a constant silly grin from all the pop culture references generously heaped on top.I'll admit my review comes from the perspective of someone that has never watched a single episode of Power Rangers or anything of its ilk. I know the references and tropes well enough to have understand every in-joke but I went into Chroma Squad excited due to the developer and genre more than the setting of the game itself. I mention it only as I believe that lovers of all things Mighty Morphin will go on to enjoy this even more than I did. With that considered, there should probably be a health warning on this for the most rabid fans.			"

												Edit: This review was done with a key obtained from the developer. Somehow, I missed the disclaimer on this originally.Not since Darkest Dungeon has an experience hit on as many levels as Chroma Squad has. There is a lot of wonderful design decisions made here, and the attention to detail is what shines here: Every detail seems to be thought out from the wonderful Tactical RPG that involves acrobatics and teamwork, to the detail of the story that plays to the strength of the nostalgia of the old Power Rangers. I had this goofy grin on my face the entire time I was playing the game, and this game is an early contender for Indie game of the year. It's that good.+:-Team based combat, especially on hard difficulties, rewards thinking and strategy in its teamwork based combat. Acrobatics (the ability to launch people further then they could run by themselves.-Strong detail payed attention to the details of each episode within the story, to make it feel like a old Power Rangers episode/series. -Customization of game takes things to new levels with catchphrases and squad names. Adds a whole level of immersion. -Little Details make the experience that much more immersive, such as punishing for using a finishing move that doesn't kill a monster. Audience gauge and Director guidelines help add challenge to make the episode more flashy. -Overall, the nostalgia that the game repeatedly hits works on almost every level, from the 8 bit graphics to the references to the series past. In addition, it's able to mix up the modern day media/internet culture into it as well. -Studio upgrades leave a lot of different options to play around with. Upgrades, Mech Upgrades, Studio Upgrades, etc.-:-Mech battles could be a little bit more challenging.-Some more information can be provided at times regarding teamwork skills (like the supports healing factor, for example)-Comes very close to copyright infrigenment in several cases. Worrisome in some cases. For Gameplay and First Impressions:

												I wanted Final Fantasy Tactics in Sentai suits and was not disappointed!No seriously, I'm calling Chroma Squad a must-buy in terms of tactical RPGs. At worst, the scenarios get kinda samey, the mecha battles are more luck-based than anything, Scout class needs work in terms of role within the team and the meme-based humour might get under some delicate skins. Never mind the details; as a tactical RPG, Chroma Squad gets everything right and even dares some neat ideas concerning character statistics, combat and the money/audience system.What I'm saying is there's a deepness to the game despite the apparent simplicity of the setting, with clear character roles and a certain leeway in how you want them optimized. The love for the genre is genuine and goes a long way in enhancing your experience; it's more than just shooting aliens as in X-Com. Building an audience to gain money and better toys is a welcome change from XP grinding. The grid movement can be unforgiving what with the inability to take back a move but I feel as this just adds to the challenge factor.In short: the core of the gameplay is great and the further you get from the tactical RPG, the worse it gets. I can't fault a game for false notes when it's just being overly ambitious. An original backdrop for an RPG, multiple story paths, clever insertion of Kickstarter backers into the story and the fact I've encountered no game-breaking bugs despite a Report button makes me want to heavily endorse this product. An example for other Kickstarter-funded game developers.			"

												An amazing game with noticeable flaws that tarnish the gameplay depending on the player.Pros:Nostalgic soundtrack and gameplay, balanced difficulty, loads of content/replayability, and creativity. Many games this generation are essentially creatively bankrupt, but Chroma Squad realizes this and challenges the standard of games today. A tycoon game with rpg gameplay and tons of customization has been completely unheard of. Fun humor and fun character designs, the game doesn't take itself seriously at all and knows its limits. It is literally self-aware of the tropes and cliches it uses. For example, in one point of the game, a girl needs to be rescued. One of the squad members questions if it should be a guy just to avoid using sexist tropes. The game knows the stupidity of generic hero-saving-the-day tv shows and utilizes it to bring out the fun that is in them easily. Also, if you are a fan of super sentai, you will laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off at these references. I promise you.Subjective:It's obvious just from the start of the game how much customization there is. You can customize everything- from your squad name, the names of your members, the attributes of the members, the weapons of the members, the abilities of the members, your mecha, your mecha's name, your transformation name, and way more. In theory, it sounds great, but when you get right down to it, it get's annoying. Have you ever felt the feeling of, ""Ugh, I can't choose between these great abilities/weapons! I wish the game didn't even give me an option!"" Well, half of the game is like that. It's so customizable to the point where it may ruin the enjoyment factor. Should I craft this? Should I buy this? Should I equip this? There's way too many choices. Me personally, I had only a few problems with this, considering how much I love customization in games. This is a pro or a con depending on the player.Cons:Repetitive. Incredibly repetitive, to the point where you say to yourself, ""Really? This again?"" The game is oozing with creativity but unfortunately the gameplay is designed so that almost all of the fights are entirely the same. Some enemies are different, the map layout is sometimes different (and other times copy pasted), but the game throws at you the same fights over and over again just to reach the conclusion. This is easily noticeable after getting through the start of the game. No effect on overall plot. Nothing you really do changes where the game is going. Sure, occasionally you get fans praising you for doing x or shunning you for doing y, but it doesn't really do much in the long run from what I've seen.Little strategy. Unless playing on the hardest difficulty, you only need a bit of strategy to complete the levels. Dialogue. The dialogue is sometimes humorous and creative, but really? It can be written by 5 year olds and probably be the same. The writing is pretty awful and the characters have little depth. This I get it; that's the whole point of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and is SUPPOSED to be immature. It isn't that big of a deal, but the game could easily be better with more engaging dialogues and more clever jokes.Mecha fights. Fun the first time you launch it and the first time you use a new ability you got, but otherwise? Not engaging at all, and anti-climactic a lot of the time. Incredibly repetitive. Overall though? Do I have to go through a bit of repetitiveness and subpar dialogue to enjoy a game with tons of replayability, nostalgic design/soundtrack and a unique experience? Definitely. This game is fun as hell.			"

												If you are a fan of Power Rangers or Super Sentai. You should give it a try!Lots of subtile references/nods to Super Sentai seasons. (Won't say what they are but if you've seen sentai seasons of the last 2-3 years, you'll see some and will put a smile on your face!) Gameplay is really simplistic (Don't go into it expecting complicated mechanics like from the Disgaea Series) but honestly it doesn't need to be overwhelming. The overall episode ""goals"" challenge you to certain things before the end of the section. Have yet to run into one that wasn't impossible. As the seasons (5 in total) go on, you'll come across items to craft and buy to upgrade your Squad members, so there is atleast some customization for you to play with as you're going along the story.After each episode you get revenue based on how many fans you get. Fans are usually earned if you use an ability or complete one of the episode goals. Most goals tend to give you well enough fans to hit the cap. If a squad member falls, it'll subtract fans. Later on you'll start to get contracts from agencies that can change the end revenue based on what you want. +Money? +Fans? Things like that. The more fans you have, the more bonuses you could have!Again if you like Power Rangers/Super Sentai or Tokusatsu, try this out! If you aren't, you may not understand the fourth wall breaking studio-type story the game has. But the gameplay is still enjoyable!			"

												Chroma Squad is a Tactical RPG made by Behold Studios, the developers behind Knights of Pen & Paper. Chroma Squad is a love letter and a tribute to decades of Japanese superhero shows such as: Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and the Metal Hero series. =STORY=You start off as a five-people  team of stuntactors who decide to make their own Sentai-themed TV show in which they become a Sentai team themselves and fight against all sorts of monsters while managing their resources and fan-community behind the scenes. The first two seasons start very tame since you’re still an indie Sentai studio with a low budget, but from season 3 onwards the plot becomes more serious and fascinating.Depending on your choice during the finale of season 4, you might either end up doing the Rider route, the Metal Hero route or the Sixth Ranger route. I won’t spoil much, but each route has their own scenarios going on with interesting mini stories that contribute to the game’s lore. The finale of the game itself is amazing, and is something to behold and be amazed at – I’ll try not to spoil it, but it’s definitely “empowering”.Mind you, the game developers have suggested to implement more alternate endings or routes  within future DLC or updates, so this review might end up dated and not give a complete overview to what the story system of Chroma Squad offers.= CUSTOMIZATION =This is arguably my favourite part of the game, ‘cuz who doesn’t want to make their very own Sentai dream team? You can customize your team by choosing out of approx. 20 actors, each with their own appearances and bonuses. You can also name them and decide which suit colour they wear, i.e. if you always wanted to make an all-Red ranger team, well here’s your chance! Throughout the seasons, the game offers various types of helmets and suits that not only give certain statboosts but also visually alter the appearance of your hero. Unfortunately, the amount of actors and visual-altering equipment you can choose from is quite limited, so you’ll have to either wait for future DLC or step up your modding skills.You can also name your studio, your team, your giant robot, your transformation and lines of dialogue that call forth said mech, transformation and team attack. While it doesn’t give you the ultimate customization possibilities like customizing your own hero costume or actor from scratch, the game offers a decent amount of customization which will hopefully be expanded in the future.= GAMEPLAY =While the game is a turn-based tactical system, it’s not as complex or multi-faceted as Super Robot Wars, but neither is it overtly simplistic. You generally control five characters, each with their own stats depending on equipment, actor, role and bonuses you’ve activated through studio upgrades or siding with the more favourable marketing agencies. Each role offers a variety of skill, the Techie and Support role are for example more oriented on long-range and healing skills, respectively. Your characters can generally do two actions per turn – in most cases you’ll (1) move to the enemy and (2) perform an attack or (1)(2) move to the other end of the screen. Your heroes can wield weapons which not only increase attack damage but also provide with an extra skill. Last but not least, there’s the Teamwork mechanic in which you can make two or more of your heroes pull off an combined attack at an enemy they’re both facing.The giant robot vs giant monster battles have a more mini-game feel to it, but it can still be one heck of an intense battle. It’s a sideview turn-based battle in which you can hit the enemy multiple times until your turn is ended through missing the opponent, ending your combo with the defend options or ending the turn with a super attack. During the enemy’s turn you must step up your reaction game to minimize the amount of damage your mech will receive.Outside of missions, there’s also a light Studio Simulation system going on – i.e. you’ll get to read and answer fan letters, upgrade your studio for additional bonuses, upgrade your giant robot, buy equipment, craft equipment or materials and side with the marketing agencies that give you the best bonuses or help you earn and gain more money and fans.= OVERALL =If you’ve longed for a game in which you can make your own Sentai team and fight against hordes of enemies with the help of unlikely allies and your trusty giant robot , then look no further because Chroma Squad is arguably the best Sentai game if not one of the best Henshin Hero games up to this point. The story, several dialogues and fan letters will make you laugh and smile – and perhaps, even give you the feeling that you’re being a true hero of justice. Gameplay-wise, Chroma Squad is a very accessible game but not without a challenge for those who want to step up their game. While the visuals and soundtrack aren’t AAA-tier, they’re still pleasing and amazing to see and listen to nonetheless. This game is definitely made with love, and it shows. I can’t wait for the future updates and potential-DLC this game has to offer. Behold Studios, you’re the best and thank you for this amazing loveletter to decades of tokusatsu heroism.			"

												Chromatize!!!Oh, this game is going to stay in my mind when I am thinking about round based strategie right after UFO: Enemy Unkown (sorry - its hard to beat that one)You play as 5 stunt(wo)men who decide to disobey their director and leave to make a hero-show on their own. Each has a specific role ingame that makes one more awesome than the other. The plot divides and intertwines between ""real-life"" and show which leads to funny dialouges between the characters and enemies.The game itself is NOT a serious simulation and even makes fun of itself. Its mixed with a little bit of income managment and skill editing of the different classes by crafting and/or buying items.The crafting menu is not complex and not too simple - you get new equipment to buy/craft every ""season""(which can be compared to chapters) which require rare materials you can find during an episode(level) or craft/recycle out of lower grade materials.The gameplay itself can be compared to other RBS - you move your characters a given number of tiles per turn and attack - or use a weapon - or use a skill - or prepare for 'Teamwork' to unleash the super epic ultra finishing move penta deluxe!!!While gameplay is kept simple the game gives you a number of goals you have to achieve (like: Kill [...] in 2 turns.) in order to gather more audience and get more money and fans for that episode(level) which get harder just like the enemies.While the enemies are sort of clone troopers its not getting boring since you will encounter a new enemytype or boss almost every level.The graphics themselves are outstanding (my bar for this one is not set too high) - the looks of the actors are changing with the equipment they are wearing and animations are smooth and flawless. You can see every minute that went into the creation of every art asset in this game.I'm not quite through with the game but as far as I played I would say that since I saw it on gamescom 2014 it lived up to all my hopes I put in it and didn't waste any of its possible potential. I absolutely fell in love with this game. (Thanks for being with MEGA-BOOTH at gamescom to the devs at this point)Buy this game if you want a fun ride with awesome ideas/design and changing gameplay.-RaptorTwitch			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Chroma SquadDevelopers:  Behold StudiosPublisher:  Behold StudiosGenre:  SRPG/Economic hybridGeneral ImpressionPerhaps I’m just nostalgic about those simple and happy times I used to watch the Power Rangers on TV as kid. For me, Chroma Squad really shed a new light on what a modern pixelated video game can achieve. The title I’m reviewing today is a far cry from your run-of-the-mill 2D Simulation Role Playing Game (SRPG, for short) since it incorporates a well planned economic component to it. You have to supervise  a team of stunt actors looking to promote their own studio and projects. And that is no easy task, given how cutthroat the show business is in general terms. You control everything from the production of the shows and even the advertising and human resources department of your firm. It’s not just a faux Power Ranger simulator in which combat takes center stage. You need to carefully manage your total funds and some compromises shall be made when hiring actors or sacking older ones which contrary to their skill sets, lack any appeal towards the audience. And you will certainly have to entertain your public. That is where the core tactical side of the game, comes alive. You have a surprisingly complex turn-based battle system that relies on literal teamwork between the squadmates you control, since boss fights are never easy. This really is a rare case of a title that can be used to demonstrate independent creativeness and show the gaming industry that you don’t require an overinflated budget in order to create a fun and captivating game.Strong Points+ Beautiful pixel graphics and equally pleasant soundtrack.+ Clever use of pop culture references and humor.+ Unique type of gameplay.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Some elements get repetitive over time.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I backed this game on Kickstarter, and it's better than I ever could have hoped for. This game, at its core, is a tokusatsu simulator. What is tokusatsu? It's a style of Japanese live action television featuring transforming super heroes, martial arts, and special effects and stunts.Let me first say this: don't let the ""Inspired by Saban's Power Rangers"" throw you or discourage you from buying it. The designers were forced to put that under threat of legal action from Saban, and there are a few subtle digs at Saban throughout the game. Tokusatsu heroes are much bigger than just what came to the West as Power Rangers. In actuality, many countries including Brazil and France got Japanese tokusatsu super heroes in the eighties and nineties before Power Rangers was a ""thing"", and that is inspired by the full range of Japanese superhero shows. Fans of tokusatsu heroes will spot references not only to classic Super Sentai, but also to Kamen Rider and Metal Hero shows such as Space Sheriff Gavan and Juspion.There are two main portions to the game: tactical combat and studio management. In the tactical combat portion, you battle ""mook"" enemies and a ""monster of the week"" in a format almost identical to Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea in an isometric perspective. There are always ""objectives"" for each episode given by your show director such as performing a certain number of stunts or defeating the enemy in a certain way. Doing so will boost your ratings and improve the show's income.In the studio management portion, you purchase and set up upgrades for your humble studio, investing in better cameras, hiring big name actors and skilled crew, and upgrading your special effects and costumes. While your costumed heroes may start out with a mop bucket on their head and bicycle pads for armor, with enough positive fan reaction (which you'll see after each episode is filmed via a sampling of tweets about the episode) you might eventually be wearing costumes on the level of a professional production! Additionally, interactions with other companies and fans might affect your production. What will you do when other studios start coming to you with their hands out? Take them to court or give them a cut? What will you do when overseas fansubbers start subbing your show? Let them on the chance it'll increase your merchandising, or drop the hammer on them?In addition to this, you have a great deal of customization of your show itself. You can name your studio, name your super hero team, and even customize what they say when they transform or do their super attack. Want them to shout out, ""Henshin!"" when they transform instead of the default? You can do it! Want to pick your own colors instead of the default? You can do it! Want to have an Orange Ranger instead of a Yellow Ranger? Want them ALL to be red heroes? Yes, you can even do that!This game follows the standard Sentai story elements: heroes battle foot soldier ""mooks"" on foot in their civilian clothes until they build up enough power (audience approval!) to transform -- and when they do, it boosts your audience approval even more. Once you defeat the monster of the week, of course, as any fan of the shows know, the monster has to grow huge. And what would Sentai be without giant robot battles? Purchase gear and equipment, assemble your giant robot and have a battle on a massive scale. In addition, there is a motorcycle prop you'll receive later, and an option to shift the show into a ""solo mode"" featuring a lone motorcycle Rider hero with a flowing scarf that favors jump kicks as his preferred method of defeating monsters. So in case you are curious -- yes, you CAN be a Kamen Rider!The graphics are 8-bit, but don't let that discourage you. The animations are great, the characters are big and bright with big cutscenes when important events happen. The music is catchy and reminiscent of classic Commodore chiptunes or Nintendo 8-bit sounds with a catchier sound.Overall, I highly recommend this game. If you're a tokusatsu fan, you definitely will want to play this, but even if you just have a passing interest in superheroes, tactical battle games, or managing a TV studio, the charm and uniqueness of this game will certainly entertain you.

												Back when the Power Rangers were a big deal in 1995, my parents wouldn't let me watch it. They deemed it too violent. Mind you, they're telling this to a guy who is chronically addicted to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and tuned in every Saturday to watch the Spiderman and Batman cartoons. Power Rangers were much too violent though. When my folks finally gave up on controlling my viewing habits Power Rangers quickly became a guilty pleasure and I watched it until Wild Force. Enter Chroma Squad, a retro style turn based tactics game that puts you in control of a squad of power rangers. It is every bit as fun as going round your parents' back to just watch cardboard robots beating up rubber monsters.Chroma Squad's premise is very catchy hook to begin with. A group of disgruntled stunt actors are fed up with their boss and quit their current Ranger season to start their own series. With buckets, old shirts and cardboard boxes your crew assembles a set of costumes and backdrops and the battle against evil can begin. Along the way you'll find that there is a little more to playing Power Rangers than just making cool poses.The game's real kicker is the ability to create and assemble your own team. You can possibly recreate every Ranger team down to the letter with the game, or engineer a squad entirely your own. Did you like Mighty Morphing Power Rangers? Just pick the five colours, three boys, two girls and be on your way. Fed up with the patriarchy? Pick five girls, colour them all in shades of purple and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ Feeling grimdark and edgy? Pick five depressed kids, paint them black and act like Batman. Everything is up to you. Each Ranger has its own role. Lead is in charge and gets additional hitpoints, while the tech rangers does bonus damage with weapons. The colours are up to you, so you can make the Pink ranger be the boss this time round and let the snooty Red ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ be the butt of the Megazord this time. After you tune your squad you record your episodes. This is a turn based tactics game where you fight minions and monsters on a grid. The real selling point here is positioning and teamwork. One ranger can kick a mook for sure, but positioning your squad in such a way will allow you to vault your rangers straight into the bosses face on the first turn to deliver a juicy team attack. It is key that master the acrobatics and abilities to chase down the shifty bosses, or that you weaken and wear out the brawlers without losing a Ranger, because no one likes it when the good guys lose.You performance isn't measured in money, or experience; it is measured in audience. Since you're recording a TV show your audience is your life; and you cannot survive without loyal viewers and fans. Every episode gives you a hand full of objectives to clear to make your episode a bit better. More audience, means more fans, means more money, means better suits, means better TV, means more audience, etc. It is a simple, yet fun system, because it invites you to think of other ways to approach a problem, rather than to look for the one tactic. The entire game is booming with references to the Power Rangers and its Japanese original: Super Sentai. Finishing moves, focus on Red, giant robots, believing in your friends, mystery helpers, talking jars, it's all part of the experience. During your downtime you have time to craft new weapons from arts and crafts materials as well as answer fanmail and hire marketing groups to propel your show to the next level of hype. You'll quickly fall in love with the familiar and sometimes cliché traits of the series that round out the experience.All in all, the game presses so many right buttons, it's hard not to like. Though the sometimes lazy writing rips you out of the game, the desire to know what kind of crazy thing the devs have cooked up for the next episode will have you coming back soon. The branching storyline also helps to draw you back in after beating it once. Chroma Squad is a precious gem that should be play by anyone who ever watched even a single episode of Power Rangers.

Developer: Behold StudiosPublisher: Behold StudiosFormat: PCRelease Date: April 30th, 2015Oh boy here it is Chroma Squad. A game like no other out there.Let me start of by saying that this is a game for children.Nothing for adults like me and you. We are big now. We can buy alcohol, drive and get on all roller coasters.I mean I pretty much watched Power Rangers and the likes whenever I could, because well I have had smaller siblings so I had an excuse ... err I mean I was forced to watch it.Anyway you don't have to be a fan of Tokusatsu and Sentai to fully enjoy this game. I mean it doesn't hurt if you are it probably makes everything just so much better but all you need to fully enjoy it is a sense of humor.Now on to the review. Retsu go!Chroma Squad is a Tactical-Management-Business-RPP about running your very own sentai show.You slip into the role of five stuntmen which basically got fed up that they do pretty much all the work while the actors are just sitting in their chairs most of the time. One comes up with the idea to create their own studio and so they quit their jobs to set up their own sentai studio.This game is filled with jokes and references to the tv shows or to memes and it's overall a very good laugh.Now we get to the management/business part.You now have to setup your studio and buy props like mics, lamps or a better green screen. Those items will give you all special bonuses but also come for a price. You don't only have to pay once for those items well for some you do and others cost something like 25 bucks each episode. So you have to choose wisely on what to upgrade. Also you have to hire actors, choose an agency to help you reach a greater audience and make sure you're fans are happy since hey this is tv show!Onto the RPG part! Retsu go!In case it wasn't obvious but you take the role of five actors and the director of your sentai tv show. You have to read and reply to fan mail which can grant you bonuses depending on your actions and then there's crafting.Duct tape, play dough, card boxes and many more stuff you'll need to craft your new items like swords, guns, helmets and so on. You can buy several materials and you can also recycle your old and unused gear for materials. You only have a % chance to get certain materials but hey atleast you have the chance to get some materials back.Your goal is to record five episodes for a season. Meaning you have to record and fight five different scenarios before you reach the season finale aka end boss battle. While recording the shows you see the directors instructions on screen which you should follow in order to get the max amount of audience.What else can I say?If you enjoy tactical and/or rpg games you should definitely give Chroma Squad a try.If you like the good ol' Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger you will probably drool all over this game.

												This is the love letter game to childhood heroes we need and deserve. This game was made for and by Tokusatsu fans and you can really feel it while playing the game. Game will appeal to those who watched Power Rangers or Super Sentai. Customization is pretty good. Linked example here is what I liked the most. The hero shouts.


much customization

Name Changes for members. Each actor comes with different stats. Roles also have set stats as well.

You can also buy or craft new costumes/gear and change how your heroes look.My only complaint is that you only have the standard 5 or 6 man team member set up.  3 man teams like Sun Vulcan and GekiRangers can't be recreated. There is an option for a Kamen Rider mode later in the game for those who want a solo experience.			"

												Excellent tactical RPG with a surprising amount of depth.It's a bit of a business management sim on top of the RPG side, but they mesh very well together.The game play works well, with plenty of options in combat to choose how you want to approach things, and a wealth of customization in the pre episode/fight setup.A silly and offbeat story line with enough genuine comedy to make you laugh occasionally helps to spruce up the quality game play as well.It starts off simple, so it's not difficult to learn but gets progressively deeper, and I can tell there is more to come. I'm genuinely looking forward to each new ""episode"" of the TV show you play in.Difficulty wise, I'm playing on hard and it's just right for me. Hard enough I have to pay attention to what I'm doing and think out my actions, and most episodes I'm barely scraping through. Can't comment on how that would fit for others of course, but as someone pretty accustomed to this style of game hard difficulty has works nicely for me.I'm not finished the game so I can't comment on length, but I'm a long ways from finishing and have put in about 11hrs on this save so far. So I'm confident there is a surprisingly large amount of content to play through.I've heard tons of love given to the sound track for the game but... honestly I don't see it. It's not bad by any means but it's more decent and fits the game well, then anything truly memorable.The visuals I really appreciate however, it's simple retro pixel graphics but the combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are all very well animated and look quite nice. Lots of extra frills like a fast forward effect reminiscent of an old VCR on a CRT TV fit perfectly with the atmosphere.I can happily recommend this to anyone who wants a lighthearted RPG, or just looking for something unique and different. Not much else out there like this.9/10 and a genuinely excellent game. Easy recommendation.			"

Summary:Chroma Squad is a turn-based action RPG game that revolves around a group of Power Rangers stunt actors, who are acting Power Rangers. They are unhappy with their director and with the studio where they are taking the show, so they make their own, Chroma Squad! The story might have few surprises for you but the main thing are the references and jokes, you'll find many of those.Gameplay is classic for turn-based action games, with exception of acrobatics - a character can hold a position so another character can ricochet himself farther (closer to your target enemy). You can expect about 30 levels (split into 5 ""seasons""), with repeating basic enemies but original bosses, which will make you laugh and, some later ones, might make you a little angry. You have to try hard.But I don't want to scare you, I've played on ""Interesting"" difficulty (take it as normal) and I think it was perfectly balanced experience. I had times where I've almost didn't beat the level (last man Power Ranger standing!) and I've never felt the game was too easy, so I always felt motivated to do my best.Anyway, Chroma Squad would totally suck if they weren't able to form into a huge mech. And guess what, you will have a mech action too! But don't get too excited for that, mech fights have completely different fight rules, there is no positioning strategy and your attacks are based on your luck.Visuals are presented in neat pixelart style, combined with nice sound effect and soundtrack, which contains even a Japanese theme song! Everything gets you to the right mood pretty fast, so you can enjoy everything developers made - and there's a lot of content to see.Chroma Squad is definitely worth recommending, I've enjoyed it for more than 10 hours and might even try to play it later again on higher difficulty for another endings. If you are looking for  turn-based RPG, pixelart and want many pop culture references, you'll love it!Pros:- Extensive system of skills, upgrades, items and crafting. You'll spend minutes in management windows between fights and you won't mind it at all! - Well-made turn RPG and strategy gameplay. - Funny dialogues that perfectly fits into the silly story of stuntmen running a TV show, that changes their lives.- Specific unique tasks for every single battle. So if you think it's too easy, try to do something more and complete them - you'll be more popular, if you can do it.- Fair pixelart graphics.- Doesn't get repetitive. There are many mobs that are getting reused pretty often but you can (on most levels) expect a new and original boss with his unique skills. Also, every season, each of your characters get a new skill!- More difficulties, more endings.- Good sound effects and soundtrack.- Steam achievements.Cons:- Kaiju fights. They are too much based on luck, you just see your % chance to hit your enemy... and hope you'll hit it.			"

												Go go Chroma Squad!Now that the game is finally done with its Final Wave of beta-testing, the Super Marvelous Super Sentai inspired RPG is in everyone's hands, and it was well worth the wait.Only vaguely similar in structure to the also wonderful Knights of Pen & Paper (also developered by Behold Studios), the pixelated adventure takes your through the many misadventured of your own custom made team of  Sentai / Power Rangers inspired actors who have abandoned their previous, terrible acting gig to create their own series.The director? You, of course!The game is rife with fan service, and if you have any love for the original Sentai series or the Americanised Power Rangers interpretation of the show, you will feel right at home with this game. A great amount of customistation and developement is under your control, from the genders and colours of your team to the overall look of your costumes.The main game is a RPG treat, bringing you through numerous seasons and many episodes of your own hilariously awkward show. No trope is left untouched as you battle and ""chromatze"" your way through hoards of enemy lackies and boss monsters in the well designed turned based RPG gameplay. Though the pixel art may not be to everyone's taste, the humour behind the game's inspiration shines through beautifully.This is a highly recommended game, and one I encourage every Sentai / Power Rangers to check out. If nothing else, its a better Power Rangers game than any official branded has ever been.P.S. I make absolutely no apologies for the puns used in this review.			"

												This is one heck of a game and definitely worth the price.  At first I didn't realize that it was a tycoon ontop of a tactical rpg.  However; with that said, both elements compliment each other making this an incredible experience.  I didn't read any reviews before I purchased this game WITH the soundtrack, which is also hellacious-ly awesome.  I mean... go manage some power rangers while you see thousands of people watch you kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names, or get pummeled.Pros:*The download is very small*You get to manage your very own power ranger team    *actors    *colors    *weapons        *store bought        *crafted home made    *studio building    *clients via marketing    *lawsuits        *yeah people gonna hate on you for being heroes to children or carbon copies*Over 100 episodes    *approx 5 seasons so farCons:*Where the hell was this when I was a kid?Nuff said, no questions asked.  If you cannot decide then go watch youtube.			"

												Don't be fooled into thinking this is purely a casual game you will play for 10 minutes at a time. It's a lot more involved than you would expect and a HELL of a lot more addictive. Crafting is interesting and absorbing and combat, whilst a little on the simplistic side, is pure low tbs fun. The storylines are funny and well developed and upgrade paths for your studio are logical and sometimes entertaining. Overall it is totally engrossing and a breath of fresh air. Also it's currently on humble for practically nothing. Get it and get it now.			"

												TLDR: This is an amazing game, but it hinges on one (or two) factors. This is an amazing game IF: You like Power Rangers or Super Sentai. This is the main reason I'm ""Not Recommending"".  I will still play for another 50 hours or so, but I'm a Rangers and Sentai fan. 9/10 - Power Rangers/Sentai fans6/10 - Normal RPG, tactical fansChroma Squad has some mis-leading aspects, mainly that this is a simple tactical game, and not so much of a Manager/Studio Simulation, and it lacks any deep RPG elements. PROS:-Best Power Rangers game yet! No joke, easily the best. If you like Power Rangers at all- BUY THIS NOW! You will not be very disapointed.-Blend of tactical, rpg, and simulation aspects-Can customize team's colors, equipment, weapons-Crafting is available-Can upgrade the studio-Great retro music and art (some people hate that, I like it)-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'-Great GUI/UI. It looks very nice, and it's easy to use.-Contracts with different agencies. This is a really nice touch. I like this a lot. CONS:-The simulation/managing aspect is sort-of fake. You don't really become a fliming studio in the sense you get to create your own episodes. Nor does changing the 'actor' for your Rangers change their personality (a black guy with a mohawk has the same personality as an alien, who also has the same personality as a living beaver-man).  You DO get to choose the order of episodes, but this will only change the ending of the game (as of right now, when I write this). -Virtually NOTHING you do has an effect on how the story/studio/managing/episodes etc. Some things effect how many fans you get, and it will change these end-of-episode fake tweets (Twitter) ""Wow!  You ended with a finishing move! That was awesome"" or ""Lame, you need to change your gear! #OldGearIsLame"". This is a nice touch at first, but it becomes annoying. Especially when 'fans' want you to change your gear every episode, when there isn't any new gear avaiable.-Tactical elements are light: I did not feel I had to ever strategize to complete a level. -RPG elements are light: Very few RPG-like choices. When you beat a season, you get new 'Season Abilities', ultimately only allowing for 5 different abilities/powers/moves per 'Hero'/Ranger -Studio Management aspect is very light: Right now it only improves your heroes, and or Mecha. It can also give you more fans/money.-Mecha Battle: This is nothing more than a simple time-reaction game. It does not feel engaging, and also Mecha battles do not happen after every fight. So when it /does/ happen, it feels anti-climatic because of how shallow the fights are. -Crafting can be fun, but it also feels shallow. Instead of choosing the gear you like (like a damage suit vs a HP suit vs a magic suit etc) you just get scaling gear. So you end up re-crafting your old gear just so you can get the newest set. -Due to crafting the items in the 'Shop' are either much worse or much better in comparison. (Level 3 shirt from shop: 120 HP, Level 3 shirt crafted: 87 HP and +1 random property (likely of equal strength)-The story... If you buy this game for the story PREPARE to be disapointed. It's fully of tongue-in-cheek (aka humorous, funny, comical etc) elements. I am not a huge fan of this. The writing isn't very solid (Sorry Gui) and I never find myself wanting to know what happens next-There isn't a lot of gear/items/equipment etc. Half way through the game: 14 'equipment' pieces to craft, 17 to buy. Weapons: 14 to buy, 12 to craft. Remember, these only affect some visual looks and your stats. Weapons give you a new attack (which is nifty) but ultimately it's going to be a variation on the same thing (axe doing more damage than sword)-(Currently) no NewGame+-There are even fewer studio improvements to buy, making the studio/managing aspect even weaker. (I'm half way through the game and I have 10 available to buy) -Buying the ""bigger studio' doesn't actually change anything for the episodes. Nothing at all. (It provides stats, but does not change the episodes themselves) At least in Game Dev Tycoon the visuals changed to a larger studio and gave more options to do things. That is not the case here.-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'Knowing all of this: I will still end up playing quite a bit. And I don't mind posting this, knowing a lot of fan-bois will dislike my review. I still find the game to be fun, but very misleading. You don't really manage very much. (Unless equiping & crafting gear in any other RPG counts as simulation/managing aspect :P ) The studio improvements don't change much. The gear changes your looks and stats (like most games) but there isn't much choice, so everyone at a certain point will be wearing either A) Gear that was Crafted or B) Gear that was bought. You aren't going to use an old gear-set that has worse stats, and there isn't a choice between visuals (you get what you get, right now) "

												Chroma Squad is a tactical role-playing game, released for personal computers in early goings of 2015. It was heavily influenced by various Tokusatsu series, two of the chief inspirations being Saban's Power Rangers and Shotaro Ishinomori's Kamen Rider.Go Go Power Rangers!Five professional stuntmen who've grown tired of the poor production values and tyranical director of their current television series decide to uproot and take their talent elsewhere. Soon after impulsively deciding to leave, the group begins developing an original Sentai series, and must work through a myriad of problems to ensure that the series is successful.Out of the frying pan, in to the casting department.Before the game rears into action, the player is given several options to tailor their experience: A choice between three difficulty settings, helping to accommodate players of all skill levels; selecting your squad and studio names, colors and transformation shout; and finally, designating the actors to the roles that you see fit.Each of those actors have unique bonuses, which help to determine how they'll influence the team for the better. Several of these bonuses are especially beneficial with a particular role, e.g.; Skill Regen for an Assist character to improve the rate at which they can heal the rest of the group. Some actors go so as far as to impose combat penalties on themselves, so that they can provide a heavy boost in another area.Branching paths are another feature that help to provide some elements of customization. The studio will occasionally receive an email with several options for replies. While most of these only lead to an audience bonus, others can provide weaponry that otherwise wouldn't be available. The largest branch in the game is accessed during one particular battle: depending on how one chooses to complete an objective, the game determines how the second half of the journey will play out. All of these add a great degree of value to subsequent plays.It's Morphin' Time!​The foundation that the game is built upon is squad based combat, which plays out on a turn-by-turn basis in which the rangers move around on an isometric grid. The team use their varied skill sets to turn the tide of battle, in whatever way they can. Be they used for healing, or rapidly bursting down the health of nearby enemies, each member is prepared to put up a fight, whether they're alone, or working together. Should they choose the latter, teamwork is used as a mechanic that allow them to launch one another to distant locations, as well as attacking enemies as a group for higher damage. Still, sometimes even a team of powerful heroes need a little more help to defeat a daunting foe.Megazord, Eat Your Heart Out​!At times like these, our heroes call upon their Mecha to participate in Kaiju battles; essentially, giant robots fighting giant monsters. These also play out turn-by-turn, but here the objective is to create combos with your abilities, all the while paying close attention to a percentage representing you're likelihood of hitting the target. The significance of this is that combo-chains determine your damage multiplier, and missing an enemy breaks this chain, resets it to 0, and proceeds to the the next turn. While these sections aren't especially interesting on their own, they do add enough variety to keep the core gameplay relatively fresh.A Heartfelt Tribute​Personally, I've never been particularly compatible with isometric tactics, as they tend to be very slow paced, without providing something that makes it feel necessary. That said, I found Chroma Squad to be a game that meaningfully improves the pace of the genre. Perhaps the kindest thing I can say about it in that regard is, while the gameplay is familiar, the time you spend in battle doesn't feel like it massively exceeds the amount of time allocated to plot and cutscenes, as it does in many tactical titles.As a longtime enthusiast of the source material, Chroma Squad had an easy time getting through to me, as it shows an incredible amount of reverence for the style, and does a wonderful job of presenting it in a unique way. Going beyond that incredibly initial premise, there's an incredible amount of charm to be found here. From the moment you launch the game, the main theme mimics the vocal styling of many classic Tokusatsu themes, and perfectly sets the tone for the adventure. Something as simple as skipping through cutscenes is done as though someone was fast forwarding through a VHS tape, showing an immense amount of character for something that otherwise wouldn't be noteworthy in the slightest. Here we have an incredibly quirky game that makes for a very engaging experience and is absolutely worth the price of admission.Time Spent: 132 Hours (Average game length: 15 hours.)Further Playing: Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS), XCOM: Enemy Within (Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)			"

What I liked: The combat, yet simple has some depth The music and the charming yet cheesy story The whole TV management gameplay aspectWhat You Need to Know: Yes it's similar to Power Rangers, but this game is good on its own not for being nostalgic (I’m didn’t watch the shows as a kid) The combat is turned based, luckily the animations are fast and you’re not bogged down waiting for the enemies turn even when a dozen are present. Each ranger is a class with special abilities that grow in number with each season.The game is based on a TV of these fake rangers, but the story gets weirder as what’s real and fake blur the line. Each episode you play has optional objectives that when completed give you lots of fans(this is your way of making more money and getting better marketing perks). The first 3 seasons these were important to get as many as possible. But still missing some of them is ok and still not be crippled later on, plus a lot of them are easy. But some bosses spawn mines or spores by the dozens each turn which I did not like. But that was only 2 out of the 30+ bosses you fight. The game has a funny/corny story; I never skipped over it because it was entertaining enough to me. If you don’t like it you can skip it all very easily. There is no voice acting, so you will read the dialogue. It even has choices you make by email which will give you either in game rewards, like money, fans, materials or weapons or just the satisfaction of responding to a fan or person in need. Some even choose what bosses you fight so you won’t fight all the game’s bosses in one play through.The game even has 3 different endings where the last season of the game changes depending on your choice; you have different rangers you can pick at the start of the game (which you can name) along with the email choices above give a good replay value.Now the TV show management side is very easy and isn’t hard to understand. You have marketing team which you can pick from a lot with new ones each season offering different benefits, like more money, fans damage, item drop and more depending on who you pick. You have crafting which is cool, offering more variety of armor and weapons that the shop doesn’t have. The shop and items you craft are both viable with neither being the obvious op choice. Next are the mech battles, you customize your mech by the 5 parts of the body (head, torso, 2 arms and legs). These you craft and once start leveling up your parts to high tier it’s going to be hard to get the materials to swap if you want to. Now the battles themselves are simple, your main attack with every hit you gain a combo but lose in accuracy, so there is some luck involved there. You get abilities depending on the parts you picked for your mech. Overall these battles are short, flashy and fun to mix up the fightsI played the game on the middle difficulty and failed about 3 episodes (there is a penalty for doing this). So it’s not that hard. Playing on the easy mode would be a cake walk if you’re worried about how difficult the game is. The game even though it’s simple does require planning and synergizing your team’s abilities and timing when played on the higher difficultiesMy Score:A+Paid:Included in $1 Humble BundleCompleted in:14 hoursGames similar:  XCOM FTL Battle Brothers "

												A neat, quirky and bright little game with a somewhat unusual premise with that tactical rpg touch. First Impressions: + Colorful and intriguing premise+ Developing your own team of team of power rangers+ Very much a nice Disgea fix - Gameplay can get a little monotonous (best enjoyed in doses, not binge runs)An enjoyable experience so far, a nice tactical role-playing game for your PC but falls short of hitting Disgea and Final Fantasy Tactics. Reccomended lightly. Reviewer will update with more gameplay. 7.83/10			"

Go, go, Chroma Squad!Chroma Squad is Power Rangers plus Disgaea. If you like one or both of those, I am 99% sure you will like this. If you do not know of either, then that is what the rest of this review is for!I confess, I never watched Power Rangers or any sentai shows as a kid. But I do know the tropes quite well and have heard more than enough about them to get the gist. Chroma Squad is a love letter to those shows, and you should expect them to follow those standard formulas. I found it to be an absolute blast, especially as an SRPG lover. Take a look below to see all the reasons why.Pros:While I like SRPGs in general, this one hooked me and wouldn't let go. The gameplay is addicting. Every episode has different objectives and maps, and it is a lot of fun to figure out how to best impress your audience while winning the fight. It keeps the core gameplay strong while adding enough variables to make the on-foot fights fresh.There is a crafting system that  works well. You can make some nifty equipment with materials that randomly drop. Sometimes the shop equipment will be better, and you always receive gold after each level. So even if you bomb during a crafting session, you have good resources to fall back on.Grinding does not exist. There is no experience present, and the only thing you can earn from each level is randomly dropped items, which cap off at eight per level. I approve of the levels all being scaled by equipment per season, rather than by level. You can even mix up the order you play groups of episodes in!You have a lot of freedom with your characters. You can select different designs for the squad of five, name them, choose their skills, equip them accordingly, and make some great set-ups while utilizing a ""role"" structure. As a bonus, you get to name your studio, catch phrase, and robot, among other things.The story starts off a bit standard, but it evolves into a fun plot. The build-up is excellently done, and the development your characters get helps a lot. I grew very fond of my squad and was sad to finish their story, though happy with how it ended.There are three endings, and while I have only gotten one of them, I get the feeling they are each very different. Along with this, some choices come up throughout the plot that have an impact on the battles and story overall. It is great to have a reason to replay it beyond simply wanting to play it.Very good graphics all around! The characters look distinctive and have well-done designs, the giant robot and enemies look hardcore, and the TV screen openings/endings/loading screens are nice touches. It is a colorful game that is pleasing to the eye.The music is fan-ta-stic! The opening theme alone made me go, ""Oh heck yes,"" and the rest of the game kept that quality. You can buy the soundtrack for $3.99, which is more than worth it. I know I'll pick it up when I have some more funds to spare.Of course you get a giant robot to fight in. Why wouldn't you? I like the way it works overall. Defending requires precise timing with your clicks, which is of a fair difficutly. But trying to hit the kaijus multiple times is problematic. I missed far more 70% opportunities than I hit with. Bad luck? Most likely, but it can be frustrating. I still call the robot fights a plus due to their epic feel and most of their mechanics, yet unlike the on-foot fights, there is not a whole lot of variation. The developers mentioned they want to strengthen this part of the game, which would be great.Speaking of the developers, they are very friendly people who take fan comments and suggestions into account. They are constantly striving to improve Chroma Squad. Having people like them as the creators of this game makes me think it will become even better. That is incredible to consider, given that they already have produced an amazing piece right here. Their tribute to sentai shows is masterfully executed, and I love their dedication to that.There are 43 achievements that you can get, and most of them are not too difficult. As a bonus, if you beat the game on a higher difficulty level, you get achievements for that level and all of the ones below it. I wish more games would do this instead of insisting you play on easy mode after beating hard mode, all for the sake of an achievement.Okay, look. You control a group of people in colorful suits fighting evil cupcakes, lawyers, irons, badgers, and television sets with martial arts, wacky weapons, and a giant robot made out of cardboard boxes. What else do I need to say to get you to buy this?Neutral:The analog stick movement with the PS3 controller seems a bit floaty. I am not sure how it is for other types of controllers. Using the mouse keeps the movements sharp. Thankfully, this is not a game that requires quick analog movements, so it is not a big deal.Speaking of controllers, you can't use the controller for the kaiju fights. Again, not a big deal, especially since there are not many commands used in them. It is somewhat bothersome to have to set the controller aside, but the store page does say it is only partial controller support. My PS3 controller actually worked in every other situation (besides typing out the names for my heroes/studio,) so that was a pleasant surprise given that I wasn't sure how well it would respond.There is no New Game+. Some games are not suited for New Game+, but this one begs for it. The good news is that the developers have acknowledged the lack of a New Game+ and are trying to implement it. I would be very happy with that addition!What this game does have are multiple save files. I like this feature. The problem is that there is nowhere in the game that makes it obvious this is possible. I thought I would be erasing an old file when I started a new one, and only then learned it keeps multiple files.This game does have trading cards. They look nice and are a good addition for collectors.Cons:If you have more than a certain amount of weapons or armor in your inventory, you can only see a handful to equip. You can't scroll through them to get an older item if you want it. Since I like to have one copy of each item in most of my games, this drove me bonkers. You can still recycle the old items, you just can't get to them on the equip screen. Ugh!When using the keyboard controls, the mouse pointer shows over the game pointer. I don't know if there is a way to disable that. If there is, I couldn't find it. That is the main reason I used a controller, as when you are using the analog sticks instead, the mouse pointer vanishes.There are some spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout the game. Most of them are not that noticeable, and they do not interfere with the story, but they are worth mentioning. The oddest one I saw was weapons that you craft saying ""any role"" can use them, when in truth some are limited to certain roles.Overall experience:I was excited to play this game, and it surpassed even those expectations. It satisfied me not only as an SRPG, but as a stand-out tribute to a great genre. It is charming, fun, and has fantastic spirit. I've beaten it once, but I plan to play it at least two more times. It's too good not to!Rating:9/10. I was leaning toward 9.5/10, but there's a few issues that drag it down a little too much for me to give that precious half of a point. That being said? This game is awesome and playing it will make you feel more awesome as well. Join in on the sentai love and pick up Chroma Squad now!Looking for more great indie games?

												Chroma Squad scratches both my nostalgia and strategy RPG itch in places that have long been left unscratched. Do you remember in your childhood the Super Sentai TV series? If the answer is yes you MUST buy this game! It's a cool tactical game with cute pixel art, a high nostalgic content and a good humor. There is a hilarious tactical strategy RPG hiding beneath the pixel cover, which proudly confesses its Power Rangers heritage. The whole thing is just so darn sweet and well-intentioned.

												It's a bit meta, lots of weird, and a huge amount of fun.Even as a concept, Chroma Squad is unique: You are stunt actors who decide to leave their job on power rangers to start their own better written power rangers. That means winning the battles are only half the fight: You have to win them with style, lest the audience decide your fights are too boring. While some of the directors goals are tricky, they do add to the challenge, and it force you to learn the tricks of the game quickly. You'll soon enjoy tossing actors across the map and pummeling minions as a team for fun and profit.Outside of combat, it's all about the show. You and your mech will need upgrades that not only give you the usual benefits of gear, but also make you look better. Get a bigger studio! SD Cameras! Flood lights! The better it looks, the move people will watch, and the better your options and cash flow will be.And this works together, resulting in a good casual strategy game that I can't wait to play more of.

												Talk about a hidden gem!I wasn't sure of what exactly I was expecting when I purchased Chroma Squad, but I liked the combination of tactical RPG and Power Rangers references enough that I had to give it a shot.  I was impressed right out of the gate as the game incorporates several different genres very well and even adds several new elements that I have not seen before.The tactical combat of the game is very enjoyable and there is much more to it than I had initially assumed.  Each episode begins with your heroes arriving on the scene and battling their enemies in their plain clothes.  While in this form you don't have access to your equipment and abilities, though you are formidable enough to go toe-to-toe with the villains all the same.  Once you transform, however, you get your costume and the previously stated abilities unlocked and you can really do some impressive things.  The aspect of combat that really caught my attention and made this game stand out, though, is that your goal is to make every fight as cinematic as possible.  For example, every battle has two Director's Objectives that give a massive boost to the points you earn for putting on an exciting fight, your Audience.  You also gain audience for performing special skills, defeating enemies, using teamwork to give a teammate a boost (the boosted character performs an acrobatic maneuver to move additional spaces that turn), and most of all for performing unified 'team attacks' where you set your squad up in such a manner that they all focus on and attack the targeted enemy at once,The music is enjoyable, the battles challenging and fun.  Did I mention that you get to customize the look of your gear, colors of your outfits, specializations of your stats and skills, and actors who you use for your squad?  Oh right, and you get to customize and do battle with your own mech!I can not put into words how highly I recommend this game.  Truly a hidden gem and one of the best games I've come across in awhile.			"

												You don't have to like tokusatsu shows to enjoy this game. It's a lot of fun to play, and the developers clearly have put their heart into it. I highly recommend getting it, though at the time of this writing it still has a number of bugs to iron out.The game is challenging. It may be possible to resolve an episode quickly, but going straight to the finish line without doing anything interesting doesn't attract an audience, which you'll need if you want fans and money. Figuring out how to build your audience efficiently while keeping your squad standing is difficult and very satisfying.Between episodes, you produce your show at your studio. Here, you manage your squad's equipment and skills, purchase studio upgrades, answer emails, hire advertising agencies, and choose which episode to shoot next. If you've played X-COM, you'll be familiar with this.The customisation options really let you craft your own super sentai. You can choose your squad members, pick suit colours, name the mecha (the mecha's colours reflect the team's colours), write catchphrases, and of course, name the squad. The personal touches aren't ""cutting-edge"" but they make the game more immersive and playing a lot more fun. At least, I get a kick out of it.Leading my Cuddle Force is a man in a panda suit named Blossom. Squad members Make Love (yes, the button to suit up is labelled ""Make Love"") and they yell ""Cuddles conquer all!"" after transforming. Their finishing move is the Beatdown of Love, and their mecha's name is Robert.			"

												Aaaah! After 10,000 years I'm free! Not only from the infernal hellfire of school, but from that god awful writer's block! Time to conq- write; write a review. Sorry. It's on Chroma Squad, so strap in.REVIEWChroma SquadGENRETactical RPGSTORYThe year is 20XX probably. Five stunt actors with attitude are recording their parts in the most recent episode of the hit sentai show sensation: Super Rangers! The show stinks though, and so does its director: Dr. Mi Ah. [More like MAMAMiAh, amirite?] No cool monster fights, no struggles against the higher ups, and most of all; no giant mecha fights! Our heroes are fed up and, immediately after finishing the recording session, quit Super Rangers to start their own sentai show. The gang sets up their base of operations in Blue's uncle's warehouse; unsure of where to begin. However, in the center of the room stands a large object obscured with a large bedsheet. Pulling the sheet off, our actors find the start of their new journey,  and after signing a contract or two; they're ready to Lights, Camera, Chromatize!GAMEPLAYChroma Squad is very unique in its gameplay, fairly simple, but unique nonetheless. You control your units on a grid, taking turns moving your units and allowing your enemies to move. Simple. You can utilize a teamwork mechanic to not only group up on an enemy, but launch your rangers to spaces they couldn't normally reach. Unique. Each of your units has specific passives and abilities tailored to their class. Simple. These abilities may come into play for completing 'director's instructions'; secondary objectives that will give a healthy boost to your audience. Unique. Every mission features a big boss monster that has its own special attacks and abilities. Simple. Just like in Power Rangers though, the monster becomes gigantic after you beat it; bringing you into a risk-vs-reward kaiju fight minigame. Unique. You get the jist. Outside of combat you can upgrade your gear, improve your studio, answer e-mails, sign marketing agencies to your show, and upgrade your mecha. Upgrading your gear not only increases certain stats, but visually changes the look of your heroes for hire. Improving your studio provides you with an advantage while recording your episodes; though you really shouldn't think too hard about them. I'm not rally sure how upgrading your light fixtures makes enemies less likely to dodge attacks, but I also don't get how so many people burn their meals while watching my show. E-mails range from heartfelt to crazy and everything in-between Sometimesyou get fan-mail about aliens and tinfoil hats, and other times you get companies asking you to buy a 'sword enlargment kit.' Marketing agencies provide temporary bonuses in and outside of combat depending on which agencies you sign your brand to. Personally, I always chose Toys-R-Fans because I like money having money; lots and lots of money. Upgrading your mecha simply gives it small bonuses during the kaiju fights, such as increased hit chance or a chest beam. Y'know, little things.VISUALSThe visuals are nice, not too complex, but very charming. The pixelated aesthetic compliments the game nicely; and this especially shows in the exemplary boss design. You'll start out fighting monsters like Boxing Box; a cardboard box with boxing gloves. [You're on a tight budget okay?] Eventually however, you'll be fighting intergalactic evildoers such as Tengu, a Japanese demon with cloning capabilities. Either way, the game was pleasin' to my eyeballs and I think it'll please yours too.SOUNDTRACKHot diggity dog, this is a good soundtrack! Featuring 31 unique tracks composed by a variety of artists; you couldn't ask for anything better to accompany your multi-dimensional misadventures. Each track fits its respective scene beautifully, with the timing on some of them being downright god-tier. [That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.] Personally, my favorite track has got to be the main theme. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted on the main menu listening to it. I probably need help.FINAL THOUGHTSIt takes quite a bit to make me buy a game based off of impulse alone, and Chroma Squad happened to have that special something. It was charming, enjoyable, and just challenging enough from start to finish to keep me wanting more consistently. In a way, I got hooked on Chroma Squad the way you get hooked on a show. My first thought after beating an episode was 'Man, I can't wait to see what happens next!'. Being able to choose my actors and their names was a great touch, and the ability to modify the catchphrases and names of aspects of the show took it to the next level. I don't think I'll ever get tired of a wise, robed monk yelling 'Prepare for dank justice!' before turning into a spandex clad superhero. The gameplay is simple, but brings a unique twist to just about every aspect. The dialogue is... cringe-worthy at times to say the least. At the same time though, it reminded me of the horrible dialogue in my favorite shows as a kid. I love the look of it, and I don't think I'll ever quite get over how fantastic the music was. This game is by no means perfect, but for what it's worth; I'm willing to say that this is everything that I've ever looked for in a videogame. It panders to my inner-child, it indulges my unhealthy addiction to customization, it scratches that tactical gameplay itch, it gives me goosebumps when I listen to the music, and most of all; it makes me remember why I love video games. Thanks Behold Studios, I needed something to get me outta this rut.Ohheytherealsomayormaynotbeanactualalienthreatthat'sgonnadestroytheplanetifyoudon'tstopitsogoodluckwiththat.			"

												101 Miutes played and just finished chapter 1. Oh excuse me ""Season 1"" with 4 Episodes  + a 4 Part Season FInale! and I have to say - I. Am. Pumped!the game itself is (as the title card says) a Shoot out to the classic Power Rangers series. You take over the role of 5 spandex wearing Super Sentai Actors who grew tired of their old director and start their own studio.They use Blue Rangers Uncles warehouse to shoot their first episodes and find a prop from a huge Super Hero thing - which their old director finds out himself... From there on he starts plotting and you start raking in fans, money and cardboard to make awesome costumes.First of all - the Episode stories are HILARIOUSLY terrible! But then, looking back to when Power Rangers was a thing in my life... WHo cared about story? I dont want to see those 5 people at school! I want to see them beat up those evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Come on, make an entrance and beat the crap out of those Baddies! And thats what those episodes are about ""F**k Story, lets kick some♥♥♥♥♥""the fighting feels like its fitting into a SUper Sentai series, with acrobatic jumps, multi hit combos and dreadfully colorful Team Attacks, and at times, I feel less like a twenty-something years old dude playing a strategy game, and more like the 6 year old kid, watching those spandexed Actors beating the crap out of other spandexed actors, Striking poses myself and being the Blue Ranger in Kindergarten.But I have to do some critic here as well. As first - the tutorial covers the basics. and only the basics. It covers moving, acrobatics, Team attacks with basic attacks. But thats it. Okay - other things can be found out within play, like that you can start a Team Attack with a Weapon Attack, instead of a basic attack and that the Weapon musnt be on Cooldown as well.Secondly - Weapons. Your main weapons are your - gloves. You can buy and craft swords and Guns but they never seemed to use them in battle. just... punching the enemy. Until I found out that those weapons are Active Abilities, with Cooldowns and all.The Amount of customisation is overwhelming in the beginning, and sometimes you may end up not knowing what to pick. But you'll come to understand.However, overall the game is awesome, and if you are a fan of old Super Sentai Series and in need of a little nostalgia fix, get this game!Random Fun Fact : When Haim Saban first bought the US rights for the Power Rangers Series, he only reshot the ""Everyday Life"" scenes with US actors and took the Fightng scenes from the japanese original series and re-dubbed them. A pretty intelligent move.			"

												Starts strong, with an amusing story and good base mechanics.  By season 3 or 4, the scarcity of new and interesting mechanics turns the combat into a dull grind, full of reskinned enemies that you've fought again and again and again.I played through the end of season 4, on the highest difficulty.  The game balance seemed reasonable but not overly challenging at first, but by the end, it felt like I was constantly underlevelled and underequipped.  Even though the game has no concept of experience (season number does function as a sort of ""level"") and my gear was the best on offfer.As a result, the game became a tedious slog of repeatedly sending 2-3 people after each enemy (for multiple turns, if it was the defensive type), keeping everyone's health up, and the occasional weird ""because the director told me so"" goal to get more audience.  The strategy varied *slightly* depending on the exact configuration of enemies, whether you could hit a few with an AOE, and if there was a boss.  For bosses, the standard procedure was to ignore them until you killed the enemies, then repeatedly wail on them with 2-3 people and heal up from their inevitable ""knock one or all nearby people back, move, attack again"" attack pattern.  And with a boss in most episodes (stages), even that became completely routine.The end boss of season 4 was particularly dull.  Every few turns, he summons two enemy-summoning portals.  The portals have about as much health and defense as a normal enemy, and they spawn an enemy every turn (except the turn when they are spawned).  So you spend half or more of your time cleaning up the portals, rather than handling the boss.  The boss also has an assistant, who (for plot reasons) the game suggests not killing.  The assistant heals the boss periodically.  I ended up killing the assistant eventually, because it was taking far, far too long to win when I kept having to go kill portals and watch the boss get healed.  I had even tried letting the portals spawn for a few turns and just focusing on the boss, but had to regroup and clear them out, as the ever-spawning enemies were threatening to overwhelm me.The mech battles similarly stagnate.  The first one is neat, and the next few are also cool as you customize your mech.  But by the end of season 2, you're mech has basically reached its final form, and it's just a matter of making numbers go up to try to keep pace with ever-stronger enemies.I liked the game.  It had charm, an amusingly-cheesy plot, and solid mechanics.  But while the plot progressed and got better, the mechanics didn't,  I don't regret buying it, but I do find myself saddened and disappointed that it couldn't follow through on the solid experience it started.

												TechRaptor Review by Mark RichardAfter a development cycle interrupted by looming threats of legal action due to copyright issues, Chroma Squad, a a Kickstarter turn-based isometric tactical strategy with Super Sentai spices, created by Behold Studios, has made it across the finish line after reaching an amicable agreement with Saban Entertainment. Thank goodness for that, because it’s every bit as charming as the developer’s previous game Knights of Pen & Paper, only without those pesky micro-transactions.Despite a few questionable design choices and small bugs, Chroma Squad is an enjoyable experience. The customization makes all the difference in the world, and it has an infectious innocence that evokes fond childhood memories. The campaign goes on for a solid ten hours, plenty of time to use the framework’s potential to the fullest. If that doesn’t appeal there’s also a branching story, talk of adding multiplayer, and the end credits promise an upcoming New Game+ mode.Overall Score: 6.5/10 - Good - A whimsical love letter to Super Sentai and a must have for a fan, though far from perfect in design.Read the full review at: http://techraptor.net/content/chroma-squad-review-spandex-warriors "

												A great and at times, hilarious, retro tactical RPG. No level up system so the equipment system is the only way to change character stats. This causes a pretty simple tactical RPG system character-wise. Most of the strategy is in the battles themselves making sure you choose the right abilites to accomplish the objectives or ""director's instructions"". Marketing and upgrading your studio are the other two micro managing things you'll do between stages (""episodes""). Both pretty much letting you adjust rewards for completing episodes or helps you gain bonus stats during them. The other major part of the game is the Mecha battle! Although they can get a tad bit tedious, it's Costume Quest-esque fun. You ugrade your machine parts, but in the end the pieces are all pretty similar. The mecha fights are all the same, your hits are die rolls, and missing a 95% hit is infuriating when they pummel you 3 times in a row after. The saving grace for Mecha battles is that you can hold Enter to fast forward them like cut scenes.The dialouge is pretty funny and the story riddled with pop culture references, this makes for a special kind of humor. It has a pretty entertaining story and kept me hooked all the way through. When you do finish the game (I recommend it), keep clicking!			"

												This game is a tactical rpg about a Power Rangers Tv show.  The battles are similar to a game like Final Fantasy Tactics but the gameplay is not as good.  At times the storyline and gameplay feel generic and indie feeling.  After awhile though the storyline gets better and the game was more interesting and fun.   I wish their were a few more songs on this soundtrack for this.  One of the battle songs is a bit overplayed in my opinion.   Overall I would recommend playing this game if you like rpg games and are looking for a different kind of experience.  I do think this game is rated too high, but by no means am I saying this is a bad game.			"

												I got this along with a humble bundle where I really wanted something else, and for whatever reason I played this game for a while instead of just idling it for the cards. I am glad I did.The story is surprisingly good, and the mechanics are pretty interesting. What starts as a bunch of stuntmen making a power-rangers clone slowly takes a turn for the serious... I don't want to spoil the game, but the twist comes a few seasons in and was done well enough to not feel horribly forced.			"

												There is a lot of people saying that this game isn't good because it's boring but if you like tactics games it's amazing. Pro-Terrible writing, but that's EXACTLY what I want out of a camp cheese fest that this game is aiming to do.-Challening combat, enemies don't just sit there and take it.-Amazing OST-It's fairly long, every episode has a new crazy villain. -You can customize nearly every facet of your team and Mega Zord.Cons-Very very easy at the start-These reviews saying it's boring because they don't like tactics games.Seriously that's it. I can't think of how many games I actually want to beat anymore and I played this in full. If you like Sentai shows of the past, especially Power Rangers, I couldn't tell you to buy this more. You'll love it.			"

Recommended: While the soundtrack and art design can subjectively leave something to be desired, the ""tactical RPG"" at the core is fun, and Chroma Squad is a love-letter to the sentai shows of yore.  It's rough around the edges in production values and some of the humour falls flat, but the actual core game is an enjoyable romp through sentai sensibilities and a solid tactical RPG to boot.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												First, I should mention that I played through the game on casual difficulty, so I can't really say much about the gameplay itself. I will say, though, that I greatly appreciate the developers including such an easy level of difficulty for people who just want to enjoy the experience and the production of the game itself.And what a production! Beautiful pixel artwork, excellent music, and a consistent goofy tone throughout. I think a lot more could have been done with the story, especially in terms of developing the individual characters, but I appreciate that this kind of depth is not really the sort of thing you'd find in the TV shows the game is inspired by. The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it reeks of Kickstarter. Well over half the missions include someone totally unrelated to anything running in, saying, 'Hey, it's me! Steve so-and-so! I know kung fu!' and then being a bizarrely-dressed fifth wheel for the duration of it.I get that you can sell little cameos to backers and that this is a fun thing to do, but there is so, so much of it in Chroma Squad. You can't help but think that maybe there could have been more interesting things going on in the actual story if there weren't these constant interruptions.Ultimately, however, the lighthearted tone of the game overall makes it not too big a deal.Anyways, pick this up! It's great.			"

												Let's start by answering a common question. Do you have to be a fan of the inspiration/shows to enjoy this game? No. However Chroma Squad does capture the magic and feeling of its inspiration. The jokes, winks, and nudges are all done hilariously and authentically. Poking fun and at the same time honoring the source material. Being a fan just maximizes your enjoyment and lets you in on some of the jokes. That doesn't stop Chroma Squad from being a very deep, rich, RPG. From customization of your Cast(Party) to choosing what weapons(props) to craft. You will mold your team into what you see fit. Battling minions, bosses, kaiju, and a budget. No two save files will be alike unless you want them to be. Not only do you have that turned based tactical combat. You also must manage your own studio. Choose upgrades to boost ratings, and what ad agency will represent you. All these choices and options can deeply affect the flow of combat, crafting, and if you succeed or fail. All of this seamlessly blends together in this over the top and humorous RPG. With wonderfully done pixel art, music, and steamy goodness. Chroma Squad is as wonderful of a homage, as it is a game.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Have you ever watched Power Rangers as a kid? Well I didn't, but I knew of it, and even watched some scattered episodes here and there, but I always found it too hard to get into and really corny (And I know, it is part of the charm of the series, your hand is probably shaking right now to tell me that, but as a kid, that didn't grab my attention.), and well, this game surely nails on corniness, it feels just like the show, which I nowadays respect a lot, everything is here, the music, the silly costumes, the fights, the megazord, even Zordon is in it; and, in gameplay, this game surprised me, it's really fun!In Chroma Squad, 5 stuntman for an lackluster action show get bored of their current contract and their director, so they decide to quit and make their own independent studio to film an action packed show, starting in a humble warehouse with Chroma Key and a text to speech giant brain prop, up to a real professional studio, and throughout the game you have to manage the costumes, the advertisement, the props, reply to fan letters, and of course, film the show. And it's all tongue-in-cheek and very corny, just like the original Power Rangers. It's amazing to see the big Mecha fights against a giant enemy, or the exaggerated moves, or EXPLOSIONS!!The game has a really cool battle system, it is somewhat basic, but still fun. You watch over the battle field and you can either move or attack an enemy, you also have skills you can activate and a teamwork mechanic, which I think it's really well done. But that's just when you're filming, when you are between shoots, you can manage and improve your studio and show, by buying or crafting clothes and weapons for your rangers and improvements for your mecha, purchasing new filming equipment, signing contracts with advertising agents, and answering fan mail. Everything is really creative and well done.The game looks really good, it has a wonderful 32 bit style to it, and sometimes there's also a 90s TV filter in the studio management screen, which sets the tone pretty well, all the sprites are really well drawn, and the enemies design is also fantastic, especially the bosses, who are a ton of fun.The music and sound effects though, those are the best part, in the title screen, the game has an Japanese opening music playing, which already sets the mood to the game, and the rest of the soundtrack, is really good and somewhat catchy, I love it!Overall, this game is great, I absolutely recommend it, it has the soul of the Power Rangers in it, with all the fun corniness the show had, the developers did a wonderful job! Now they just need to make 23 movies and iterations of it, and it truly will be Power Rangers, the game.Read more video game reviews at cassus.org "

												First Impressions: Will Update as I play moreChroma Squad is a pixel art tactical turn based Rpg. You are a bunch of stuntmen and women that decided to strike out on their own and start a tv studio.You take contracts, set up costumes and weapons,  battle it out in power ranger like episodes that lead to boss fights. All in all its been good fun so far. So far in my limited playtime i would most certainly recommend this game.  "

												Another great game from Behold Studios. It's been a long time coming but retains all of the charm of their earlier Knights of Pen and Paper, plus crunchy tactical RPG combat and all manner of in-jokes and Sentai/Tokusatsu references. Frankly it is a brilliant concept and over the top fun.Cons: There are bugs and typos. Be careful not to alt tab out as you might not get back in. Sometimes your cursor will loose focus on a pop up menu and you'll be unable to click it, making you force quit. These are rare occurances and will likely be fixed before long. Now I have to get back to playing.			"

												This game is good, but not great.I do enjoy the writing, though this is obviously subjective. There are some things that feel like i don't understand an in-joke, but i never really watched a lot of power rangers, so that might be the reason for that. The combat is complex enough in the later stages, but sadly a bit stale in the early game, as you both gain additional abilities throughout the game at a rather slow pace, and additional enemy types take a while to appear. It is pretty accessable due to that early simplicity, but it can drag on for a while. There are some customisation options in gear and skill selection which feel relevant, and the optional objectives can be fun. The Mecha fights are pretty annoying. They are usually either impossible (If you didn't invest enough material into your mecha) or boring (If you have invested enough), and they don't really involve a lot of interesting decision-making.The soundtrack is amazing.Overall, i can definitively recommend the game, i am having fun and have nearly finished it now. I am guessing at a total of about 15-20 hours of gameplay. There are apparently multiple endings, but i don't think this game has that much replayability. Which it does not need to have, it is fine for what it is.			"

												I'm not really one for writing reviews, but I wanted to make an exception for Chroma Squad.This game is an absolute gem. It is so suffused with character and charm as to reach points of ridiculousness. It pairs down the infinite complexity of many tactic games to a small team of characters, which allows each to have their own personality. The storyline, though I'm only a few hours in, is the perfect blend of cliché, kitsch, and nostalgia that somehow comes together to be more than the sum of its parts.I can say wholeheartedly that I really wish I had seen the kickstarter when it was up so that I could say I had done my part to make this game possible.I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few things I would've like to have seen, after all this is a review. I went in expecting to be able to make small graphical reprentation of my friends and I, but when selecting characters you select them as a whole character. So you can't choose what they look like without also choosing their stat bonuses. So, while there is character customization it's not as indepth as I would've liked.During gameplay you'll get access to crafting. I would've liked to have seen a slightly more informative UI and perhaps an indication of how deep the crafting tree goes. It would also be nice if there was more options at each tier. As it is, it seems to break down to two options, either straight HP or HP with some added utility. But, as I said, I'm only a few hours in. (Half way through Season 3)If those two points started to scare you away from this game, please don't let them. I have not had this much goofy fun in a long time, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on it because of my whining.I unreservedly recommend this game.			"

												Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG where you control suit actors for an indie tokusatsu (Japanese for ""special effects"") studio, directing them both in shooting episodes and budgeting behind-the-scenes. Your goal is to make the ultimate indie 'sentai' (Japanese for ""squadron""; think Power Rangers) show by balancing fan acquisition and retention, and leveraging those fans for an extended budget.Brief plot synopsis: a group of stunt actors, tired of being pushed around by their short-sighted and creatively-deficient director, break off to form their own indie production team. They find a prop called Cerebro in a warehouse belong to one of the members' uncle, and make Cerebro the 'hook' for their new show. Unfortunately, they wind up garnering attention from more than just a growing fanbase...Your team is comprised of five members; you choose their suit actors (who each possess various stat bonuses and penalties), their roles (which determine what weapons they can use and what skills they unlock), and their colors (Ever wanted to have a ranger team without a red? Or maybe everyone is pink? Here's your chance!)The meat of the game is the tactical combat - each episode plays out as a series of turn-based encounters. There is no 'initiative' stat, so you can move your characters in any order. Your get two actions, which you can spend moving and attacking (though attacking uses up all remaining moves, so move first), or you can use up the rest of your turn to use ""Teamwork"". The ""Teamwork"" move allows other characters to pool damage for a devastating attack, or to use the teamwork-using party member as a trampoline, bounding across the map in one move action. Each action builds up ""audience"", which acts as power meter and influences mission profit. Once you get enough audience, the ""Chromatize"" action unlocks, allowing your group to form up and transform into their super-powered alter-egos. Once in their hero suits, members unlock their special class abilities and weapons. Once you deal enough damage to a boss, a star and the words ""FINISH IT!"" will appear over their head. This is your cue to use a five-man teammate offensive and unleash one of your two finishing attacks (a standard melee finisher and a ""Form the Giant Five-Part Howitzer!"" weapon finisher that can be done at each weapons' respective ranges). Special ""Director's Instructions"" ask you to perform special tasks within an episode (like ""rescure the hostage in three turns"" or ""don't let any team member fall below 50% health"") for an extra Audience boost.The first 'season' of play will end with you unlocking your giant mecha, which you'll use at the end a majority of the missions thereafter. Mecha combat hinges around stringing together punch combos - the higher your combo, the more damage you deal with your next punch, but the lower your chance of landing said punch. You can order the mecha to defend to end its turn (giving it a bonus to defense against the monsters' counterattack that scales with its current combo bonus) have the mecha perform a finishing move for massive damage (Giant bazooka arm? Energy saber? Chest-mounted laser? Take your pick, or take them all!), or use a defensive technique.After every mission, you're brought back to your studio, where you spend your hard-earned profit on new props and upgrades for your studio. The shop will allow you to buy a few choice weapons and suit parts, but nothing fancy; you'll have to craft the exotic items yourself. During each mission, you collect random materials which can be used to craft props for your heroes or parts for the giant mecha. You can put your fanbase to good use in the Marketing section, where you can hire different firms to grant an array of toggleable bonuses (Need a better drop rate? Go with The Green Team - alternatively, consider an Indie Marketing Gig if you want to improve your Audience-to-Fans turnover ratio). Go to the Studio to buy upgrades to your set (maybe consider some health care?) or mess around with your studio options (""Lights, Camera, Chromatize!"" not cutting it for a transformation call? Why not try ""Powers Unite!""?). The Mecha section allows you to outfit and upgrade your giant mecha for the kaiju-sized brawls. Finally, the Actors section allows you to review your suit actors' stats, change their special abilities, and mess with their equipment (You can't wear buckets on your heads forever, guys). During the course of the campaign, you'll make decisions through the in-game e-mail system, some of which affect which bosses you fight. While the plot stays relatively the same regardless of what you do (up until the halfway point, anyway!), there are multiple endings depending on the choices you make, and multiple playthroughs are necessary to see everything.I would recommend Chroma Squad to anyone who enjoys tactical RPGs, regardless if they're a diehard tokusatsu fan (but being a diehard tokusatsu fan won't hurt). Chroma Squad retails for $15, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it at that price.			"

												A group of stuntmen of a sentai series decide to go indie after they get too annoyed with their boss' arrogance: starting from a small warehouse and using cardboard costumes you''ll be following their story in this tactical RPG.Chroma Squas is not only a love letter to the sentai genre but also a very fun game to play thanks to its humourous story and gameplay straight out from the series it took as a model.PROS:-quirky pixel art-spot-on sentai-inspired soundtrack-amusing plot backed by dialogues filled with references and humour-story offers three branching paths that'll change scenes, bosses and even who joins your team-the tactical combat is fun and offers a decent challenge, same goes for boss fights -studio management, crafting, a shop and a few unlockable skills all give a fair sense of progression-nice length, took me 11 hours on Interesting difficultyNEUTRAL:-the actual studio management options are pretty light on content-gameplay stays basically the same and can get a bit triteCONS:-mecha fights get dull after a bit-could have used an ""undo last move"" button and an animation speed option-randomness in crafting is annoying


Chroma Squad 
A Screenshot of Chroma Squad
By: stranger1982




The sentai genre is everywhere in the game..it's in the costumes, the moves you pull, the mecha fights against kaijus and the over the top dialogues: but Chroma Squad also breaks the fourth wall by letting you see the cameras and green screen or by chatting amicably with the extra in the boss costume before you fight them. Eventually you'll realize that maybe not everything is just a special effect but the game rarely abandons its humour and will keep throwing references your way. You'll also have to manage your studio by buying upgrades and deciding which contracts to sign for marketing: while studio upgrades are a straightforward ""more is better"" story ad agencies all provide different bonuses to fights/ audience/ money gained letting you customize your experience a bit.Most fights feel fair and some can be easy as long as you upgrade your equipment and play decently but, at times, you might end up making a bad decision due to not being able to see whether an enemy'll be in range of your rifle or how far you'll be able to throw teammates before you actually move: this is where an undo button'd have worked wonders in case you misjudged a distance-which is not as hard as it sounds- or just misclick. Mecha fights are enjoyable at first but they get dull quite fast as you're basically just chaining a combo, doing the ""click to defend"" minigame on enemy turn, and unleashing a special move when needed: it's not bad per se but the number of fights and the repetitive gameplay make the novelty value fade fast. Last but not least the crafting system is a bit of a chore as you'll be using materials dropped from fights or bought to build new costume pieces and weapons, sadly they come with random properties so it's mostly luck based whether you'll be getting something decent or useless: in the end you can either reload your save and try again or just buy some all around decent stuff from the shop directly.Chroma Squad offers a good amout of fun, if limited in variety, gameplay enriched by an amusing story and narrative: it's good entertainment made even better if you have even just a passing knowledge of the sentai genre.

			Take a look with us at Behold Studios' tactical RPG based on Saban's Power Rangers. Yeah, it's as awesome as it sounds.		

Who didn’t have at least some fascination for Power Rangers when they were a kid? Sure the effects were cheesy and the plots formulaic, but there was a special magic when you were younger to seeing a team of colourful heroes take down hordes of nameless aliens and monsters. Hell, Marvel Disney seems to know what’s up. With the help of Kickstarter, Behold Studios launched their tactical RPG based off Saban’s hit franchise with amazing results. Get your suit ready, it’s time to Chromatize.For such a lighthearted tone, the storyline is legitimately captivating. In what almost seems like a metaphor for the formation of Behold Studios, the 5 stunt actors that do most of the work on their past Sentai show decide to quit out of frustration with their director’s lack of fresh ideas. While building a studio from scratch, our heroes need to shoot episodes quickly and establish a fanbase to turn some revenue so they can keep the lights on, the actors paid, and the new season contracts coming in. The entire game is framed around this television production point of view, with missions gradually blurring the lines of reality into the realms of fantasy and superpower for the characters. Setups for conflict are playful with these ideas; an episode may require multiple reshoots due to on-set power outages, and other times you could be joined by unexpected ally rangers with their own personal vendettas against the alien baddies. Each level ends with tweets from your followers either praising or criticizing your work, and a fun email system helps to make you feel like you’re actually interacting with your niche crowd. The brief tutorial on combat helps succinctly explain the flow of fighting without dragging down players with over-explanation, and it does a great job to tie into the introduction of the story. The whole game carries a consistently fun tone that’s easy to enjoy. It’s a cheerful and self-aware romp through the experiences of being an independent studio and crafting something meaningful to both the creators and fans.For veterans of the genre it may feel slightly basic and on a smaller scale, but every element you’d want in a tactical RPG has been incorporated here fantastically. There are 5 separate roles for each party member to fill. There’s the lead that acts as a tank, support as a healer, a stealthy and mobile scout, an assault character as your heaviest damage unit, and a techie that specializes in ranged combat and item use. Each class has distinct capabilities and limitations for moving around boards and dispatching enemies, making your choice of team member just as important as what you want to do with them. Audience is gained by performing skillful moves and combos, and this metric dictates your overall fan count and income. Just like most Power Rangers episodes, the squad usually has to engage in some out of costume combat before having enough audience power to Chromatize and activate your powerful suits and abilities. Skilled players can be rewarded with bonus audience by following special director instructions in each episode shoot. Trying to setup tactics to fulfil every side goal can be challenging, but other times the objectives sort of complete themselves.Players can employ a variety of tactics to clear levels; strategies don’t simply involve just hiding weaker units behind tanks. There are two phases to each character’s turn, allowing you to creatively set up attacks with special weapons, abilities, and a unique gameplay element called Teamwork. Activating this ability sets up the character to help gang-attack enemies with subsequent Rangers, or catapult teammates across the board to reach distant foes. Setting up a Teamwork attack with all 5 members results in a satisfying finishing move that deals massive damage, but players who aren’t careful to use this maneuver appropriately are punished with a loss of audience interest.Of course many bosses take on a second life after defeat, becoming Kaiju beasts to destroy with your giant mecha robot. These sequences handle similarly to piloting a World of Warcraft vehicle, but unfortunately for how common these parts are they lack the same amount of strategy that can be found in the rest of the game.Players that put in the time will find it easy to see the inspiration taken from the source material in a loving way, and the thoughtful game behind it. Your experience feels totally customizable from the start. You choose from a large variety of actors; characters with specific stats to fit into the game’s 5 main roles for your squad. You can set the colour for each member as well, fully immersing your interest in your team. If you want the pink ranger to steal the spotlight with the lead role you can totally do that here, or maybe you don’t want a red ranger at all, there really are no limits to team assembly. The unique T.V. production management system to your team’s growth is a wonderfully creative way to explain the game’s action and provide a narrative backbone to the accumulation of player wealth. Rather than gaining experience and levels, characters boost their stats through buying and crafting new gear. Creating new items from dropped material makes outfitting your team to be a more involved endeavour than simply spending money at a shop, and it motivates you to defeat just a few more foes in each stage to get those extra drops. Quirky item descriptions help keep a smile on your face while you click through these menus. There’s a good emphasis on needing to understand how to get the most out of your cash and saved up materials in order to make your team the best it can be. There’s also an interesting balance between managing your budget to buy your team these upgrades and to also spend on studio expenses, such as better lighting and healthcare, each adding their own statistical advantages. A variety of marketing companies can be hired for different perks in order to gain a larger audience and more income, and just like the items more of these are unlocked as you progress through the story. The game’s broken down into 5 seasons, with each stage acting as an episode shoot. Starting a new season unlocks the next tier on each character’s ability tree, giving exciting progression to each of the distinct classes. Players can set their team’s abilities to their preference and go back to tweak them later with no penalty, giving a level of freedom to experimentation on these trees that isn’t in most role playing games.The level of detail in the presentation truly creates a vibrant world to take in, all accompanied by a soundtrack that’s honestly one of the most enjoyable we’ve ever found in an indie game. Little touches like the plucky upbeat signature jingle complements the rest of the perfect retro groove that the music carefully weaves with its effects and scales. Seriously, they’re some of the best bit-style tracks this side of Megaman. Art is so fine-tuned as to even include bent corners on menu screens to make you feel like you’re watching from your tube TV. The familiar pixel art style is done expertly; there’s a real level of character given to the sprites by the careful expressions and animations. The isometric perspective works extremely well for both the gameplay and the artwork. Behold Studios really hit all the right notes, giving us a great tactical turn-based action title that’s a perfect game for fans of the genre or anyone looking to try it for the first time. You might spend some time wading through some new gameplay elements, but it quickly clicks and with enough skill you’ll soon be taking down monsters just like they do on TV. There’s no doubt that you should take up your offer to join the Chroma Squad.SCORE: 9.0			"

												Chroma Squad is absolutely worthy of my 300 Steam games anniversary. This game doubles, no, triples the fun capacity Asian superhero shows comprise, as it's about winning the audience as much as winning the forces of evil. It could have been really plain if they simply mixed fighting sequences with cutscenes, but the fourth wall gameplay mechanics made this game something special. You don't only gear up and ""battle"", you literary make a show through different decisions as a director and manager. Half a year in and this is one of the most entertaining games I played in 2015.			"

												When the game starts, its pretty obvious that the devs are big big fans of the source material. A lot of love and care went into the development of this game. The art style and the audio fits the theme nicely.As a strategy-rpg, its pretty light fare. Both casual strategy fans and hardcore super sentai fans will find a lot to love in the game. While the tactical battles aren't as deep as can be found in FFT, Ogre Tactics and etc, Chroma Squad has enough meat for strategy fans to be able to sink their teeth into.Overall, I'm happy with the game and I'm glad that I backed it in KickStarter.

												Chroma Squad is a decent turn-based tactics parody RPG that might not be complex enough for some people. It probably helped that I grew up on Power Rangers so my appreciation for the setting and tolerance for its issues might go a bit further than some. You can expect around 12 hours of playtime on the normal difficulty if you engage a bit with the crafting system and take time to equip everyone optimally.I’ll start off by going over Chroma Squad’s problems. This game is weighed down by its boring mecha fights and gameplay repetitiveness. The mecha fights are 2D encounters where you take turns beating each other up instead of taking place on a grid. Imagine missing attacks with 80-90% accuracy against monsters that need to be KO’d three times and you have the early mecha combat experience. The fights become more tolerable later as you can equip different mech parts that increase accuracy (a must), other stats, or grant new abilities. Still, they’re too long and not mechanically interesting. I also didn’t enjoy the timing mini-game when you defend. The gameplay repetitiveness comes from the pacing of acquiring new abilities and the common enemy variety. The bosses are fine and some of them have interesting gimmicks. New abilities are unlocked at the start of a new season which felt too long since you can only have one active out of the two or three choices at that tier. Some choices felt obvious, but I did do some switching around later in the game. What helped me was playing in short bursts of 1-1.5 hours. Otherwise, the gameplay might wear you down since you’ll often be using the same strategies against the same baddies. I noticed areas being reused often too. I recommend deliberately setting out to acquire the Rider path for season 5 to experience some very interesting gameplay changes relative to the rest of the game.Chroma Squad allows for some silly customization. Since the theme is that you’re running a TV studio, you’re able to select your actors, name their characters, name the studio, customize catchphrases, name the mech, and more.  I highly recommend personalizing everything to have more fun with it. I went with Friendship Squad and named the mech Big Friend. The power of friendship can overcome all, don’t cha know.The gameplay itself involves recording episodes (going out on missions) and managing your team in-between shoots. Episodes involve combat and following the Director’s Instructions as best as you can since you want to have a high audience rating for more money and fan conversion. The combat involves you making squad members move twice or move and then attack (attacks end the character’s turn). You can use certain abilities that count as free actions so that you can still attack and/or move. The Teamwork ability that any class can use lets you gang up on an enemy or toss teammates around which lets them move farther. The gameplay becomes more interesting later with more abilities unlocked while the start is a bit slow.An example I can give is the having the Assault use Teamwork to toss the Lead away from danger, then using the Lead’s Join Up ability (free action) to gather everyone without making them use any actions, followed by the Support’s AoE heal, using the Lead’s Lasso ability to rope in a weak enemy for a kill, and then making the Scout cloak for something sneaky-sneaky.The team management aspect involves crafting gear with materials found in episodes or from crates, deciding on what studio upgrades to buy, deciding which marketing agency to hire (income buffs, combat buffs) so that you can spend fans on even more buffs, buying gear from the shop, deciding on what abilities to use, and reading fan mail. Crafting can be a little time consuming considering that some stats are RNG which leads to multiple attempts if you have a poor roll.Well, that’s it. I liked the game overall, but it does have some problems. I think it’s worth a look.			"

												This game made me glad, than I'm subscribed to Humble Monthly Bundle ;). It's simply awesome. Fun, light-hearted, cute, self-aware and full of references - most of which I probably didn't get, but hey! How fun this game must be for people who love Power Rangers and similar TV series! But fear not! Even if you know almost nothing about this sort of stuff, you'll still find something for yourself :).Pros:+ choose your own team - Want to have all female squad? Here you go! Or maybe men only (men dressed as panda by any chance...?). Why not! But how about... A robot? Or an alien? Or maybe even a beaver? + crafting, managing your own studio, buying upgrades, fan mails... Don't you have a feeling that sometimes game developers give us just ""naked"" game, without any substance besides main action? Well, you won't have this feeling here.+ graphic - I cannot imagine better graphic style for this game.+ music - simply awesome. I think Lord Gaga's theme will stay in my memory for pretty long time. + tons and tons of references! + funny, self-aware, full of intended cliches. If it won't make you laugh, it'll at least make you smile.+ awesome, hilarious enemies.+ challenging but not frustrating - I finished game on medium difficulty. It can be pretty challenging when you try to fulfill all goals, but still it's not that hard that you want to throw your PC out ;).Sadly, there are also cons:- too long fights. Not all of them, of course, some are very quickly, but there's tons of fights that just take too much damn time and it's not because player don't use proper strategy. No, no. It's because there are fights with tons of enemie's minions and each one of them need to make a move, EACH turn, and sometimes it really takes forever. And if you add mines/sprouts to that... It's just hell. And I don't think there's a way to skip it. There was a time, when I literally step away from my computer for a few minutes and when I get back, last enemies were still moving.- mecha combat - it breaks my heart, but it may be one of the weakest points of this game. Of course you need to have huge robots and huge monsters with the game heavily inspired by Power Rangers. And don't get me wrong, crafting upgrades for your Mecha is pretty interesting, but fight itself... Boring and repetitive. If Mecha battles were reserved only for final episodes/bosses then maybe I wouldn't have this opinion, but they are a regular part o game. And they look exactly the same. You make combos, that ends with special move/defense or just because you didn't manage to do another attack. Then your opponent attacks - always three times (and sometimes there's a special move). You defend yourself by clicking in the right moment. And then the process continue. Regular fights are fun (if they don't take too long), because you have different enemies, with different skills, minions, attacks, goals etc. Here, no matter who your opponent is, fight ALWAYS looks the same. There's no much strategy involved.			"

												I had a fun time with this one. The game design is solid, and the game has sufficient challenge at a casual level. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. Most of the combat themes are 'catchy.'I have mixed feelings about the story, but I would not say it is bad. At some parts I wanted to read through it, while at other parts I just skipped it to get to the combat. Whether you care about the story or not, you can always fast-forward through it - which is a nice feature the devs added.With everything said, I definitely recommend giving this game a shot.			"

												 Very fun and thematic game, played all the 3 endings. The tactical RPG element is somewhat simple, but on the highest difficulty the combat is very interesting, because you have to work with what you have and can't grind levels/items. The difficulty curve to me was just right. And it's from a studio from my country, so I might be biased, but I want this Behold Studio to keep growing!			"

												I started playing Chroma Squad and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it a joy. I doubt its wide appeal but jesus as someone who played the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of the SNES Front Mission and adored Power Rangers back in 93 I'm in heaven.  Chroma Squad hits that itch juuuuust right. It's one of those games that was made just for me. Having played it for a while, I have to say that the limiting factor is a horribly designed menu system. Being able to flip through menus and equipment/item/crafting screens is 110% key for this kind-of game and frankly... this one sucks. It's to the point where I'm on Season 3 and I barely want to continue because it means *another* long set of having to jump menu to menu to menu to compare shop item stats versus craft item stats versus what my heroes already have equipped. It is 100% kneecapping my enjoyment of an otherwise A+ game.Pity.			"

												It's been a while since I last properly sat down and played an SRPG, and I was honestly weary to a degree with the whole Super Sentai's Powers Rangers theme Chroma Squad employed. Needless to say fact I beat it in under three days after I actually began playing should tell you I was way off that mark.You create and assume the roles of your five-strong Super Sentai group, process which is done through choosing which character will assume each role (Lead, Assist, etc) and there are quite a few cameos ranging from actors to pop icons you may recognize. I had fun naming my totally-not-Weasley-Snipes “Eyes-Open”, but that's beside the point. After that's done and over with you find out they're disgruntled stunt actors on a related show who decide to create a new studio and show of their own. These are the humble beginnings game presents you with and it's customizable down to Ranger colors, studio name catchphrases team will employ. Far be it for me to say that's ALL there is to this story, and oh boy does it escalate, but it never loses that sense of “we're running a show here” which is further enforced by character's comments, episode setups and constant camera crews on the set. This illusion is never broken because no matter what happens you're still making a show which nets you fans and money. Both are important for keeping your studio successful because it lets you craft gear from materials your enemies drop; things like tape, cardboard and glass, or straight up buy new stuff from the store. You will also want to invest in your studio for things like HD cameras which net you more audience per-episode, better health insurance for HP bonus, etc. It's definitely sensible and tongue-in-cheek with the mood of the game. As befitting a Super Sentai team you will also acquire a wise MENTOR and Mecha at your disposal, latter which also gets its own separate upgrades and is used in 1v1 fights against giant opponents. As far as actual meat of the game goes, that being combat, you'll quickly discover your team of five is constantly outnumbered usually 3-to1 if you're lucky and keeping your gear up snuff is a good idea. As each of the five seasons go by your characters unlock another tier of skills you can choose form so you're not just brute-forcing it. In fact, I'd argue game is somewhat on the easy side unless you really want to do all of Director's Instructions aka specific set of objectives in each episode which may be on the tricky side but are also a great way to get more audience, except in the very last part when that difficulty spike becomes too real. It does make for a fitting conclusion, but also drags down what should've been a way more intense end game. I will say that send off itself is amazing and no game that plays the theme track can do wrong by me in that regard. It turns out your show is pretty radical and watched worldwide. If there are any negatives they are very few, mostly on the side of some Unity engine shenanigans like some scripts not being timed correctly which leads to some delays, hang ups when game has to display things like a ton of audience bonus gained from healing and alike, but I would probably point out overused Mecha fights in the last episode or so as the worst offender for me. You don't have to end each episode like that and especially not because you'll notice hit percentage is still RNG-driven so it'll eventually turn on you. I also wish game was longer, but you can also have too much of the good stuff.So, did I like Chroma Squad? I loved it. Really got me motivated to play some more SRPGs when I get the time and had me grinning like a maniac at times. You gotta accept it is, well, episodic at times because that's the source material it draws from, but stellar soundtrack really kicks in at times and does wonders for overall impression. If you're even remotely interested in these games give it a go and remember to GATTAI at your earliest convenience.			"

												I had a great time playing this! With that sweet, sweet 90's pixel-art nostalgia and the general ""have fun"" attitude of the game, I couldn't help but enjoy it! Not to mention that awesome music. The Nintendo/Sega-esque 8-bit style battle music is soothing to my soul.For a T-RPG it's pretty minimal in its actual strategic gameplay. That was something I personally loved, but I could easily see others hating. Differen't strokes for differen't folks. If you were looking for a hardcore, strategy heavy tactical RPG (which no one would blame you considering one of the key words is ""Tactical"").. then this game most likely isn't for you. If anything, as far as strategy goes it's mainly about what you build more so than what you actually do during the battle sequences. I think this was a great move because It greatly helps the game's immersion factor, which is the part that truly charms you and stands out the most. I played on intermediate difficulty and not once did I have to consciously think about how I was gonna move/attack 'X' turns ahead like a game of chess. I did, however, have a moment where I consciously thought (and was surprised) at how captivated I was into what's basically an 8-bit power rangers rip-off with a ""behind the scenes"" twist. I think it's because of factors like the minimal strategic gameplay (as well as the storyline) that I was able to just relax my stoned mind and have fun with it.The story is easily where this game shines the most. A story that really makes you feel like you're progressing from the point of being stunt actors playing fake super heroes to becoming actual ones that eventually end up saving the entire planet (and I think universe?). Another thing to note about this game is it's very satirical, emphasizing mainly on the process that goes in to shooting the episodes and production in general. The bosses are sometimes pretty ludicrous in design (and name) but this game's humor is just that, ludicrous and out there- So it fits the theme nicely. There's also multiple endings- something that I was unaware of until randomly checking out the achievements (lol). That's a pretty big bonus and adds a good bit of replayability. The story is also much longer than I expected it to be, so that was a pleasant surprise all aroundThe dialogue became... interesting... at times. But the rest of the game as a whole easily makes up for the questionable dialogue. When it's bad dialogue- it's intentional. It's not like it's bad because it was an earnest attempt at something that just came out wrong in translation, or something that just flat out didn't work at all. It's definitely all intentionally placed bad dialogue. Things like the game's constant breaking of the fourth wall was forgiveable... but intentional typos for a laugh and putting emoji's into my game dialogue?! NO. Just, NO!The music was fantastic and hit all the right spots. I'm considering buying the soundtrack for $5 just to make a good review for it that would probably rival this one in length. Nuff said.. It's probably what hooked me the most (next to the story) being how important music in general is to a guy like me, but I digress.All in All, it's a fantastic game. I highly recommend if you enjoyed anything 'Power Rangers' related when you were younger, and just feel like having a few laughs with it now that you're older. "

												Tactical RPG fans interested in a Power Rangers parody should buy.I would like to give it a thumbs up. However, while I personally enjoyed the game, it has far too many issues and bugs. Behold Studios can do better.Pros* The Teamwork systemThe core of the battle system is the Teamwork system. I overall really like it. During a character's turn, you can end it by selecting ""Teamwork"". That character can then do one of two things: A. Join another team member's attack on an enemy.  B. Throw another team member to a further space.* You can fast forward through scenes by holding down Enter or SpaceA lot of games simply have a ""skip scene"" option, but that's a very binary choice. With fast forward, I can selectively skip through parts of scenes.* Character models change as you change equipment- In a lot of RPG's, the character models are the same regardless of what you've equipped. In Chroma Squad, the characters look different depending on what you've equipped!* Music- The background Studio music got stuck in my head. In a good way.- The music that plays in the Mecha battles is good and gives the appropriate feeling.- Japanese theme songs are great.* Can choose the order you play Episodes in- Each Season, there are 5 to 6 Episodes. Except for the first and last Episode, you can choose which order you play the Episodes in.Mixed* Story branches based on your choices- Great to have branching- But the branching is simplistic. There's only one minor branch and one major branch- If you want to see all 3 different endings, you have to replay from the beginning. And because the branching is so simplistic, you'll be mostly replaying the same content.Cons* Many game mechanics are not clearly explained.- What's Crafting Rate? Fan Conversion Rate? Income Conversion? Skill Regin? None of these are clearly explained by the game.- Some abilities boost Defense. Wait, how do I see my character's Defense stat? Well, you can't. They hid it.* Difficult to plan character movementIn Chroma Squad, you'll often want to use Team Acrobatics to have one team member throw another to a further tile. But this is tough to plan and I was often off by one.- You don't get to see the member's throwing range until after you've already put them into Teamwork mode.- The grid is only explicitly drawn as you're moving a character. And it is only drawn covering the area that that member can cover. The ability to undo actions that don't trigger RNG would be helpful. So you could undo movement or putting a member into Teamwork (exception: the Support class can heal neighboring members when put into Teamwork mode, which does trigger RNG). * Crafting is problematic.You can either buy equipment or craft it yourself. Crafting is neat in concept, but it has several issues:- The bought equipment is unique from the crafted equipment. You'll often be asking yourself whether you should buy Equipment B or craft Equipment C.  However, the Shop and Crafting screens are separate, so there is no direct way to compare the two. I found myself constantly jumping between the two screens. (And you can't jump directly between them. You have to back out to the main Studio screen first. Bleh.)- I generally found the Crafted equipment to be worse than the bought equipment.- Some crafted items get random properties, which are basically boosts to one of the stats. But there's no explanation of what to expect. If you get Health +10 is that a good roll or a bad roll? Also, sometimes your rolls can be for the same stat. I found that a bit surprising at first and wondered if the game maybe failed to give me one of my random properties.* The story scenes have horribly slow pacing. Thank goodness you can fast-forward.- In many scenes, the enemies are shown appearing one... by... one...  by... one... Why? No one want to see that.- Do you like watching characters move across the screen with nothing happening?- There are significant pauses between characters saying lines- The fast forward system doesn't have an option to let you stop fast-forwarding at speech lines. That's what I really want. I want to read the dialog, but I don't want to have to wait through poorly choreagraphed scenes. * Every mecha battle is the exact same- Every monster you fight behaves the same way. And so you never have to change your strategy in how to fight them.- The setting where you fight is always the exact same. (The game lampshades this, but that doesn't excuse it.) - This was a huge missed opportunity. Imagine monsters that attack in unique ways that require unique responses. Or unique environments that you can use as part of the fight.* The final bad guy is a huge letdown. He simply just shows up at the very end. You've never seen him before. There's absolutely no connection to the character. That's a big story failure.* Tons of bugs- About 20+ minutes into the final battle, the game wouldn't advance. I had to restart from the beginning of the battle.- After finishing an Episode, I pressed escape while it was totalling how much Money and Fans I had earned. The game got in a messed up state and never gave me credit for the Money or Fans.- For a game that fails to explain its mechanics, it compounds this by showing incorrect information around those mechanics:-- The game often improperly calculates Expected Income. -- One Ad Agency gives you a bonus of 35 Fans per Episode. The game improperly shows that the Fan Conversion rate is increased by 35, instead of just a flat increase of 35 Fans.-- The game is often incorrect about the number of Fans and Money you earned the previous Episode- When defending in the Mecha battles, you basically have to time when you press your mouse. Unfortunately, this is exactly when the game would decide to stutter on me.- Sometimes a character is attacked offscreen and the camera doesn't move to show you what's happening.- If you click the upper right corner, you can submit a bug report, which is great. But, the form to report bugs has bugs! The arrow keys where you're writing text don't work.			"

												I highly suggest buying Chroma Squad. Now, some people say you should watch a sentai series or something to understand this, but I started playing this game having watched one episode of Power Rangers in my entire life. I used to think that toukatsu looked pretty cheesy, but this game has given me a new view of it, and I actually kind of appreciate it now. The game can be summed up as ""X-Com meets Power Rangers"" basically. You control a team of five people, and each one has their own special moves and name. The team is highly customizable, and I've actually grown attached to my hilarious looking squad. You also frequently fight kaiju (big monsters) in a big robot of your own. The game also has a pretty neat crafting system, a fanbase system, marketing stuff, and even MORE! If that doesn't sound cool enough to buy then you obviously have no soul. Anyway, give it a shot, and if you aren't sure, wait for a sale. It's worth it!			"

												Great brazilian game inspired by the Super Sentai series like Changeman and Power Rangers.You are creating your own studio to produce your Super Sentai serie, so you have to contract the actors to perform in the show, manage the money and audience on each episode and do the costumes and buy the equipment.The gameplay is a turn based combat system, where you must perform the instructions by the director to win more money and get more fans to watch your show. I think that is pretty nice it forces you to explore more your teammates. And of course there are some giant robot fights in the end of the episodes, it is nice but too easy to win.If you are more a RPG-person, your can see the status of every weapon and equipment for each member of the team. And if you don't care about these numbers you can just pick the most expensive and high level item and you are ready to go.So if you liked any Super Sentai serie when you were a kid (or still watching these series) you should play it now.Note to my brazilian friends gamers: Jogae pra apoiar os parça da comunidade indie Brazuca e ajudar a desenvolver mais a industria de games em nosso país :D			"

												Funny, well-crafted, challenging (on challenging) but not unfair and a funny story to boot! This game is a grid-based turn based strategy featuring well-down pixel art (well-drawn enough to overcome my initial dislike for pixel art generally) where you control 5 Power Ranger style characters to set up your own awesome TV Show. Naturally, things aren't what they seem in the world. While the game is generally a  lot of fun there are some minor frustrations: bugs can force you to repeat levels (which can be a grind if it occurs late on a particularly difficult or long mission), cut scenes are unskippable (only fast forwardable) and there is no ability to grind so if you misspend your gold you're gonna have to play a lot better.In Summary: 4 RAINBOW WARRIORS X out of 5PS: FEEL THE POWER OF THE RAINBOW!

												Pros - The general look of the game is top notch. It's very appealing to look at. - The soundtrack is decent, albeit forgetable. - Changes in armor and weaponry are actually shown on the sprites, which makes equipping new gear feel much better. - The Teamwork function is pretty neat. It allows for some pretty interesting tactics in combat. Having one character toss another character in order to move them closer to an enemy is a cool way to move around the map. I just wish it was more fledged out. I feel like this would be a great feature if it was just developed a bit more.Cons - The game is very easy. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I'm having no trouble so far. - Customization feels pointless. It doesn't matter what you call your crew, your show, your attack names, etc. It's just there for the sake of having it as a selling point. - The writing is terrible. It actually has smileys - :) - written in speech bubbles. As though the characters are somehow able to pronounce "":)"". Furthermore, not an hour in and the game blatantly tries to push an agenda down your throat by (poorly) criticizing the ""damsel in distress"" trope. A character mentions that his sister would like to appear on the show in respone to them needing someone to play the role of hostage, which another character immediately says they cannot allow, and they find a male person to play the role of hostage instead. It's never explained WHY having a woman in that role would be bad, they just say it's bad. - You cannot influence the episodes in any way. How you take out enemies, how many of your crew members go down in battle, how long it takes, etc... All of that only influences how many fans your show gets, and it's all completely arbitrary. (A hero falling in battle for any reason will cause you to lose viewers, while something as simple as moving a hero around on the map can cause you to gain viewers.) - Mecha battles are insultingly simple. You have the option to either attack or defend. You can attack as many times as you want, but your chance to hit decreases with each succesful strike. Defending ends your turn and gives you a bonus to defense, which increases the more times you've hit your opponent this turn. On your opponent's turn, you just click the mouse button at the right time to reduce damage. Eventually, you gain access to a finishin move, which deals high damage and ends your turn instantly. That's all.I came into this expecting something like Agarest mixed with Game Maker Tycoon. I have to say, I'm very disappointed. Even if you're a huge fan of Sentai shows, I imagine the cringy dialogue, boring story, and shallow gameplay will start to rub you the wrong way eventually.I cannot recommend this game to anyone, and it is certainly not worth the asking price. I doubt I'll ever finish the game, so I don't even consider it worth my time.			"

												In terms of Strategy RPG's, I'll put this somewhere between Disgaea and X-Com. The world and story are great, although the combat isn't too strategic focus since there's a lack of flanking and not many map obstacles that you'd find in other games. The macro, base building element on the other hand surpasses X-Com as there's alot more variables to consider such as hiring a marketing firm to promote the show, crafting or shopping for armor and weapons, and picking items to upgrade your studio. It's a fantastic game, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Great game. I think it really helps if you're a fan of Super Sentai shows. Even a reasonable knowledge of Power Rangers will do. But even without that, I think what really shines through with this game is how self-referential a lot of the writing and humour is. Fake emails from viewers asking when the Kickstarter backers will get their copies, sidelong references to how similar all the enemies look, pokes at bad spell-checking of the narrator.And the pop-culture references go beyond Power Rangers. If you look closely enough, there are littered references and parodies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Teletubbies, Robocop - even The Devil's Advocate!Behind all this is an extremely solid and varied strategy game. Chroma Squad comes in for a lot of criticism for being shallow - and I think this was my first impression, too. The first ""season"" of the game provides very limited flexibility and differences between characters and especially on normal difficulty it's easy to simply punch your way through most battles. But the action is driven by the Director's Instructions which push you to complete battle with a certain style and a certain way, which makes a difference to audience size, fans and of course studio income. Characters get an additional ability slot unlocked per-season, so by the third or fourth set of missions it's possible to really customise your squad's abilities and maximise your performance. Arguably the weakest element is the Kaiju fights, in which you take turns trading blows with a giant enemy. I personally like them and I think they're a really satisfying end to an episode, from a narrative point of view. BUT, if you choose upgrades which give you boosted attack and hit % then there really isn't much to do apart from gamble with the decreasing hit % and occasionally defend. However I recently went for a Mecha build which game me a choice of four special abilities to choose from and this gave me a lot of flexibility, expression and interest in these fights - but that route is optional, so the devs may want to consider what needs changing for these in - dare I wish!? - a sequel.But it's definitely one of those games where I think ""ahh, one more episode"" and before I know it, it's two A.M. Really fun turn-based combat, great humour and stories and I love the low bit graphic style.			"

												As a kamen rider/super sentai fan I absolutely enjoyed this game for the first hour or so.  However, after the magic of creating your own sentai team wears off the game's flaws shine.  The mech battles are the MOST tedious, repeatitive and awful experience you'll even have with a game.  The regular on foot combat gets pretty repetitive as well, but isn't the worst RPG combat I've endured.  THE WRITING THOUGH. The writing is attrocious even with the patch that removed some of the meme spouting.  It screams reddit and doesn't ever improve to feel like you're in an actual sentai show.			"

												I was never a real fan of the whole sentai/power rangers stuff, still the theme was enjoyable on a '90s nostalgia level. I guess a lot of jokes went over my head but I didn't overly mind much.This game describes itself as a tactical RPG, and it couldn't be more accurate about that. It's not particularly strategy heavy, but the tactical play and the between missions team building feels great. The crafting system is a bit clunky and some of the studio upgrades seem very oddly priced, but that doesn't ruin the fun. The game did feel a bit easy on the medium difficulty setting though.Alll in all, I feel it's good enough to recommend provided you like tactical play and the theme. The rough edges can be forgiven because you get the real feel that this was a labour of love.This game does commit the capital sin of making you feel irrelevant during the final bossfight. They tried to go for an epic ending and succeeded, but all your choices and perfect tactics don't contribute to it. It doesn't ruin the game, but it's a beginner's design mistake they shouldn't have made. "

												I love what the game is trying to do, but I feel that it fails. The combat is very shallow for a turn-based RPG and too much of it comes down to random chance (particularly the mech scenes). It varies between frustratingly easy and frustratingly difficult, and never really feels like a rewarding challenge.The writing would be a lot funnier if they didn't call attention to every single joke and reference that they make (Seriously, they throw in a ""see what we did there?"" at least once per cutscene, and it feels like a laugh track.) And for a game that is supposedly about running a studio, it really doesn't do anything original with its combat. I think it would have been a lot more interesting if we could choose the extras for them to fight and increase the challenge level on our own, and get more audience points for having a dramatic battle. Instead we're only rewarded for winning the fight, and that's no different from every other tactics RPG in existence.			"

												Disclaimer: I’ve been provided a key of this game for free.  My comments are my own.Chroma Squad is a fun game that does well in bringing the inspirations of Power Rangers into a Tactical RPGHaven't heard of Power Rangers?  Well this game pretty much sums up on what it is like.  Mass number of the same type of enemies our heroes beat up, bosses that are unique(So far I haven't seen reused bosses), giant robot battles, disembodied thing, funny and cheezy dialogue, finishers, and the transformation sequence(Though I wish I could see more of it because I only saw it once so far.).I have put a number of hours into this game and I have to say that this is a fun game and you guys will have fun with it as well.Here's my impressions video of this game if the text above is not enough to convince you.

												I like the aesthetic and the management aspects quite a bit. I'm a little turned off by the similarity to new XCom (e,g, the two action points per turn), only because seemingly way too many games are copying it, and the lack of terrain in battle maps is, I think, a much bigger problem with the modern SRPG boom than devs seem to realize, when compared with classics like Tactics Ogre (looking at you, Banner Saga!). That said, the combat balance is way better here than in Massive Chalice, it doesn't overstay its welcome, and it was a nice surprise. I just wish it were a little better.			"

												This game is fantastic and I cannot stop playing it. You're tasked with running your own TV studio in order to produce a Power Rangers-esque show. Your path to stardom will not be easy, as a plethora of monsters and baddies must be fought to attract the larest audience possible. I'm usually not a big fan of games with a turn-based combat system, however Chroma Squad knows how to make it fun and interesting. Team attacks, finishing moves, acrobatics, and skills are all at your disposal while fighting the hordes of enemies thrown at you. To my surprise, the game also implements a crafting system. Enemies will drop loot that can be turned into gear. In addition to this, you may recycle old gear to gain some parts, which in turn can be crafted into nicer materials to make better gear. There's a shop too, and a place to buy studio upgrades. All in all, there is a lot to see here, and the funny dialogue and refreshing gameplay make it a great experience.			"

Being as it was just released, there's still a few bugs here and there, but nothing completely game breaking.

												Very fun turn-based RPG/SIM where you are managing a new show similar to power rangers. You'll have options to upgrade your warehouse and players with many different items, manage simple contracts (like promoting your show.), and make decisions on certain impasses that come up. Kinda reminds me of The stick of Truth but, with Power Rangers being the center of the gag's. Of course it's no where near as volatile as South park but, there is still much to be had here for adults and children from what I seen so far. Great game.			"

												I friend gifted me this game so I just wanted to shout out a big thanks to him!This game... is awesome. I love the concept. Created by Behold Studios, Chroma Squad is essentially a Power Rangers management sim. You get to make your own squad and customize your team to fit your desires of having one of the best or lamest Sentai teams ever!The story is that a bunch of stuntmen quit their old job because they believe their director lacks creativity and want more creative freedom. The plot really goes off the rails later on but it's fun to watch. The dialogue of your team is super corny but I loved it however if that's not your thing then it might be something to consider if you're planning on getting Chroma Squad. The dialogue is filled with puns, references and enough fourth wall jokes to make Deadpool blush.Visually it looks nice, it's some nice pixel graphics. I don't think they use it as a lazy excuse since it's nice good to look at and there is detail in the game. Not the heaviest but enough to distinguish everything easily. The music is personally one of the best parts of the game. This is some really good chiptune music, it has some great soundtracks that get you pumped up for a boss battle and my personal favourite ""This is Cerebro"" is so campy and so catchy. The gameplay itself, when fighting is a tactical RPG. A pretty fun one, the game has an emphasis on team attacks which is pretty cool and works with the theme. You got abilities and cool weapons for the different classes to play around with and a cool chunk of bosses. You also get finishing moves for them which is pretty sweet as well. One thing that does bother me a bit is that a lot of the time the game can be too easy but then there is a huge difficulty spike in the last level. What is that all about?When not in normal combat you're doing one of two things. The first is managing your studio, it's fun as you have to upgrade the studio, buy or craft new gear, hire agencies to promote your show, check emails and all that managment sim stuff. The other is the mech combat. It wouldn't be Power Rangers without a giant mech battle in almost every episode. It can be fun but really it just comes down to chance whether attack or block attacks. It looks cool but it's pretty shallow.To conclude my mad ramblings I of course like this game a lot! It's one of those games I wished I played earlier when it came out last year. If you understand the basic core material you'll have a lot of fun with it.  If you've never heard of Power Rangers AT ALL or know exactly ziltch about it then I wouldn't reccommend this to you. Otherwise you should definitely get it! It's a game that's about having fun rather than being amazingly unique or difficult (for the most part). I give this an 8.5/10			"

												Chroma Squad... what a unusual concept.I grew up watching oldschool japanese films (Godzilla, Ultraman, Rodan, etc), watching shows like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, oldschool martial arts films that were dubbed by... less than stellar actors, etc.So lets just say I love the source material and whatnot.Final Fantasy Tactics style games (Tactical RPGs) are always sorta hit or miss.  Some focus too much on choice leaving you with a mountain of options and a hard time deciding what actually works for you.  Others are far too focused on the story and ignore a good tactical format for combat.Chroma Squad hits alot of good notes:-5 classes, all with tie-ins with character archtypes in shows like MMPR-""Actors"" that give different stat boosts to the class you slot them into, or to your progress as a whole, depending on choice.-Solid combat that feels good, without a mountain of stats and rules to learn-Various mini-goals for each 'mission' (part of an eppisode) that are typically not too hard to complete and net you more money to spend on upgrades-MMO style gear levels (White/Green/Blue/Purple) that help you determine which gear is better (not to mention easy to understand stats)-Alot of comedy moments before/during/and after each fight.  There are more references to pop culture, source material, and strange happenings than I can even begin to list.-Great badguys, even when they are repetative it's still funny to see the dialog that tries to explain why they are there.Now some negatives-Crafting system can turn out garbage gear.  You can break said gear down and try again, but it's a losing system.-Some of the 'mini-missions' don't work with everyones playstyle, there have been a few so far that I found irritating to try to complete.-Sometimes the 'jump' feature doesn't seem to want to fire for no reason.  This makes positioning annoying at times.-Music gets repetative, but not really a big issue, mute works wonders.I love me a good tactical game, and one filled with humor and references to some of the best (and cheesiest if I'm honest) shows/movies is awesome in my book.  Too bad there isn't multiplayer co-op or pvp, that would send this game to the realm of 'zomg best timewaster ever... for a week or three'			"

												Chroma Squad is, as it says, a tactical RPG that was inspired by the many Sentai series such as Power Rangers, Kamen Rider and many, many more. What is the story, you ask? Well, essentially, the story of the game goes like this: You have a bunch of stunt people who recently quit their jobs because of a director who was, shall we say, demanding and is overall being a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and they all decide to start a studio of their own! From the beginning, they don't have much to work with, using cardboard, duct tape, and third-rate costumes to get by, eventually, they start having an audience to work with.The gameplay is quite fun, you kit out your actors in the best gear that cardboard and duct tape can buy and record new 'episodes', essentially maps, for the season, each with their own bonus objectives that don't punish you much for failing them but the extra fans and cashflow you can get from maxing out your audience each episode is a nice incentive to do them. Every actor has their own special abilities that are accessible as soon as they suit up which can be sometimes impossible to do at the start of the episode as you need to build audience power first before chromatizing. The phrases said throughout the game such as ""Chromatize"" and ""Mecha Power, Activate!"" can be modified in the studio to your liking. Yes, this means you can be as silly or as creative as you like... or creatively silly.The difficulty of the game is strange at times, some episodes are easy, others are pretty difficult, even with the best gear for the season's tier equipped, and others still are fairly difficult. You'll end up curbstomping half the time if you're playing on the normal difficulty if you know how to play tactical RPGs, well, tactically, and I'm fairly certain hard mode is pretty challenging but I can't quite say that for myself. I'm not going to say that this game is too easy but it feels too easy at times, especially when you have an assault one-shotting everything they touch that isn't a boss monster or a shielded enemy.However, despite the odd difficulty curve, I absolutely adore the presence of the game and I absolutely love the feel and the gameplay of Chroma Squad, it kind of reminds me of XCOM, in a way, with all the aliens but minus the permadeath. Oh, and the music's damn good too, I will admit that the title theme may have dug deep into my brain and has implanted its melody into my brain and it won't get out. Although, there's not really much replayability in this game apart from the acheievements and, well, I can't say all that much without spoilers.In short? Fun game, even if you're not very familiar with the subject of the game, although most references may fly over you since this is an homage game, after all. Worth a buy? Sure. It's a good game for its price although it tends to be lacking a bit in the replayability department, it's fun for what it's worth and that is what matters.			"

												Update: (Robert Evans voice) ""I've sold out in Chroma Squad and it's only my third season. Mike Tyson and Gaga are completely ruining the show with their egotistical rewrites yet it's never had more fans. Money hand over fist, and Mike just injured a stunt actor. Was it worth it? You bet your sweet♥♥♥♥♥it was.""Absolutely frickin charming. Really fun gameplay/objective based combat with a clever twist. Really really enjoying this so far - anybody who grew up on 90's television will enjoy the story, and really digging the gameplay so far. And the themesong will get stuck in your head like any good bad tv show.Now I need to stop writing this so I can get back to playing, MY STUDIO MUST PRODUCE QUALITY TELEVISION!			"

												An excellent and amusing theme, backed by fun and interesting gameplay, chock full of references from the genre s a whole.You are a group of five actors fed up with a terrible director, shoddy story(or lack thereof), and the boring same ol same ol rehash of a Sentai series, and you all have decided to form your own studio!The game is a tactical RPG where you control your five heroes/actors through various episodes of your series, trying to earn fans by doing specific goals in each episode, earn enough money to buy and upgrade equipment, and improve your Studio to make bigger and better episodes! A wide variety of events happen, other heroes make cameo appearances, you collect materials and craft your own special equipment, including mecha suits!Combined with a very amusing story, and a very fitting soundtrack, its a fun and engaging game that I can highly recommend.

												Love tokusatsu (Power Rangers, Super Sentai, Kamen Rider etc)? Ever wanted to create your own tokusatsu show? Then Chroma Squad is just the ticket! From the creators of Knights Of Pen & Paper comes this rather excellent little tokusatsu inspired indie game. Full of tokusatsu references from Power Rangers to the various fansubbing groups located around the internet, this game comes highly recommended if you're a tokusatsu fan like me. But of course, you dont need to be a tokusatsu fan to enjoy this game. If you like tactical RPGs, then you'll probably enjoy this too. It's a solidly built game that has been a long time in the making. Being one of the backers of the Kickstarter campaign, and having to wait over a year and a half for it to be developed, I can honestly say that Behold Studios have definitely delivered the goods! Show your support, and buy it already :D			"

The development staff of this game clearly has a lot of love for the shows they are parodying and if you enjoy Power Rangers, Super Sentai, Kamen rider or any other rubber suit show I recommend you play this game.

												Chroma Squad is a tactical strategy game with some management aspect. It kinda resembles new XCOM games. Its main meat, the tactical strategy, part is quite fun with couple of interesting mechanics. Things like doing combined attacks with your team members and or making acrobatic throws. Management part offer quite different choices. Such as transforming your viewers into either fans or cash. It has satisfying amounts of options in character customization and in RPG elements. There five roles and you hire different actors with different bonuses for each role and each role has small skill tree in itself. You can equip your characters with crafted gear with random properties. Even the mecha fights which are not the major component of the game has some fun mechanics. It uses combo mechanic where successive hit increase your damage but reduce your hit chance so you have decide when to use your finishing move. Have not finished it yet but according to the achievements pages it even has multiple endings so some replayability.Story and design wise i feels like a true old Power Rangers TV show. It has a kinda cheesy humor and characters it was to be expected from it's Power Rangers source and i personally found them funny. This cheesyness also includes popular culture references and memes. A small detail i really liked was that you can customize the color and look of your characters costumes and you can see these changes effect the looks of the effects and mecha and small things like that. You can also customize your warcries like when you finish a boss or transform or summon your mecha.One last thing, if you do not like pixely art style that might be turn off for you.10/10, GOTY, would recommend etc.			"

												Chroma Squad is a great turn based game. Poking fun (or paying homage?) to the power rangers, you take the role of the actors in creating ""Episodes"" of your new TV show. Along the way you earn new items and get upgrades and of course new fans! Using all these new items you can upgrade your actors and the studio to make the show even more exciting.Honestly I didn't think this game would be my cup on tea, but I wanted to support the Brasilian developers, Behold Studios. Once I gave it a shot I was hooked. It's cheesy, it's funny and if you liked Knights of Pen and Paper +1 you'll probably like this one as well			"

												More or less an in depth review-Pros~This game brings you back to your childhood (or lets you experience a childhood), bringing me back to the days where I proudly watched series like Power Rangers. Not many games that want me to feel nostalgic can do it like this game, the next best thing for nostalgia would be Shovel Knight, but this takes the cake~Simple , yet extremely fun RPG mechanics. Ok lets get this down, 5 base classes, the lead, support, techie, assault, medic. Each class is equipped with each special ability of course, but then there becomes another layer, with the inclusion of different characters with each their own respective stats and weaknesses, this can dramatically effect the way you can fight a boss. An example would be, my lead, who i chose to be the Panda Guy (Forgot his name!) has reduced movement speed, because of this one of the episodes required me to kill the boss with my lead (This is also known as Director Instructions, although not required, it gives you a boost in ""audience"" which helps you use a few Studio options which will be explained later) My lead was way too far from the boss and there was no way to get to him before the boss dying from my techie's amazing counter-chance. Thus causing me to feel the want to restart the level and do it again to 100% it, and I did, I had to dramatically change the way I play by having the Lead always stay close to the boss while the others protect him. Now I would explain the skills to you, but they are fairly simple and standard RPG mechanics (Use them and then you have a cooldown, the usual)~What it wants to introduce to you though is it's ""teamwork"" mechanic. This mechanic allows you to have one of your well....heroes...can sacrifice their turn to say instead of using a skill to kill an enemy they switch to teamwork mode so that another one of your team can go to them and be launched farther than they can usually move, you could also do a teamwork attack. Which consists one or maybe even all of your team to attack a single opponent, which does become very useful against harder minions.~Music- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the music is so nostalgic, it literally brings the heart of 8-Bit RPGS and Super-Sentai series and puts them together to make just an amazing soundtrack~Story - To me, the story is the important part of a game (If it offers a story, it better be damn good *cough cough Call of Duty Ghosts cough cough*. Now at first the story may seem pointless, but after maybe the 2nd season if i recall, it gets just a huge jump in drama and everything just starts to mold into place. Each character is given their own little ""arc"" or little segment focusing on them and their personal problems, and by the end of them season you feel satisfied and you just want more. Although I won't spoil much of the story, I can tell you that the dialouge includes many pokes and jabs toward internet memes and commonly uses smiley faces (Which too me is very refreshing) Now in terms of story itself, you start off as very ticked off actors that leave the studio they are hired at and buy/create their own. As you progress you are given ""choices"" through ""fan mail"" which people send you, although it may not seem significant, these fan mail choose the path you will be taken on and how your fans will react, also be warned there is no voice acting so get ready to read.~Bosses- Each boss is super memorable and actually are pretty damn funny when intended, each skill set makes sense for each boss and are actually pretty fun to figure out how to fight against. Now after certain fights, you are allowed to what some people may call MECHA FIGHTSSSSS!.....now these are simple but are actually pretty fun and poke fun at the *ahem* Power Rangers mecha fights.~Stuio/Crafting Etc. - In the studio you can buy stuff from the shop or look and change the skill sets of your characters. Inside the shops you are given the ability to buy Armor and Weapons. Now most of these items are basic and the best usually come from crafting (DUH) but are still useful. Now crafting, simple, yet not the best or even my favorite, so ill explain my dislikes of it later. You can also go to the ""Studio"" options which allow you to spend money generated from episodes to upgrade certain attributes (Health Care gives your actors +Health and HD Cameras give you better Audience Conversion Rate). Next up is the Mecha Screen, basiclly upgrading the parts of the mecha to make it better as the story progresses. Not too overly complicated, but could be a lot better.-Cons~Crafting- Because you cant replay episodes, you better hope you get those crafting items by luck OR you can spend considerable ( A LOT ) of money from episodes you did to buy Material Packs and because of this you may be out of luck for the first few seasons or you force yourself not to buy better Armor/Weapons/Studio Upgrades. ~Agency Buying- I held off talking about this because I'm more or less biased toward this, but as you progress thorugh the story you can hire agencies to promote your show, this gives you special boosts to a certain amount of episodes (1 or 3) and of course it tells you the boosts but it doesnt tell you how much fan power it costs (You earn fan power during episodes) which left me bummed out because although there were 4 boosts I liked on the agency, I could only get 1 of them for 3 episodes because I didnt know the fan power was so high. Leaving me a lot of money down the drain.~All in all this is a great game, it achieves what it wants and does even better than certain rpg's. I would give this game the Indie Game of the Year if i could9.4/10			"

												I'm really enjoying the game so far.  Combat has an XCOM vibe in that you have two actions per ranger, though you can use things like ""teamwork"" to pull off some powerful attacks/stunts.  You can equip weapons and armor of various types, either through crafting or buying the item in the store in between missions.  As a bonus, you can choose specific characters (each of which have their own stats) as well as the ranger color they'll represent.  While the game stands fine on its own, I believe those who used to watch ""Power Rangers"" as a kid (or as a teen/adult) will appreciate it more.  Easily recommendable!

This game is really addicting making you tell yourself ""Well one more episode and I quit"", and suddenly you're 2 seasons further. This game has a great tutorial and begins very easy, so don't worry if you're worrying that this game will be too hard.For people that like Turn based (strategy) games with RPG options I would really recommend buying this game.

												Super fun! I love the customization and the humor. It's obvious that the devs are really huge Sentai and Mecha fans, with all the references pretty much dumped all over. Gameplay is solid. Few little tweaks could have been made, though, like the ability to undo an action. I've messed up a couple times by accidentally clicking somewhere I didn't want to go. Other than those minor things, I'm having a blast. Totally recommended.Also are the devs going to release modding stuff? It'd be nice to customize some things, like add in my own characters and whatnot.			"

My Humble ReviewPros Themed after all of the team battle live action tv shows in Japan pre/post Power Rangers Great fun story,comedy,fan service galore Some team/studio management servicing as upgrades for battle and earning spending money Good crafting system and shop giving you a option to either buy all your gear,craft,or both Great number of characters to choose from to make your team, some better than others dependingon your play style Multiple brancing side stories won't spoil Fantastic music, you will want to play with the music turned on, great time Mecha battles, simplistic but fun. Also upgrades for your Mecha Graphics made this game more of a treat for me than probably mostCons Some of the battleground areas sorta repeat often but there is enough variety but might be a con for some. Season 5 difficulty curve, this can be a make or break moment for some trust me (depending on ur choice at a certain point). I got the hardest option so had to battle like a one man army to victory.With planning, patience , and strategy I over came it. I can't decide if I would call it a con or not, but for some they might fight the battles too simplistic which might make the game feel repetitive. Since I enjoyed my time in the game and I played in spurts of 1-3 hrs at a time I did not feel the repetitive nature much.Overall Thoughts & Final VerdictA fantastic lover letter to the genre it is inspired from.Great soundtrack,variety of bosses, mobs,special attacks and team attacks. Truely a gem for anyone who was a fan of the power rangers ,and of 8bit gaming. Do yourself a favor, get this game full price or on sale and hope we get a Chroma Squad 2 bigger,better and badder in action.			"

												Combining pros and cons, because you should know what you like in a game and what you would rather not want to see.Go: It has 8-bit graphics.I myself have gotten quite weary over retro-pixely graphics. But I also know that graphics shouldn't be a reason to determine whether to buy/play a game at all. The worst that can happen with a good game of which you don't like the graphics is that you might think ""well, it could look better"". And as we all know, if you have to say that it's just the worst, right? It has an 8-bit soundtack.Well, technically it's not 8-bit at all. Ultra fakebit, I'm telling you. Everyone who's ever listened to chiptune should notice immediatly. Noobs.For me it was the same as with the graphics at first - I just can't hear it anymore. And still, the soundtrack is super catchy + fits the game perfectly, although I feel like it could contain a few more tracks. Then again, the theme song is not just catchy, but also funny. Speaking of which, the game itself is pretty punny.Yes, it's definitely one of the funnier games you'll see. Not necessarily the funniest, because it's not Portal. However, although I've always been looking forward to seeing new boss monsters, because of their funny names or puns they came up with, I felt like the humor was innocuous. Of course humor doesn't always have to be ironic/sarcastic/critical - I just feel it wouldn't have hurt sometimes.Oh, hold on, there was this one situation where they were directly referring to Anita Sarkeesian's Tropes vs. Women in Videogames series, which I found absolutely hilarious, very well placed and well executed. Good job Behold Studios! Although it's not a very long game in and of itself, it felt unnecessarily prolonged after around season 3 in the game. It was basically the same thing over and over again, until the game ended. Most episodes you make go like this:Fight minions, fight minions and boss, fight mecha battle against same giant boss.That's probably the weakest part about the game and the one thing I would personally hold against it. Still, I managed to beat the game just yesterday and right now I'm actually in the mood to play it again, with different actors. The fighting system is tactical and has it's own profundity, while remaining simple. It's really a good balance.Although, of course, I personally would put the fighting system and the game itself into the more casual corner with the other more casual fighting systems and the other more casual games.tl;drWhen trying to summarize my experience, I would absolutely recommend anyone (meaning all of my friends and you) to buy this game and at least play the first two to three seasons (the game progresses in seasons) of it, to see if you'd like to continue or stop. I'd also say that it's worth it's regular price. But hey, you can always wait until it's on sale. And if it is on sale, you should definitely get it. "

												Chroma Squad, a game that gave me a quad heart attacak.Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG, which has quite the fast download baud. But there is more, because the thing about it that earned my immediate apllause, is that it is parodying sentai with several references throughout, which made me glad, but I have sadly found a lot of accidental hentai.Super sentai, or to the duper americans power rangers, are shows about various dangerous threatening the world with a shower of monsters. So it is up to three to six teammates, to bring an end to the evils killing spree. The difference between sentai, and the ignorance of power rangers are huge, mostly in terms of violence because lord knows how hard mothers bother, they somehow still seek something that will make them take the offense and write angry letters.The basic of the plot that quickly forms a blood clot, is five stunt actors are getting the brunt end of the stick from the director, mostly because the real actors are mostly spectators now. They get sick of this repetitive shtick, so they decide that instead they shouldn't bide their time, they quit on the spot leaving the old studio to rot, to start their own, though they bring their former director down by stealing the suits. Earth is under threat, but like a stoners baguette the heroes take a long time to learn, and until then they are quite stern about this all being special effects, or defects. They use the footage of them fighting aliens, to get their show more lighting. I won't go further, because this does go deeper but is actually simple to follow, which is a nice dimple of quirks that I love.The tactical gameplay, is actually quite practical. Like a cannibal feret, you can use teamwork to attack, step back, or get teammates closer or in positions you would rather see in your vision. You have a variety of not only weapons, you have a small soceity of actors to pick from, obviously some fit better into each role of the five, it is up to you to put down that tea cup and to decide which loon becomes a front line goon or a back line maroon. But you also have directors instruction to follow, which you should unless your skull is hollow. Or you'll be low on money, and despite the amount you will quickly blow through it. Items are dropped, as long as you aren't stopped from murdering aliens. Which can be used to upgrade your zord, or create weapons and armor out of cardboard. Though you must not forget, because you can't bet all your cash on weapons and shiny gear, to try and make the enemies fear you. You have to handle a studio, since you are the borough. You can pay for better green screens, shop association, contracts for promotions that last up to three episodes before abdication. Upgrading health care, so that your squad will fair better when taking hits, or upgrade the workshop to get more tiny bits to craft with. One thing I do enjoy, which was quite a clever ploy. Are the letters you receive, after each episode you achieve, you have fan mail to answer, and if you do it without fail you gain fans, money, or more funny as it is I rather support telling your director off when he threatens to take you to court.This game is great, though unfortunately fate can't make everything perfect. The zord battles are the main issue, I did rip a few tissues at them...At first, but aside from that I did not have a thirst for anymore, because they were slow where you just click a button to deal a combo of blows. No strategy or thought, but despite the upgrades you bought, even if you take a hard hit an yelp, and run out of health, you call your fans for help. They give you health, which was quite a bother to me to know there was no stealth to the threat. It meant I could mess up, without having to fess up any real significant consequences.That aside this game is grand, and all of the humor and references make it far from bland. Out of all the sentai references, the one that more so instantly hit my preferences, was a statue greater than sweet bubblegum, that was dedicated to big 1, from Jack-Q the second super sentai.Otherwise can recommend.

												Put a few hours into the DRM free version before downloading for Steam. Plays like a light version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and piles on a lot of charm and fairly funny writing. Not too difficult so far, but also requires enough strategy to remain fun and interesting, without becoming too frustrating. For anyone who likes turn based strategy, I'd say it's worth checking out, and for anyone who has a fondness for Sentai in general, it's a must own.			"

												This game is so fun. If you are a 80's baby like me who came of age in the 90's, and were a fan of the phenomenon that was the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers; this game is for you! It's so clever and smart. The minimalism of its aesthetic endears it rather than detract from it. The turn-based gameplay is sleek and very easy to learn. The items and various customizable features keep it fresh and exciting, and the storyling is meta cuckoo crazy goodness fans of any game should enjoy. BUY IT.			"

												This is a great game for those of you out there who have ever been fans of the Super Sentai genre.  (To get a really great background that's fascinating to watch, go see ""Linkara's History of the Power Rangers!""  Even if not a large fan it's really neat the history and stories behind these shows and their legacy.)  I had a blast with the game and enjoyed the moments of humour through-out the episodes.  That it has multi-endings makes for repeatability in the play-throughs, and I'd endorse this game for any sentai fan.			"

												Chroma Squad, a game that gave me a quad heart attacak.Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG, which has quite the fast download baud. But there is more, because the thing about it that earned my immediate apllause, is that it is parodying sentai with several references throughout, which made me glad, but I have sadly found a lot of accidental hentai.Super sentai, or to the duper americans power rangers, are shows about various dangerous threatening the world with a shower of monsters. So it is up to three to six teammates, to bring an end to the evils killing spree. The difference between sentai, and the ignorance of power rangers are huge, mostly in terms of violence because lord knows how hard mothers bother, they somehow still seek something that will make them take the offense and write angry letters.The basic of the plot that quickly forms a blood clot, is five stunt actors are getting the brunt end of the stick from the director, mostly because the real actors are mostly spectators now.

												Hah! This game is too much fun. For anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy RPGs, with plenty of customization, cheesy chiptune music and intricacies that are easy to learn but difficult to master... Pick this up, even at full price.Here we have a game where you manage a crew of actors/actresses of your choosing, filming a television show with a brand new studio. The two big elements to this game are when you're in the studio (business management mode), and when you're recording (combat mode). Both are fleshed out quite well--when you're in the studio, you *will* spend a while making tactical decisions as to what agency to sign with, what to craft/buy and for whom, and how to gear up your mech for the upcoming fight.Combat is a whole 'nother beast. It isn't *terribly* complicated on the surface, but the addition of being able to enter a ""Teamwork"" state where you can either combo with others or, more importantly, catapult off them to gain some extra movement and set yourself up, that's where it gets interesting. It's a little reminiscent of throwing people around in Disgaea (similarly, the whole game has a Disgaea-ish feel to it). In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a direct offshoot of the Super Sentai-esque characters from Disgaea, but that's just because this is also a tactical RPG and it's a common trope.In addition, adding a layer to combat, in each scenario you have a pair of ""Director's Instructions,"" which net you bonus points (referred to as ""audience""). These are tallied at the end to give you money and ""fans"" (which are effectively points that allow you to benefit from more of your chosen agency's bonuses). PROS:* Though it's not for everyone, and can get a little repetitive, the cheesy, chiptune, over-the-top music is great. * Also subjective, but I find the combat to be just plain fun, and hard difficulty will provide no small amount of challenge for the perfectionist. Mech combat is no exception.* Very deep game overall. Seems like something I'd give another playthrough.* It's funny and cheesy without pushing either of those too far.* Nicely animated for 2D sprites.CONS:* Some of the stats are a little unclear, and there seems to be no in-game explanation for most of them. Some of them are self-explanatory, some aren't. This might not really count as a con, but the UI could have used some cleaning up.* Can't undo accidental misclicks in combat. In fairness though, that can be chalked up to human error, it's not like it's easy to misclick.* No toggle to see the tactical grid, which has led to some poor choices in gauging how far away I've been from an opponent (another reason I wish there was an undo function).* This may just be me, but my computer stutters at least one or two times during those crucial timing-based defense moves in the mech battles. Probably just me since I run so much in my background, but the game continues and I'm left only to guess when to click. I've run much higher graphics games with zero issues like this still running everything in my background, but I will say the game is otherwise technically sound.* My last minor gripe, I wish I could fire an actor and replace them. So fair warning, you can't change your characters mid-game.Pick this one up if any of that appeals to you, it definitely put a smile on my face.			"

												Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG where you use power ranger esque characters to fight monsters. so right off the bat it sounds awesome right? Well it is, it's really awesome but is it perfect? No. When the game is on the ground using its awesome sentai inspired battle system it sparkles like the sea. However each stage ends with a mecha fight, that is cool in theory but in practice it becomes a nightmare. Stages in this game usually take about an hour so after an hour of immensly satisfying tactical comabt where victory is decided by skill alone you are thrust into a situation where you could randomly lose all your progress and need to entirely restart the mission. This can leave you entirely dishearted as an hour of very intense gameplay can be thrown out the window. Aside from this however, the game is outstanding. looks great, sounds great and can lead to some very satisfying gameplay. You really should play this awesome game, but be ready from some seriously salty rage quits at the meccha battles.			"

												The ""humble"" pixel art of this game can catch you off-guard. It's a very funny game, much deeper than I expected (30h + on it), and overall it's very well done. You start with 5 stunt men, from a Power Rangers alike TV show, that get tired of doing all the hard work of the show and getting none of the credits, so they decide to create their own show where they can be the leading actors too. I won't talk about the rest of the story because that would be a spoiler. The combat is turn based, like XCOM or The Banner Saga. When you are not fighting, you are running the show and you have to deal with TV ratings, marketing, season budgets, etc. At the beginning it will be a very crappy and low-budget show, and it will be up to you to improve it.The 95% of positive reviews are a good indicator of the quality of this Brazilian game funded through a kickstarter campaign. It's an homage to the Power Rangers / Super Sentai kind of shows from the 90's, so you'll probably find it more interesting if you were a kid during that time. The key feature of this game it's his humor. They managed to pay an homage but yet at the same time they mock every single cliché from those shows. The acrobatic jumps, the different colors of each fighter, the giant robots (Mechas) at the end of each episode, and much more, it's all there. It's a cliché mocking homage game.			"

This game has charming graphics and a nice japanese touch, but not till the point when it becomes cringy. The fighting mechanics are interesting and provide a lot of options on how you play. The story is also great with lots of humor and drama. Being able to personalize all your characters and names of the team etc. is fun and it really makes it feel like it really is your team. I havent tried the other modes beside casual yet, but the casual mode stays true to its name and if you want a real challenge you should try the other harder modes.If i would give this a number score it would be 9/10. I strongly recomend it.			"

												Amazing RPG with a great sense of humor. Not as much customization as other games, but there's still a good amount. As I played this game I grew a liking for the characters. You get to name them, choose what they wear, and even choose what they shout out as they do the amazing finishing move. Even though the game had great replayability, I couldn't see myself using any other characters. It was the group that I made. The story wasn't perfect, but it allowed me to become attached to this group of ex-stunt doubles who made their own show. This game is unique and fun. It's not the longest game, but the time you do spent playing it will not be dull. As you go through this game's story, you will laugh quite a bit. Not too many games have this type of feeling to it. You can tell the dev team put a lot of effort into it. You can tell that they wanted this to be a great game. Not only is the game good, but so is the soundtrack. (Go buy the game and the soundtrack)I'm giving Chroma Squad an 8/10 rating.			"

YouTube™ Video: Backlog Beatdown: Phil the Conquistadork Reviews CHROMA SQUAD! 

			Views: 64		

			Phil's review of Chroma Squad! Phil's New Year's Resolution is to kick the crap out of his considerable gaming backlog, and he's starting with the tactical RPG Chroma Squad!		

It’s a tactical RPG with base-building strategy elements that follows the story of five stuntmen who leave their second banana positions to make their own martial arts TV show. Like Knights of Pen and Paper, Chroma Squad has retro-inspired graphics and music, and spends a lot of time breaking the fourth wall and poking fun at pop culture tropes.I personally felt that Knights of Pen and Paper, while it had some charm, went on for far too long without shaking anything up, ultimately weakening what might have been a charming experience by overstaying its welcome. And while Chroma Squad sometimes suffers from a similar affliction, I feel that Behold Studios learned a hell of a lot, tightening and producing an RPG that is just plain fun to play.			"

												Wonderful little tactical RPG game where you control a team of actors with their own show where they fight monsters, which starts coming true as time goes on.The meat of the game is the tactical turn based combat, and as someone who really enjoys this type of gameplay this is right up my alley. There are also some RPG elements outside of combat, such as allocating skill points, crafting and buying upgrades.After completing most maps you join together and go into a giant mecha to fight the boss of the map again, with a different combat style which is focused on timing the hits and using a limited number of different abilities. This is a nice addition for the first few times, however it is not nearly as fleshed out and feels like an after thought. And seeing as how you have to do a bunch of these fights I'm quite sure everyone will get tired of them before the end of the game.The story is reasonably entertaining, although it can become tiresome to follow since it is delivered solely through text boxes of the main characaters, and you have to wait for each one to finish scrolling in order to move on to the next one. So if you read much faster than the game scrolls then you're going to have to do a lot of waiting. There is an option to fast forward through everything, however it is not really useful if you still want to follow the story since the fast forward skips everything.And the game does go a little overboard with the pixel artstyle, I certainly would have liked more definition and fluid animations. Also the overall design starts to become stale with time, especially since this is quite a long game.I would easily recommend Chroma Squad to any fan of the tactical turn based combat style.7 / 10			"

												Chroma Squad is a Tactical RPG game made by Behold Studios, creators of the mobile game, Knights of Pen and Paper, an RPG that is more pressing buttons that movement. Now you'd think that this would make it hard for them, seeing as they're pretty much doing nothing the same. If you do, get out. This game is packed with humor, references, and breaking of the fourth wall. And while most people hate breaking the fourth wall, it's done in a way where if you literally are paying no attention, you will not see it. And if you're going into this game using the internet for the first time, the references to pop culture and video games will definitely fly over your head, but if you know the internet like the back of your hand, every reference will make you laugh, and there are a lot. The game play is simple, you have two actions you can do with every character every turn, and you can switch between who you're using by clicking their box, or using both of the above player's actions. Each ""class"" has their own unique set of skills, with customization diverse enough so that there is very little repetition. A lot of this game's achievements can be accomplished on the first run, but to get them all you will have to play the game at least three times. And if you get stuck, the community has already figured them out. After you beat the game, I reccomend sticking around after the credits for each run, and you will be pleased by what comes after, but stick around until you get forced out of them to get information that will complete the story more and more. Now buy the game and get to playing. #FrendshipIsForever			"

												I expected a lackluster Tactics RPG with a Sentai/Power Ranger coat of paint. I was so very, very wrong. Chroma Squad is awesome. I was very surprised how much I love this game. It is great for fans of old or new series, American or Japanese shows. I can't recommend it enough. Various branching story plots, a huge amount of customization. My only real issue is that there isn't a lot of guidance available after the tutorial. Some stuff is trial and error, experimentation, etc. In a lot of ways, that is good and lengthens the life of a game. If you are struggling, though, it could make or break an episode.			"

												I can't decide which I like more, the feel of being in my my own super sentai show or the way the game tears down the fourth wall for the enjoyment of the audience. Chroma Squad is a great blend of tactical combat and character building with skills, crafting  and base building included. I thoroughly enjoyed my play through and after finding out there are multiple paths to the ending, I might just end up making my next squad to experience the joy all over again. Chromatize!			"

												Hah! This game is too much fun. For anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy RPGs, with plenty of customization, cheesy chiptune music and intricacies that are easy to learn but difficult to master... Pick this up, even at full price.Here we have a game where you manage a crew of actors/actresses of your choosing, filming a television show with a brand new studio. The two big elements to this game are when you're in the studio (business management mode), and when you're recording (combat mode). Both are fleshed out quite well--when you're in the studio, you *will* spend a while making tactical decisions as to what agency to sign with, what to craft/buy and for whom, and how to gear up your mech for the upcoming fight.Combat is a whole 'nother beast. It isn't *terribly* complicated on the surface, but the addition of being able to enter a ""Teamwork"" state where you can either combo with others or, more importantly, catapult off them to gain some extra movement and set yourself up, that's where it gets interesting. It's a little reminiscent of throwing people around in Disgaea (similarly, the whole game has a Disgaea-ish feel to it). In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a direct offshoot of the Super Sentai-esque characters from Disgaea, but that's just because this is also a tactical RPG and it's a common trope.In addition, adding a layer to combat, in each scenario you have a pair of ""Director's Instructions,"" which net you bonus points (referred to as ""audience""). These are tallied at the end to give you money and ""fans"" (which are effectively points that allow you to benefit from more of your chosen agency's bonuses). PROS:* Though it's not for everyone, and can get a little repetitive, the cheesy, chiptune, over-the-top music is great. * Also subjective, but I find the combat to be just plain fun, and hard difficulty will provide no small amount of challenge for the perfectionist. Mech combat is no exception.* Very deep game overall. Seems like something I'd give another playthrough.* It's funny and cheesy without pushing either of those too far.* Nicely animated for 2D sprites.CONS:* Some of the stats are a little unclear, and there seems to be no in-game explanation for most of them. Some of them are self-explanatory, some aren't. This might not really count as a con, but the UI could have used some cleaning up.* Can't undo accidental misclicks in combat. In fairness though, that can be chalked up to human error, it's not like it's easy to misclick.* No toggle to see the tactical grid, which has led to some poor choices in gauging how far away I've been from an opponent (another reason I wish there was an undo function).* This may just be me, but my computer stutters at least one or two times during those crucial timing-based defense moves in the mech battles. Probably just me since I run so much in my background, but the game continues and I'm left only to guess when to click. I've run much higher graphics games with zero issues like this still running everything in my background, but I will say the game is otherwise technically sound.* My last minor gripe, I wish I could fire an actor and replace them. So fair warning, you can't change your characters mid-game.Pick this one up if any of that appeals to you, it definitely put a smile on my face.			"

												Five stunt doubles quit their job and start their own sentai show in Chroma Squad, a turn based tactical RPG. If you’re not familiar with the sentai genre, it’s basically costumed people doing goofy acrobatics and occasionally piloting giant robots to fight space monsters and other wacky stuff, and this game features all of that. You even get to name your team (I picked Colorblind Crusaders to be ironic) and can customize all of their catch phrases.Each of your team members has a role that defines how you will use them in combat. The scout typically runs ahead to stun groups of enemies or pick off individual monsters. Support heals and technician has a variety of useful skills and long distance attacks. Lead and Assault are for tanking and damage dealing respectively. All characters have their own skill tree that expands with new selectable skills every season.This game features an assist system where a character ends their turn and becomes available for throwing other characters across the battlefield. If you put characters in assist mode while surrounding a monster and attack with a non-assist character, you will perform a team attack for additional damage. Finally, placing all five members of your squad in assist mode surrounding a monster initiates a special finishing move that does a lot of damage. A major underlying system in Chroma Squad is the audience meter. You gain audience by successfully completing levels. To keep things interesting, each level has director’s instructions that are essentially mini-quests ranging from “defeat the monster with a finishing move” or “attack the monster with lead 5 times”. Audience is turned into cash at the end of each episode and can be used with various marketing agencies to give your squad various different bonuses as well as additional cash. Cash is then used to buy armor or weapons or crafting materials to make specialized gear.If I had to sum up Chroma Squad with one word it would probably be “cozy”, if only because of the soundtrack and overall graphic theme. Try listening to the OST on youtube and you’ll see (or hear rather) what I mean. I really liked the simplified retro-look as well, it has sort of a late-era SNES feel to it which fits perfectly with the game’s style. There are all sorts of little campy details like the characters doing different silly poses when they’re the focus of conversation or the omnipresent recording crew following you to every single battle and staying just out of harm’s way. All of this comes with a nasty catch though; there are some significant performance issues in this game. My rig is capable of doing VR games no problem but I still had loads of framerate drops at random parts of the game. The good news about this is that it typically won’t effect your playthrough due to the tactical nature of the game, but it will be a bit of a pain for giant robot fights where you have a QTE during the monster’s turn that requires you to click at a precise time to defend.If you are in to sentai-style stuff at all, you will probably love Chroma Squad. Even if you aren’t though, this game is still fun for anyone who would enjoy a tactical rpg like Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics. "

												I'm not really good at reviewing, but this game is worth the shot. At first, what you see looks like your usual Tactical RPG, because it is! The game doesn't have any complex mechanics, and that makes it fun! You can play the game in many different ways that will affect your battles directly. You can play the game without upgrading your studio by option and probably get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked a lot, or you can go and max it out, leaving little room to improve your gear, and that is totally up to you! Also the fact that you can respond to fanmail adds a bit of relationship factor to the game, you just get really absorbed in it, and it's a really casual thing too. Even the references are made casually, like nobody's business.Overall a really great game. I'd play again and aim to play a bit differently if I had the brains to.			"

												       Chroma Squad is simply a love letter to what Power Rangers use to be. It has action, comedy, interesting writing, and anything you would want from a PR game. You start out as 5 stuntmen who have recently quit their jobs doing sentai stunts to form their own studio. When you get into the studio thats when the real magic begins. Once there, you're able to design your own suits and mechas, something I'm sure any PR fan has dreamed of.     You're also able to respond to fan letters and control your fan market to some extent by choosing from a wide selection of advertaisment firms. When you go into battle this game is a mix of an RTS and Turn Based RPG ala Pokemon. The RTS side is used for your simple ranger battles where each class has a variety of skills at their disposal, which grow as the story progresses. You're also able to do showy finishing moves on the bosses in true sentai fashion. My only problem with the RTS board is that sometimes you can't see parts of the grid because they're blocked by objects on the field.       The game then becomes much closer to a TurnBased RPG when in mecha form where you're allowed to hit your opposing monster a certain number of times before a hit misses and they hit back. But, all is not lost when they hit back theres a system that if you time it correctly and click in the white area of the bar you can block some of the damage. Think Gears of War's reload system. Everyonce in awhile though this bar lags causing you to get hit by the full blunt of the attack without a chance to stop it.TL;DR:The Story and writing are amazing and are VERY PR like. The RTS combat while fun has some issues with grid square blocking, nothing gamebreaking though. The mecha combat is far slower than the RTS combat but still quite funScore: 8.6/10			"

												Its alright. It would be much better if there was a lot more diversity. Also the game freezes a lot on counterattack + driver buff and pretty much ♥♥♥♥s your progress. You wont have to worry about it until Season 5, but man its really irritating having to go though all of an eppisode two or three times. Especially if they tell you that you need to use the buff for your audiance gain...Its a good dedication to Power Rangers though. Its a simple turn based strat/combat game built aroudn light camera action. Its fun to play but nothing really outstanding. Very repetitive music and combat doesnt change every. Play for about five episodes and youve played the entire game as far as what you will be seeing and what to expect. The look of the enemies doesnt change until around chapter three. they are still the same thing, however, just reskined.Its hard not to recommend it. Its a well made game minus the bugs. Its just not very durrable for replay, I dont think.			"

												A chance to play as the Power Rangers or Sentai if you're more into that. It's a solid mix of RPG and Tactics with the mission objectives playing along fairly well with the story. Managing money as well as studio upgrades and a few choices that can affect things in later seasons is also a nice surpise but lets be honest the appeal of the game is it's cheese factor!If you ever watched Power Rangers from the early days of Mighty Morphin to whatever is on today or kept up on the Japanese side of things then this game is worth the 15 bucks, you'll look back on all the cheesy lines and silly stuff that made up a childhood or even whats entertaing today, these guys got it right and naild it solid.

												 This a really cool, funny game. It's based on Power Rangers, so it's obviously already awesome just because of that, but the gameplay is what really makes me love it so much. This is a strategy game where your characters become more powerful by either (The long way...) crafting equipment you gain from various enemies, or (The easy capitalist way) paying for equipment at a shop. This game also has a few different possible endings, so that gives it some replay value, and since this game lets you choose different characters at the beginning as well as have your own play style, you shouldn't really be bored out of your mind replaying the game like I usually am with some other games. The price isn't really too much compared to what you get out of it, because there are a lot of ways you could customize your team to work with your play style (At least 3!.... Probably more, though...). Chroma Squad really gave me a lot of nostalgia, especially since I grew up watching Power Rangers, but I think I could really recommend this game to anyone who really likes any sort of strategy game or any sort of game where you can make important choices to decide what happens. Soooo.... This is a pretty good game, and, as a plus, the soundtrack is awesome!			"

			First ever proper stream, was playing Chroma Squad on the pc. A very cool game to anyone who enjoys rpg turn based games, a very fresh interesting theme to it as well.		

Did you like power rangers as a kid and miss the charm of it? Do you enjoy playing turn based rpg games? Do you like pixel graphics? Do you like Micro management?This game has it all and as much as the graphics might push some people away, it should not. This game is well worth the ball of lint on the bottom of your pocket and the story and setting is enjoyable and rather true to it's origins and style.9 out of 10 would recommend.(sorry for the video quality first time streaming, settings are a bit off still.)

												If this game were a woman, it would be that kind plain looking one sitting at the bar that you think ""well why not"" and then when you both get back to her place you have the most mind-blowing one-night stand of your life.  You leave the next day thinking you should ask for her number, but you don't want to ruin the mood.  For the next week you can't stop thinking about her, every waking moment at work, you're dream of that smooth sound track, or the cute way teamwork throws you over the enemy head or that classic finishing move with a twist...you realize she was the one, she was the game you could spend the rest of your life playing if they'd just put out more!  But...but, it's too late, because you didn't want to be ask...damn damn damn!  (seriously though, I'd be happy if you guys made some DLC for the game)Actual review:This game is a paragon of polished indie developing.  Gameplay is nicely balanced between managing a budding hollywood studio, planning show episodes, gearing out your team, and actual filming (combat events) of the show.  The storyline is well written and kept me wanting to find out what happened next, combat is varied with all the different things you can do (teamwork, using items/weapons, skills, morphing (""chromizing"") vs fighting as nomral people, and of course all the wonderful abilities that come up through gameplay.   Let's not forget the mini-goals you can choose to complete during each scenario and managing your fan base (answering emails...etc).I appreciate that you have a casual mode for people who want to build a studio based on purely asthetic decisions vs. the harder modes where you need to manage stats that items give production.My favorite part is when building a team I can name them anything I want (I can name the squad anything I want too) and you get to choose the people on your team INCLUDING a loveable but useless animal mascot....well he wasn't so useless once I armed him with guns!  mwhahahaha!

Chroma Squad feels like it went down a checklist of damn-near everything I personally could ever want in a game. Power Rangers, giant robots, tactical combat, extensive customization, crafting... Even if some of these systems aren't individually excellent in their execution, together they create something truly special.			"

												This game is fantastic. Lots of nostalgia for anyone growing up watching power rangers. There isnt much strategy to the game but just enough to make it enjoyable though you wont be smacking your head against the wall because it is difficult. Sometimes completing all the director's instructions can be a chore but if you dont care about that and just want to 'win' than it will be a piece of cake...unless you play on the hardest difficulty, where you will need all the fans you can get to generate money and keep your studio floating. There is definitely replayability because you can get a couple of different endings but it feels like most of the choices you make are small scale, it is a pretty linear story with some variations in my opinion.Also, dont pay any attention to the gamergate types that complain about feminist tropes. There is one episode that has a guy kidnapped instead of a girl in the very beginning and it doesnt have any bearing on the rest of the plot, just the game creators making commentary on overplayed tropes.Overall I would highly recommend this game to someone who loves strategy, RPGs, power rangers, and a few corny jokes.10/10			"

												This is a game with it's heart in the right place.

I mean, you can see that the game was made with enthusiasm, but it is definitively a love letter to sentai fans. i'm not a fan, and most jokes went right over my head, to be honest. As for the ""tactical"" aspect, it is okay, but definitively nothing great.If you really like sentai shows, Buy it now. and i mean NOW. this will probably be your GOTY.Word of advise: This thing is BUGGY AS HELL. enemies shooting from outside the screen, receiving so much damage that the HP rolls back to full, and powers with ""X turn duration"" that lasts for the entire battle are common.

I can Completely reccomend it to anyone if you have a chance to play it.Now the issue I had with it was the difficulty spike at the end of the 5th season. I'll be the first to admit, I'm awful at tactical rpg's but I was going through the game on ""interesting"" quite quickly although not without issues, few missed objectives :(. The end of the game was a massive wall that I just couldn't get through, I'll blame it on being 2am when I was playing. Had to drop the difficulty down to finish the game.			"

												I was truly positively surprised by this game. At a first glance, a turn-based tactical RPG with a silly, yet fun story. After playing several hours, the story turned out to be silly - but still fun. But the gameplay itself revealed to have more depth than I expected. Currently I'm in the beginning of Season 5 - and will definitely have to replay, for following reasons:* Marketing - a key strategic component. I thought way too little of it initially* Resource management - especially cash* A well-reasoned choice of actorsI found very little wrong in this game. Maybe the only downside is the slight lagginess of Mecha battles.			"

												A Game that puts you in charge of making your own Awesome Super Hero Saturday Morning Cartoon Show, because your last boss rejected your ideas to improve the show, so now its pay back and its all good. Why? Because you, the player, take control of these 5 actors starting up their own TV Show and you get to decide what needs to be done. Like which episode plot/mission you will be doing, earn cash, managing your Awesome Studio Backlot, earning a ton of cash, getting support and likes from fans, $making it rain$, crafting items for your stars to use in the episode (which improves stats), earning tons of cash, having references from actual shows to be in your episodes, and did I mention earning butt-loads of Cash. So if you ever wished of making your very own Saturday Morning TV Show then this is the game for you.			"

												Chroma Squad is a Tactical-RPG (i.e.: Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem), coated with some Management Sim mechanics.In Chroma Squad you control an independent Super Sentai Studio trying to create its first series. As such, you'll have to manage your money, buy upgrades to the studio, new clothes for your actors and hire people to take care of your marketing strategy. The meat of the game, however, lies between these management sessions. Whenever you record an episode, the game becomes a tactical RPG: you start giving orders to your actors on where to move, who to attack, stuff like that.It's an amazingly stylish game. The pixel-art is awesome, the soundtrack is pure chiptune bliss (plus a main theme with japanese lyrics!) and the game is packed with references to pop culture and super sentais in general.You don't really need to be a super sentai fan to enjoy the solid tactics mechanics in this game, but it surely adds to the overall experience. I recommend this game to anyone who ever enjoyed a Power Rangers episode or is just itching for a new TRPG game.TL;DR: Awesome Tactical-RPG with stylish graphics, soundtrack and references. If you like Super Sentais you'll fall in love with it!			"

												 This a really cool, funny game. It's based on Power Rangers, so it's obviously already awesome just because of that, but the gameplay is what really makes me love it so much. This is a strategy game where your characters become more powerful by either (The long way...) crafting equipment you gain from various enemies, or (The easy capitalist way) paying for equipment at a shop. This game also has a few different possible endings, so that gives it some replay value, and since this game lets you choose different characters at the beginning as well as have your own play style, you shouldn't really be bored out of your mind replaying the game like I usually am with some other games. The price isn't really too much compared to what you get out of it, because there are a lot of ways you could customize your team to work with your play style (At least 3!.... Probably more, though...). Chroma Squad really gave me a lot of nostalgia, especially since I grew up watching Power Rangers, but I think I could really recommend this game to anyone who really likes any sort of strategy game or any sort of game where you can make important choices to decide what happens. Soooo.... This is a pretty good game, and, as a plus, the soundtrack is awesome!			"

												Alright so after doing a Let's Play on this game, I have to say for a game that had so many references from video games, anime and even toku.  I'm saying this now...SEQUEL-WORTHY!  This game remind so much of Lunar Silver Star Story because of the many references they threw in the game.  That, aside..with all the strategy games I ever done, I really enjoyed this game immensely and if I would do this game over, I would. But I would recommend this game only if you're a fan of tactical games, tokusatsu, or video games.  I could say this game could finished in less than a day if you did all of it in every difficulty, but that's clearly up to you.  To Behold Studios, THANK YOU! Please consider doing a sequel!			"

Chroma Squad feels like it went down a checklist of damn-near everything I personally could ever want in a game. Power Rangers, giant robots, tactical combat, extensive customization, crafting... Even if some of these systems aren't individually excellent in their execution, together they create something truly special.			"

												This is a game with it's heart in the right place. It is clear that the devs gave a lot of effort to make what was, for them, a great game.Now, having said that, i need to be clear.If you don't care at all about ""Sentai"" shows, and you're looking for a tactical RPG/ strategy game, this is at best a 7/10. I mean, you can see that the game was made with enthusiasm, but it is definitively a love letter to sentai fans. i'm not a fan, and most jokes went right over my head, to be honest. As for the ""tactical"" aspect, it is okay, but definitively nothing great.If you really like sentai shows, Buy it now. and i mean NOW. this will probably be your GOTY.Word of advise: This thing is BUGGY AS HELL. enemies shooting from outside the screen, receiving so much damage that the HP rolls back to full, and powers with ""X turn duration"" that lasts for the entire battle are common.

												I just stayed up untiul 3am finishing this game because I kept saying one more episode.... from season 3's finale.This game was great. My biggest critisisms are nitpicks (Like how the Scout teleports slightly delayed, or how the light pink colored beam for the finisher comes down as white, which stands out when you ALSO have a white range) mainly and desires for certain things to be included, but overall there are no major shortcomings of the game.I wish there were more actors to choose from (Completely an asthetic thing. I wanted to make my friends as members, but only like 2 of the actors come close to resembling them), and that there was a Sixth ranger position with it's own unique traits like how the Lead gets bonus health and so on.I truly hope there will be DCL, or a sequal or SOMETHING. I simply want MORE of this game. Now to go look at the achievements and see what kind of stuff I may have missed.			"

												If you are a fan of Power Rangers or Sentai, you will absolutely love this game from start to finish. It is a well built strategy rpg with all the features necessary to build your own team of crimefighters with a super meta/ awesome narrative to boot. The gameplay is smooth, and the game visuals add to the tone and character of the story Behold Studios was trying to tell. It is not a perfect game. I wish the mecha or megazord fights were more diverese (or more like the common combat) maybe with like 5 zords against the giant monster in a strategy style. I would like to have a custom character creator as dlc if possible. In short, besides my nitpicks. I do recommend this game. It feels like you the manager of a season of power rangers or super sential and thats all I could ask for. Plus, the MUSIC IS FREAKING AMAZING.			"

												So in Sentai and Power Rangers, when the team gets defeated, they come back later in the episode and beat the enemy.You're not allowed to be defeated and I feel like it really takes away from what Sentai and PR is all about, standing defiant despite defeat.  Still, I get it, one of the 5 characters is a healer, and you have to use that.  It prevents me from making a fantasy, dream-team though.  Anyway, I'm a 1993-present PR and Sentai buff, and this game is the closest thing to an RPG for that genre.  I'm a bit of a fanboy though so take it as you will.As far as the gameplay, it's quite basic really, and the combat system makes you want to always use counterattack skills.  The music is really good!			"

Product received for free
												Great squad based RPG/microsim game. The simulation doesn't matter that much it basically functions as an upgrade menu so don't expect much from that end of it but the fighting felt good,although a bit tedious at times due to crazy ammounts of knockback. From the sound of most of the negative reviews they were playing on harder settings, but I was playing on casual because I never have enough time to beat long rpgs on harder difficulties, but anyway it seemed a little too easy until the end game. I barely won so I can only imagine how difficult it must be on harder settings, as It was a good game but I am not likely to replay it as it did get a bit tedious towards the end, especially the giant robot fights which were cool in concept but always boiled down to the exact same thing. Anyway I got this on humble bundle and wasn't disapointed, check it out if you want, or don't its your time and money, this is just my opinion that I felt necasary to write as I just played this for about 8 hours over the last couple of days and was mostly hooked.

												This game is an absolute blast! If you're a fan of Power Rangers/Super Sentai, and enjoy a simple, squad-based, tactical game, this is perfect for you. The concept is fun, the story is classic for the show genre, and it's awesome to watch your heroes get more powerful and learn new skills as the game progresses. It even has a twist that I was reeeeally hoping they'd toss in towards the end of the game! Definitely worth your time and money, check it out!			"

However, running a studio that produces content such as this brings a smile to my face that I never knew that I could make. More games like this need to exist.

												TL; DR: If you like X-COM style tactical RPGs, this is a pretty fun and light spin on it.  The game has some rough edges, but is a solid all around tactical RPG.Long Version:If you're into tactical RPGs like X-COM, then this is a fun 10-15 'light' experience.  The angle (you're stuntmen from a Power Rangers-esque TV show that get in a fued with the director and decided to start a new show) is original and can be pretty amusing.  For better or worse, you can fast forward through most the story.  I wish there was an in between, where you could read the cupious amount of story text quickly without reverting to warp speed, but it's either painfully slow or hyper speed.  The other thing holding the game back is a bit of UI/tutorial polish.  The game, especially in the beginning, rapidly unlocks new features, but never really even tells you they're there, let alone what everything means.  It's not a deal breaker, but I could imagine going through significant chunks of the game without realizing some suped up ability or item was available.The other drawback of the game is the QTE Mecha mini-game that ends many of the episodes.  You basically are given a % chance to hit on a punch, to continure your combo, and have the option to switch to defense or lay a power move on.  Needless to say, you will feel the burn of the RNG when you miss 3 or 4 consecutive ~75% swings, each time taking massive damage because you can't properly defend when you miss.  You thene have a little bar that you have to click when it's in the right zone to deflect as much damage as possible.  I only 'lost' 3 or 4 times playing through the game, and every time it was in the mecha game.  Kudos for trying to mix it up with a different paced bit, but it's too rough around the edges, especially compared to the relatively tight tactical RPG play.Speaking of the 'RPG' aspect, they are definitely on the lite side.  No XP, you just unlock the next level of the skill tree when you complete each season.  No mana points either, everything is done on a x-com style cool down system (also, there is no ammo, everything can be used as many times as it cools down).  There is crafting, though it's not very well explained.  The advantage of crafting is that the gear has a few set attributes, plus a few random attributes to it that MAY make it better than the items you just buy outright.  But you never know until you craft it, and you can't compare a craft item to your current gear until you actually make it.  You also have to combine lower craftable items into better items, and then better items again, to be able to craft the good stuff.  This, again, is never really explained and buried on a submenu - I didn't know I could do it until Season 5 (of 6), and until then, I was confused on what the point of a crafting system was when you never got the materials you needed to craft.  Turns out, I had plenty, but I had to combine my 75 rolls of regular tape into 15 rolls of silver tape, and then those 15 rolls into 5 rolls of gold tape...which I could then use to buy the pimp stuff.If tactical RPGs are your thing, this is a nice light experience.  I imagine it has pretty low system specs, so it would probably be good on a laptop, though the Unity engine chugs occassionally, especially during the mecha scenes.  Definitely worth picking up for a few bucks or in a Humble Bundle.			"

												So in Sentai and Power Rangers, when the team gets defeated, they come back later in the episode and beat the enemy.You're not allowed to be defeated and I feel like it really takes away from what Sentai and PR is all about, standing defiant despite defeat.  Still, I get it, one of the 5 characters is a healer, and you have to use that.  It prevents me from making a fantasy, dream-team though.  Anyway, I'm a 1993-present PR and Sentai buff, and this game is the closest thing to an RPG for that genre.  I'm a bit of a fanboy though so take it as you will.As far as the gameplay, it's quite basic really, and the combat system makes you want to always use counterattack skills.  The music is really good!			"

												Great squad based RPG/microsim game. The simulation doesn't matter that much it basically functions as an upgrade menu so don't expect much from that end of it but the fighting felt good,although a bit tedious at times due to crazy ammounts of knockback. From the sound of most of the negative reviews they were playing on harder settings, but I was playing on casual because I never have enough time to beat long rpgs on harder difficulties, but anyway it seemed a little too easy until the end game. I barely won so I can only imagine how difficult it must be on harder settings, as It was a good game but I am not likely to replay it as it did get a bit tedious towards the end, especially the giant robot fights which were cool in concept but always boiled down to the exact same thing. Anyway I got this on humble bundle and wasn't disapointed, check it out if you want, or don't its your time and money, this is just my opinion that I felt necasary to write as I just played this for about 8 hours over the last couple of days and was mostly hooked.

												A Game that puts you in charge of making your own Awesome Super Hero Saturday Morning Cartoon Show, because your last boss rejected your ideas to improve the show, so now its pay back and its all good. Why? Because you, the player, take control of these 5 actors starting up their own TV Show and you get to decide what needs to be done. Like which episode plot/mission you will be doing, earn cash, managing your Awesome Studio Backlot, earning a ton of cash, getting support and likes from fans, $making it rain$, crafting items for your stars to use in the episode (which improves stats), earning tons of cash, having references from actual shows to be in your episodes, and did I mention earning butt-loads of Cash. So if you ever wished of making your very own Saturday Morning TV Show then this is the game for you.			"

The fact that I had to replay a few missions to mean meant the difficulty was well struck.I generally don't play a game more than once, but the replayability here might be high enough that I might pick it back up in a few weeks.8/10 -- Two points of feedback, the crafting system is largely RNG, and felt underpowered in comparison to the shop purchases. There were also some crafting metrics that I didn't exactly follow: ""Crafting Rate""? not entirely clear what it affects? Drop rate? Crafting power?			"

												Strangely fun! Reminds me of Disgaea for some reason. Disgaea is better, though.The replayability is not so good due to the miss chances being frustrating on higher difficulties (and I hate bad RNGs), but there are multiple endings.Story is amusing. More so if you watch Power Rangers at all. Their sayings and colors are customizable if they annoy you. Or you could have 5 pink rangers if you want to confuse everybody.I'd recommend this only if it is on sale, but is definitely worth a run through for $10 or so.			"

												The full review can be found on Start 2 Continue[start2continue.com].Excerpt:After enough grief from their director, five talented stunt actors decide to take matters into their own hands, starting their own studio and action-packed TV show. Where Millennials like myself had the Power Rangers back in the ’90s, Behold Studios gives us Chroma Squad, a tactical RPG where you control this quintet of do-gooders in their rise to glory–or at least television fame.Packed with a ton of tongue-in-cheek, fourth-wall-breaking humor and its obvious impersonation of Power Rangers, Chroma Squad is all about nostalgia in its style and delivery. With its pixelated sprites and loading screens that “warm up” and adjust like an old tube television when you’re starting a new episode, this is the kind of game that would go great with pajamas and a bowl of cereal on a Saturday morning.

												Woooo... Just finifhsed the game on its ""medium difficulty"" and all i can say is wow. Such a satisfying experience all around. If you really enjoy rpg strategy games such as fire emblem then this is certainly going to make you one happy camper.PROS:Very easy to get intoHilariously bad punsGame doesn't take itself too seriouslyCustomizable catch phrasesGreat upbeat musicPretty colors O>Oa LOT of humour----------------------CONS:Mech battles get repetitive after the first 4~Crafting can just sometimes seem outclassed by some of the easily aquired shop itemsHilariously terrible punsCan sometimes feel a bit aggravating if you need to get a certain directors challenge done, then the AI screws it up for youAll and all, i loved this game, but its not for everyone. So play it if you watched power ranges as a kid and always wanted to be one. ^-^			"

												Do not be fooled by the small playing time that Steam shows. When I started playing this game for the first time, I was offline, and I played for 7 hours non-stop.This game is a dream that come true!When I was a kid, on the 90's I loved to watch tokusatsus (heroes in costumes, like Power Rangers, Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, etc..) and loved to play with my cousins like we were in the show.If you're like me who always wanted to be the creator of your own tokusatsu show, here's your chance!Chroma Squad is a beautiful game of tactical RPG  (a bit similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, or Tactics Ogre) where you control your own tokusatsu squad and studio in your way to become very successful and famous.You can customize the colors, names, and choose the actors that will play them, and even what they say when they call their giant robot, or when they transform!You equip items (that even change their appearance!) buying from the store, or creating from your workshop to become stronger, and choose wich skills each one will have. Each squad member have it's own role and skills. (There's the Lead, Assault, Scout, Techie and Support.)If you watched tokusatsus you will notice many references, and the game have very funny conversations and events.Even if you're not a fan, nor didn't watched any tokusatsu, I recomend this game if you like Tactical RPGs. You will love it!Don't waste any more time, buy it and have tons of fun!Now if you excuse me, the world need my help. Random Rangers, let's Randomize!			"

												Really fun game with a lot of replay value.  Tactical RPG combat flows well and the team-up system leads to some fun things to do even while abilities are on cooldown.  Branching story paths make for some good incentive to play through multiple times.Mecha battles are a little one-note, but still fun.  Crafting system seems to have bad drops, but with proper marketing choices and investing in some of the material packs you can make it work out.My only complaints: YOU CANNOT UNDO ACTIONS, which is so frustrating sometimes, oh boy.  That's the number one problem for me.  Also there is not enough cool stuff to spend money on in the in-game store, as each tier boils down to ""defense armor"" vs ""offense armor"".  Crafting has one or two interesting items (the Speed boots and the Team-Toss gloves) but there isn't a lot of variety outside of the gimmick items, when there could be a lot more going on.  More actor choices (and the ability to recast them mid-series) would be nice too, it feels like a very small pool of options.The game also ends right when you start feeling very powerful so I'd like to see a 'New Series' mode (where you do a new team with a new storyline but keep your studio) or some sort of extra seasons.  Some way to keep going.  The game feels a little short.  A 'mission creator' and some sort of endless mode with escalating difficulty as seasons keep going on could fix this, and I believe the developers are looking into these sorts of ideas.It's off to a great start, it's an awesome game for anyone into tactical RPGs or sentai/power rangers stuff, and I hope it keeps improving over time.

												I'm going to recommend it, with a few caveats.  Keep in mind that the game mostly gets by on charm and style.  As a tactics game, it doesn't do any of the things I'd like it to.  My favorite Tactics games, like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, let you recruit a handful of named characters with personalities.  Other games, like XCOM, let you fully recruit and customize your own squad.  Chroma Squad does neither, you can choose 5 from about 15 different characters at the very beginning of the game, and they're all interchangeable with no discernable personality.So without interesting characters the gameplay has to be compelling (like XCOM) but it's pretty simplistic and does a poor job of explaining itself.  That being said, you get to make your own Sentai team.  So, you know.  That goes a long way.			"

												Ten years ago, every friday after school, my mom and I would drop by the nearby Blockbuster and get a handful of DVD's. Most of the ones I got were blocks of episodes of TV series from the 90's/2000's. Some of these were, you guessed it, Power Rangers episodes. Ever since then, the TV show, and vitrually any other kind of Sentai, held a special place in my heart, and you can imagine how I felt when I saw this game on Steam. This game mixes strategy with the over-the-top action, spandex, robots, and explosions of any episode of Power Rangers, and does a phenominal job of invoking the inner child who was too young to  see sucky special effects. If you like fast-paced, turn-based games and Sentai fight scenes, then I definitely reccomend Chroma Squad.			"

												The pros:The game is quite fun and very addictive. It's a strategy RPG with a unique concept that is pulled off extremely well. It's the perfect application of crafting mechanics, too. The graphics are beautiful, and the music is impressively good. The concept of going from small-time to big time is a brilliant idea for a game of this manner.There is a lot of attention to detail in the game, with secret things to find both graphically and plot wise. It's easily worth the MSRP, and is one of those things you don't know you want until you have played it for yourself.Protip: Don't try hard mode on your first playthrough. It's really unbalanced hard.The cons:The programming is so glitchy the game feels like a beta version. The textboxes overflow when people are talking and transitions are often jarringly abrupt, just cutting out and flickering when a level ends instead of having a proper ""you win"" screen. The controller controls need major work as they just operate the mouse cursor instead of having true controller support.The writing is mediocre, with very poor grammar that could have used major proofreading. Some of the scenarios are sort of nonsensical due to the writing. The appearances of numerous Kickstarter backers break the immersion of the game, it would have been better if they didn't have to awkwardly say their full names every time someone appeared. The backer characters all look like the same nerdy white guys, and dont make sense in the setting.With the lack of characterization you'd think there'd be some kind of character creation for your team, but instead there is very little in the way of choice if you want a decent team, I wish you could choose from more diverse appearances and just assign certain personalities to them, instead there are kind of obvious ""best characters"", so if you didn't want a cartoon beaver on your team youre flat out of luck.

												A long overdue gift to those who grew up dreaming of making a Sentai series all their own. What Chroma Squad lacks in simulation elements it compensates with a neverending celebration of the best parts of Sentai new and old. If there is anything to pity its that Chroma Squad wasn't 3 different games and fans of Metal Heroes and Kamen Rider only get to revel in the last season of the storyline, but their inclusion shows just how much love Behold Studios has to offer, it can't be contained and oozes out of every scene! At the same time, if you step outside what the game celebrates you're left with an honest and simple Strategy RPG with map and encounter designs that genre veterans will find uninspired. The Episodes of the game are filled with colorful characters based on classic Sentai villains and antiheroes or pop culture and it is their presence and strength of personality that bring flavor to each individual Episode. So if you're prepared to be charmed, prepared to fall in love with the idea of being a team of costumed heroes, or prepared to be entertained by a campy throwback to how Sentai captures the hearts of children, Chroma Squad is absolutely the game you're after, look no further.

												After 20 hours of play I would most deffinetly that if you want to get this game...wait for a steam sale or humble bundle sale, etc. It's not worth the full asking price. The awesome atmosphere of 90s Power Rangers, Voltron and Silver Rider and the Star Sherifs is more or less lost among the repetitive grind of the game. The missions devolve into mindless running around and doing the same 4 skills on each of your squad mates over and over again, on bland, unispired, baren fields. No variaty, no interesting locations, no obsticles. The mecha fights are a joke. You like to grind press a quick-time eventbutton 20 times, while waiting or a randomly generated percentage attack to hit or miss ? Well this is the game for you. To add insult to injury in the middle of the game there is an episode which is just mecha battles one after the other, like the developers just gave up and said ♥♥♥♥ it...The final stage/episode is even worse. Oh do you want to fight all the bosses up until now all at once ? How about after that try to escape from a room filled with gas, while you get pummeled by a repetitive bad guys? And then get to the final boss that just spams those god damn unskippable attacks so you can watch them ...hmm 50+ times? Best day ever.All in all - good story, cool idea, fun concept with the companies, the studio upgrades, etc.Horrble repetitive main game - fight 5 different enemies the whole game.... - a squirel guy, a bird guy, a toad guy, a rhino guy, a possum guy....that's it - and of course the pallet swaps...A quirky concept a good game does not make! There should be some fun gameplay somewhere in the whole mess.			"

												Chroma SquadThere is alot going on with Chroma Squad but I'll keep it short...some areas of the game are very very very good...and some awful.Let's start off with the good, Chroma Squad is a hybrid between simulation and turn based strategy. It sounds complicated, but they kept those two elements at the simplist form. So,  the developers pulled it off nicely.  I played on the easiest difficulty because I am atrocious at both genres, but this title kept me interested.  There are a few branching storyline choices to choose from, so that's a plus as well.The storyline is hit or miss...so I'll try to keep the spoilers to a bare minimum. Note the word try:If you read the description, if Chroma Squad, the player runs its own Super Sentai studio/show.  The actors who decide to start their own show are all best friends who got tired of their former show's director. So the player runs the studio, and the action(Turn based strategy) is the episode being filmed. I wish it was that simple.  It begins to get confusing, because everyone begins breaking the 4th wall(from the show to their audience), sometimes the actors don't know if what's happening while on set is scripted or really happening, and then soon they begin to 'Morph'/Transform for real and fight real battles while its still being filmed.(In other words, the actors became real super heroes and saved the world). I sometimes got mixed up with what is real or what isn't real.  At one point, a developer comes on screen and tells the actors its all just a game and he made a glitch by mistake, is that the 5th wall being broken????The gameplay was fantastic, and the retro style graphics were beautiful too.  I liked the idea of naming my studio and all the catch phrases, so the only thing I didn't like was the story, I pretty much hated it.  I wish it was either one or the other, either a Super Sentai game(Where I name the characters, catchphrases, customize colors/armor), or the same studio simulation/turn based strategy where it was kept JUST A TV SHOW without a confusing storyline.6.5/10I know alot of people love the story, and that's okay.  It just wasn't for me.			"

												If you didn't like Power Rangers or any Sentai when you were younger, I pity you.What a brilliant love letter this is, the game in terms of what it wants to convey is just like Pacific Rim:""We love you, and you aren't forgotten, and you are still awesome!""In terms of gameplay, it's just like Tactics Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics without all the pesky and hardcore min/maxing which might take many hours for some with OCD to have the best possible character. The feel of the game is brilliant too, it feels so fun to engage in the setting and everything it pokes fun at, while editting YOUR OWN SUPER HERO CALL-OUTS.I rate this a Megazord/10. "

												OH GOD THAT WAS AMAZING D:I just finished the game and well.. you're in for a treat!I gotta warn you though: from the moment I put my hands on this game I only stopped for sleeping and eating.If you also grew up watching Power Rangers you're gonna have a great time!There are a lot of references there, from internet memes to Anita Sarkeesian and Scott Pilgrim.I had a blast learning the mechanics and this game has a much better balance than Knights of Pen and Paper, specially at the end. If you're reading this you're probably wondering if this game is worth your money.Lemme give it to you straight: It is. Just freaking do it! :DI know some of the guys from Behold Studios personally and I know they put a lot of love in their work. This is definitely a breath of fresh air in this industry so obsessed with making money. I Well, thank you for this amazing experience!Now I need to clean my house and get back to my normal life.Next time around I'm gonna play in portuguese to see the original jokes, one of the few perks of being brazilian.Also I'm gonna make different choices in order to see all the outcomes.10/10 would do it again.

												Once I had this rad metal solo in my head and it was like WEEDLY WEEDLY WEEDLY WEEDLY and I was like ""Man, what is this rad metal solo in my head!

Then I went and just listened to the Power Rangers theme song, because honestly.Chroma Squad is like that, only it isn't a song, and you haven't heard it before, and you wouldn't think Metallica made it. Also it's a tile-based RPG. That is another thing that wouldn't be obvious from that story.

												When it came to creating my new company I found that none of the alphanumeric characters on my keyboard would work. This is a very common issue for people using OSX which has not been resolved. There's a bug report thread of approx 150 messages in which the devs initially state ""post your bugs here and we will check and fix them""... Which they have not. They have implemented a bug report system in the game, but alas, if you can't type the damned report what's the point? This game might be very good, but I can't get much further than the intro/tutorial and I have absolutely no respect for games studios that don't fix bugs or respond to support requests			"

												I really wish there was a meh button, because I do really love this game. However, I cannot currently recommend it as I have  found so many game breaking bugs. For example, In some battles it will get stuck doing nothing when the enemies are supposed to be attacking, which is VERY annnoying in the final phase of a very difficult level. Also, sometimes it will allow you to move into the spaces of other heroes or enemies, causing accidental movements when attempting to select a target to control or attack. If these bugs are fixed, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game because when working it is a funny, well put together blend of tactics on the battlefield and managment in the studio. I really wish I could say this is the perfect game, but until the bugs are worked out I cannot.			"

												An overhyped mess. It rides on the nostalgia train but crashes ingloriously when it comes to gameplay.This is written after haven finished the highest difficulty.In essence it consists of 4 core elements: Tactical RPG, economy / money management, crafting, and bugs.-On the tactics side we have a squad of 5 actors / heroes fighting enemies in turn based combad on a planar field. During the first few levels it works perfectly. You have your classes like assault, support and scout who each do different things. But the more you play the more a mess it becomes. Suddenly everyone has heals, buffs, damage, etc. It lacks imagination. This is even more emphasized when it comes to enemies. You have to face melee, ranged, healers and coloured variations with more hp / damage. Even the bosses play the same way (almost) every level. They each mainly use the same attacks / abilities. It makes for a very tedious gameplay experience all the way to the end.-Economy. The better you do the more money you get. That's the premise. It falls apart very early in the game when it becomes clear that it's almost impossible to miss the mark. Probably due to the very easy difficulty even on the highest setting. Same with director instructions during missions. Basically sidequests that make you do something. Mostly it doesn't even affect the gameplay and furthermore the boost they give becomes negligible the further you progress.-Crafting is a big part of the game. The more this hurts. It is horrible and completely missed the point of crafting.You get materials from slain enemies or you can buy random packs in the shop. So good so far. But crafting is a lottery. You pick your base and it adds random properties. That's not crafting, it's lottery. When you want a defined outcome. That's crafting. It makes sense very early in the game pretending that your actors are improvising. But when you suddenly deal with high tech components the immersion falls apart. It doesn't hel either that most of the game the shop sold items are just far superior and don't have you hurt yourself through the atrocious interface.-Bugs. This one is really dissapointing. We are talking on an Ubisoft level of bugginess. Nothing so far has been gamebreaking, but considering this whole thing rides on tropes and the passion for the genre one would think the devs would put more effort into this. Originally I would list the bugs here, but I simply lost track of them and at one point didn't bother to write them down. From economy, to battle, loot drops. Hell, even the basic text bubbles have a minor word wrap bug. It really becomes a joke when you realise there is a permanent bug report button on the top right.This is a very sad case. I really tried to like this game, it's not bad, but it is below mediocre. It became painfully obvious during the game that all they cared about was the athmosphere and design. They got that perfectly and then stopped doing anything else. Don't get me wrong, most of the things I mentioned are very minor, but they are so numerous you wouldn't believe the devs actually played their own game (and those peeves are not even all).For the price tag of 15€ I cannot recommend this game. Too short, lackluster gameplay. Even fans of the genre are better of just buying a DVD of their favourite series.			"

												More reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comMy goodness… does anyone remember when the Chroma Squad Kickstarter happened? There there was the whole mess with release dates and stuff? Yeh? No? Well I don’t. I just heard about Chroma Squad a few days ago. This game is proof that there is just too many cool game concepts out that, while I may not have time for them all, are way too under my radar. I’m now realizing why indie developers always link other Kickstarters in their emails.Chroma Squad is a tactics game based on the concept of the Power Rangers’ show. The literal making of a Power Rangers’ show. Chroma Squad, at its heart, is a TV show simulation game. You start out as the five stunt-people (of your choosing from default characters and Kickstarter backer-based characters) that get tired of taking orders and decide to start their own show. You make your way into one of the stunt-person’s uncle’s warehouse (in my case “The Fro”) and find that it has a giant-floating-spikey brain in a jar (which isn’t creepy in the least) and decide to use it as their own personal Zordon.Now it was listed in the video for Chroma Squad that you’ll get a better reviews for the episodes you record with better and flashier moves you’ll do during the show, but I wasn’t totally convinced of this until I just went around one-hitting the baddies in the second episode. (Let’s just say the tweets were bad for that one.) This part is right up my alley because my favorite moves and/or characters are usually the ones with the flashiest move sets because I am a visually stimulated person and things look cooler with explosions! That’s where teamwork comes in. If you set one of your people to be in the “Teamwork” mode and another Chroma warrior attacks, the ones waiting in that mode will join in for extra damage and a bonus to viewers added. The more surrounding a bad guy, the more damage you’ll do. If all of your buds are waiting around the same bad guy and you’ve put on your Chromatic suits you’ll do a super-special Chromatic finishing move complete with a catchphrase, light beams and power stances… good stuff all around!It gets even deeper when you start crafting with drops from the level. Upgrades to your armor and your eventual mech are all done with common items like DuctTape, leather and cardboard boxes. I recently upgraded my mech with a cardboard box and silver duct tape and that just made me laugh. I have to admit that playing five stunt people who started their own studio and are making ends meet and working with what they’ve got is pretty stinking interesting and also kind of cool.Score: Gewd.Chroma Squad is a solid title. It’s good as a tactics game, but excellent as a parody of the making of a Power Rangers show. The option to upgrade your armor, weapons and mech with common items like play-do and cardboard is hilarious and fun. It definitely sets itself apart from most RPGs in that aspect, but still it’s an RPG. There is humor and humor based on nostalgia and I enjoyed both! However, at its core it’s a TV show simulation and so it all comes down to money and fans attained by the end of each episode. Maybe it gets a little easier at the end game with more things to defeat or something, but the same issue bothers me now. Since you obviously want the most viewers and money, I find myself dragging fights out to complete achievements/goals and to max out that bar. Is it necessary? Probably not too much, but it also feels like it is. Maybe it easier for some, but that meter is not my friend at times. On another note, that may not bother me as much as it does here if I could take this game with me on the go… say on my Nintendo 3DS? That would be pretty sick! Pick-up-&-play may have been better for this game for me.			"

												Chroma Squad is an SRPG inspired by power rangers.PROS:-More SRPGs or Turn Based Strategies are usually a good thing.-Very colorful and charming. -Kinda sorta has controller support.CONS:-Controller support is pretty iffy. Way worse than Disgaea or XCom EW. -No controller support AT ALL in mech battles. -Management layer is cumbersome and not fun. Menus are awkward. -Battles can get somewhat tedious. Not enough interesting maneuvers, just basic ""move, whack, get whacked"". -Optional Objectives aren't fun for me.If you are interested in Chroma Squad, compare with Disgaea and XCom EW/2.			"

												Bloody wonderful game if you like Super Sentai in the slightest. The game has some really stupid Social Justice Warrior stuff about tropes against women but that is a trope in it's self of Tokustatsu. There will always be that one episode about girl power (a la Transformers & every other children TV show). Nothin' wrong with a little girl power. But you should never let your ideology get in the way of a fantastic game. Well worth 14.99 USD.			"

												I followed the development of this game back from its Kickstarter campaign, and despite all the fanfarre it got, all I can say is that it was a letdown.The gameplay in itself is somewhat enjoyable, if limited. Group battles are of a light tactical nature and play decently, but mecha battles are basically just contrived sequences of dice rolls.There is some fun to be had in customizing your studio, Rangers and their equipment, but it all feels unbalanced, in such a way that there is just ""one true way"" of doing things, while the rest is filler.The main issue, though, is the plot and flow of the game... or lack thereof. The story is rife with jokes that read like internal jokes of the dev team or obscure references. It's not even a cultural barrier deal, because even playing on the native language of the studio, the text just felt confusing, weak and generic.That is compounded by the fact that every other mission counts with ""support members"" who contributed to the campaign. In summary, they are all dudes who are pretty much alike and have to make an introductory speech stating who they are, what they do, etc. and then be awesome. It gets annoying fast.It's not that it's so bad that it shouldn't be played, but really, with so many other options out there, why bother?			"

												Got it for $1 with Humble Indie Bundle. But I think it's worth the full price as well. It's not Top Tier tactics game, and you shouldn't get it unless you've already played XCom and want something new. I particularly liked the TV show setting, mecha building and fighting, studio upgrades, item crafting, marketing (various boosters), audience meter twist for the secondary mission goals. The normal mode is quite hard, I suggest picking the easiest one unless you are the guru of this genre.I'm not in it for the story, so I was pretty much always holding the space button to skip the dialogues.

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Chroma Squad 

			Views: 20		

			Today we're taking a look at Chroma Squad. It's a turn based combat game (similar to XCom or Steam Marines) that parodies the Saban TV shows (like Power Rangers).		

This game is hilarious. I got a giant beaver as the leader of my squad. Named him the beaver monarch. Now the rest of the squad actually calls him that.This is a seriously fun game. The gameplay definitely fits the feel of the old Power Rangers show. The controls are simple and the animations are gorgeous (one of those examples of amazing pixel art). If you're looking for a fun and hilarious game to pick up, this is your answer.			"

												This game is awesome! I had a lot of fun playing it and Its soo full of nostalgia too!Its a very well polished game with a great art style and music. If you ever wanted to run your own powerrangers show than this is it! An actual power ranger/super sentai/kamen rider RPG that is actually good and actually real! The game is really really satisfying and I feel happy having played it! For in depth impresions of this game go watch totalbiscuit's video about this game on youtube, he does a much better job at explaining the game. :)P.S. at the very least you can make power rangers named/based on your friends and family members and make them do embarrassing cheesy antics! Worth the giggles I say!			"

												Turned it on intending only to ""try it out"" amongst some other stuff we got from Humble Bundle and got pulled into an honest four hour session, with every intention of returning for more. Very engaging RPG and mangement gameplay and would do well ported to droid or iOS. I'll compare it to FF Tactics and the tactical Personas, but it's clear that 103% of the inspiration is Sentai shows, and they love their source material. The writing is also self aware and as my significant other is a dancer/stuntperson, I could really get behind the idea of the stunt people taking over the show and finally getting the respect they deserve. Also REALLY appreciated being able to make my team LEADER a black woman. Refreshing aaaaas hell.			"

												Normally i dislike pixel art games because i feel that they are lazy with the technology we have now, but this game is almost addicting. i enjoy the way the levels are played out and i enjoy the toungue in cheek villians. i also love the crafting system and the tactical feel of the game. my biggest concern however is the mecha fights. i feel that there is more that can be done here. if a sequel is made (and i hope they do!) then i think that the Mecha fights can be greatly improved. maybe the crafting system can be improved too, because i like crafting things.

												I was interested by the premise of a power rangers-esque tactical RPG, but this game had everything it promised and more!The best part of this game is the fun and satisfying gameplay. The tactics you implement in fights like the team acrobatics and team attacks are true to both this genre of game and the TV shows Chroma Squad draws inspiration from. There's so many different play styles you can try thanks to the no-penalty selection of skills. By no-penalty I mean that if you want to change a character's skills alter their strengths and weaknesses you can do total 180s. The freedom to experiment with different strategies really add a lot of replay value to this game. The crafting is very thought out with different tiers organized so that there are no useless crafting items and none of them are too hard to get. The studio upgrades, mecha upgrade, shop, and agency stuff are all great inclusions that all players to go wild with improving and powering up their characters. I also love being able to make my own power rangers  including their names, colours, catch phrases, and all that other cool super hero stuff.The visuals are pixelly, but in a good way. Behold Studios did a great job using an old-school graphics style in a cinematic and modern way. Even though everything is a clearly made from little squares, there is detail involving perspective, lighting, and various other aspects that gives this 2D world a bigger feeling. This style is similar to games like Hotline Miami and Party Hard, if you need an example.The music is awesome, once again capturing the vibe of those 90's shows we all remember so fondly, but being modern and pleasing to the ear. The theme songs for specific characters are all tailored quite well to who they are paired with. The story at first made me think ""meh"", but after a couple episodes I was drawn into being a squad of stuntmen trying to make their way in the world independently of The Man. And even more drawn in when the stakes get raised and the stuntmen squad must become genuine heros.There are minor quirks here or there, but none worth mentioning since they've probably already been fixed as I'm typing this. TL;DR: if you like incrediby well made tactical RPGs and have a nostalgia scratch to itch, then you should really play this game.			"

												This game man, if you lived in the 90s and watched the power rangers on tv every sunday well... you are in for a treat. Every sunday on steam you can make... your own super hero show featuring 5 people...actually... they don't do that anymore? Well... THIS GAME IS STILL HERE THEN! So basicly it's about you running your own studio and acting out every scene which will air on tv and you get fans after each match depending on how good you did it. In the studio you can make higher materials, armour,weapon and recyle older things to get back some stuff.. but most of the time you wont get anything back at all. And later in the game... you get your own giant mecha which you can customize and make part for as well. The thing I really love about this game is the ''ACTING'' it's so soild... and when you equip gear it changes looks for both weapon and armour, Pretty cool game I'd say.Buy it, Try it uh... love it?'well... if you don't like it you can always get a refond somehow... Also dont try emailing the emails in the game... trust me on that one...			"

And later in the game... you get your own giant mecha which you can customize and make part for as well. The thing I really love about this game is the ''ACTING'' it's so soild... and when you equip gear it changes looks for both weapon and armour, Pretty cool game I'd say.Buy it, Try it uh... love it?'well... if you don't like it you can always get a refond somehow... Also dont try emailing the emails in the game... trust me on that one...			"

												Just beat this game last night (got the Tammy story line) and for what it was worth I thought it was a solid game. I feel as though that if you're a huge fan of Power Rangers or the Sentai genre or a big fan of RPG games, this game is for you. It has a lot of references to Sentai shows like Power Rangers and even other super hero based things like Marvel and DC to random things like Little Mermaid and Barney the dinosaur. This helps it to an extent because after a while the references were getting kind of old and repeptitive. Also on some levels the number of enemies on the field at a time is crazy and I feel as though that the game kept making more and just had a bunch in the corner standing around till more died. It was kind of annoying in that regard to especially when you would have a supposedly strong boss, only to have him being shielded by tons of minions. Still though I thought this game was fun and the sound track as well as look were kick♥♥♥♥♥and I will be playing this through again at some point, and try and get a different story line. If you're a fan of power rangers, sentai shows, or rpgs, I totally suggest this game!			"

Also one of the best things in this game is the tounge and cheek speech. [Note nothing major will be spoiled here] The story begins when 5 stunt doubles are doing a  scene for a show with a rather shoddy director yelling out degrading comments. The 5 after the scene decides they should make thier own show and they set out. Play the game its great.			"

 I got this game through Humble Monthly. What that means is I didn't go out special to find it and buy it.I hated the Power Rangers. I really and truly did. To this very day they make me cringe. I'm not sophisicated by any means; but I enjoy being entertained like the next person does; and watching robots continue to fake explode for like three minutes at a time simple isn't my cup of tea. The Power Rangers are so fake, so chinsy, and generally awful.But if you make a game about dudes aspiring to be them with an 8-bit art style and tight controls; what you get, is an enjoyable experience.I like to imagine this is what the team behind Power Rangers had to actually go and do. Like, at one point, they all were just wearing rain boots and could craft plastic and stuff together to make a spiffy top hat; and then they all did shots of vodka and did an episode.Its got a crafting system that'll allow you to make better weapons and costume parts; thus improving your stats and killing the dudes faster and easier.This game also takes a few pages out of recent Fire Emblem game's playbook in a good way and will let you use teamwork to get farther ahead in the map; or you can use them to pummel foes. Its just a bit annoying having to constantly tell them to use teamwork; and it  can ony be used once per turn. Also the game is kinda like a game of chess where you can move all your dudes and attack maybe in one turn; which again; takes me back to FE. I know FE isn't the only game that does this; but its the only one I can think of.The Story is basiclly what you'd expect; its not lack-luster but its not awful; the battle system isn't creative but its also not overused and they do it well. They give you objectives that can provide bonus' if completed; and you gotta complete them. Cuz if you don't you'll just run out of money.You can change actors for certain benefits if you want, it tries to be funny and doesn't succeed for me, everything you buy will take money from you after you buy it which I feel is quite needless; why not just let us have the buff.So.Is it fun? Yes.Should you get it? On sale, yes.Will I beat it? Eventually.Rating: 7/10			"

												This is a slick homage to the Sentai series, but it's a really solid tactical RPG that can be approached from multiple levels of difficulty depending on how much you want. Well done music and SNES style art. There's a few ""sick memes"" in here but they poke fun at their existence in the game at all. This is one of those games that is just oozing with love and passion from the creators. Definitely recommend picking it up if you need a light game to get you through a holiday weekend with your family, or if you're recovering from the flu on the couch (or even if you're doing outpatient recovery from surgery, as I did)			"

												Chroma Squad is a fun and cheeky tile based strategy RPG.  I like that it incorporates the gameplay styles of games like Game Dev Tycoon and those other ""build a franchise"" type games.The gameplay isn't too complex for a tile-based SRPG, but there are some fun ways to make your characters interact.  After you win the first segment of a battle, oftentimes a boss will show up and you fight it in your giant robot - those sections I found to be tedious.  Pretty much 100% RNG based, which was disappointing, as the buildup makes it seem like those sections will be the most fun part, unfortunately, they're the least amount of fun in the game.Definitly worth playing, it's not a serious game but for a casual title that you can play if you don't want to invest yourself too heavily into something I would recommedn Chroma Squad.  Unfortunately I wasn't drawn in enough to finish the game, but definitely had some fun with it.			"

												Turned it on intending only to ""try it out"" amongst some other stuff we got from Humble Bundle and got pulled into an honest four hour session, with every intention of returning for more. Very engaging RPG and mangement gameplay and would do well ported to droid or iOS. I'll compare it to FF Tactics and the tactical Personas, but it's clear that 103% of the inspiration is Sentai shows, and they love their source material. The writing is also self aware and as my significant other is a dancer/stuntperson, I could really get behind the idea of the stunt people taking over the show and finally getting the respect they deserve. Also REALLY appreciated being able to make my team LEADER a black woman. Refreshing aaaaas hell.			"

												Chroma Squad is an entertaining game in which you 'run' a group of tacky TV superheroes. While it gives you plenty of autonomy to make your own decisions with regards to costumes, weapons, and plotlines, there's also a genuinely gripping yet light-hearted story throughout which keeps you coming back for more.I like it enough that I'll probably get it again when it comes out on consoles next year, but I wasn't so sure about the £10.99 price tag; I ended up waiting until it was on sale, which happens fairly often.

												A goofy but endearing love letter to the rediculousness and camp of the Power Rangers. 16-bit art and a fantastic chiptunes soundtrack add to the nostalgia. While a little bit simplistic, following all the director's suggestions actually does add a bit of a challenge. Plus, being able to write your own catch phrases and name your giant robot is awesome.			"

												First of all, this game is fantastic. Easily one of indie gaming's bright spots so far in 2015, this game has a very unique premise, is solidly executed, and follows through with a great sense of humor, although it isn't very challenging. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you tried to start your own Power Rangers / Super Sentai clone in your garage (or in this case, your uncle's conveniently abandoned warehouse)? Well you no longer have to wonder. Manage your warehouse/studio by upgrading your filming equipment and studio layout. Buy your actors better costumes and props to improve their abilities, or build them some out of duct tape and card board. Then take to the stage and film your show by battling it out with monsters and minions in tactical turn-based combat.

												In a review that requires no analysis whatsoever, all you need to really know about Chroma Squad is that it feels and plays exactly like a reverent burst of childhood nostalgia. Centered around a Power Rangers motif and tactical role playing gameplay, it's a concept that is never taken too seriously and instead commits to delivering an experience both entertaining and unabashedly ridiculous. The developers clearly used an endearing sheaf of letters to spell its love for the sentai genre and consequently you'll be hard tasked to find a game executed with more fun and heart than Chroma Squad. An essential addition for anyone who wants to embrace the pure joy of video gaming.			"

												This is an unfunny game. This is an unfunny, SJW Doormatt, Meme spamming, Pandering, Pretentious, Stupid game with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot. But it's so much fun to actually play.

It's my Power Rangers, they can be whomever I want.List of grievances:-Harshly pro indie to the point of annoyance-coorporations/lawyers/etc are all literally demons.

Just standard stuff,-detracts from the story In a first season epsiode just to bash ""gender roles"", instead of just have the episode with no real changes even suggested.-constantly ♥♥♥♥ing panders to it's Kickstarter crowd, not even in a subtle manner.

What I found was something in between a tycoon style game, like Game Dev Tycoon and a 8 bit top-down tactical RPG.  Hmm.  So does the concept work?Growing up I liked power rangers - it was such a cool show.  As I grew older I really liked RPG games on my Gameboy Color.  Pokemon Yellow, Zelda, and then on our home PC FFVII.  So when I saw this game, I thought I would really enjoy it.  But it just failed to catch my attention, I never felt engaged or interested in what was happening in game.ProsThe theme is great.  You are making “power ranger” episodes and gaining more viewers/money depending on how well you perform.The genre is unique.  As I said, somewhere between a tactical RPG and a business sim game.  Very unique, and indeed a good idea.I think the 8-bit style (or is it 16?) is appropriate as the game is a throwback to the ‘90s.ConsUltimately, I just couldn’t get into the gameplay, progression, or the story. THe only real technical complain I have is that I found the interface odd and uneasy.  Sometimes it's difficult to tell, according to the character selection bar on the right, which avatar correlates to various characters on the map.  Setting up the vital teamwork moves is also a little awkward and inconsistent "

												I really want to like this game. I really, really do. I'm a huge fan of Tokusatu shows and I love Power Rangers and Super Sentai. I also love strategy games, business managers and RPGs. This game is based off Power Rangers, is a strategy game and has business manager elements. Sounds like a combo made in heaven, right? Well...I've tried to play through it over 3 times now and every time I just get tired of it. It's not a bad game, really, but it reeks of poor design choices. But I don't want it to seem like I hate the game, so lets talk about the positives of the game. The game looks gorgeous. Pixel art sometimes feels lazy, but this game makes it look really nice. Sprites are put together nicely and are animated well. The maps in particular look sweet, I especially love the city block with the toy store map.  The pieces of gear you can craft also look great, most end game gear even looks like cool Power Ranger suits. The animations your characters do when they fight enemies are also done really well and just feel like they really connected. The sound effects really help in making every hit feel like it landed too. The gameplay itself is also fun. It's simple, very simple, but fun. It's a basic SRPG affair. Units move across a grid map and punch enemies in the face. Some classes like the Tech Guy can hit enemies from afar and each class has their own skills to spice it up a bit. You only get 5 Rangers (missed opportunity for a dope 6th Ranger to join you), so the actual strategy element is a bit lite. Now for the bad...The story...oh dear the writing. The writing in this game can range from just plain boring to borderline offensive statements that make no sense, but I want to avoid that can of worms so let's just talk about the other way the writing just isn't very good. First of all, the actual show you produce doesn't seem to have any sense of internal continuity with itself. You don't really see this unbelievably powerful alien king plotting his plan to take over earth in the show itself. That's like, a trait in Power Rangers since MMPR. Lord Zedd, Emperor Gruumm, Master Sledge etc, even the more fantasy ones had a similar antagonist. Almost every episode feels like a basic ""Monster of the Week"" episode. You only get to see the action elements of the show too, not the character development or world building Power Rangers is known for. The show you're running is boring and none of the episodes stand out. It's ironic because the actors you play as complain about the former show being all action and no substance. Next off, the monsters you fight all seem like jokes with no substance or personality. Yes, Power Rangers had silly looking villains (Diabolico still makes me chuckle), but most of them are still meant to be taken seriously, and to an extent, are. Some monsters in Power Rangers look downright awesome. Lord Arcanon, Lord Zedd, Loki, Badussa, Koragg, Ransik, etc all look awesome and threatening. Meanwhile in Chroma Squad we get...that ""has science gone to far"" meme from a few years ago and a stop sign wizard...it's not very riveting. Your characters have no portraits for dialogue either, nor do they change expression at all, which makes the mood hard to read. It's hard to take a serious seeming role with a half naked boxer perpetually in a ""1-2 punch"" animation cycle. Those issues I listed, plus the fact that if you get down to it, the plot boils down to a basic ""leader who got full of himself and has to get back down to earth"" scenario (Man, Power Rangers SPD had that plot resolved in like, an episode...) that just isn't fun or interesting. When the plot actually does get going...it's just a typical villain arc with no flair or personality. The main bad guy is a joke in both literal and metaphorical senses. He has no menace to him. It's just a lady gaga parody. Imagine if we got someone like Lord Zedd, Octomus The Master, Emperor Gruumm or even King Mondo or Rita Repulsa to hijack the plot? That would've been 10 times more interesting then what we got. Heck, Power Rangers even had a similar villain to Lord Gaga named Heckyl...and they made him so much more interesting by giving him more depth then ""he's feminine and girly"". Now, the bad parts of the gameplay. The bosses just feel like they're tailored made to be as counter productive to a strategy game as possible. The first major boss teleports around every turn -- which makes gaining distance to regroup feel pointless, can scatter your units -- which makes positioning feel pointless, can attack multiple times per turn -- which is just mean and can stun your units -- which just removes an aspect of strategy. Not only that, but he constantly summons ranged units, which widdle you down while he attacks your units twice a turn. What makes this even worse is that you're healer in this game is borderline worthless. 1 heal per 5 turns? Are you serious?And it doesn't get better...Season 5 is where I always just give up. It's just not fun in the slightest at that point. Stage gimmicks become bull and enemies have way to much health. The fact that you can't save in episodes -- which can take up to an hour -- is just painful. Theirs no check points, once you feel an episode, that's GG, gotta re-do it unless you want those major drawbacks. What makes this even worse are the mech fights. Oh god the mech fights. The mech fights have literally no strategy to them at all. No extra skills, no items, no techniques, just ""punch"" and ""super move"". Winning or losing is based off your luck with RNG. Character customization is also plagued with RNG. Getting crafting items is based off enemy drops or you can buy them in the store (Money is painfully scarce, mind you), so getting that piece of gear you need is up to chance. You think your characters are under equipped? Just got to live with it, I guess. You can't re-do episodes and theirs no way to grind reliably. If you're doing bad with drops, you just have to deal with it. Because of this, my squad always feels so lopsided, with my frail healer and scout getting all the good gear to cover their bad defenses, while my fighter and Red Ranger lack behind. Speaking of your squad. You can create your own Ranger squad with 5 classes. Pretty basic stuff, you got your Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, Black Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Pink Ranger, but you can customize the colors. Each has a different bonus and skill variety. My issue with this is the actual people you get for your Rangers. Most characters you pick just seem like jokes. I would've liked a variety of normal looking humans. In the words of the wise Zordon ""Alpha, Rita's escaped! Recruit a team of teenagers with attitude!"". That's probably just a nitpick on my end, but I just wish this game took something serious, you know? Everything feels like a joke. The characters are jokes, the mentor character is a joke, the plot is a joke, the monsters are jokes, the main villain is a joke. Theirs nothing to take seriously, nothing to really get into. Power Rangers had silly moments, but was meant to be taken seriously. This is just nothing but a joke. It's not a funny one either.All in all, this game isn't bad, but it lacks substance, balance, depth and just fun.			"

Key given by the developer for review purposes only,no other compensation is received.OVERVIEWIn Chroma Squad you control a group of actors that make a super sentai show, with a mad and boring director.Until one day they resolve to create his own show to get success.You will start with a simple and old basement gived to you by the uncle of a team member.you will grow your studio getting new upgrades,recording new episodes,getting fans and managing contracts by mail system from the game.The gameplay is turn-rpg based where each team has a turn to move and attack,you also get a team work special named chromatize,where your actors transform in super sentai ones. Your goal here is to grow and not lose fans,because if the fans number reach 0,you will lose the entire game.-----------------------------------PROS & CONSPros:Unique gameplay style,make your own way,no equal quests.You change the order of episodes to play.Really Small,and most of the machines can handle it.Extremely addictive,many achievements and a couple of hours to beat the game.Also game features many languages to choose,making it for all.Cons:If you play without pausing times,can be repetitive.-----------------------------------SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGA game for people that ever dreamed making your super sentai show.Inumerous hours of gameplay,much content,and such features makes this game unique and awesome,also game is really cheap and you can grab it with a big discount on sale also.

												If you're on Mac, there's a bug that most people seem to run into that won't let you use the keyboard. Which means that once the tutorial is over, you are unable to progress as it requires you to type the name of your new company. Based on the comments in the forums, this has been going on for the last 2 months and the devs have not addressed yet.So, I'm sure this is great on Windows, but if you're on Mac wait for the devs to fix this before purchasing.

												I don't know if i should recommend this, on the side it's a really nice game with solid and simple tactical gameplay that evolves on the game lenght. But it doesn't deliver on the promisse of real management simulator options, it lacks options on crew management(like characters dying in story, etc) and the worst thing is the dialogues, the dialogues breaking the fourth wall all the time destroy the nice cheesy sentai story and they should be more complex, not much considering the early Mighty Morphin Power Rangers dialogues, but more.I understand that the writing is based off on Power Rangers and not on the original Sentais that usually have a better more structured story, but god damnit they should work on it. And there is no language barrier in place as some reviewers sugest, everyone know english and if they don't they could always hire an english professor(im brazillian too so i know it's possible) to work on a better layout on the story. It's like that simply on their will to make it ridiculous...TL;DR: Gameplay is fun, yet simple. Story is cheesy and not well thought. I would recommend it only for POWER RANGERS fans, cause it doesnt rly sound like a japanese Super Sentai, and more like a Saban rip off of a good thing.			"

												A fun turn-based strategy game with Sentai trappings, it's pretty enjoyable, with plenty of callbacks to classic Power Rangers tropes. It's fun, doesn't explicitly spell things out for you, which is a plus in my book, I don't need my hand held.

As other reviews have pointed out, I think you really have to like the very specific references and story content to fall in love with this. It caters to a very specific market, that unfortunately, is just not my cup of tea.All I can really comment on is the actual game. For some reason, the complexity and depth reminded me of Advanced Wars in the sense that it is fairly shallow and lite compared to other much deeper turn-based fighting games. Its not bad - it is just a certain kind of thing. I like the base management, but others have said that choices don't matter all that much. I did like the art style, but it wasn't enough to carry me further.If you watch the trailer and it screams 'play me!', then this is *probably* for you. I bought it based off of the 'overwhelmingly positive' review status. Bad idea - I actually got a refund since it was fifteen bucks. Obviously there is a fan base, but I am not a part of it. "

												Christian game developers know that it's not cool for the characters in their games to just stop what they're doing and start telling you about the power and majesty of Our Savior Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb Of Hosts, even though they really want to.So why do feminist game developers think it's cool to start speechifying about sexist tropes and trying to change the world by ""not reproducing what it is""? That totally took me out of this cool little game. Now I'm worried that the next game I buy is going to tell me to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or FEEL THE BERN.

												What starts out as a quirky but promising little indie tactics RPG becomes an utter slog by the end.  I beat the game once but while there's two more endings for me to go do and the promise of some different gameplay if I can redo the first four acts again, well... I don't want to do those all over again.  It serves best as a reminder of the caveat emptor nature of Kickstarter.			"

												Game is barely strategic, and is in fact massively repetitive and tries to be irritatingly meta. Either you're playing each mission to its ""requirements"" for bonuses constantly, or you're on the edge of bankruptcy regularly if you want to take things on in a sane fashion. Crashed on me regularly. Wasn't worth the effort in the end and I regret buying it.			"

												I am sure that a lot of people will enjoy the game. To me the game just felt too clunky, both during the base sceens and the battles. There's a lot of little things that annoys me but not enough to engage or interest me.After playing for 90+ minutes I decided to get a refund because I wasn't having fun. Maybe I would have liked it more after giving it some more time, but then I would be above the refund time limit.Also the controller support is really bad since you just move the cursor around and it's really hard to select things. There are also no instructions for what buttons do what. So it's best to play with a mouse.			"

												it starts good, but both the story and gameplay becomes repetitive and loses its color as it nears the end. very unique setting with its own sense of humor, but it loses the grip once protagonists fall into pseudo-reality situation. If the developer wanted the transition in the story from indie actors ended up actually saving the world scenario, they should have been more careful in the method of unfolding. I personally think they should have sticked with being indie actors / producers and may be having them struggle with competition with some big company or copycat program.Though, it took a path of woops we are actually dealing with real evil! gotta save the world!Reminds me of the movie Galaxy Quest back in 1999. The setting felt like another cliché.			"

												Chroma Squad is easily summed up with: ""If power rangers and Xcom had a baby, this is that game."" If that sounds like fun to you then you don't need to read the rest of this. Pick it up and have some fun.For those who are interested in getting a little more indepth, I'll provide what I can by way of a review (but I don't have a huge amount of time devoted to the game so take what I say with a grain of salt).Pros:Aesthetically really nice. Meaning the visuals and music are basically perfect for the game.Fun and funny storyline (from what I've experienced so far)Gameplay is like a simplified Xcom. Mechanically I'd be ok with letting my 8+ year old nieces and nephews to play. They'd figure it out after some trial and error.Family friendly (so far)Cons:For some people they might not like the pixelated aesthetic. I can undersand that point of view, even if I don't agree with it.For a slightly longer review. I had fun playing this game. When I saw it first appear on steam I was intrigued enough to pick it up when it went on sale. Even though I don't have a lot of playtime, I will say that it was worth the sale price for sure and would be worth full price too. There are hours of entertainment that can be pulled from this game. It's light enough on the processor that it makes it perfect for gaming on the go if you don't have a great laptop and/or just want to ""film a quick episode"" (mission) when you are waiting for class to start or stuck in the airport. If all this sounds good to you, consider giving it a chance.			"

												Cons: - No option to restart parts of an episode.- Controller support does not work during Mecha Battles.- No Keyboard commands to move through menu selections, battle options, and  map navigations.- Mecha skill selection and upgrading tiers feels lacking. Not enough effort was put forth into making it more enjoyable. Rating: 2 out of 5 A lite tactical role playing game. Chroma Squad's gaming mechanics is hardly deep enough to qualify as a tactical role playing game. The studio, crafting, and mecha upgrading systems are simplistic in nature. Chroma Squad scores high in nostalgia but lacks the depth and extensive upgrading systems that tactical role playing games are known for. My recommendation: Skip it. Spend more on a better game. Rewatching your favorite squadron based television show can also recapture those feelings of nostalgia.			"

												I don't think I've ever said this about a game before, but the writing makes me want to punch myself in the face. It's not bad English, it's just supernaturally bland. Banal is not a word I've ever had cause to use before, and I'm using it now.It's like...You know how five year olds write? Maybe all the words are in the right places because the teacher helped them out a bit, and maybe their spelling's all been fixed with red pen, but the story still reads like a grocery list?That's Chroma Squad. That's Chroma Squad in its excruciating, every-mission-is-a-plot-mission tedium.This would be tolerable, I guess, but the gameplay is boring too. Even on the hardest difficulty, missions just take longer to clear, and most of that time is hammering away at putties waiting for something to actually threaten you.There's a whole resource management/business sim back end to the game and that, at least, isn't boring, but it's grindy and obnoxious instead. You try to farm enough resources to craft new gear while deploying advertising bonuses to get new fans and increase revenue from viewership, while pumping your stats with a few small global bonuses, so that you can quickly and efficiently win the next mission with lots of style and max out your money gain.That's not awful, but it ends with you playing the mission, which is.If you liked Knights of Pen and Paper, you'll like this. It's a time-waster with bright colors and a surprisingly pleasant soundtrack. It has good design ideas but they're somehow lost in the implementation - like a cannoli and kidney milkshake.I tried hard to enjoy Chroma Squad, and I recognize that other people may have quite different experiences with the game, but at the end of the day, it's still just...""Once upon a time there was Teddy. He went to the store. Then he went to the beach. It rained there. The end.""0/10, Teddy. Wait a few years and try again.			"

												This game overall falls far short of what it should or could have been. I was getting more and more disappointed as I played further into the game. First a few key points of the game that are off.""Hire Actors"", ""Cast actors"" Sorry but this is a once off near the start of the game you pick your 5 heroes which you can't change and must be in the 5 roles forced upon you. There is also no choices in villains or henchmen appear in episodes.""Customize your TV studio"" No you get to pick from a small list of improvements that improve your heroes statistics, drop rate and fans per episode or unlock a skill rank that can only be used from certain seasons onwards even if purchased before that season. You don't get to choose what your sets look like.""upgrade your gear"", ""craft weapons"" Upgrading does not happen you replace for better gear and in my play through all bought gear was better than anything that could be crafted except a few utility gear that increases throw distance or movement. As for the rest of the game each hero only has a choice of 3 weapon to equip either a one handed sword, a pistol or their role's specialty weapon with a very limited selection of skills. During the episodes you play them out with no choices in what you do except for the very few times you change the ending path you are on. Even during a cringe worthy talk about not following sexist tropes I thought I would finally get a choice of rescue a boy or a girl but the game forces their decision on you. I really would have liked to have many choices that would affect what type of fans, how many fans you get and what the media is saying about your show. The game also has quite a repetitive feel to it doing pretty much the same each episode.As for bugs I have had some random freezes where I can't continue the battle but can access the menu and quit out and reload my game. I have also seen directors orders not being completed where you need to destroy x amount of a boss specially summon (Bombs and Clones) but if your team does enough acrobatics and flashy moves the directors orders don't matter.

												I picked up this title because I love Power Rangers and loved the idea of making my own. I read plenty of reviews before picking it up and they all seem to come down to the gameplay is weak but its basicly Power Rangers so who cares. What I did not get warned of and I hope I can warn some who care is that this game does push a political agenda. I just want to enjoy making my own Rangers not get told I shouldnt allow/enjoy things because someone somewhere might find it sexist. People are free to have their own views but I dont want to pay money to have others shove theirs down my throat.So if you think its sexist to have a female kidnapped by the bad guys you will love this game! However if you think not letting someones sister on the show because it might some how offend someone and on top of that say she shouldnt be disappointed because youre fighting sexism, is stupid then it might not be up your alley.

												Haven't played too far into the game.. Literally the second or third mission, but so far I'm not sure if I can recommend this. As a SRPG, the combat seems extremely shallow, with your abilities being both on a fairly long cooldown and locked solely to your transformed state. Not to mention the fact that.. there seems to not be many overall. It seems like each season you unlock one more per character, but again that seems extremely shallow to me. I'm not even sure if the game is actually balanced to be played on the hardest difficulty either, with some director goals that seem extremely difficult if not impossible to pull off.Also unfortunately the game can be extremely preachy, especially in one infamous episode that I'm sure has been mentioned in other reviews. I'm not even sure how the issue could have been written better, but its pretty eye roll worthy overall.			"

												The game is amazing but due to multiple game breaking bugs; I cannot reccomend it.The major bugs are all lumped into the final episode - where you can soft-lock your game or just outright crash. This has apperently been fixed; while it still clearly persists.Also, the hub system could use a massive rework. Because of the clunky design you end up having to click 10 times to get what you want accomplished. Example 1: Rather that put the crafting system alongside where you need crafting - you have to leave what you're doing and go craft that thing (which unnecesarily takes time to complete; even if you have all the materials.)Example 2: You cannot compare stats with what you have equipped unless you are buying it from the store. If you're crafting something; prepare to go back and forth several times with lots of clicking involved to manuever between the two screens.Overall: It's great but... The last bit of the game is a buggy mess and the menu design on the hubworld is terribly clunky. Avoid it until a much-needed overhaul is made.			"

												This game feels Kickstarted as all hell. The mass-appeal and cheap pixel art aesthetic, the barebones gameplay, the stupid pop culture references in lieu of humor, everything points to Kickstarter. Most damning of all is the numerous systems and mechanics that were obviously bullet points on a pitch list first, and fully fleshed out or interesting ideas second. There's crafting, but it's really simplistic and boring. Ditto the teamwork system, the fans/money interactions, and just the combat in general. This game could really have stood a few more (6+) months in the oven, because it's not truly bad, but it's definitely not living up to its potential.			"

												Do you like dying because your attacks missed and there was nothing you could do about it? Do you like chasing gun-wielding birds across half the map? A few quirks kept me from enjoying this game as much as I wanted to. I will never understand what goes through a designer's head that says ""You know what might be fun? Setting up 3/5s of your team for a combined attack that will miss"". Or just accuracy in general. It's not fun, it detracts from strategy, and it's incredibly frustrating. Similarly, gunmen in the game can and will kite you endlessly to the very edges of the map. It's not fun, it's not interesting, and it just makes you want to chuck something through a window. They will do this on every single turn, and if your teament that can catch them isn't at hand you're SOL. The art is amazing, the themes and writing are really cool and well used, and you can tell the creators are huge fans of the Sentai series. Its just that the game is an exercise in incredible frustration. If you can stomach these awful design choises, the game is fantastic. But for me few things♥♥♥♥♥♥me off more than accurasy where it absolutely is not required.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. There's some really good ideas and bit and pieces that work well together, but then the game quickly remembers it's an indie title so it immediately breaks the fourth wall with some dumb meme joke and poorly placed rants about sexism. It wouldn't have been so bad had the dialogue actually followed what sentai/powerranger shows were like, but it isn't ; it's completely about these random, pre-made characters that always spew the same lines regardless of their gender/race/species. Why even let people choose the visual appearance of them if you've already created characters for them? It would have been better just to create a premade team that apes the original show's archetypes rather than blandly change the visuals.The game also suffers in that there's too much fluff and not enough depth. You have weapons, crafting, a store and various upgrades - but they all feel meaningless. Nothing really excels and feels like it was tacked on because all rpgs must have crafting now, rather than it was something important to the game play.Lastly, the art can be downright confusing or poorly imitating at times. For some reason my blonde female support character won't stop rubbing her nipples in her idle animation. It's kind of disturbing and is weirding me out. Just, standing there all day, rubbing away. Did nobody notice this ???? "

												I'm a big fan of Tactical RPGs and I'm a big fan of SNES-era graphics, so this is why I bought this game.While downloading I was reading up on the company and was happily surprised to see that they also made Table-Top RPG (or something like that) which I also enjoyed a lot.To sum it up, the game is fun and challenging but gets repetitive quickly. I tried it on hard from the start and after 1 hour restarted on Medium to get the hang of the game more (it WAS hard, my heroes kept dying and I couldn't finish any extra goals).The combat is fun and you get new skills often enough that you don't get bored.However, I think I am at about 60% of the game so far and it has started to become quite repetitive for me. There are very few different enemy units, the story is not that interesting, and the Giant Robot Battles lose their charm after the 2nd one - it's always exactly the same. I haven't had any real trouble with the fights for a little while now, but the extra 2 goals they give you during missions are not always easy to complete, so it gives a nice twist.I'm now slowly playing it when I have free time (I'm also a CIV V addict) just to say I finished it, but after 8 hours, I was bored. Wait for a discount.On another note, I'm now watching Sentai again.			"

												This game could have been good in a lot of respects. The idea was novel, but after that was over the game you were left with was poor in many respects. You can not skip cutscene and the characters, abilities, and roles are all very static with little to no customization possible. The only choices you can make have clear right and wrong options with very little balance. This is all on top of cringe worthy dialog that drags on, including preachy speeches about sexism. And you have to sit through all of it because lets not forget, you can't skip cutscenes. Despite how little it appears that I've played this game I have actually logged many hours on another account encompassing mech fights, crafting, and character choices (when available).			"

												Seems like a neat idea, but is unecissarily ugly. I wanted to like this one and I think I'd enjoy following the story, but it's just too ugly to play.Pixel art can be really good, but this is not good pixel art, and there is nothing about the theme of the game which seems to require pixel art, so it makes me feel like it was chosen out of laziness, which shows. Too bad.Also, couldn't get it to play on the orrect monitor.			"

												General Review:The game is cool, but has too much dialog. The storyline is so gigantic they even added a fast forward feature that came in handy when the game crashed and I had to restart a level. Is not that the game isn't fun, it is, but it is one of those games that will annoy the sh*t out of you at some point. Pros:-Based on Sentai shows-Studio options are very diverse-Turn based combat system-Nice 8bit feeling-The game is full of intelligent humor-Game has a lot of referencesCons:-TOO MANY bugs and unexpected crashes-Crafting things is a messy task because some items have random status-The recycling feature is useless cause drop rates are fu*ked up (for real)-The giant robot fights are too flat, I dare to say boring			"

												Great soundtrack, terrible game. Chroma Squad fails on all fronts, it's lackluster as an SRPG and it's tycoon elements are few and far between. The writing is abysmal and does little to pay real homage to the brand of Japanese TV shows it's emulating (I wonder if the writers have ever actually seen an episode of Super Sentai) it's full of internet memes that serve no real purpose and just comes off as lazy overall. The backer content is also predictably awful, I wish kickstarters would cease this trend of letting their backers insert anything at all into their games.Avoid this one, even if you're a fan of Sentai shows, unfortunately that's the hook that lured me in and the end results leave me feeling very disappointed.

												From what I saw of the game's trailers on steam this game seemed very interesting and fun to play, I loved Power Rangers as a kid. It took very little time to download and when I finally started up the game the game developer logo popped up, then I was greeted with a pink screen...only a pink screen. Aparently the menu has graphics that don't even work if you don't have the right graphics card to run it. If you know some people can't run it then why put it in the game in the first place? Lazy on the developers part.			"

												I'm sorry to say that I wasn't a fan, and I wanted to post some of my issues to other prospective buyers. I'd like to clarify that I'm a big fan of both management/sim games, SRPGs and Sentai, so I fall right into the game's key demographic.The game is spoiled by poor writing throughout the gameplay experience - I understand the developers are working against a language barrier, but this means that much of the dialogue has no flow or substance. Tonally, the dialogue never seems whether to indulge in the action fantasy of sentai, or provide a narrative about the stunt crew pursuing their own career. The result is that the characters are constantly breaking the fourth wall which is not only tiresome, but spoils the atmosphere the game's (very good) graphics are depicting.The game has been designed without level ups: where this might seem beneficial to some, they've replaced this tried and tested mechanism with a bolted-on crafting system. You become dependent on crafting gear from items dropped by enemies - worse, you have to hope that the 'random bonus' is actually worth having. The removal of level ups takes away a sense of stable progression, and replaces it with gear-dependence, which, for me, sucks the fun out of the game.The management aspect is not developed or interesting enough as a worthwhile distraction, and the two gameplay modes (simulation/SRPG) don't mesh with each other in a satisfactory way. The lack of depth in the simulation and the lack of levelling are disempowering - you're never sure where you sit on the game's difficulty curve, and ultimately your successes do not feel like they've originated from any choices you've made. This is poisonous for any game, but Chroma Squad simply fails to provide any grit, depth or detail beyond what is an impressive exterior.TL;DR: It looks great on the surface, but goes to pieces once you get past the unique premises, references, and graphics.

												TL;DR 2: The -- just gonna go out on a limb and realize I've been a lil harsh.Its colourful, if you're super bored and its 4 am then who's to realize you're a dank memer and you just love shity ♥♥♥♥ing memes that would make Pepe proud (only god and your mother who will both send you to hell damn you.). Its one of those things where you're very easily amused by grinds and futile mechanics things will work for you, or if you thrive in the badness of things. Like naming your squad the Peepee patroller and naming your mech the WOBBLY SAUSAGE, caps mandatory. Its stupid, really stupid, not really lucid gameplay sort of fun, play it if you're tired, bored, and its priced at the fiveish dollars its worth. Man, it's 4 am RIGHT NOW AS I'M TYPING IT, I'm exhausted and my friends are asleep  after a night of enjoyment, I'm actually having fun while gorging myself on brownie bars. Still not reccomended, but, eh, if you're a sad little man and you know it, buy Chroma rangers, cue jingle I'm outies.TL;DR: Power Rangers (but not really, its more a side detail to people cracking dank memes), dull mecha maymays, some people are mad about Social Justice, but the game itself just isn't as thrilling as it promises to be. RIP in Pepperoni. Not really as great as its touted to be. It seems for half a second it would be tactically challenging but then you realize everything you fight is just an issue of placement, which at times could be avoided if you were allowed to pick your path rather than autorouting. The item system relies a little too much on you getting lucky, and only really serves to make you irritated wih things. Squad customizations are funny for a while but you really get tired of what you see soon, and its a bit annoying when you realize into the game you put the wrong person into the wrong role. Humour is forced. Good lord is it forced, not even mentioning the heavy handed shoehorned stupid SJW messages (which really don't make sense by the way), which, really, I understand given the market of tumblr being so easy to reel into guaranteed sales, but... the humour itself gets really worn out really fast. Audience system is mostly pointless since just running a lot and using the positioning system will top you out easy enough and it just serves to drag fights on if you're going for all of the pointless little guys. Not to mention, a lot of the skills look cool! Then don't really do anything compared to the normal punching action, combined with a lack of many real skills, its best to just stick to passives save for the one starter heal move and punch things to hell. Mecha battles are excruiatingly bland and don't really carry the oomph you're hoping for, its more of a rock paper scissors game but without any chance of losing unless you somehow hit ALT+F4.			"

												Kurt Vonnegut said that anyone who has attacked a piece of written work with genuine loathing is being ridiculous, that they are behaving as someone who has ""put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae"". What I'm about to do is kind of like that, but imagine me duct taping pink polyester all over my body and wandering into a public park to hunt down an anthropomorphic version of a video game called Chroma Squad, a tiny freckly kid with jubilantly blue eyes, offering me an ice cream cone, his diminutive hands aquiver with timid goodwill. I will proceed to karate kick that child in the face, and as he reaches for the ice cream again (mint chocolate drizzled with galaxies of cake sprinkles), I will remove my plastic helmet to let him gaze on my dreadfully expressionless face as I level a long gentle stare into his brilliant, innocent eyes, grinding his delicious confection into the pea gravel with the heel of a nylon boot.I came to Chroma Squad for obvious reasons. Chroma Squad begins with what we are to take as the stunt actors from the actual Power Rangers set staging a revolt and opening their own studio to shoot their own martial arts children's show, or in other words, to do everything exactly as before but with a rigorous simulation of creative control. The thing that really drew me to it, though, was the rumor that it was a Final Fantasy Tactics-esque Tactical RPG with a splash of XCOM flavor, full of cheek and wit and heart-warming hilarity to bring home to the whole family.I'm going to have a total XCOM-snob conniption right now, so be sure to click the 'not helpful' button if those words don't mean anything to you at all. This game's combat is wearing tactical RPG clothes for what appears to be no reason apart from the fun of having made a game that aesthetically resembles a turn-based tactical RPG ala Disgaea or FF Tactics. Battles are much more comparable, however, to those of Diablo or Torchlight, in which you click somewhere on the screen, your little fellows amble (or here, cartwheel and cheer-lift one another) in a direction, swing their fists around, and that's it. This, of course, places Chroma Squad on the tactical combat spectrum nearest to ""something you idly click through.""It's all about positioning your team just right so they can perform the same finishing move again. And again. And again. All for the entertainment of the type of children Chroma Squad must think we all were at a certain age: the kid who got up early every Saturday morning to sit at the TV with eyes pressed directly to the glass. Combat is shockingly boring, special abilities don't really synchronize, and there's basically no reason to attempt to play ""tactically,"" because the experience is much closer to being babysat by a kind teenager who thinks she's way cooler than she is. You are given a laundry list each mission of little hoops to jump through, such as ""defeat 3 enemies in the same turn,"" ""keep all your heroes alive,"" or ""attempt to figure out how to do that same team attack again,"" but all of these come off as suggestions on the level with ""wouldn't it be really cool if you brushed your teeth and went to bed at exactly 8 PM per your parents' instructions? We're really on the same side here.""I found myself cranking the difficulty down from its highest setting midway through, not because I felt particularly challenged, but because I just couldn't bear the thought of spending more time seeing this thing through than I had to. Yes, sometimes you'll get so bored watching each reskinned enemy type spawn in one-at-a-time and run into positions that will have no effect on how you'll fight that you phase back into paying attention to learn that your healer is dead, and things get a little bit tricky. Then you can halfheartedly attempt to survive the mission or suffer some consequences featuring a number that represents your supposed fans, who have opted, instead of watching your onscreen incompetence, to get stoned and watch Godzilla vs Megalon again, which is about 1/4 as stoned as I'd need to be to enjoy this game or find it compellingly difficult, a state of I mind imagine as a hypothetical level of brain-myopia in which I lose the ability to read or control my bowels.What you'll never see in Chroma Squad, at any rate, is any indication that the AI knows that it's supposed to try to win. Chroma Squad is every bit the tactical RPG that Battletoads & Double Dragon was way back when.The game's interface is by far the worst enemy--not much is communicated clearly, and features stand a very real chance of remaining hidden in plain sight well into late game. The explanations of some abilities don't make sense--one has you dealing damage to enemies along your traveled path, but the ability doesn't path through enemies, so I never figured out what the hell that ability is supposed to be doing.One could argue the game is challenging given that you'll feel underpowered most of the time. But I'll counter that by saying that making a sloppy, unresponsive mess of a studio management screen does not tactical gameplay make. Your resource management screen seems wilfully designed to confuse you--you'll spend money in an attempt to get at least one aspect of your television enterprise functioning competently, but little seems to help. You cannot sell equipment and are instead forced to reduce items to scrap materials you'll probably never use. Everything is a one-way street to a sort of long suffering.Somehow, the novelty of the game's customization options wears off extremely fast, and even turning your heroes' ""morphin time"" catchphrase to HAIL SATAN fails to drum up much enthusiasm when you know more deadening combat is coming.THAT'S THE WHOLE JOKE, you say. It's all LOW RENT and also DID YOU NOTICE that EVERYTHING IS A REFERENCE. Yeah. And it's extremely hilarious or something. Don't get me wrong, there are some sensible chuckles strung throughout in the form of a draconian director barking Backstreet Boys lyrics as stage prompts, an anonymous ""biggest fan"" innocently emailing the studio to ask if Halliburton had any involvement in the design of the Megazord, or the sudden run-in with the star of Colin's Bear Animation, who unaccountably transforms into a send-up of Yakra and Heckran from Chrono Trigger.But when I start to sense that the game's wit is wringing itself raw with the exertion of transmuting ""Nick Fury"" to ""Rick Anger"", or naming a large sentient iPod enemy DOPi, or reaching -just- -one- -more- -time- for another Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shoutout, I start experimenting with how much mileage I can get out of the handy fast-forwarding key. I swear to god, nothing tells me more about how quick this game's lights and camera went up around its ramshackle production than having a character recite the Taken monologue verbatim and the villain responding with ""Hey Sentai fans, did you catch that that comes from somewhere else? Thanks so much for playing our game, guys, and HEY MACARENA, AHA.""Best of all, I watched the everloving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Power Rangers as a kid and got into my share of schoolyard trouble for it, and I don't know if it's me or the developers of this game who are supposed to be more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that the fact alone does not make this game good. It is all heart, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, all heart through and through, stuffed with beautiful art and infectious music, and for all those elements I will certainly place a crisp gold star at the top of this game's construction paper project plastered with hot glue and macaroni.Pure flavor, bad content, like a Fruit Roll-Up or a new season of Full House. Buy it as cheap as you can.			"

												Go-go SUPER LUCK SQUAD!I'm reviewing this game purely on the gameplay aspect. There are plenty of positive reviews regarding story and sentai fanservice.This is based on playing the highest difficulty:This game is a decent turn-based game in it's own right. There isn't much strategy to it. A bit of planning is involved to complete the director's instructions, but in the end it all comes down to luck. The most important thing to making equipment, materials, all based on luck. I have one save file where a certain material I obtain in abundance, and really dont need it as it's mostly for the starter equipment, and another save file where the only material I've been obtaining is the make the same pair of gloves. If you dont keep your equipment up to snuff, your rangers are as good as dead or too weak to complete director's instructions as the episodes difficulty increase._____Now for the actual gameplay. Here is wear luck becomes absolutely infuriating. Let me give some examples:Now, remember, you control a squad of 5 rangers.The director wants you to kill all of a certain enemy within, say, 3 turns. There are about 10 enemies on the field, and you need to focus on 3 specific ones. Those specific ones need to all be dead in 3 turns. Sounds simple enough, plan out how you'll position your rangers to catch them and take them out. Now, let's get to the problem:- Most of the squishy enemies, unless you luckily score a critical, can't be killed by a single ranger. This means it will take two of your rangers attacking to guarantee that kill. After a ranger attacks, they're done for that turn. This means it should be no problem for you to kill 3 of the weak enemies within 3 turns. Let's not get into details about some rangers having to use up their turn just to move around and get close to these enemies. We'll just presume you'll probably be spread thin and only have a kill average of 1 enemy per turn.... wait, change that from 'kill' to 'chance to kill'. You have a 'chance' to kill 1 enemy per turn. So if you happen to miss this chance, you can kiss that director's instruction goodbye, and restart the episode. Let's type how this will play out if you're unlucky:First turn: you manage to kill an enemy.Second turn: you manage to kill another enemy.Third turn, your last turn to complete the instructions, and you're only one kill away: you order your rangers to attack and... the enemy dodges. Well, you're screwed. Time to abort episode and try again.This is how many of your games will play out. This may not be too bad when it's just the start of an episode. However, there are times when an episode has 3 parts and you can spend an hour of your time going through the episode, completing all director's instructions only to have some unlucky crap happen at the very end and have to restart from the very beginning. That's a lot of time to be wasting over something that's completely out of your control, luck.I'll give you one of my recent episodes as an example, there are three parts. The first two parts are simple enough, the third part involves a boss that can heal itself and many enemies around that heal. You have to kill the boss within 10 turns and finish it with a finishing move. A finishing move requires all your rangers to be next to the boss and attack together(use Teamwork). Technically, you have to kill the boss within 9/10 turns, since he will stun your rangers(making you unable to use the finishing move on the 10th turn, as it requires all of your rangers) on specific turns... one of those specific turns being the 10th one. Now, that seems like a pretty decent time to take out the boss. That is, if you're lucky. Let's play this out:(We'll skip the small details and say you manage to get rid of the healing minions within 3 turns. You now have 6 turns left to take out the boss, who will also heal himself for pretty hefty amount. If you're lucky, he wont heal too often. If you're unlucky, he might heal twice in a row, making all your damage done to him in a turn, null. You still should have no problems as long as you manage to keep hitting him every turn and wittle him down. Given you have proper planning, you'll be just fine!)Turn 1/6: You manage to quadruple the boss, and dealing enough damage that will allow you to outdps his heal.Turn 2/6: You deal enough to outdps his heal again.Turn 3/6: He dodges, completely wasting a turn, and heals himself. That's okay, you see that you still have a chance to take him out in time.Turn 4/6: He dodges again... okay, it might  be close, but just maybe you can make it.Turn 5/6: He dodges again, and heals. He's now at full health again, it's game over. Time to abort and do the whole episode again, taking up another hour of your time._______Let me give you one last situation. In this one, YOUR luck can be your downfall in completing instructions. Let's say you need to kill 4 enemies in a single turn. Well, remember how it can take two rangers just to kill one enemy? You have 5 rangers, it takes 2 to kill one. Simple math, you can't kill 4 in a single turn. Unless... you plan ahead and simply soften them up to kill at once later. You're so clever. A tactical genius in the making. This shouldn't be a problem, you've got the plan and the means to execute it! What could go wrong?None of the enemies dodge, you manage to soften up 4 of them enough to where any single ranger can finish them off in your next turn. There's absolutely nothing that could go wrong. Unless... <.<It's the enemy's turn: The weakened enemy attacks your ranger, it's super effective! At least super effective against the enemy, because your ranger decides that of all times he's going to choose this time to do a counter-attack. The softened up enemy dies. Now you only have three softened up enemies, maybe you still have a chance. You'll have 3 rangers kill the 3 softened ones, and your other 2 rangers can double attack some other enemy. Unless... <.<It's still the enemy's turn: Another of the weakened enemies attacks another ranger. You couldn't possibly be so lucky you counter attack again, could you? I dont think I need to say where this is going. You know you're screwed, abort episode and try again.The game could also stand to give some actual info on the stat points. There seems to be no info on the usefulness or effective amounts for Cooldown Cost and Skill Regen. There are other stats as well that have no explanation in the game, and you just have to guess and hope they're worth investing into.If they cut out all of the luck crap, it would be an entertaining turn-based game that actually rewarded you for proper planning. Instead, it's always a roll of the dice.I dont know how many hours Steam will say I've played this game, but my first save file is 11 hours. My second save file says 3 hours. So any beyond that was just wasted time from having to abort episodes.			"

												Chroma Squad is the indie power ranger, an strategy rpg like FF Tactics. Its a unique game that uses props as armors and weapons, its because the story is involving a movie studio. What I like about this game is a mecha fight or megazord fight. No problem with optimization, game run flawlessly, but it lacks of graphic options. Pros:- Mecha fight, standard fight, 1 on 1, basically just hitting a def, atk, or skill button. Its repetitive, but still is a unique concept.- Power ranger theme game, you can choose who will be the rangers from humans to dog. There are also space rangers that you can get when you pick certain choices in the game- Story is OK- Because the game is about making an episodic tv series, you can upgrade your studios, equipping your studios with new and high tech equipments, and ofc you can hire a marketing team, each team has their own perks, to activate these perks you need fans, yep sacrificing your innocent fans to the devil to gain some bonuses. You can gain fans in battle, every action you do will grant you a small amount of fans, you get more if you can fulfill the director's mission (sort of side objectives) everytime you go to do missions.- Finishing move, there are 2 finishing moves here, both of them are executed by positioning your rangers around the enemy and use Teamwork command to finish their turn and the last ranger has to attack the enemy. Pretty neat. - Crafting system, you can craft weapons, armours and robot parts. Fortunately, you can buy materials from the crafting shop, but its randomize though. And unfortunately, you cant grind money or materials in this game. Its kinda hard when doing the challenging difficulty because of this. Cons:- Graphic is bad, really bad. Because of lack graphic options, my rangers has become square rangers. - The weapon I equipped to my rangers are useless aside from the skills attack. I dont know why the dev decided that any equipped weapons cant be used to attack the enemies, but can use their skills. I dont know if its a lack of animation or this is how the game designed the game- Battle system is too simple and unpolished, aside from skill attack from weapons and from level up, there is nothing more. So, battle will become boring after a while.And because I cant grind materials or money, with no means to upgrade your characters, I had a bad time a few times on challenging difficulty. Its not a bad game nor a great game, its OK game. So, I dont recommend this game. If you are a power ranger fan, you're good. If you're a casual, stay away. And if you're an achievement hunter, go for it.			"

												As soon as I played it I IMMEDIATELY knew this had to be the same team behind Knights of pen and paper.If you are buying this expecting it to have some simulation elements or have strong RPG elements then immediately stay away from this game. This development team has sucked me in many times with the premises of their games but they never follow through with this premise.I certainly would have loved a game about making my own Sentai series where my decisions determine not only how popular the show is with the combat being real tactical battles with impressive ""fakey"" special effects with many of its comedic moments being just the sort of crud a studio would pull to save money. Yet that isn't how the game works.Basically to understand the game you take the role of several stunt workers who have decided to make their own ""power ranger"" type show. You achieve this by having random fights at which you are given goals that you must succeed, there is a story but the characters involved mostly speak entirely out of character at all times.In fact that is probably my biggest gripe about the game's comedy is that it has absolutely no grounding. The game makes no attempt to even pretend like there is a show actually being recorded because characters almost never say their proper lines and cannot shut up for a moment about their own special effects or plotting. So some jokes, such as the characters not being able to transform because their costumes are in the cleaners out of show, fall completely flat because it never feels like this is interfering with the show because it just feels like a Larp. Another joke that falls flat is their constant references to their cheap teleportation effects, which would certainly be funny if they didn't constantly refer to it. The comedy could have been this game's saving grace, the nectar that would sustain me through the simplistic combat.Outside of this the vast majority of the game's comedy are references. The majority of them are ""references for reference sake"" rather then folding them seamlessly in the game's comedy.What the game really boils down to is a tactical RPG nothing more and nothing less. The studio runs itself and your decisions are just buffs, you are not the one writing the plot, chosing the opponents, deciding on the scenes. Yet what is there is just the barest of a tactical RPG, in fact if they didn't give you the ludicrous goals at the start of every episode the entire game would be too easy.Yet even in this there are some genuinely good ideas there. Viewership, which you will max a little too quickly, depends on how you fight. Boss monsters for example must be defeated by your finisher otherwise you get a stiff viewership penalty (for obvious reasons) and if you waste a finisher on a boss and don't defeat it? You also get a penalty. Yet even this can come off as forced when you cannot even transform until your viewership is high enough (what is this viewed live?) instead of just allowing the player to carefully contemplate whether taking a penelty is worth it.These goals are usually things like ""defeat all enemies before hurting the boss"" which are decent ones. Yet as you go on they become quite complex requiring you to carefully map out the field. The issue with these isn't that they are difficult, and they are, but that they are the only source of difficulty in this game.You then collect crafting items from ordinary enemies which you can craft into weapons that are usually ""comedic"" so expect a lot of ""Bucket helmets"" and ""Tinfoil swords"". They have their own stats as well as randomized bonus stats based on how good the item is. These are equipped like everything else and to the game's credit all the items show up on your characters.You can get studio upgrades and even marketing using the money you earn on each episode. Marketing for the most part effects the money and viewership of episodes for a small fee. You can also use your viewers to activate additional powers unlocked by that marketing campaign which can easily turn the tide in a fight from easy to rediculously easy. Studio upgrades amount to buffs and bonuses to shooting or to crafting as well as unlocking more items.To shoot you are given a selection of fights you must do, and you will do all of them so don't worry, and then you get into a fight. That is what it amounts to. All the shoots are usually fights with usually the characters chiming in, out of character, about what this episode might be about (as said earlier they barely keep up appearances that they are actually shooting this show).I think what this ultimately boils down to is that this game is a disapointment in every level. It wasn't the game I thought it was going to be. Yet when I tried to like the game, the game actively hurt itself. Its comedy is forced, its tactics bogged down and simplistic, and the game is as linear as heck!For those who are going to buy this as a comedy game, I should state that the trailer for the game is much more funny then anything you are going to find in this game. So watch 30 minutes of an hour of a letsplay and base how ""funny"" it is on that.Get this on sale for 5 bucks! If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat. Also feel free to say this is unhelpful because this review is negative, especially you production crew.-Edit: playing it a bit more, the ""acting in character"" does improve but the comedy still falls flat. Mostly because the Out of character events rarely manifest in character.			"

												What do you get when you cross Heroes of Might & Magic with Power Rangers and a business tycoon simulator? Pretty much this beauty of an 8-bit game. This game combines tactics in two distinctly different ways: The first is managing your indie studio and putting up with all the lawsuits, conspiracy theories, marketing agents, and distinct shortages of PVC and duct tape. The second is the actual green-screen combat with tactical acrobatics, team combos, and all the exploding rainbows a Japanese stuntman hero (or heroine. 10/10 chose Scarlett Johansson as their healer) could ever dream of! There's a lot of humour with terrible acting and some cheeky references across the board, and of course, your very own cardboard Mecha to fight people in suits ravaging the helpless scale model city.Seriously, grab this game. It's the Power Rangers video game the world never knew it needed.			"

												This game fits two types of analysis, one if you are a fan of tokusatsu and another if not.For those who are fans, the game is sensational and very entertaining. It's ok for you to play.For those who are not fans, the game is already very warm and without great attractions within the genre.The graphics are pixel art, but they are far from being well worked.The plot and story development are fun.The gameplay is very easy, you can go straight to hard to have some kind of difficulty.Anyway, it's a good game, but it's far from a great game. Rola close with 10 hours and for those who seek 100% goes about 40 hours.(Tip has 3 possible endings)esse jogo cabe dois tipos de analise, uma se vc é fã de tokusatsu e outra se não.para quem é fã, o jogo é sensacional e bem divertido. vale bastante vc jogar.Para quem não é fã, o jogo já fica bem morno e sem grandes atrativos dentro do genero.Os graficos são pixel art, mas estão bem longe de serem bem trabalhados.O enredo e desenvolvimento da história são divertida.O gameplay é bem facil, pode ir direto para o hard para ter algum tipo de dificuldade.Enfim, é um bom jogo, mas está longe de ser um grande jogo. Rola fechar com umas 10 horas e para quem busca 100% vai umas 40 horas.(dica tem 3 finais possiveis)			"

												A creative tribute to the Tokusatsu genre that many have grown up to or still enjoy. Having team work and acrobatics effect audience levels was an interesting mechanic that allowed to the player to decide on how much of either to do to maximize the attendance to gain more fans/money per episode. The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.Having different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.Storyline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.One thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs. During a level that had a Boss Mob, could have had the minion's designs centered around that particular Boss in the later stages. It's understandable at the beginning since it is representing the beginning stages of a starter company.			"

												I wanted to like this game. The concept of former stuntmen making their own TV studio that you control mixed in with strategy RPG combat was a fresh idea in a landscape full of zombie survival games and minecraft clones. But having just finished the game, it failed to deliver on so many levels.PROS:- Great overall concept.  Run a TV studio while having your stuntment meet certain criteria in strategy RPG battles.- The art style is interesting and has character.  The costumes pay homage to the various costumes seen in shows like Power Rangers.- The music works well enough for what it is.CONS:- The studio management aspect of the game is very under developed.  Most of the choices, from the type of camera you use to the marketing agency that you hire, are shallow and don't offer more than slight bonuses here and there.  For example, you can have your marketing agency put up your actors for an award, but all that will do is increase your fan power, which is used to activate marketing agency policies.- Objectives in battle could have been more varied.  As it is, there are 3 primary objectives that you'll see:  1. Kill X amount of enemies, maybe with Y time; 2. Kill the boss with a team member/team attack/finishing move; 3.  Keep everyone alive/above 50% health.   This is disappointing because, being a TV show that you make, you could have gone with more interesting objectives, especially if you the player could set them.- The writing is not very good.  The story seems to be unsure on whether it wants to play a particular scene straight or comically, and so flip flops between the two extremes awkwardly.  In addition, the story progression is very clunky and poorly executed.- The game is unfunny.  Most of the ""humor"" comes from blatant references to pop culture outside of the genre (such as a Robocop/Tiger hybrid.  That's it, that's the joke), with a smattering of poorly constructed puns to tie it all together.- The localization is not very good.  The game was clearly translated by somebody that does not have very good command of the English language, as much of the text and dialogue just reads wrong to a native English speaker.  Getting a decent writer would fix this and some of the previous issue.			"

												Time to save the world with mild Gymnastics. Chroma Squad is about a small team of stunt men that get sick of thier old boss and deside to start their own Power Rangers like show. The gameplay has you using five different squad members in a grid based arena fighting some waves on enemies and a boss. The game's main difficulty is based on if you choose to the the mission objectives, from hit the boss every turn, win in 5 turns, or finish the boss with a finisher. The game is filled with references that just comes and goes from video games, to pop culture the games has cheesy diologue. The crafting system is somewhat of a mess so I just stick to the shop. The mec combat is bare bone with realy no differences with attacks just the animation that happens. But even with thous complants it acctualy makes the game more true to how a noraml Power Rangers epiosode happens, (story, simple fight, transform, beat boss, boss gets bigger, mec battle, end episode). Overall the campyness and the gameplay make me suggest this game if you have the money and a week end to waist. P.S. The narrirator spells poorly			"

												Normally I'm fairly good at knowing which games I'll enjoy, and this is one of those rare exceptions that I was completely wrong with how I'd react. Halfway through the third act, I found myself floored, how could I not know that a tiny top down team tactics game would be drastically improved with the guise of recklessly cheap 90s nostalgia? For me, this game is like a restaurant, that I ate at for years- to the point where I got physically ill anytime you thought of it. It is this eatery, but years later, when I found out the chef has been indicted for serving criminally poor quality meals, and in some robust campaign I found myself back there, with a free meal coupon, and the new chef personally going out of their way to try and regain my patronage. It takes content from my childhood and under the guise of pointed satire, allowed me to appreciate the beauty of chintzy theatrics.			"

												While it's not the Power Rangers game of my dreams, I found a lot to like about Chroma Squad. I was originally turned off when I found out it was about running a TV show and not actually being Power Rangers, but it actually works. It's full of all the cheesy lines and scenarios fans of the old Power Rangers seasons will like, and people who have stuck with the show can appreciate the love and knowledge of the franchise and it's tropes went into this game. I'm not particularly a fan of strategy games and I'm not really good at them, so I found this game pretty difficult on normal, but fans of the genre might find it too easy. Still, I really enjoyed all of the customization, the multiple storylines, and found the game overall to very enjoyable.			"

												I feel rather disappointed in that I was unaware of this game until long after the Kickstater was met. I'm a fan of sentai series, both american and japanese versions, and I see a lot of genuine love and effort put forth in the game to show off the themes, corny messages & jokes, and tropes that those shows fall into. With that, however, a love of those fanchises is felt through the effort and minor details scattered in the stages, dialogue, and backgrounds. For instance, the statue of JAKQ's 'Big One' in the convention stage or the reference to Doggie Kruger in one of the post-stage tweets. What about the game play? Well, it plays like the tactical RPGs I love (FF Tactics, Disgaea) while still have it's own take and original elements to it. I do wish there was a big more clarity in know what can and can't be done. For example, I didn't know until Episode 3 that I could customize more then the chest of my mech by clicking on the seperate parts. There are some small nuances in the game like that that take me out of the game for a moment as I may have spent my materials differently. Better explanation on fan or income conversion may be nice as well. Overall, I'm very happy with this game and pray the studio learn from this and make their next game bigger and better.			"

												From the soundtrack to the gameplay, this game is gorgeous on every front.   I love everything about it.The customization of your characters is subtle enough to streamline the gameplay but involved enough to make things personal, and give you a reasonable amount of input.  The plot is cheery and interesting, and it even has a quite a few unexpected turns up its sleeves.  Once you hit the turning point things really escalate quickly, and in the best of ways.There is tribute paid to so many legacies that the banter alone would make this game worthwhile to a diehard fan.If you're a fan of Tactical RPG's, it's worth every penny-- and if you're a fan of Super Sentai?

I'm basing it off of just finishing Season 1, but basically you are given director tasks to appease audience, such as defeating X amount of Y monsters in Z amount of turns, or pulling off finishers on bosses which are very satisfying (when you Chromatize)+ THE MUSIC: My lord is this the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time. Kudos to the music makers for making such an amazing soundtrack (looking at you A little break from saving the world)+ Graphics: The graphics is a very vast and colorful pixelated style, and it's very appeasing to the eyes+ Fan System: Considering it's about an indie group trying to run a show, fans play a major role. They determine how much money you get, and that money goes to upgrading equipment which is the only way (as far as I can tell) to increase your stats.Cons:-Crafting Equipment: I'm not knocking off the crafting system, I like it. The only thing that pesters me is that you don't get to see the stat increase or decrease until after you craft it, and once you craft it, you have to hope it does increases with hopefully small decrease in other stats, otherwise you have to recycle it and so far my rng of recycling has been pretty poop.-Options Menu: Totalbiscuit would probably sue me for doing this since that's his thing.. but the option system is kind of lacking. Sure the requirements would allow even my pc which is viewed as being powered by a potatoe could play it, but the resolutions are kind of hard to navigate and change.. for some reason, you have to let the game go full screen, change the resolution (for me I had to click alot to figure out how to make the slider work), then uncheck full screen, and then it'll save the resolution you want (though for those that play full screen all the time it might not be a problem). But hey at least it has a seperate audio slider for both volume and sfx. ^^That's about it. The cool thing is that the company is now doing the long task of fixing many bugs... so it's good that they'll keep updating this game. Heck there's even a button to report bugs. So because of that, so will this reveiw if more changes for the better (or worst) occurs.			"

												I feel rather disappointed in that I was unaware of this game until long after the Kickstater was met. I'm a fan of sentai series, both american and japanese versions, and I see a lot of genuine love and effort put forth in the game to show off the themes, corny messages & jokes, and tropes that those shows fall into. With that, however, a love of those fanchises is felt through the effort and minor details scattered in the stages, dialogue, and backgrounds. For instance, the statue of JAKQ's 'Big One' in the convention stage or the reference to Doggie Kruger in one of the post-stage tweets. What about the game play? Well, it plays like the tactical RPGs I love (FF Tactics, Disgaea) while still have it's own take and original elements to it. I do wish there was a big more clarity in know what can and can't be done. For example, I didn't know until Episode 3 that I could customize more then the chest of my mech by clicking on the seperate parts. There are some small nuances in the game like that that take me out of the game for a moment as I may have spent my materials differently. Better explanation on fan or income conversion may be nice as well. Overall, I'm very happy with this game and pray the studio learn from this and make their next game bigger and better.			"

Not too hard, but not hand-holdingly easy on the normal difficulty, which is perfect for me. The humor is great, and the entire game is super nostalgic and left me feeling nothing but great inside. I found myself smiling at several points of the game, just enjoying all of the little aspects of it.This game is easily my favorite game to come out this year and that I've played this year.

												First of ill just say this game gets 10/10 from me. Got that part out of the way.Pros: (For me at least)+Incredibly good sound track+Vibrant colours and fantastic 16bit (I believe) graphics with fantastic animation+Run your company how you like with choices of marketing, upgrades to your studio and characters+Customized team (You can choose your rangers colours and actors (from a set pool of actors)+Tactical turn based combat+Teamwork skill allowing team members to coordinate between each other during battle+You can personalize your company name, the team name and some of their catchphrases+The Transitmancer+You can have a pink male rangerCons: (Once again personal opinions)-Not as much choice in episodes (missions) (Though for story purposes i understand why)-Not very many robot parts to choose from-Giant robot fights tend to be chance oriented (Which personaly frustrates me at times)I honestly recommend this game if you enjoy tactical turn based combat and or super sentai.I hope we get a sequel or successor to this game.

												Ladies and gentlemen, the ooze is back hello all this is my review for Chroma Squad first off i love this game. This game is very clever at first it feels that you are just making a tv series and it fun but there is more but you got to play to find out.If that dose not get you to play then i going to say this if you watch the power rangers from the past and you went mad with getting the toys playing the games then this will take you back to that days.There are things that i would love to see here maybe in dlc list or in the next game yes i think this game will have many chroma squad games.here is my pro list of the game You get a fun roster to pick you squad like alien, robots and old 90s stars.you get to choose you players colour so for me i had the green squad leader and the red was the tech guy.Story is made by you as you get to film any tv episodes in any order which is fun.Like mass effect the story is not linar you can choose diffdient things and you get diffdient mission to do.There are zoids but called mecha and you get to fight with it to beat your gaint bad guy.The music is so freaking sweet it fun to listen too.now for the con i hope the people who made this don't feel bad about me saying this but as a fan i feel like i should say somethinghere we go.con there is only one finish attack i would like for more maybe a weapon mode like the power ranger did in there 94 days I wanted more mecha and not all the same size i want one like the dragon zoid and many others.i wanted more cutscene as there was awesome which lead to my next con i really wanted something cool to happen for the suit charge like you spent a lot of crash making the suit for your team and you get nothing new really just go oh new suit but that it.The end credit scene is bad ok you made the end cutscene a nightmare only reason i spend so long click on the (...) bar was i thought why would you put this in if you had nothing after the cedits maybe next time add a save after the cedits so we don't have to do the long clicking thing.The second life big boss battle mode to me i wish there could of been more like a test of stength thing and seeing bulding blow up.that all folks i do hope there are more around the corner to come i do hope you enjoy the game.I do hope there make a movie verson of the game too and i also hope you make other games too maybe a godzilla game as i would to see you guys do that keep them keeping boys i will end saying this chroma squad is the power ranger mass effect it that good.

The only flaw is the games story is just as casual as the difficult. towards the end the characters even start calling it a game, and on one occasion a npc hacks into the game.			"

												This game is precisely what it appears to be: You run your own ""Power Rangers"" type TV studio, beat up monsters, gain fans, and have giant robot battles. It's a little simplistic, but the first time you find yourself shouting your customized battle cry before a finishing move you will not care. I'm hoping for some mods that let us get deeper into the management: Create your own Big Bads, write some custom lines, set up your own battles, create some custom minions. With improvements like these, I could see this game having a long lasting future.In the man time, it is still completely worth it.

												This game was really fun, and it taught me the about the power of friendship and teamwork. It is a great tribute to the Power Rangers and all Sentai, but also stands on its own as a turn based strategy.The game is very satirical and at times a bit meta, but it's just to keep things light hearted. I had so much fun crafting new armor and weapons to go along with each team members powers (which get cooler every season you beat). There are plenty of spelling errors, bad grammar and bad puns. You will also find yourself in stereotypical locations and plot devices from the series such as ""The Park"" or ""ranger feels bad for hurting the groups feelings somehow"".I only wish the game was harder. On Interesting difficulty I never lost a ground battle, and I only repeated a few Mecha battles (yes of course there is a giant robot) because I hadn't figured out the crafting system yet.Overall great game, 9/10			"

												8/10""Great gameplay along with nostalgic references, couple of tweeks to mecha combat needed and more diverse storylines wouldnt hurt""I picked this game up based on the theme and overall design and i am so glad i did! Brilliant references to 90's culture and an interesting tactical RPG combat system make this game very enjoyable. The scenario is you are stunt performers of a super sentai show who decide to make it on your own by kickstarting your own, the plot then twists from what is a tv show with stunt actors to then turn into something alot more real. The game gives you full control over your cast, studio and many other things which makes this game very interesting and different from the norm. With your team of 5 unique classes you can take down foes with a variety of unique moves or work together and form devastating combo attacks. The fact each character is a certain class is a great idea keeping you thinking about what form of attack you will make that will benefit the battle in the long run. Your characters strengths can also be upgraded with an interesting upgrade system, with a shop you can spend program revenue with to buy stronger equipment or a crafting system in which you can create equipment with drops or purchased materials to help make your characters or mecha stronger. As far as the mecha is concerned it is perhaps the weakest part of this brilliant title, although it feels incredible the first couple of times it happens the tactical tile RPG suddenly turns into a 2D fighting mechanic that feels as though it relies on luck far too often. Your accuracy ratio reduces the number of successful hits you make in the same turn, there were times however where i would hit once have an 85% hit chance and miss finishing my combo. i understand it can happen sometimes but it happened alot more than it probably should have. It made it more frustrating given the fact the enemy monster had the same attack pattern which never missed and then could also do a super attack every few turns made some of these duels long, repetitive and rather frustrating. I feel if the mecha combat was still a tile combat system where you fight in the city it could be made a lot more interesting, whats to say your viewer rating could go down based on the number of detroyed buildings via combat, or using the environment to your advantage. It would certainly make the currently bland mecha combat into something a bit more interesting. The story structure is set in a number of series in which the goal is to increase your fanbase and revenue by putting on an awesome show. You are also in charge of advertising and the studio which can be upgraded to help with the show. The idea of seperate series is great and makes the game into more bitesize chuncks that open up possibilities of extra content later on. With multiple endings the game does have replay value and the episodes in each season can be played in any order desired. The enemy designs are fantastic and some of the stories are great but perhaps more of a mixup with different scenarios would only benefit the game more, party members could be missing or sub objectives could be more diverse with perhaps saving civilians or dealing with environmental scenarios. This does happen sometimes but maybe not enough.The soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to and keeps the tempo going. it plays very well along with the artistic style of the game.Overall the game is a great experience, especially if you are a power rangers/super sentai fan with some great story and combat design and an interesting yet simple upgrade system and tle based RPG combat. More diverse storylines and some work on the mecha battles would only do this game good! If they bring out more content as well this game could be played long into the future. "

												Chroma Squad was if anything a blast from the past. The retro graphics, mixed with the power rangers theme brought me back to my childhood. A simpler time. A tactical RPG where you have your own custom power ranger team, you can name the rangers, the team, even choose colors. You also run a studio, purchasing upgrades, signing advertisement contracts, and crafting new gear for the rangers. The script is funny at times, and goofy dumb at others but you'll love it just the same. I clocked in at about 11-12 hours over a couple weeks on normal difficulty.			"

												Time to save the world with mild Gymnastics. Chroma Squad is about a small team of stunt men that get sick of thier old boss and deside to start their own Power Rangers like show. The gameplay has you using five different squad members in a grid based arena fighting some waves on enemies and a boss. The game's main difficulty is based on if you choose to the the mission objectives, from hit the boss every turn, win in 5 turns, or finish the boss with a finisher. The game is filled with references that just comes and goes from video games, to pop culture the games has cheesy diologue. The crafting system is somewhat of a mess so I just stick to the shop. The mec combat is bare bone with realy no differences with attacks just the animation that happens. But even with thous complants it acctualy makes the game more true to how a noraml Power Rangers epiosode happens, (story, simple fight, transform, beat boss, boss gets bigger, mec battle, end episode). Overall the campyness and the gameplay make me suggest this game if you have the money and a week end to waist. P.S. The narrirator spells poorly			"

												Well-executed tactics game with a variety of mechanics to play around with. Rough around the edges and mostly lacking meaningful dialogue, but it brings some new ideas to the table and I really enjoyed my time with it.I like the goofy, happy-go-lucky attitude and the deliberately corny special effects even though I've never had any interest in sentai shows.

												Chroma Squad is an outstanding tactical RPG that I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and a ton of other live action hero shows. The game clocks in about 15 hours (give or take) to complete one play through and is loaded with a ton of fan service and pop culture references that keep you constantly hyped and laughing throughout your journey. The blend of simulation and RPG is where the game truly shines and feels unique. You aren't only creating your dream Sentai team, you are a part of the show!On the tactical side, the game does not get very complex, and I found the game to be quite a breeze on Normal, but honestly, that's okay. A game does not need to be hard as hell in order to be fun. However, I will note that as hype as the Mecha battles are they are pretty one sided and easy to complete most of the time. From the perspective of a fan of Sentai it makes total sense and you feel awesome beating up Kaiju for the sake of justice, but the above mentioned simplicity is why I couldn't recommend the game to someone just looking for a Tactical RPG fix. Though I would say at the very least look up some footage and if you are open minded enough you might really enjoy it anyways! Might even get you interested into Sentai etc.Chroma Squad as it is may have relatively simple combat, crafting and business simulation but I strongly feel like that's the entire point of the game. The game doesn't just want you to create a Sentai show, it wants you to be the hero! So what are you waiting for? Get out there and deliver some justice! And don't forget to shout a cheesy line like ""Justice is best served in a rainbow of colors!"" It doesn't have to make sense, as long as you do a cool pose while saying it you'll be FINE.Pros•	High replayability•	Fan service...fan service everywhere!•	Incredible soundtrack•	Amazing retro graphicsCons•	Individual aspects of the game are simple•	Left me begging for more customization. (perhaps we might see more in updates)•	A few annoying bugs, but patches should be coming in quite soon9/10			"

												This game was really fun, and it taught me the about the power of friendship and teamwork. It is a great tribute to the Power Rangers and all Sentai, but also stands on its own as a turn based strategy.The game is very satirical and at times a bit meta, but it's just to keep things light hearted. I had so much fun crafting new armor and weapons to go along with each team members powers (which get cooler every season you beat). There are plenty of spelling errors, bad grammar and bad puns. You will also find yourself in stereotypical locations and plot devices from the series such as ""The Park"" or ""ranger feels bad for hurting the groups feelings somehow"".I only wish the game was harder. On Interesting difficulty I never lost a ground battle, and I only repeated a few Mecha battles (yes of course there is a giant robot) because I hadn't figured out the crafting system yet.Overall great game, 9/10			"

Went into it, expecting Fire Emblem and Power Rangers. And got pretty much that. Also lost like 6 hours and it's now 4 in the morning because THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTING. 10/10. But it for your kids. Buy it for your dog. Don't buy it for your dog. Buy it for your dog twice. Perfect. I wish I had more money to throw at developers. Not even just for the soundtrack. I honestly believe this game is worth more than the (around) 14 dosh I payed for it. Music is so catchy, and almost makes me feel like I'm watching Power Rangers as a kid again at times. Dialogue is catchy and clever. Only on like the 4th season (chapter) and the story is already so solid. Take notes other developers, this a good♥♥♥♥♥game.			"

												A power rangers inspire strategy fighter. The pixelated artstyle is fantastic, the humour is brilliant, the music is so very fitting.The story is about a group of disgruntled stunt actors forming their own studio to produce a power ranger/ super sentai series without network interfierence. The story is played out in episodes and seasons, with the studio inbetween for upgrades, equipment, ability management and mecha construction. Each customisable character has their own abilities and personality, fights have a big reliance on team-work and the more stunts and team attacks and director instructions you pull off, the bigger audience you get, which nets you more money, more marketing and a bonus later on.I highly recommend it to anyone even vaguely interested!

												Ok so the game starts off a little bleh with a Tutorial but right after that it takes you into a really fun story. I'm not a huge Power Ranger fan but this game drew my eyes quickly. I love the team based combat and the idea of a simulation of running your studio.I just finished making my first season of the series and now have an deacent size fan base. Also haveing a good company advertising for you is a major plus as you try to make your way through the seasons.Also lets you customize and craft items that you get after you kill enimies as well as customize your own Robot.(ARC SQUAD UNITE!!!) I highly recommend this game looking for a tatic style RPG/SIMULATOR then look no further I'm so happy I picked this game up and I will very willingly say this game could be the one your looking for. I rate this game 8/10 and I really think everyone thats intreasted in these genre's are in for a treat scoop it up and give it a shot! "

												Well I don't know HOW nor WHY i love this game....but i do... You may be wondering: Why would you hate this game? Well it's not the power ranger theme cause i loved the show when i was a kid; no it's the fact i hate, and i mean ""hate with a burning passion that wishes the genre to die out and never return"" hate, tile based stratagy games...but when i played this...when i started playing Chroma Squad...something was VERY different. The fights never over stay their welcome in the easy mode, the challenge of the higher difficulties are fairly noticable (though they need to stop fixing what was already a good game), and it's just fun to make up your own power rangers team name and special lines. the upgrading system is all based on the items you buy or craft so you be really tanky or deal ALL the damage. my only issue is the craftable armours and weapons aren't as good as the shop items thanks to RNG-ness deciding if the weapon has an attack buff at all and lator shop items tend to be weaker in weapon but not in attack base making more about using your basic attack then anything else but it's sad saying even THAT is better then hoping to get a good weapon via craft... It's a great game despite that and for someone who hates ""Move guy to enemy to attack them"" styled fights that's saying something!			"

												8/10""Great gameplay along with nostalgic references, couple of tweeks to mecha combat needed and more diverse storylines wouldnt hurt""I picked this game up based on the theme and overall design and i am so glad i did! Brilliant references to 90's culture and an interesting tactical RPG combat system make this game very enjoyable. The scenario is you are stunt performers of a super sentai show who decide to make it on your own by kickstarting your own, the plot then twists from what is a tv show with stunt actors to then turn into something alot more real. The game gives you full control over your cast, studio and many other things which makes this game very interesting and different from the norm. With your team of 5 unique classes you can take down foes with a variety of unique moves or work together and form devastating combo attacks. The fact each character is a certain class is a great idea keeping you thinking about what form of attack you will make that will benefit the battle in the long run. Your characters strengths can also be upgraded with an interesting upgrade system, with a shop you can spend program revenue with to buy stronger equipment or a crafting system in which you can create equipment with drops or purchased materials to help make your characters or mecha stronger. As far as the mecha is concerned it is perhaps the weakest part of this brilliant title, although it feels incredible the first couple of times it happens the tactical tile RPG suddenly turns into a 2D fighting mechanic that feels as though it relies on luck far too often. Your accuracy ratio reduces the number of successful hits you make in the same turn, there were times however where i would hit once have an 85% hit chance and miss finishing my combo. i understand it can happen sometimes but it happened alot more than it probably should have. It made it more frustrating given the fact the enemy monster had the same attack pattern which never missed and then could also do a super attack every few turns made some of these duels long, repetitive and rather frustrating. I feel if the mecha combat was still a tile combat system where you fight in the city it could be made a lot more interesting, whats to say your viewer rating could go down based on the number of detroyed buildings via combat, or using the environment to your advantage. It would certainly make the currently bland mecha combat into something a bit more interesting. The story structure is set in a number of series in which the goal is to increase your fanbase and revenue by putting on an awesome show. You are also in charge of advertising and the studio which can be upgraded to help with the show. The idea of seperate series is great and makes the game into more bitesize chuncks that open up possibilities of extra content later on. With multiple endings the game does have replay value and the episodes in each season can be played in any order desired. The enemy designs are fantastic and some of the stories are great but perhaps more of a mixup with different scenarios would only benefit the game more, party members could be missing or sub objectives could be more diverse with perhaps saving civilians or dealing with environmental scenarios. This does happen sometimes but maybe not enough.The soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to and keeps the tempo going. it plays very well along with the artistic style of the game.Overall the game is a great experience, especially if you are a power rangers/super sentai fan with some great story and combat design and an interesting yet simple upgrade system and tle based RPG combat. More diverse storylines and some work on the mecha battles would only do this game good! If they bring out more content as well this game could be played long into the future. "

												Summary: The game is great only hindered by some difficulty issues and minor bugs. The games story and graphics are fantastic. Upgrading is satisfying and also takes a lot of thinking. Combat takes strategy and is near flawless, for the most part aside from the Mech battles difficulty spike.Lengthy-er Review: Combat is great, it takes a lot of strategy of what combinations of teamwork, and skills to boost your audience meter. The game lets you customize what your squads name is, transforming motto, and actor names. This makes the game feel way more your own and adds a lot of depth. The story is silly and over-the-top enough to feel very Sentai-like. The ""hub"" where you buy upgrades and items is another fantastic aspect of the game. Buying new items and mech parts, along with buying new marketers who can bring you special benefits depending on which person you sign a contract with. Replying to fan emails was also a joy to do. Now onto the cons. Mech fights are incredibly challenging even on normal mode, it took me NUMEROUS times to defeat most makes in the final 2 seasons. Mech fights also lack strategy and ends up mostly being dependent on luck. For example, for each punch you start off around 90% chance to hit, then goes down to around 80% for the next punch, and so on. Problem is healing skills require you to get around a 4x combo of punches to do any real healing, and so does the +Def move. It is nearly impossible to get consistent 4x combo, myself rarely even getting 3x combos. Even with that decent sized flaw it doesn't take away too much from the game, it is still fantastic and charming. All the pro's easily out weigh the cons.Rating: 9/10 "

This game is very clever at first it feels that you are just making a tv series and it fun but there is more but you got to play to find out.If that dose not get you to play then i going to say this if you watch the power rangers from the past and you went mad with getting the toys playing the games then this will take you back to that days.There are things that i would love to see here maybe in dlc list or in the next game yes i think this game will have many chroma squad games.here is my pro list of the game You get a fun roster to pick you squad like alien, robots and old 90s stars.you get to choose you players colour so for me i had the green squad leader and the red was the tech guy.Story is made by you as you get to film any tv episodes in any order which is fun.Like mass effect the story is not linar you can choose diffdient things and you get diffdient mission to do.There are zoids but called mecha and you get to fight with it to beat your gaint bad guy.The music is so freaking sweet it fun to listen too.now for the con i hope the people who made this don't feel bad about me saying this but as a fan i feel like i should say somethinghere we go.con there is only one finish attack i would like for more maybe a weapon mode like the power ranger did in there 94 days I wanted more mecha and not all the same size i want one like the dragon zoid and many others.i wanted more cutscene as there was awesome which lead to my next con i really wanted something cool to happen for the suit charge like you spent a lot of crash making the suit for your team and you get nothing new really just go oh new suit but that it.The end credit scene is bad ok you made the end cutscene a nightmare only reason i spend so long click on the (...) bar was i thought why would you put this in if you had nothing after the cedits maybe next time add a save after the cedits so we don't have to do the long clicking thing.The second life big boss battle mode to me i wish there could of been more like a test of stength thing and seeing bulding blow up.that all folks i do hope there are more around the corner to come i do hope you enjoy the game.I do hope there make a movie verson of the game too and i also hope you make other games too maybe a godzilla game as i would to see you guys do that keep them keeping boys i will end saying this chroma squad is the power ranger mass effect it that good.

												A nice charming game, for those who like the super sentai/power ranger series'.Felt a great deal of nostalgia and humour. Liked the freedom of customisation in many aspects of the game. Fun Soundtrack.However an undo button would be nice for those who are new to the game, but this was only a minor nitpick.Overall, fun game. :D			"

												Henshin!Holy cow, is this game awesome.  The game is deep and strategic, and the tongue-in-cheek humor will please anyone who is a fan of TV, sentai or otherwise.  I'm only a few hours in, and the level you can customize characters in the game is already astonishing.  I can't wait to see what's in store for my super team in the coming seasons.  I recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs, Strategy, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, Humor, or any of the above.Now if you'll excuse me...Cerebro is calling with a new mission!  Tenshin-Da!			"

												A game the 90s kid in you who watched every single Saban shows have always dreamed of.Chroma Squad is an enjoyable tactic RPG and management game for a strategy player to to get into.  The art style, humor and music really fit the tone for this affectionate parody to sentai shows.  The customization/management portions of the game gives the player a sense of ""creative control"" over the presentation of the show they are creating.  The referential tone is similar to Knights of Pen & Paper, as in every tropes applied in a sentai show (both in real life and in story) are addressed in a comedic light.In short, GET THIS GAME IT IS MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!!!!!!

												Chroma Squad was if anything a blast from the past. The retro graphics, mixed with the power rangers theme brought me back to my childhood. A simpler time. A tactical RPG where you have your own custom power ranger team, you can name the rangers, the team, even choose colors. You also run a studio, purchasing upgrades, signing advertisement contracts, and crafting new gear for the rangers. The script is funny at times, and goofy dumb at others but you'll love it just the same. I clocked in at about 11-12 hours over a couple weeks on normal difficulty.			"

												This game may have been released too soon. Once it's fully bug tested and no longer freezes during the interminably long last mission (which I finished after 7 attempts and two weeks), this game is a 4/5. As it stands, with these glitches, it's a 2/5. Positives:- The idea is well thought out and utilized. - The main RPG game is fun and entertaining, and fairly deep. - The fourth wall breaks and overall sense of humor are fun. - Customization- you can change your team's name and their various battle cries. These make the in game dialogue awesome at times. (No, Bill, of course you're as important as anyone else in Sakura and the Rest!) I'd like more costume choices, but what's there is fine. Negatives:- The mecha missions are incredibly dull, since it always comes down to the same exact fight (punch punch punch punch special. Click to lesson damage. Click to lessen damage. Click to lessen damage. Punch punch punch punch block.) A few of the enemies have very slow animation that makes the battles even MORE interminable, especially the Barney parody. I changed the mecha summoning catch phrase to ""Let's Get This Over With!"" I seriously dreaded them every time. - Glitches. These are the game's current biggest issue. They seem to be clearing up, but they kept me from finishing the last mission for two weeks, which destroyed the game's momentum and my interest in pursuing the other alternate endings. Buyer beware. - The last mission. There's a plot twist in that last mission that changes who the villain is that makes it less satisfying. I didn't get the final battle I REALLY wanted. Overall, this game is a lot of fun and incredibly imaginative. Once it's fully polished, I recommend it. Just check out the community board before buying and make sure that things have been cleared up.			"

												Ever want to make pretend and create your own 'Power Rangers' inspired TV show while actively fighting your way through the story? Well with Chroma Squad you get that chance! Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG inspired by the 'Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' where you get to buy all your set equipment, outfit your heroes with new cardboard armor and weapons, and fight evil villains. All with the help and guidance of CEREBRO! (Cerebro is a floaty brain much like Zordon!) I played through the tutorial and the first ""episode"" of Chroma Squad and it was delightful and full of nostalgia. You are a group of stuntmen(and ladies) that leave a show much like the Power Rangers and decide to go off on your own to make your own show! So you are given access to a warehouse which you use as a studio to try and create a better show.With tactical rpg elements like upgrading your actors skills, costumes and weapons, you increase their stats like a regular rpg. However, you are creating a TV show. So you must also spend the money you earn to upgrade your studio, lighting, cameras and a number of other things.The goal here is to keep your fanbase happy and create the best show you can. Here's my first look! (Still uploading it's so fresh)

												This game is precisely what it appears to be: You run your own ""Power Rangers"" type TV studio, beat up monsters, gain fans, and have giant robot battles. It's a little simplistic, but the first time you find yourself shouting your customized battle cry before a finishing move you will not care. I'm hoping for some mods that let us get deeper into the management: Create your own Big Bads, write some custom lines, set up your own battles, create some custom minions. With improvements like these, I could see this game having a long lasting future.In the man time, it is still completely worth it. Jump in and start singing along with the Chroma Squad theme song now!			"

												ChromaSquad is a fantastic Tactical RPG where you create your very own team of Sentai Warriors. Customizeable to a great level, you can choose your team, each color, team name, catch-phrases, craft your own armor and Mech pieces and more! While simple in mechanics it is noting to sneeze at as it keeps you pumped for the next episode and what may be around the corner.~I wish to extend a cordial THANK YOU to the creators of ChromaSquad. It has been a good while since I've immersed myself so deeply into a game. And the absolute charm, fun and personality this game had to offer had me smiling ALL the way through. Right after finishing it I had to start over as it is simply too much fun! And I plan to play your other games and see what more Behold Studios has to offer. <3			"

												I will recommend this game to anyone is a fan of RPG who wants a fun experience without having to spend too much money but to me the game is worth more than there selling it at as a fan of Power Rangers and Super Sentai this game is one of the best times I have had with a game and will be in my top 5 games of this year. It has a interesting and complex combat which will seem simple at a first look but has a hidden complexity with the audience to impress. The game has very loose and meta humour so if that’s not your thing the story may be confusing and annoying.If there any negatives in my opinion is that you cannot customize the characters and Mecha much. The mecha battle don't add to the audience bar. The update crafting system is improved from the earlier versions but ends up being more difficult to use and I found myself using the store. The final problem is that every time you start a new camping you have to go through the tutorial and due to this makes the beginning of the game a grind.Even with these problems I love this game and its really worth a go and I am going to end buying it again for Playstation 4 but if you don't feel like buying I am betting on it being a Playstation Plus game or a least small discount even if in my case I feel the game is cheap all ready.

												Chroma Squad is an outstanding tactical RPG that I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and a ton of other live action hero shows. The game clocks in about 15 hours (give or take) to complete one play through and is loaded with a ton of fan service and pop culture references that keep you constantly hyped and laughing throughout your journey. The blend of simulation and RPG is where the game truly shines and feels unique. You aren't only creating your dream Sentai team, you are a part of the show!On the tactical side, the game does not get very complex, and I found the game to be quite a breeze on Normal, but honestly, that's okay. A game does not need to be hard as hell in order to be fun. However, I will note that as hype as the Mecha battles are they are pretty one sided and easy to complete most of the time. From the perspective of a fan of Sentai it makes total sense and you feel awesome beating up Kaiju for the sake of justice, but the above mentioned simplicity is why I couldn't recommend the game to someone just looking for a Tactical RPG fix. Though I would say at the very least look up some footage and if you are open minded enough you might really enjoy it anyways! Might even get you interested into Sentai etc.Chroma Squad as it is may have relatively simple combat, crafting and business simulation but I strongly feel like that's the entire point of the game. The game doesn't just want you to create a Sentai show, it wants you to be the hero! So what are you waiting for? Get out there and deliver some justice! And don't forget to shout a cheesy line like ""Justice is best served in a rainbow of colors!"" It doesn't have to make sense, as long as you do a cool pose while saying it you'll be FINE.Pros•	High replayability•	Fan service...fan service everywhere!•	Incredible soundtrack•	Amazing retro graphicsCons•	Individual aspects of the game are simple•	Left me begging for more customization. (perhaps we might see more in updates)•	A few annoying bugs, but patches should be coming in quite soon9/10			"

												Third game in the series (after Knights of Pen and Paper and KoPaP2) is definitely an improvement. Nonetheless, the pacing feels slow, the character customization limited, and upon succeeding I rarely felt like I'd been particularly clever, but more that I had exploited poor AI and strange mechanics. The attempt at a humorous plot line is also incredibly painful -- as much as I wanted to like it, the writing is abysmal. That said, there are some well-done elements. Acquiring points by piling on certain mechanics (rather than by being brutally efficient in dispatching enemies) to unlock power-ups lead to some of the more interesting tactical decisions, and the crafting system occasionally presented a tough choice. In another couple games, this dev team could be the talk of indie gaming, but not yet.			"

												Chroma Squad is a turn-based, tactics RPG from Behold Studios. Let’s get rocking.The GoodThe Power Rangers were a huge part of my childhood. I’m not talking about the newer, crappier Power Ranger series’, I’m talking about the original that started in 93. The Red Ranger was on of my idols as a child. Chroma Squad has all the same Power Rangers vibes in all the right ways.The story is not what I expected it to be. While I was ready to dive headfirst into a tactical, turn-based Power Rnagers styled game, I was surprised to find that I was diving into a tactical, turn-based you’re playing as stuntmen filming a Power Rangers styled show game. Total curve ball. That’s what I get for not watching the trailer beforehand. I’m still trying to figure out how I missed it.Gameplay is simple, but not too simple. There’s the right amount of everything for you to take into consideration while you’re in the heat of battle.The music is great and the dialog is actually pretty funny.The BadI’ve got nothing here. Move along, please.The MehIt’s not actually the Power Rangers.Verdict: YeaIs this a game you should get? If you like turn-based tactical games, then yes. If you watched Power Rangers at any point in your life and enjoyed it, then very yes. If you can get it on sale, even better.			"

												A tactics game where you play as a Power Rangers TV studio. Game is split up into episodes (where you do battle) and in between episodes you spend your cash/craft upgrades. It has a silly story with silly enemies and plot. Story is mostly told through dialogue so doesn't get very deep. A lot of 'just because' reasoning so you have to go with the flow. Things that happen outside dialogue are often just quickly summed up by the narrator to set the scene. Graphics are good enough and sound fits well.Episodes are often split up into 1-3 tactics battle segments and sometimes finished off with a mecha battle. The tactics system is pretty standard and simple. There are only damage and status effects, no damage types (no physical vs magic attack, no elemental resistance/weakness). The mecha battle is a regular RPG slugfest where you take turns attacking each other. You can do multiple actions in your turn and each action builds up your combo meter (which increases the effect of your next action but decreases the accuracy). In normal mode, the enemy mecha usually just does 3 regular attacks one special attack. You reduce damage taken through a timing minigame (there's a bar that fills up, stop it at the right time and you block more damage).It feels like you want mecha battles to be over as soon as possible so it feels better to go for as many 50%+ accuracy attacks as you can rather than ever defending. It seems like enemies usually do 3 attacks of ~5k damage each and defending (maybe unless you go for max defense) only blocks a total of ~5k of that. It feels like a race against the clock so the less turns you take to defeat the mecha, the less turns the enemy has to deal 15k+ damage.However, it does get a little frustrating when you miss your 2nd attack (~85% accuracy) twice in a row, which is brutal because of your missed damage output (especially if you're holding onto your finisher for a high combo) and it means you take free rounds of damage. But I guess that's why there's the mecha audience meter (DBZ spirit bomb-esque gathering the energy of your fans). When you lose all hp in a mecha fight, your hp meter refills with audience points (though losing hp from then on doesn't seem to affect audience score later). Assumably, the more fans you have the more HP you get.In tactics battles, your performance is calculated by an audience meter which goes up through combat actions and by following the episode's director's instructions (which are bonus objectives like 'win in 5 turns' or 'keep all members above 50% health). In normal difficulty, clearing missions wasn't too hard but clearing them while following the director's instructions was sometimes pretty challenging. However, you don't need to do every instruction to max out your audience meter and it doesn't seem like failing them matters if you fill the meter anyway.Boss enemies sometimes have line attacks but they feel unpredictable. The attacks don't hit a standard grid-based area (not clean 45 degree directions) so it's more realistic but you can't tell what it'll hit. One boss has a burst aoe (starting from himself) that usually hits allies hidden behind other allies but there were rare times where it didn't (only the one in front got hit). Sometimes the cubes served as cover, sometimes his attack hit despite the cube being in the way. Maybe there is no such thing as cover and it just randomly misses without showing the 'miss' text. He burst twice in the same spot on one turn and hit 2 on the first and all 5 on the second.The only real indicator I could see of how much damage you'd do is the enemy health bar (which shows how much remaining hp would be left after the attack). It can be a little tough to see if an attack really finishes it off or if there's a pixel left. It would've been nice to see an obvious indicator (like the bar turning gray) to show the attack should finish off the opponent.Alternatively, you could check your attack stat for how much damage you'd do (only for single attacks; I'm not sure how teamwork attacks affect damage).Seems to let you retry missions relatively easily (via abandon mission) so if you like to retry there's no need to quit/restart the game. If you don't, then you can personally choose to make your own hardcore mode by accepting whatever result you get. It's pretty nice for me because you go into episodes without knowing what you're really up against so you can abandon and customize/upgrade as necessary so you can beat the mission. Also, some director's instructions (mission goals) can be ruined by unfortunate events outside your control.It allows you to fast forward through cutscenes which is very nice. However, it sometimes speeds through the first text bubble even when I didn't intentionally click or skip through. It may have captured a click several seconds before during a cutscene or something. It would be nice to also have animation speed options in settings to make quicken actions and be able to fast forward in-battle quips.[Side note: why is 'go' and 'fas' blocked by steam? Wanted to type 'go' and 'faster']Other thoughts: One tactic is to pull back and give a turn to let the enemies chase you, often clumping together for aoe skills. Audience bonuses from marketing may not count towards the audience meter cap (meaning if you max out the meter it still counts as a bonus towards the cash/fan conversion). Would be nice to have that cleared up in-game. Mostly polished but there are some quirks. Dialogue bubble gets cut off in one sewer scene, breath->breathe typo. Seems like some e-mails don't deduct the right amount of cash? I know some options say they'll cost a certain amount but are reduced but those mention it in the reply. At hotdog stand battle, it feels like there's a minion that comes in on the left side that doesn't get placed on the map? When you have a flat +fan modifier at end of battle, it still shows as per 100 in the tooltip (you have +175 fans per episode but it shows as 175 fan conversion per 100 audience) Seems like you're supposed to lose audience when a party member is downed but it either doesn't work properly (audience bar visually is reduced but actual number isn't) or there's a hidden buffer you get by overfilling the audience meter. Seems like Tammy is supposed to get into the mecha (and sometimes she teleports with the rest) but they didn't make a new cockpit image, still only 5 people. Although normally fine, sometimes I had a little visual lag/frame skips when blocking in a mecha fight, making it hard to time blocks properly.Worth a try if you like the theme (a studio making episodes of Power Rangers) and are fine with simple tactics games. I don't think I would like it as much if it were a generic tactics game (the combat system isn't very deep) but I think they play up to the theme very well. Reminds me of Punch Club (silly story, good-enough game) though I think I enjoyed this experience more.			"

												Wow, all I can say is ""Wow!!""This game appeals to the part of me that remembers almost missing the bus often in 2nd grade trying to stay inside to watch as much Power Rangers as I could.It's a bright, more simple version of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Tactics, etc.  You play as stun actors who after dealing with an insulting, arrogant director realize they have the passion and talent to make their own show instead of being doing the hard stunt work and letting actors soak up the screen the rest of the time.From there, you manage your own studio, making decisions about fan interaction, marketing, managing crafting materials (used for building your own costume parts as well as eventually creating your mecha suit, yeah, it's as awesome as it sounds)The game's story is clever anc cute and as of Season 3, seems to be building to more of an interesting story than I would have ever expected from what was seemingly a simple game (sure, it's got the basic tropes you've seen before, but they're done right and they provide a context that serves it's purpose and frames the fighting well)I get it. I get why the reviews are so good: great game, great exectution, interesting concept that appeals to something that was likely a part of many of our childhood's.Grab it.  I got it free from a good buddy who had an extra key from a bundle, but had I known what a true gem this is I'd have bought it up already.Seriously, get it, get it, get it, get it.  Manage your studio, prepare your mecha, and CHROMATIZE MOTHA♥♥♥♥AS!!!!			"

The game relies a lot on Power Rangers nostalgia and poking fun at the genre's various quirks and tropes.			"

												Finally finished the game (after having to re-start because my previous save bugged out due to having start a day before official release). I cannot wait to start doing this game over again (likely with a different path and a new ending) for my Drunk Play channel.The sound, the game play, the nostalgia. All very good.Only negative thing I'd point out is how the crafting system is now 100% random. You can't go to the store and buy crafting materials to get the crafted items you want. Now you buy a box of random items and if you're not lucky, you could end up never being able to craft better items (or at least Season level items) to up your game for the next battle. Can get a little bit annoying. But you should end up doing just fine in the end.TenNaddaTen. Will save the world again.			"

												Chroma Squad is an amazing game where you delve into the makings of a Super Sentai studio. It's like a business tycoon, a tactical RPG, and a customization rainbow stuffed into an amazing masterpiece of a sandwich!I honestly can't remember how I stumbled across this gem, but when I saw it, I fell in love with it and I had to have it. I'm glad that I did stumble acorss this, 'cuz I've had the funnest time playing Chroma Squad, the most enjoyable game I've come across in a while. In the first week of owning it, this game was what I'd play every night if I wasn't busy. It's extremely addicting, and while the story seems to start out at a good pace, things escalate quickly later on, providing great plot twists that keep the story immensely interesting.With those opening comments out of the way, let's list the pros and cons.Pros:~A great level of customization with a plethora of actors, colors, and equipment to choose from, heck, even the mechs have a good level of customization.~A great soundtrack. I persoanlly am a big fan of the 8-bit/chiptune style of music, it reminds of the days of arcades and gameboys. Any chiptune lover would listen to the soundtrack over and over again. If you like the music, get the reasonably priced soundtrack. Not only does it help support the devs, but you get to listen to your favorite groovy tunes from the game anytime you want.~Cool graphics. if you like these kinds of pixely games or pixel art in general, this is a game for you.~The storyline. I've said it before: It's interesting with a great pace.~The play time. It took me about 22 hours to get through my first playthrough of the game, on the normal difficulty setting. And that's just for one of 3 endings that the game has to offer. Depending on the difficlty level you're playing and the time spent jamming out to the music, the time to get all the endings can range from 50 hours to 70 hours. Great amount of gameplay.~The achievements. There's not hundreds of them like their are in other games, and most of them are pretty easy to get, you just need to play the game accordingly. I got over half the achievements on my first playthrough. (Though I guess they could add some ones in the future that require DLC.) If you're not an achievement hunter, that's all right, it could just be a fun side quest. This game has enough play-achievement balance that you don't need to dedicate hundreds of hours to get all of them.~Difficalty settings. This is always a great feature to have in a game. The difficulties are casual, interesting, and challenging, ehich translates to easy, normal, hard respectively. If you're new to this type of game and/or want to focus on the story, play the game on casual. If you've played these games before and like a nice balance of story and challenge, interesting's your cuppa joe. If you like a challenge, like good planning, and you aren't afraid to lose a little to win a little, challenging is just the right fit.~Nice balance of battle and management. Not only do you fight with your heroes, you need to check and maintain their gear in order to beat the enemies that get more difficult as time progresses, as well as answer emails from fans, manage production companies, and upgrade your small warehouse studio as time goes on.~A great price. This game is relatively well priced, and will provide hours of fun and enjoyment that for most of you will be the best entertainment you've had in a while. At 15 American dollars for the game, with 5 additional for the soundtrack DLC, 20 dollars is a great price for this game. (Without DLC, the game is about 10 British pounds, 13 with DLC, for those of you in the UK)Cons:~Though the customization is great, it would be a little better if there was more actors to choose form to play your characters.~Though it has a great storyline, playing it for the second time, at first, can seem kind of repetitive, and I found it hard to emotionally invest myself into the second set of characters. If you feel the same way, I advise taking a break for a month or two, so the shine of this game doesn't get burnt out.~Dr. Mi ahOtherwise, this is a great game, and if you were a fan of the Power Rangers when you were a kid, you're going to love this, although prior association is not required for this to be a great game. I personally thought ths was an amazing game.I give Chroma Squad a 9.7/10Happy Chromatizing!			"

												This game is a turn-based tactics RPG where you control a team of actors who are trying to get rich and famous by playing a ""Power-Rangers""-like TV show. In terms of gameplay the game is OK, but where it really shines is on comedy! The story is filled with jokes and references, the characters interaction are really funny, the scenarios where the fights occour are somewhat odd, some enemies are really dumb... And the comments after each episode... Sometimes they are just... ROFL!If you like comedy, Power Rangers, tactics RPG and pixel graphics, you should really consider trying this game!			"

												For 15 or even 30 bones, you really can't do much better than Chroma Squad. Even if Power Rangers (or Super Sentai if you INSIST) isn't necessarily your jam, it hits all the right notes for making a good gaming experience through that Triple-A seems to have forgotten; It's fun. Fun. You remember that? You know, when you get giggles or smile? When you get drawn into the experience not because of the spectacle, but because the game directly involves you and lets you make it your own, that's how you make games fun.Throwing down on some details, here's some specifics of why it's already made my top ten for 2015 --Turn-Based strategy, not RPG. Think XCOM: EU, but with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Power Rangers.-Customisation and upgrades for pretty much EVERYTHING.-Resource management that's more give-take than just your standard subtraction. It reminds me a lot of how the economy worked in Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries, a type of economy system I feel got left by the wayside in favour of simpler/easier things that don't add any weight to your decisions.-Crafting, a system that is notorious for earning my ire by basically being utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t roughly a million per-cent of the time, actually makes some sort of sense in how components are named/what goes into what. It's also not needlessly complicated, which is a gigantic tick in my ""yes"" box.-It's got good moments of humour in it. It's not a comedy game, per se, but it knows not to take itself too seriously, and the humour it employs has a nice spectrum, from subtle pointing out of tropes, tongue-in-cheek, to bad puns, to breaking the fourth wall, and even some nice.... ""meta"" moments.-The art is nicely done, and consistent. While I can't say I have any particular love for the ""retro"" style that just about every indie game is doing, this one has really nicely animated sprites with a lot of good character to them as well as fun and well-done environments.In conclusion, if you're one of those indie-game wads that just can't get enough of retro-styled graphics, crafting and whatever, you should have already creamed your free-trade, locally sourced shorts just by looking at the game's trailer. But even if you're not, this is definitely a game worth playing if you just want to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun playing games for once.			"

												If you had even a passing interest in Power Rangers as a kid, you'll get a kick out of this, even more so with the fact that you can tweak your team from the start by changing their names, appearances (or even, in some cases, race) and suit color to add your own personal flavor. I spent a good ten minutes trying to come up with my own team name and catch-phrases. The tactical RPG aspects are simple and enjoyable, and I like a more streamlined approach to gearing the squad. What I really love about the game, though, is its consistent charm; from my characters yelling my ridiculous catch-phrases, to the Assist character constantly using emoji's in dialogue, to some of the ridiculous bosses you face (shout-out to Transitmancer), I often had a wide grin on my face while playing.As for gripes, well, the Kaiju battles got repetitive; spam Punch until you were at about 60% accuracy then pop Defense, Defend self against enemy's attacks, repeat. It'll probably be harder on higher difficulties, but I found myself getting somewhat bored during a battle between a GIANT ROBOT AND A GIANT MONSTER. Also, there were a couple bosses who kept doing knockback abilities that kept me from doing a Finishing Move, which happened to be a side-objective for that Episode, so I spent maybe twenty minutes trying to get into the correct position.That said, though, this is perfectly viable nostalgia fuel that manages to be fun, engaging and lets you have a beaver on your superhero team. Sheer brilliance.			"

												Overall: 9/10Combat:  8/10:  Combat system consists of move and attack phase with the additional options to go into teamwork mode or use free actions.  You gain audience members as you defeat badguys, achieve mission objectives, and do special moves or use teamwork.  The common enemies are just that - common, you will see the same enemies throughout the game though they upgrade in power and stats (as do you).  The bosses are great, as with most of the game they are made with humor and they have unique skills and play styles.  There is another type of combat you go into, I dont want to spoil it but if you watched power rangers you probably know what it is.  Generally this mode of combat has you fighting and gaining combos which power up special moves.  During the enemy attack phase you play a mini game where you try to click at the right moment to minimize damage.  I give combat 8/10 because the difficulty scales weird.  I felt underpowered initially but by midway into the game I was stomping on most missions.K I'll finish this review later I gtg for now.  My Truly Honest Opinion: Get this game, you won't regret it.  It doesn't matter if you're a 90's kid or if you watched power rangers (though it makes it all the more better),  if you did not get any of its references or jokes I still feel this game is solid and worth the 15 dollars.

												It's not the best tactics game, but it's got more heart and soul than any game I can remember playing. The devs clearly have real love for the genre and for their game. It's a bit rough around the edges but worthwhile.The Teamwork mechanic is brilliant: it's both a fun tactics gameplay mechanic and beautifully appropriate for sentai.			"

												For 15 or even 30 bones, you really can't do much better than Chroma Squad. Even if Power Rangers (or Super Sentai if you INSIST) isn't necessarily your jam, it hits all the right notes for making a good gaming experience through that Triple-A seems to have forgotten; It's fun. Fun. You remember that? You know, when you get giggles or smile? When you get drawn into the experience not because of the spectacle, but because the game directly involves you and lets you make it your own, that's how you make games fun.Throwing down on some details, here's some specifics of why it's already made my top ten for 2015 --Turn-Based strategy, not RPG. Think XCOM: EU, but with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Power Rangers.-Customisation and upgrades for pretty much EVERYTHING.-Resource management that's more give-take than just your standard subtraction. It reminds me a lot of how the economy worked in Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries, a type of economy system I feel got left by the wayside in favour of simpler/easier things that don't add any weight to your decisions.-Crafting, a system that is notorious for earning my ire by basically being utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t roughly a million per-cent of the time, actually makes some sort of sense in how components are named/what goes into what. It's also not needlessly complicated, which is a gigantic tick in my ""yes"" box.-It's got good moments of humour in it. It's not a comedy game, per se, but it knows not to take itself too seriously, and the humour it employs has a nice spectrum, from subtle pointing out of tropes, tongue-in-cheek, to bad puns, to breaking the fourth wall, and even some nice.... ""meta"" moments.-The art is nicely done, and consistent. While I can't say I have any particular love for the ""retro"" style that just about every indie game is doing, this one has really nicely animated sprites with a lot of good character to them as well as fun and well-done environments.In conclusion, if you're one of those indie-game wads that just can't get enough of retro-styled graphics, crafting and whatever, you should have already creamed your free-trade, locally sourced shorts just by looking at the game's trailer. But even if you're not, this is definitely a game worth playing if you just want to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun playing games for once.			"

												I LOVE the concept behind this game.  For anyone who's ever enjoyed a good tactical RPG, this is a sure thing.  The music is charming, the upgrades interesting, and the combat with objectives keeps the game challenging.My criticisms: I would like to see them improve some of the play mecanics by maybe adding more levels with height differences.  I'm also not that into the mecha fights and could see a lot of improvement in that area.  Would also like more custom options for team set ups/classes.			"

												It's a little unrefined in some ways - the writing's a bit awkward/forced at times, certain aspects are a bit underdevelopped (Kaiju fights are shallow, crafting is largely unnecessary even on the hardest difficulty)But it's legitimately great fun.  It's just bursting with spirit and charm and energy and that can really be felt and appreciated.  Soundtrack's pretty damn awesome too.  Do the thing, get the game.			"

												This game is probably one of my favorite turn based-combat games out there. From the art style to the gameplay to the humor behind every dialog box, this game has it all. I truly enjoy the diversity in classes and the difficulty scales quite well.My only quarrel is the inability to replay levels. Due to this, I had to restart because I didn't invest enough into my mech and when it came to a certain mech fight, I was incredibly underpowered and even when I landed all hits perfectly and blocked as much as I could, I would still lose by a landslide. However don't let that stop you from playing this game, it is more than worth its price.			"

												1) Great disgaea esque gameplay without the grind.2) Soft decision based role playing3) Doesn't take itself seriously4) Soft management game outside of combatIt's a great game and you should buy it.Let's be honest, you're unsure on what to buy because you have so many games already, well buy this and other great games that will surprise you with how good they are. I'm fairly certain I've accidently ignored my girlfriend because of this game and I can't say I regret it. This game is great for 1 or multipley playthroughs (whatever your preference), the game changes quite a bit depending on which path you take as far as what you have to use for combat is concerned and some story. I enjoyed the game and I'm hoping for dlc or a new game in the series.			"

												I was a big fan of Power Rangers way back when so, seeing as how this is a Power Rangers-esque game, I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. It will definitely remind you of Power Rangers(as well as other pop-culture icons) but in a very humorous way. It is also a fairly in-depth tactical RPG with crafting elements(Hooray for cardboard!). I found this game to be very enjoyable & addicting.			"

												Now this is a fun game!Chroma Squad puts players in the shoes of stuntmen from series that shares many similarities with Power Rangers (Monsters, Mechs and Morphin). The game is a tactical RPG that requires players to use teamwork to build up an audience for more fans and money, which will ultimately make their team more powerful.Check out more about the game in my videos.

												I was really hesitant at first to purchase this game because of the lackluster look to combat but damn, the power rangers/super sentai theme just won me over. I've watched every episode of power rangers and most of super sentai. With that said, the thematic elements are spot on. The way the dialogue is corny and the team up moves are all taken from power rangers and i love every single second of it.As for the turn based strategy, the game is pretty fun. While other games like Fire Emblem or FF tactics have more interesting and robust systems, the combat elements in this game are still fun. Complexity doesnt always mean fun game play. The RPG elements are also very interesting. I was surprised to see that this game has a development strategy portion similar to that of the kariosoft games. Overall, highly recommend this game if your a power rangers/super sentai fan. For rpg/tactics fans, I would say it's less complicated and interesting the other games in the genere , but the combat is still fun.			"

												Chroma Squad was if anything a blast from the past. The retro graphics, mixed with the power rangers theme brought me back to my childhood. A simpler time. A tactical RPG where you have your own custom power ranger team, you can name the rangers, the team, even choose colors. You also run a studio, purchasing upgrades, signing advertisement contracts, and crafting new gear for the rangers. The script is funny at times, and goofy dumb at others but you'll love it just the same. I clocked in at about 11-12 hours over a couple weeks on normal difficulty.			"

												This game may have been released too soon. Once it's fully bug tested and no longer freezes during the interminably long last mission (which I finished after 7 attempts and two weeks), this game is a 4/5. As it stands, with these glitches, it's a 2/5. Positives:- The idea is well thought out and utilized. - The main RPG game is fun and entertaining, and fairly deep. - The fourth wall breaks and overall sense of humor are fun. - Customization- you can change your team's name and their various battle cries. These make the in game dialogue awesome at times. (No, Bill, of course you're as important as anyone else in Sakura and the Rest!) I'd like more costume choices, but what's there is fine. Negatives:- The mecha missions are incredibly dull, since it always comes down to the same exact fight (punch punch punch punch special. Click to lesson damage. Click to lessen damage. Click to lessen damage. Punch punch punch punch block.) A few of the enemies have very slow animation that makes the battles even MORE interminable, especially the Barney parody. I changed the mecha summoning catch phrase to ""Let's Get This Over With!"" I seriously dreaded them every time. - Glitches. These are the game's current biggest issue. They seem to be clearing up, but they kept me from finishing the last mission for two weeks, which destroyed the game's momentum and my interest in pursuing the other alternate endings. Buyer beware. - The last mission. There's a plot twist in that last mission that changes who the villain is that makes it less satisfying. I didn't get the final battle I REALLY wanted. Overall, this game is a lot of fun and incredibly imaginative. Once it's fully polished, I recommend it. Just check out the community board before buying and make sure that things have been cleared up.			"

												Chroma Squad is an amazing game where you delve into the makings of a Super Sentai studio. It's like a business tycoon, a tactical RPG, and a customization rainbow stuffed into an amazing masterpiece of a sandwich!I honestly can't remember how I stumbled across this gem, but when I saw it, I fell in love with it and I had to have it. I'm glad that I did stumble acorss this, 'cuz I've had the funnest time playing Chroma Squad, the most enjoyable game I've come across in a while. In the first week of owning it, this game was what I'd play every night if I wasn't busy. It's extremely addicting, and while the story seems to start out at a good pace, things escalate quickly later on, providing great plot twists that keep the story immensely interesting.With those opening comments out of the way, let's list the pros and cons.Pros:~A great level of customization with a plethora of actors, colors, and equipment to choose from, heck, even the mechs have a good level of customization.~A great soundtrack. I persoanlly am a big fan of the 8-bit/chiptune style of music, it reminds of the days of arcades and gameboys. Any chiptune lover would listen to the soundtrack over and over again. If you like the music, get the reasonably priced soundtrack. Not only does it help support the devs, but you get to listen to your favorite groovy tunes from the game anytime you want.~Cool graphics. if you like these kinds of pixely games or pixel art in general, this is a game for you.~The storyline. I've said it before: It's interesting with a great pace.~The play time. It took me about 22 hours to get through my first playthrough of the game, on the normal difficulty setting. And that's just for one of 3 endings that the game has to offer. Depending on the difficlty level you're playing and the time spent jamming out to the music, the time to get all the endings can range from 50 hours to 70 hours. Great amount of gameplay.~The achievements. There's not hundreds of them like their are in other games, and most of them are pretty easy to get, you just need to play the game accordingly. I got over half the achievements on my first playthrough. (Though I guess they could add some ones in the future that require DLC.) If you're not an achievement hunter, that's all right, it could just be a fun side quest. This game has enough play-achievement balance that you don't need to dedicate hundreds of hours to get all of them.~Difficalty settings. This is always a great feature to have in a game. The difficulties are casual, interesting, and challenging, ehich translates to easy, normal, hard respectively. If you're new to this type of game and/or want to focus on the story, play the game on casual. If you've played these games before and like a nice balance of story and challenge, interesting's your cuppa joe. If you like a challenge, like good planning, and you aren't afraid to lose a little to win a little, challenging is just the right fit.~Nice balance of battle and management. Not only do you fight with your heroes, you need to check and maintain their gear in order to beat the enemies that get more difficult as time progresses, as well as answer emails from fans, manage production companies, and upgrade your small warehouse studio as time goes on.~A great price. This game is relatively well priced, and will provide hours of fun and enjoyment that for most of you will be the best entertainment you've had in a while. At 15 American dollars for the game, with 5 additional for the soundtrack DLC, 20 dollars is a great price for this game. (Without DLC, the game is about 10 British pounds, 13 with DLC, for those of you in the UK)Cons:~Though the customization is great, it would be a little better if there was more actors to choose form to play your characters.~Though it has a great storyline, playing it for the second time, at first, can seem kind of repetitive, and I found it hard to emotionally invest myself into the second set of characters. If you feel the same way, I advise taking a break for a month or two, so the shine of this game doesn't get burnt out.~Dr. Mi ahOtherwise, this is a great game, and if you were a fan of the Power Rangers when you were a kid, you're going to love this, although prior association is not required for this to be a great game. I personally thought ths was an amazing game.I give Chroma Squad a 9.7/10Happy Chromatizing!			"

												Here is a review I wrote for the website Indie Game Source.http://indiegamesource.com/igs/reviews/chroma-squad-review-go-go-not-power-rangers-r218TL;DRPros:+Fun and flashy combat that does a nice job replicating battles from popular super sentai shows+Lighthearted and humorous writing that is appropriately cheesy and over-the-top+Bright, expressive pixel art+Overall oozes charm and nostalgia; better than the sum of it's parts and a must play for anyone who grew up watching shows like Power RangersCons:-Combat isn't particularly complex, especially the mecha segments-The same environments and director instructions are reused a bit too often; not enough variety in ""episodes""-Still a number of bugs to work outUltimately, your enjoyment of the game really comes down to how much super sentai you've seen. The game relies a lot on Power Rangers nostalgia and poking fun at the genre's various quirks and tropes.			"

												Finally finished the game (after having to re-start because my previous save bugged out due to having start a day before official release). I cannot wait to start doing this game over again (likely with a different path and a new ending) for my Drunk Play channel.The sound, the game play, the nostalgia. All very good.Only negative thing I'd point out is how the crafting system is now 100% random. You can't go to the store and buy crafting materials to get the crafted items you want. Now you buy a box of random items and if you're not lucky, you could end up never being able to craft better items (or at least Season level items) to up your game for the next battle. Can get a little bit annoying. But you should end up doing just fine in the end.TenNaddaTen. Will save the world again.			"

												Great little RPG. A playthrough took me about 6-8 hours of actual playing (idled the game alot while cooking and whatnot). The story and game mechanics start off a little slow in my opinion. I didn't start getting really engaged with things until about half way into Season 2/beginning of Season 3. Another complaint would be that the mechanics of the game are not super clearly explained by the ""tutorial"" missions. Once you start getting into things and experimenting, things become clear however. The story and graphics are cute, there are quite a few chuckle laughs. Recommended for anyone who likes turn-based RPGs.			"

												This is a nice little game that will keep you busy for about 15-20 hours. I really liked knights of pen and paper (my avatar is from that game) for its graphics and casual game style, and also enjoyed the overall foreign feel with bad grammar and jokes that don't always translate perfectly. This game is sort of the same, but is more linear and less compelling to replay.As someone growing up watching the power rangers I wanted to go back to some of those cheesy moments and the game really delivers, including the repetitive unispiring boss fights in the form of a minigame. The plot is overall nice and somewhat reminds me of their other work, and there's a nice fast forward effect to skip through the story. TBH I skipped through most of the ending just to finish playing.I will probably return to this game when a major update is declared and overall don't regret buying it on sale. Thanks Devs for the time put in to writing and styling this!			"

												Simple Turn-based tactics RPG that brings in a few unique mechanics to the genre.Gameplay straddles a fine line between making things intuitive but not too simple while giving you just enough but not too much stuff to play around with. The crafting system is multiple layers of RNG buggery and it leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth sometimes.  You can work around it but meh.The pacing is fairly on point and the game never really overstays its welcome.There are Super Robot Fights, though it's easily the weakest part of the game currently.  They're also gathering feedback and have announced an overhaul, so this point may become moot in a couple of months.Aesthetics are colorful with a strong indie feel (it's an indie, kickstarted game so yeah).  16 bit and the like.The writing assumes that you've watched at least 2-3 episodes of power rangers and have a passing knowledge of certain internet memes that came out within a specific timeframe (I had to google a couple things).  I enjoyed it.  It has the right kind of corn and ham that'll get me to sensibly chuckle most of the time.and again, the pacing is pretty strong despite the source material.I highly recommend configuring your super sentai team away from the defaults to fit your preferences as it can greatly improve your gameplay experience.  My team was called the Rude Rollers, they Rolled Out, and my robot was named Pablo Escobar (he shanked giant monsters).A single run may take like 6-8 hours and there are multiple endings.			"

												The game far exceded my expectations.I don't need to tell you about the graphics, either you like the chosen style or you don't. FWIW I think they did a great job of having consistent high-quality pixel art. The sound track is great too!Story is good, has multiple endings (and the game play is good enough to go through and get them all), good humor, and if you are there just for the tactics, there is a fast-forward though the dialogue.Game play is excellent.When I first recieved this game my expectations were that it would be good, but not great, but I figured I might as well give it a try, since I got it.  My intent was to play for just half an hour before bed, since I had to get up early the next day.  The next time i had bothered to look at a clock, nearly four hours had passed. I'll take the old addage about time flying as objective evidence that the game is fun as heck. Since building my new gaming rig, I have actually played it more than any other game.The game is not perfect.  I have encounted a few bugs (nothing that made it crash, and any complicated software will end up with at least one small bug.)The games i play over multiple times is limited, this one easily made the short list.You don't have to be a fan of any of the tv shows that inspired the game, or particularly fond of turnbased strategy games to find the game enjoyable. The hard difficuly offers a challenge and rewards a strategical approach, medium is more forgiving. It is a game that i think is accessible to a wide audience. For its target audience it offers nostolgia, but It is not inappropriate for younger audiencies and gameplay is approachable to anyone.			"

												Chroma Squad is a turn-based strategy game based off of the Power Rangers series. Chroma Squad has 3 different endings and 3 different difficulties.Chroma Squad has some pros and some cons.Some positives of this game would be:This game is short, and has a little bit of replayability.This game has a few choices you could do.This game has some comedy in the emails you get after each episode.You can customize your Squad's names, the mech's name, and what they do after certain things.Some negatives of this game would be:This game's endings are all based on what you do on one episode.Sometimes your game will glitch out and you won't be able to take your turn.I would rate Chroma Squad an 8/10.

												A very fun tacticle RPG with some managment style options and even a split storyline. While not graphicly superior you can still tell the dev tem put a lot of love into this project. I have already beaten it once and still love playing and trying diffrent actors, story decisions (Though there's not a lot of them.), skill setups, and of course the Mecha fights (in this aspect it is compleatly absurd how many part choices/combinations you can choose from  to custom your Kaijou whupping experiance!) . To be honest I kept waiting for a sale cause I was unsure, but after missing the last one due to finances (It was steams christmas/New Year sale so i kinda burned a hole in my pocket on other games!) I said buck it all and got it at full price when i had some spare cash. Still not regretting that decision, it's a very fun game!			"

												While it's not the Power Rangers game of my dreams, I found a lot to like about Chroma Squad. I was originally turned off when I found out it was about running a TV show and not actually being Power Rangers, but it actually works. It's full of all the cheesy lines and scenarios fans of the old Power Rangers seasons will like, and people who have stuck with the show can appreciate the love and knowledge of the franchise and it's tropes went into this game. I'm not particularly a fan of strategy games and I'm not really good at them, so I found this game pretty difficult on normal, but fans of the genre might find it too easy. Still, I really enjoyed all of the customization, the multiple storylines, and found the game overall to very enjoyable.			"

												Ok first off let me just say that I was never big into Power Rangers, but THIS game just blows me away! I love tactical RPGs, and this game is amazing. From the quirky/cheezy lines, to the amazing combat when you team up, this game brings 90's style live-action TV to you. Everything about this game screams Power Rangers, and that's a good thing! If I was 10 and watched Power Ranger, this game would be a call back to a very happy childhood. Even so, this game is great and very fun for it's kind. Worth buying if you love tactical RPGs and want a Power Ranger feel to it. Also, get the soundtrack! So great to listen to.			"

												That was 20 hours that I don't regret. Creating your own ""power-rangers""-team, and playing them through meta-scenarios while making a studio and buying plastic swords was a great ride. Because I named all my characters after friends, the banter ended up being eerily similar to if I had written it myself, which was great. Tactical turn based fighting is fun, and the added focus on teamwork and stunts on partners made it even better. I would have loved even more characters to play through the game with, and even more weapons and gear to craft and buy. I guess it's not too negative that I want more of what's already in the game. The pacing of seasons is a great idea and works well, allowing the game to be played in episodes or seasons if you want. I rarely complete games, but this one was fab, and I'll probably play it through at least one more time.Had been 8/10, but because the price point is what it is, given the production values, I'll put this at a 10/10. No game is perfect, and everything can be improved, but if 10 is an obtainable number, and considering the price, then yeah. One of my favourite new games.			"

												ChromaSquad is a fantastic Tactical RPG where you create your very own team of Sentai Warriors. Customizeable to a great level, you can choose your team, each color, team name, catch-phrases, craft your own armor and Mech pieces and more! While simple in mechanics it is noting to sneeze at as it keeps you pumped for the next episode and what may be around the corner.~I wish to extend a cordial THANK YOU to the creators of ChromaSquad. It has been a good while since I've immersed myself so deeply into a game. And the absolute charm, fun and personality this game had to offer had me smiling ALL the way through. Right after finishing it I had to start over as it is simply too much fun! And I plan to play your other games and see what more Behold Studios has to offer. <3			"

												I haven't played many Tactical RPGs but this game is very enjoyable, both in its gameplay and its satire/parody. From trying to figure out how you're going to kick the crap out of a boss while dealing with his henchmen, or trying to figure out which ad agency to go with, the game has some surprising depth to it. It certainly has some places where I wish the developers had varied up the combat and non-combat gameplay. All in all, I really enjoy this game. Hopefully they'll expand on this game, or release a sequel.			"

												TLDR:Gameplay - 10Music - 10Story/Writing - 10Nostalgia - 10Chance for Enemies to Dodge Attacks - OP_____________________________________________________________________Still in ""Season 1"" and this game is great. My only complaint is that their hardest difficulty is too hard. There are objectives to fulfill in each mission, for example: Kill all enemies in 4 turnsAnd it feels like the enemies dodge more often on round 4 than they do the previous 3.  I've had to restart more than a handful of times because of this.Another objective might be: Kill the boss with a finishing moveWhich requires all 5 party members to be alive, so if one of your members gets KO'd then tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ Which is especially hard when the Season 1 boss has 2000HP and you hit for 60-100 each person. You can team-attack for about 400-600 but that requires all party members to be right up next to the bad guy, which sounds easy enough, but as you get hit your players get knocked back depending on where they get hit from so your players will fall out of range of team attacks.Oh, and the healer can heal allies but can't heal itself? It feels like I just have to keep restarting the mission until I get lucky enough to finally pass, which to a certain degree I can understand because I don't want my wins to be handed to me, but my tactics (in a tactical-RPG) should not be undermined by something as whimsical as ♥♥♥♥ing RNG-dodging.

												This game is adorable and feels like a SNES classic that flew under the radar. The pixel graphics are clear, well-animated, and bold, the soundtrack is super catchy, and the gameplay is fun. Most of all, it oozes flavor from everywhere, from the item descriptions, to the post-level ""tweets"" as a scorecard.If it has any flaw, it's that it's a bit shallow for a tactical RPG; there's a lack of class customization and enemy variety, though they cover all the bases. The mecha battles could be better, too. The difficulty curve is a bit wobbly as well, though I enjoyed having some easy stages to ""cooldown"" with following the tough ones.Unless you're looking for a deep tactical game, none of these rough edges are enough to pull the game down. The game is a love letter to sentai shows and 90s childhood, without any cynicism or irony. It looks back on it with modern eyes, pokes fun at it's own expense, but completely embraces its nostalgia. I loved it!			"

												Time to save the world with mild Gymnastics. Chroma Squad is about a small team of stunt men that get sick of thier old boss and deside to start their own Power Rangers like show. The gameplay has you using five different squad members in a grid based arena fighting some waves on enemies and a boss. The game's main difficulty is based on if you choose to the the mission objectives, from hit the boss every turn, win in 5 turns, or finish the boss with a finisher. The game is filled with references that just comes and goes from video games, to pop culture the games has cheesy diologue. The crafting system is somewhat of a mess so I just stick to the shop. The mec combat is bare bone with realy no differences with attacks just the animation that happens. But even with thous complants it acctualy makes the game more true to how a noraml Power Rangers epiosode happens, (story, simple fight, transform, beat boss, boss gets bigger, mec battle, end episode). Overall the campyness and the gameplay make me suggest this game if you have the money and a week end to waist. P.S. The narrirator spells poorly			"

												I was iffy to buy this game based on the theme and trailer. Next thing I know it's 1 AM and I wonder where the last three days went. The developers did a really fantastic job on story, design, concept, and gameplay. My only complaint is the big mech battle scenes can be choppy sometimes.			"

												Decided to grab this game since I liked Tactics RPGs, and wanted something bright and colorful. Came into the game with pretty ""meh"" expectations and was blown out of the water.As someone who watched Power Rangers when I was little, this game is an absolute nostalgia trip, while at the same time parodying a lot of the tropes of the sentai genre. The game starts with the protagonists getting a tutorial from their overbearing boss before quitting to form their own sentai studio. You get to name all your rangers, choose their colors (Even if the palette is rather limited), their mecha, their catchphrases, etc. Though this has no impact on gameplay whatsoever, it adds nicely to the fantasy of running your own show. Gameplay is a relatively simple TRPG where you can only have one of each class, Assist, Tech, Assault, Scout, and Lead. This prevents a lot of the cheese strategies that are common in TRPGs like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. This game's difficulty in actual fights is usually pretty low. Instead the difficulty comes from getting your Audience meter filled up and then keeping it filled. The best way to fill it up is by doing flips, team moves, special attacks, and Director's Instructions, which are special submissions that can range from ""Don't lose any of your team members"" to ""win in 5 turns"" to ""Defeat the boss before defeating any minions."" The gameplay, despite being turnbased, really does a great job of showing how a sentai show usually plays out, and its very easy to see how cool everything would look to the eyes of a child watching the show at home. The only major gameplay flaw is that my scout always felt useless. Next to the rapid-fire skills of the Tech, the massive healing from the Assist, the raw damage and acrobatics bonus of the Assault, and the tankiness of the Lead, the Scout... moves an extra space every turn. This would be alright if his damage were anything special, but either my choice of actor or gear for my scout meant that he was consistently doing less damage than the healer. Though the scout does get several crowd control abilties, they all require him to be in the midst of battle, and the Scout's frailty means that these are very risky to use past Season 3.Graphics are psuedo 16-bit, bright colorful and cheery graphics with some great sprite art. Not quite on the same level as Undertale's sprite art, but its all still very appealing. Boss designers are all unique and, with a few exceptions, creative. Though you'll be fighting in th same 7 or so locals a lot, I'm willing to write that up as part of the parody. Besides, the locations are all great looking and have enough functional differences from one another to keep you on your toes.That's not to say the game is perfect. While the game is generally humorous, there are more than a few spots where I felt as though the game was expecting me to laugh and I didn't. Mecha fighting is pretty boring and one dimensional, and is usually the worst part of any mission its included in, which is a shame since a lot of its moves and parts are references to Mecha anime like Gurren Lagann and NGE, references I would appreciate a lot more if it wasn't part of the most boring part of the game. There's crafting, which is already a very played out mechanic that seems to pop up in every game nowadays, but at least here it fits the fantasy of everything on a sentai show being handmade and crappy looking. There's also multiple things that seem to ride the line between satire and unironic crapiness. When you reach Season 3, most of that season's plot revolves around your Lead growing an ego, which is a trite and boring plot line used in every sentai show ever. Are you trying to make fun of these trite and boring plots, Chrome Squad, or was your plot for Season 3 just trite and boring? Or did I just answer my own question?Despite those flaws, I'd be wrong if I said this game was bad. The game just has so much heart and dedication put into it, the gameplay is fun, the visuals were colorful and the plot is meta-tastic goofiness. While the game didn't make me burst out laughing or bawl my eyes out, it was just so delightful I can't help but recommend it. If you love Tactics RPGs or Sentai shows, consider it a double recommendation.			"

												After playing this game all the way throught I can say its worth it.  There might not be a lot of replayability until after a new game + is implemented.  One thing I will say is that on normal difficulty the game is very easy until season 5, then the difficulty seems to spike up very hard. The problem is the next difficulty up seems to be way to hard. I wish they would iron out the difficulty spikes and make it a much smoother ramp up.			"

												Pros:Customize your team with various actors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.Further customize your characters with various stat-increasing gear choices and weapon types.Responding to emails seems to provide variation in the storyline, or just give you goodies or fans.Upgrade your base to provide various buffs to your team.Optional crafting system; just buy from the store if you can't be bothered.Winning the fight is only part of the game; try to maximize audience, fans, and income as well.Light-hearted, otherworldly story with plenty of comedy.Cons:Only five party members and predetermined classes limit team customization.Unable to cancel your movement action, even if you haven't taken any other actions; annoying if you misclick a location, or misjudge distance for a ranged attack.Characters don't level up, only gaining skills and stats from equipment and progressing through the story ""seasons""Since characters don't level up, and you can't rerun past content for money or crafting components, you can't grind to level up and make the game easier on yourself even if you want to.You can only see tile markers on tiles you can move or attack to, sometimes making it difficult to judge positioning for ranged attacks.You cannot customize whether UP is Up-Left or Up-Right if using a gamepad; you just have to get used to it.A goofy, lovable Turn-based Strategy that reminds me of Disgaea. A type of game all too rare on PC. Definitely recommend to fans of Turn-based Strategy games such as Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics.			"

												A very fun tacticle RPG with some managment style options and even a split storyline. While not graphicly superior you can still tell the dev tem put a lot of love into this project. I have already beaten it once and still love playing and trying diffrent actors, story decisions (Though there's not a lot of them.), skill setups, and of course the Mecha fights (in this aspect it is compleatly absurd how many part choices/combinations you can choose from  to custom your Kaijou whupping experiance!) . To be honest I kept waiting for a sale cause I was unsure, but after missing the last one due to finances (It was steams christmas/New Year sale so i kinda burned a hole in my pocket on other games!) I said buck it all and got it at full price when i had some spare cash. Still not regretting that decision, it's a very fun game!			"

												Ok first off let me just say that I was never big into Power Rangers, but THIS game just blows me away! I love tactical RPGs, and this game is amazing. From the quirky/cheezy lines, to the amazing combat when you team up, this game brings 90's style live-action TV to you. Everything about this game screams Power Rangers, and that's a good thing! If I was 10 and watched Power Ranger, this game would be a call back to a very happy childhood. Even so, this game is great and very fun for it's kind. Worth buying if you love tactical RPGs and want a Power Ranger feel to it. Also, get the soundtrack! So great to listen to.			"

												This game is exactly what Kickstarter should be about: interesting idea, fantastic development team, and, most importantly, delivery of a finished product. The game itself blends a business management simulation on the macro level and a tactical RPG for an episode of the TV series, played for greatest theatrical effect. The animation is simplistic and minimized, but that's okay. This game oozes nostalgia, and coming off as ""Mario Brothers-esque"" is not an insult. Music and graphical interface are smooth, but some small issues have arisen with different computers. The biggest selling point is by far the writing; snark and self-referential humor make reading the dialogue part of the experience rather than a chore. As an added bonus, there is a fast forward option via pressing the enter key. It's one of the many little details that says this studio cares about the fan experience. The only real downside I can think of is the menu system: clunky and no real way to make transitions between the various sub menus easier, but perhaps that is just the nature of a game that puts you in charge of so many details. That being said, the positives outweigh the negatives by several orders of magnitude. Pick this little gem up; even at full price, it's a bargain.			"

I honestly believe this game is worth more than the (around) 14 dosh I payed for it. Music is so catchy, and almost makes me feel like I'm watching Power Rangers as a kid again at times.

I am very glad that i did!Chroma Squad takes a lot of concepts and blends them together perfectly. Obvisiously there is the RPG element, but you have to manage your studio with upgrades, you need to manage the salary of the actors, respond to fan mail and there is a crafting system. In my opinion it does it all very very well.Also the game is suppos to be fun, from the dialogue to the missions, even after the credits role when you beat the game. If you are looking for a fun game that you can play in 30minutes or dump 3 hours i would suggest this!			"

												Chroma Squad is a nicely simple tactics RPG and a very cute parody/homage to Power Rangers and Super Sentai. Tactics RPGs can be hard to get into because they're often 100+ hour epics with large numbers of characters, classes, and items to sort through; Chroma Squad strips away a lot of that to create a tactics RPG that doesn't require the same level of commitment, while keeping enough elements to maintain a certain level of strategic depth. For the most part, beating the missions is relatively easy - the tricky part is usually trying to fulfill the optional objections to maximize your audience. This worked pretty well as a way of challenging the player without punishing them too much for the occasional failure. Unfortunately, the giant mecha fights are more difficult and rely fairly heavily on luck.The character statistics are pretty straightforward, but some of the global boosts aren't as clear as I'd like. For example, how much is +10 Drop Rate? I guess the base Drop Rate is 100, but it doesn't seem to say that anywhere. +2 Fan Conversion Rate and +25% Crafting Rate are similarly unclear.Fortunately, most of these concerns do little to take away from the game's solid core. Chroma Squad is a good fit for both newcomers to the genre and veterans who feel like taking a break from their attempt to 100% complete Disgaea.			"

You have fixed progression both in the game and in the story.The game however is enjoyable and is a pretty standard tactics game. It doesn't tell you some information I wish it did ( Enemies movement, your own attack damage, cool downs on enemy abilites), however if you play it on normal or easy the game won't demand that much from you.Hard should only be played by those willing to obtain massive amounts of salt.

												Chroma Squad is a turn-based rpg, where you essentailly run a Sentai show. I personally love this game, it has some great mechanics, and the dialogue is rather impressive and witty. You control most aspects of the ""show"" from the name of the squad, to the catchphrases that they yell in combat. The story, yes there is a story, is simple and funny. It essentially follow the typical story that you'd expect from any sentai show.It's not a terribly long game, as I'm on 8 hours of gameplay and in my 4th season out of 5 seasons. Each season gradually gains more episodes with various conditions that will gain you more audience/fans. These conditions vary from survive 10 turns to use teamwork acrobatics 5 times. Their simple conditions that give each episode a nice flavor, and occasionally make you play with a different strategy.Overall, it's a fun game. Simple and easy to pick up. Sure the graphics aren't the best, but it fits very nicely with the theme of the game.			"

												Just beat it for my first time, it is a fun few hours of gameplay and since they're are multiple endings and diffrent routes I will be playing it once or twice soon to see them. If you love the Power Rangers then this will be extra funny to you I bet. I loved the villain, loved the growth of the characters, I really just loved most of this game. They're are a few issues I have with it though for example it is annoying that if you loose your Assist member you loose 95% of all healing and can never revive anyone unles you Chromatize/power up, and the fact most of the NPC allies aren't seen or mentioned again was a little disapointing though I understood why. All in all I really loved this game especially when I finished it and got to see the Villains 'dance' to the ending theme, kind of wished your squad was dancing during this as well to celebrate they're job well done but whatever.If they make a sequel or DLC I am likely to buy it and I am not the biggest fan of PC gaming, but I would love to see if they keep this story going, have the timeline of this game alter the next, or if we get to see the current squad follow something like the power rangers with the changing of powers and rosters because it's mentioned in game that happened before.Again really love this game and think it is at the least worth a try.

												It's a fun, light-hearted game! It's got good (not fantastic) music, a decent set of strategy mechanics, a fun and mostly light story, giant mechs, and an engaging, but lightweight TV show budget simulatorIt's a jack-of-all-games. It's a turn based strategy, 2-D mech fighting, TV show simulator. Though, by the end of the 4th season (out of 5), money management ceases to exist because your set is bankrolled enough to fund the wildest expenditures with ease. Combat is also too easy, with some straight up OP characters and pants-on-head AI. The enemy will spread out it's attacks amongst your team rather than congregating together to fight a single weak enemy, thus losing is almost laughably hard. That being said, team acrobatics, team attacks, and finding the sweet spot with AOE attacks are honestly delightful.It's not super strategic, but it's a genuinely fun and widely appealing indie game.

												As a huge toku fanboy, I was excited to see a video game based on Super Sentai. One that kept in the spirit of sentai by parodying it, and at the same time, paying tribute to it. I've been following this game since Kickstarter, but only more recently got a chance to buy it with the Steam Sale.As far as the gameplay goes, it actually managed to exceed my expectations. Everything is controlled by mouse and things like the the teamwork mechanic and skills you can switch out are things I've seen in other games, but this is one of the better ones in recent memory. Teamwork is more than just an extra person to help you attack, you can also use teamwork to get to spaces much farther on the field and pull off specials using it. This really helped me when trying to accomplish the special requirements. The game never felt imbalanced, too, which is awesome because it's the easiest trap to fall in with strategy RPGs.When you start a new game, you're given the option of picking your team. While I wish there was more options for party members (DLC/Chroma Squad 2?), what characters they do have are very diverse and I think they have just a right amount of options for character selections. The plot itself is the exact same regardless of who you pick, so the main reason to do this is to decide your character's starting stats and which ones you would like to see for the rest of the game, which I really like a lot. The easy way out would have been to just always have them in the suit and choose their stats, or just have your five chosen for you. It even allows there to be a possible lesbian romance later on in the game depending on what gender you pick a certain ranger. Your main five are completely customizable.As for the story itself, it's not like a mind blowing story or anything like that, but it does it's job of feeling like the power ranger/super sentai shows the game is based on. The end goal is defeating a big bad guy, and on the way, you defeat a ton of different monsters ranging from ridiculous to...well, more ridiculous. There's also trophies, multiple endings, storyline branches, and three difficulties to add some replay value.There's one place this game falls flat for me, and I don't think it's major, because it only really started to bother me nearing the end. The humor in this game can be funny at times, and then at other times can get a little groan worthy with the memes. I don't mind a lot of the refernces. The non-comedic ones for sentai fans in the weapons/equipment/skills that referenced a bunch of different sentai series all made me smile when I realized the references, and certain jokes work really well. At one point, they reference the ""What has science done"" image with the Seagull with massive biceps, and jokes like that and the backstreet boys/lady gaga references work really well, but when it's just meme, after meme, after meme, it starts to get a little grating, not unlike being in the presence of an middle aged person who goes on Reddit.Still, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun and quirky little RPG. It's definitely worth the price. I still have two more ending paths and minor storyline branches to get, so I may update this in the future, but having just completed my first playthrough, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.

												This game is really fun! The story is a great homage to Super Sentai, and filled with little jokes and references for Tokusatsu fans to find. Even if you aren't a fan of the shows I think there is still a lot to enjoy from this. The combat is pretty straight forward but works well - it feels pretty satisfying when you take out a strong enemy or complete and episode. The upgrades are decent and the suits look good. The mech fights are a bit simple and can be a bit frustrating, but are still enjoyable enough most of the time. Graphically I think it looks pretty nice. The soundtrack is amazing too. Definitely a good purchase.			"

												Incredibly fun and challenging tactical RPG with a lot of depth and comedy.   There are lots of customization options, equipment to buy or craft and endings with lots of guest characters and bosses.  Worth much more than the asking price.  Oh, and do a few runs on Interesting before you try Challenging mode because it is brutal.			"

												This game's commercial really caught my eye a few christmas sales ago (maybe 2015). I loved watching power rangers every Saturday morning as a kid ,but the shows were always too short of a dosage to quench my thirst for hot spandex action so I seeked video ""games based"" on the show. Sadly all the games were poorly made and had nothing to do with the show. However, this game is fantastic it fills all my desires and expectations of a Super Sentai game. You can customize your teams colors, suits, weapons, skills, and OMG the mecha.The Mecha is cutomizable limb by limb and if u give it a sword it can use it!!!.			"

												Pros:Customize your team with various actors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.Further customize your characters with various stat-increasing gear choices and weapon types.Responding to emails seems to provide variation in the storyline, or just give you goodies or fans.Upgrade your base to provide various buffs to your team.Optional crafting system; just buy from the store if you can't be bothered.Winning the fight is only part of the game; try to maximize audience, fans, and income as well.Light-hearted, otherworldly story with plenty of comedy.Cons:Only five party members and predetermined classes limit team customization.Unable to cancel your movement action, even if you haven't taken any other actions; annoying if you misclick a location, or misjudge distance for a ranged attack.Characters don't level up, only gaining skills and stats from equipment and progressing through the story ""seasons""Since characters don't level up, and you can't rerun past content for money or crafting components, you can't grind to level up and make the game easier on yourself even if you want to.You can only see tile markers on tiles you can move or attack to, sometimes making it difficult to judge positioning for ranged attacks.You cannot customize whether UP is Up-Left or Up-Right if using a gamepad; you just have to get used to it.A goofy, lovable Turn-based Strategy that reminds me of Disgaea. A type of game all too rare on PC. Definitely recommend to fans of Turn-based Strategy games such as Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics.			"

												A light tactical RPG for people who appreciate making robots out of buckets. Not terribly difficult, but also not very deep.The game starts very slow, but picks up considerably about seven hours in. This game scratched an itch, but might be too little, too late for some people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale.More in depth, I'm a little disappointed with the tactical depth of combat. There aren't many ways to mitigate damage during combat. It feels like enemies can attack at arbitrary ranges and move across the map at will. All-out attack is usually the best option, tempered only by the games scoring system, which encourages drawing fights out longer. Even seven hours in, I only have access to one crowd control skill, and very limited area attacks.The crafting system seems expansive, but the game is very stingy with crafting materials, which is a problem for the mech combat minigame. I found myself buying items from the shop just to try breaking them down into spare parts. I really wish there was a way to buy the materials you need from the shop. Collecting drops from enemies seems contrary to the theme of the game--why am I making the lead's costumes out of scraps from the extra's costumes? Where are the extras getting their costumes, if I have to craft the main characters'?			"

												Chroma Squad is a nicely simple tactics RPG and a very cute parody/homage to Power Rangers and Super Sentai. Tactics RPGs can be hard to get into because they're often 100+ hour epics with large numbers of characters, classes, and items to sort through; Chroma Squad strips away a lot of that to create a tactics RPG that doesn't require the same level of commitment, while keeping enough elements to maintain a certain level of strategic depth. For the most part, beating the missions is relatively easy - the tricky part is usually trying to fulfill the optional objections to maximize your audience. This worked pretty well as a way of challenging the player without punishing them too much for the occasional failure. Unfortunately, the giant mecha fights are more difficult and rely fairly heavily on luck.The character statistics are pretty straightforward, but some of the global boosts aren't as clear as I'd like. For example, how much is +10 Drop Rate? I guess the base Drop Rate is 100, but it doesn't seem to say that anywhere. +2 Fan Conversion Rate and +25% Crafting Rate are similarly unclear.Fortunately, most of these concerns do little to take away from the game's solid core. Chroma Squad is a good fit for both newcomers to the genre and veterans who feel like taking a break from their attempt to 100% complete Disgaea.			"

												This is a wonderful game that caught me by suprise. I got a copy from the Humble Monthly Bundle and looked at the reviews and decided to take a chance and play it. I am very glad that i did!Chroma Squad takes a lot of concepts and blends them together perfectly. Obvisiously there is the RPG element, but you have to manage your studio with upgrades, you need to manage the salary of the actors, respond to fan mail and there is a crafting system. In my opinion it does it all very very well.Also the game is suppos to be fun, from the dialogue to the missions, even after the credits role when you beat the game. If you are looking for a fun game that you can play in 30minutes or dump 3 hours i would suggest this!			"

												After playing this game all the way throught I can say its worth it.  There might not be a lot of replayability until after a new game + is implemented.  One thing I will say is that on normal difficulty the game is very easy until season 5, then the difficulty seems to spike up very hard. The problem is the next difficulty up seems to be way to hard. I wish they would iron out the difficulty spikes and make it a much smoother ramp up.			"

												This game is more of a tactical RPG in the mechanics of something like Fire Emblem than a Power Ranger management sim.  You have fixed progression both in the game and in the story.The game however is enjoyable and is a pretty standard tactics game. It doesn't tell you some information I wish it did ( Enemies movement, your own attack damage, cool downs on enemy abilites), however if you play it on normal or easy the game won't demand that much from you.Hard should only be played by those willing to obtain massive amounts of salt.

												Overall: 9/10Combat:  8/10:  Combat system consists of move and attack phase with the additional options to go into teamwork mode or use free actions.  You gain audience members as you defeat badguys, achieve mission objectives, and do special moves or use teamwork.  The common enemies are just that - common, you will see the same enemies throughout the game though they upgrade in power and stats (as do you).  The bosses are great, as with most of the game they are made with humor and they have unique skills and play styles.  There is another type of combat you go into, I dont want to spoil it but if you watched power rangers you probably know what it is.  Generally this mode of combat has you fighting and gaining combos which power up special moves.  During the enemy attack phase you play a mini game where you try to click at the right moment to minimize damage.  I give combat 8/10 because the difficulty scales weird.  I felt underpowered initially but by midway into the game I was stomping on most missions.K I'll finish this review later I gtg for now.  My Truly Honest Opinion: Get this game, you won't regret it.  It doesn't matter if you're a 90's kid or if you watched power rangers (though it makes it all the more better),  if you did not get any of its references or jokes I still feel this game is solid and worth the 15 dollars.

												Chroma Squad is full of style with its fun writing, simple yet engaging gameplay, and so close to copyright infringement for all its references it's not even funny. In the game you control a group of people that run a live-action power rangers rip off show where they fight evil baddies and have huge mecha fights. Before you start one of these levels though (referred to as episodes in game), you have to micromanage your money at your studio (It is a t.v. show after all), in this section you purchase upgrades for your studio and purchase equipment for characters and such and it is surprisingly engaging how much thought I personally put in to figure out where to put my resources, did I want to put more money towards purchasing materials to craft cardboard box equipment, or did I want to invest in marketing agencies to increase my fanbase and reap extra benefits for a few episodes? It gives you enough to manage without overwhelming you. The combat is your typical tactical rpg with skills and classes and such,however there is a nice little temawork mechanic where if you set a character to teamwork mode you can assist other teammates in team attacks and acrobatics for more movement adding a little extra depth to the combat. Mecha fights play differently as when you're fighting bigger monsters you play a sort of risk-reward turn based game, you basically have hit chance and damage multiplier, whenever you attack and hit the monster you get to keep combo-ing them with attacks and other abilities and as long as you land hits, for every successful hit your damage for the next attack goes up, however it has a lower chance of hitting and when you miss it becomes the monsters turn, this also employs a decent amount of strategy but can ultimately feel like luck sometimes, its still enjoyable and doesn't detract from the main gameWhen it comes to customization this game handles that aspect very well allowing customization of not only characters, but even the customization of the company, you can name the super hero squad whatever you like as well as the mechas and what they shout when they suit up, heck if you wanted to you could even theme the whole thing around butts! Butt Squad! Mecha Butt! Butter up! There is a great amount of customization in the game!Overall it comes down to this:Do you like Power ranger esque tactical rpgs with funny parody writing, lots of customization, and fun gameplay, while micromanaging your own butt studio?Then Chroma Squad is for you8/10			"

												I haven't played many Tactical RPGs but this game is very enjoyable, both in its gameplay and its satire/parody. From trying to figure out how you're going to kick the crap out of a boss while dealing with his henchmen, or trying to figure out which ad agency to go with, the game has some surprising depth to it. It certainly has some places where I wish the developers had varied up the combat and non-combat gameplay. All in all, I really enjoy this game.

												Time to save the world with mild Gymnastics. Chroma Squad is about a small team of stunt men that get sick of thier old boss and deside to start their own Power Rangers like show. The gameplay has you using five different squad members in a grid based arena fighting some waves on enemies and a boss. The game's main difficulty is based on if you choose to the the mission objectives, from hit the boss every turn, win in 5 turns, or finish the boss with a finisher. The game is filled with references that just comes and goes from video games, to pop culture the games has cheesy diologue. The crafting system is somewhat of a mess so I just stick to the shop. The mec combat is bare bone with realy no differences with attacks just the animation that happens. But even with thous complants it acctualy makes the game more true to how a noraml Power Rangers epiosode happens, (story, simple fight, transform, beat boss, boss gets bigger, mec battle, end episode). Overall the campyness and the gameplay make me suggest this game if you have the money and a week end to waist. P.S. The narrirator spells poorly			"

Knights of Pen and Paper is a fun little RPG that proves turn-based battling is not dead, as much as Sqaure Enix wants to believe. Chroma Squad is a super amazing turn based game that combines Power Rangers shamelessly with the level of strategy of a game like Final Fantasy Tactics, with a bright, humorous and atypical sentai storyline. I love it.			"

												Decided to grab this game since I liked Tactics RPGs, and wanted something bright and colorful. Came into the game with pretty ""meh"" expectations and was blown out of the water.As someone who watched Power Rangers when I was little, this game is an absolute nostalgia trip, while at the same time parodying a lot of the tropes of the sentai genre. The game starts with the protagonists getting a tutorial from their overbearing boss before quitting to form their own sentai studio. You get to name all your rangers, choose their colors (Even if the palette is rather limited), their mecha, their catchphrases, etc. Though this has no impact on gameplay whatsoever, it adds nicely to the fantasy of running your own show. Gameplay is a relatively simple TRPG where you can only have one of each class, Assist, Tech, Assault, Scout, and Lead. This prevents a lot of the cheese strategies that are common in TRPGs like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. This game's difficulty in actual fights is usually pretty low. Instead the difficulty comes from getting your Audience meter filled up and then keeping it filled. The best way to fill it up is by doing flips, team moves, special attacks, and Director's Instructions, which are special submissions that can range from ""Don't lose any of your team members"" to ""win in 5 turns"" to ""Defeat the boss before defeating any minions."" The gameplay, despite being turnbased, really does a great job of showing how a sentai show usually plays out, and its very easy to see how cool everything would look to the eyes of a child watching the show at home. The only major gameplay flaw is that my scout always felt useless. Next to the rapid-fire skills of the Tech, the massive healing from the Assist, the raw damage and acrobatics bonus of the Assault, and the tankiness of the Lead, the Scout... moves an extra space every turn. This would be alright if his damage were anything special, but either my choice of actor or gear for my scout meant that he was consistently doing less damage than the healer. Though the scout does get several crowd control abilties, they all require him to be in the midst of battle, and the Scout's frailty means that these are very risky to use past Season 3.Graphics are psuedo 16-bit, bright colorful and cheery graphics with some great sprite art. Not quite on the same level as Undertale's sprite art, but its all still very appealing. Boss designers are all unique and, with a few exceptions, creative. Though you'll be fighting in th same 7 or so locals a lot, I'm willing to write that up as part of the parody. Besides, the locations are all great looking and have enough functional differences from one another to keep you on your toes.That's not to say the game is perfect. While the game is generally humorous, there are more than a few spots where I felt as though the game was expecting me to laugh and I didn't. Mecha fighting is pretty boring and one dimensional, and is usually the worst part of any mission its included in, which is a shame since a lot of its moves and parts are references to Mecha anime like Gurren Lagann and NGE, references I would appreciate a lot more if it wasn't part of the most boring part of the game. There's crafting, which is already a very played out mechanic that seems to pop up in every game nowadays, but at least here it fits the fantasy of everything on a sentai show being handmade and crappy looking. There's also multiple things that seem to ride the line between satire and unironic crapiness. When you reach Season 3, most of that season's plot revolves around your Lead growing an ego, which is a trite and boring plot line used in every sentai show ever. Are you trying to make fun of these trite and boring plots, Chrome Squad, or was your plot for Season 3 just trite and boring? Or did I just answer my own question?Despite those flaws, I'd be wrong if I said this game was bad. The game just has so much heart and dedication put into it, the gameplay is fun, the visuals were colorful and the plot is meta-tastic goofiness. While the game didn't make me burst out laughing or bawl my eyes out, it was just so delightful I can't help but recommend it. If you love Tactics RPGs or Sentai shows, consider it a double recommendation.			"

Having team work and acrobatics effect audience levels was an interesting mechanic that allowed to the player to decide on how much of either to do to maximize the attendance to gain more fans/money per episode. The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.Having different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.Storyline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.One thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs. During a level that had a Boss Mob, could have had the minion's designs centered around that particular Boss in the later stages. It's understandable at the beginning since it is representing the beginning stages of a starter company.			"

												Good game - the isometric combat is fun due to the characters having not just different abilities, but such different abilities that it feels good when you figure out a way they can co-operate to take down a monster. For example in one of the later levels I had to kill the boss with a certain character (""A"") - 4 of the 6 team members were knocked out, the 2 survivors only had a few points of health left and were surrounded by powerful enemies - but the medic was *just* able to run inbetween A and the boss, so that A could leapfrog across the screen and give the boss one last punch, which was enough to win. The game is entirely set-piece scenarios, but the whole thing was like that: if someone scores a critical hit in a round all the tactics have to adapt. The other good thing is that the combat system rewards you for using sentai-hero logic, rather than X-Com logic. It's not about finding a weakness and exploting it, it's about trying and failing and returning again in a stronger form.There are some downsides. Only 1 gamesave. There aren't any random levels which I think is quite a bold decision: the bosses and stage layouts are little works of art: I can see that just bashing randomly-placed waves of minions would get dull. But I'd still have liked to try it - some games have a horde mode where you survive as long as possible, even if it didn't work in practice it would have made me appreciate the scripting more, I think.A side effect of everything being tightly scripted (except what actually happens in a battle) is that you can't build up or replenish resources (money and crafting materials) so if you wanted to go back and try a different character build then you couldn't (not that there are many, it isn't RPG-ish, just that you can select a couple of types of equipment for each of the 5-6 set characters). The writing is a bit odd: the overarching plot is somehow *even more* disjointed than Power Rangers, and they have tried to make *every* *single* *line* into a joke: but the layer of abstraction inbetween and the way they set each episode up to satirize the genre is ingenious - almost worthy of Charlie Kaufman at points. The stunt actors are on the way to film a scene, but monsters kidnap one of them, and when the others rescue her the first thing they ask is whether she has brought any food back (on the story's logic she was off the set).The mecha battles are both disappointing and an excellent rendition of kaiju battles. Round 1: you win. Round 2: they win. Round 3: it's really close but you power attack charges up again just in the nick of time. The mecha's abilities upgrade, the monsters' abilities change, but the traditional pattern is honoured. They're only short, so it isn't annoying - but a tiny bit more mechanics wouldn't have gone amiss like choosing which weapons to take into which fights. In a real super-robot series they would have occasionally had the kindly scientist invent a jetpack so it could fight a flying monster, or something - just for variety.Overall great fun though.			"

												Did you (or do you) like Power Rangers?  Did you watch Power Rangers even after sprouting pubic hair?  Shameful, shameful pubic hair?  Yes?  Great.  You'll absolutely love this games.It's tactical, the combat is fun and rewarding, the music is excellent, and the systems are deep and engaging.  Hiring actors, naming them and your studio, buying/crafting gear for you squad - all of these scrath an itch a RPG fan will likely be very familiar with and appreciated.  The premise and writing are cheesey, but that is abosolutely what the devs were going for and they nail it.  If you're a fan of FF Tactics, Fire Emblem, or any games in similar genres you will enjoy this.  If you like RPGs you will enjoy this.  If you've watched Power Rangers and loved it at some point in your life, you will love this.  Great to see something like this in gaming.  Got as a gift but will buy and gift to somebody else to support.  Great job on this one devs.			"

												This game remind me when I was young. I like 5-colors-rangers such as Jet Man, Power Ranger, etc.Today Chroma Squad bring me my old memory.The game Chroma Squad simulated you as a director of Sentai TV show, but more than that, you can control your Sentai squad to defeat enemies (both minions and bosses) just like turn-based game. You can upgrade your Sentai suit, gloves, helmet, weapons and much more.You know, when the boss of episode was died in first place, its will come back alive with bigger version of the boss. So you have to call your Robot to fight with the boss, and yes! you can upgrade your big-robot as well.If you missing your old memory about your favorited Sentai squad. Just buy this game!			"

												Fantastic Game, in the vein of Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy: Tactics and Ogre Battle series. Control is intutitive and the colours are bright and vibrant - just like the Sentai Shows of old. The humor is solid - if a bit childish, but that didn't stop me guffawing at some of them.Bugs are to be expected - but so far I've been lucky. Hopefully everything will be all smoothed out in the coming weeks.I'd buy it just to see how far you'd get on the harder difficulties - or to highlight how ridiculous a team consisting of a Robot, a Cartoon Beaver, an Alien, a Furry and an overweight nerd kicks so much bum.Overall it's a solid product - one I've glad I've bought.Now if you'd excuse me, I'm off to direct the Hyper Flare Fighters with their Hyperovercompensator to fight crime, promote justice and just generally geek out with their fans.

												Now, I know what you must be thinking about this game at the moment...  ""What?  A Power Rangers rip off game?  What the fruity pebbles is this doing on steam?""  Well, I will tell you what the fruity pebbles this is doing on steam, It is being one of the better games on steam as of this moment.It is quite literally a parody of power rangers, because it was quite literally inspired by the same show.  The combat system revolves around the turn-based combat system, but with tactical movements and everything.  You have your basic healer, fast person, tech person, heavy hitter, and balanced fighter.  Using these five (or less) characters, you spend actions fighting an enemy squad of minions which would be followed up by a boss.  Since the characters you are playing as are ""actors of their own Sentai Show,"" a lot of their armors, weapons, skills, and enemies would look studio-made (or for lack of better words, artificial).  Also, if you have a vast knowledge of puns, jokes, or can catch onto references or parodical-cameos of other characters of the past 15 years, then you will chuckle at all of the things Chroma Squad throws at you.There are also SUPER ROBOT VS. KAIGU {Sorry if I butchered the name} battles, where you go into your own Power Ranger-esque Robot that would fight giant sized versions of the bosses on top of the cities.  And you can customize even your own robot...  OH, and speaking of customization, you get to customize your squad (appearance AND names AND species AND ranger color), your studio name, the hero group's name, the robot's name, and a whole lot of other things!  Meaning you can make the squad as personal as you want :3!Also, this game's soundtract is very addicting, as I would catch m.yself not playing the game as I just enjoy the amazingness of the soundtrack that plays in the battles.And this game is very replayable as there are three seperate endings...  as of this moment, I haven't seen any of them, and I have only heard of one of them and I hate one of my friends who spoiled a little bit of that ending for me >:(...  But since I hope you haven't been spoiled yet either, I assure you that if all of the endings are as good as what I heard one of the endings was going to be, it will be amazing!In conclusion, this game should be on the top of you MUST BUY RIGHT NOW lists, as it is addicting, has a great soundtrack, has SO MUCH CUSTOMIZATION, and has laughs from the start of the game AAAALL the way to the end.  You'll enjoy it, I swear on it!  :D			"

												Chroma Squad is a great strategy game with a playstyle much like the XCOM where you can move your character and then choose to attack, move again, use a skill, or use teamwork to move your other characters or for a team attack. With a heavy Power Ranger feel, some rather hilarious and quite a bit of strategy both recording episodes and setting up your characters and mecha, Chroma Squad is a great game and I look forward to what Behold Studios has in store for the future.

												A very fun tacticle RPG with some managment style options and even a split storyline. While not graphicly superior you can still tell the dev tem put a lot of love into this project. I have already beaten it once and still love playing and trying diffrent actors, story decisions (Though there's not a lot of them.), skill setups, and of course the Mecha fights (in this aspect it is compleatly absurd how many part choices/combinations you can choose from  to custom your Kaijou whupping experiance!) . To be honest I kept waiting for a sale cause I was unsure, but after missing the last one due to finances (It was steams christmas/New Year sale so i kinda burned a hole in my pocket on other games!) I said buck it all and got it at full price when i had some spare cash. Still not regretting that decision, it's a very fun game!			"

												Simple Turn-based tactics RPG that brings in a few unique mechanics to the genre.Gameplay straddles a fine line between making things intuitive but not too simple while giving you just enough but not too much stuff to play around with. The crafting system is multiple layers of RNG buggery and it leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth sometimes.  You can work around it but meh.The pacing is fairly on point and the game never really overstays its welcome.There are Super Robot Fights, though it's easily the weakest part of the game currently.  They're also gathering feedback and have announced an overhaul, so this point may become moot in a couple of months.Aesthetics are colorful with a strong indie feel (it's an indie, kickstarted game so yeah).  16 bit and the like.The writing assumes that you've watched at least 2-3 episodes of power rangers and have a passing knowledge of certain internet memes that came out within a specific timeframe (I had to google a couple things).  I enjoyed it.  It has the right kind of corn and ham that'll get me to sensibly chuckle most of the time.and again, the pacing is pretty strong despite the source material.I highly recommend configuring your super sentai team away from the defaults to fit your preferences as it can greatly improve your gameplay experience.  My team was called the Rude Rollers, they Rolled Out, and my robot was named Pablo Escobar (he shanked giant monsters).A single run may take like 6-8 hours and there are multiple endings.			"

												Chroma Squad is a good call back to Power Rangers/Super Sentai nostalgia with a pixel art style and turn based tactics. The mechanics are fun but a bit simplistic - you manage your TV studio, buy upgrades and props. Your characters are fixed based on your choices through the entire series, and while there are 3 different ending the game is a little long for being stuck with those characters. You do gain skills with each season and there's an incentive to replay but I found the mid/second last act a bit repetitive. Overall a fun little game, worth getting on sale.			"

												This game is great for anyone who likes Tactical RPGs or Power Rangers/Super Sentai. I love the  Retro style graphics, Customization, witty banter and overall gameplay. This game proves that graphics are not everything, which I feel is a very large problem in modern games. So if you have the money i definetly Reccomend this game			"

												I received Chroma Squad in the Humble Monthly Bundle earlier this year.  Having never heard of it, I decided to give it a chance.  This is a turn based game where you control a team of five stunt actors who decide to start their own power rangers show.  Every 'battle' is one episode, so you go through the setup and fundraising for the studio and costumes and such, and then enter filming, which is essentially the episode.  Failing to win the battle causes you to get bad ratings on your show.  If you have positive feelings towards Power Rangers from your childhood, and you like lighter-side story centered RPG strategy games, you'd probably like this.  Its strong points are numerous; it has item crafting, a good story, challenging but not overly brutal strategy, combat is fun, good humor, likeable characters, nostalgia (without leaning on it too heavily), etc.Weak points might be that some mechanics can be a little tedious.  Kaiju battles never got boring for me (there's like 8 or so in the game) but they're all pretty similar.  Also, some people don't like pixel graphics, so if that's not your thing then move on.  Also, the game tries (and succeeds) in capturing the campy nature of power rangers style shows, so if that's going to make you cringe then you could consider it a weak feature.			"

Product received for free
												Full Disclosure: As a member of press, I received this game for free from the developer. I also make a cameo in the game. I was not otherwise compensated.Chroma Squad hits so many different points for me. Old school style, turn based tactical RPG, with a great motif, throwback graphics and great music. Created as a love letter to shows like Power Rangers and Super Sentai, Behold Studios created a great game for fans of the tokusatsu drama, turn based RPGS, or quirky stories. Your team of heroes (named by you) is highly customizable, with tons of items, special moves, and so many tricks between characters that you'll be hard pressed to play the same game twice. This game is definitely a recommendation.			"

												I was a big fan of Power Rangers way back when so, seeing as how this is a Power Rangers-esque game, I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. It will definitely remind you of Power Rangers(as well as other pop-culture icons) but in a very humorous way. It is also a fairly in-depth tactical RPG with crafting elements(Hooray for cardboard!). I found this game to be very enjoyable & addicting.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The customiazation is amazing, allowing you to get multiple types of weapons and armors that adds a whole new level of strategy. The game itself is fun and tactical, making you feel like a super hero from a Sentai show. There's only one thing I don't like about this game: Fighting an enemy who you have to do a group attack on, but he can teleport. That is my only bad thing to say about it. I recommend getting this whenever you can.			"

												I can't reccomend this game enough. You control a group of stuntmen who are filming their own action show based on the Power Rangers. You control the finance, the studio upgrades, the costumes, and everything in between, as well as participating in the actual fights. If you're a fan of turn based RPGs and the Power Rangers, this game is perfect for you. It took me 24 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game on the hardest difficulty, though I had to switch it to medium at the very end becasue the final fight was so brutal.+Good Music+ Nice animations+ Customization+ Wacky bosses+ 3 difficulty levels, and the hardest one is actually challenging+ 3 different endings+ Good progression through the seasons. (There are 5)+ Fun Story+ Mech battles+ Cute dialog- Combat gets a little stale occasionally- Mech battles are decided mainly on chance- Not very many enemy types- looking at the achievments spoiled the story			"

												The game is very repetitive. It started becoming a chore after the 1st season.The abilities are lackluster.There are quite a few imbalances. For example:-The hard mode is stupid difficult in the final mission in season 1 due to the lack of various base abilities. Perhaps it becomes a bit reasonable after season 1 but still..-Normal mode is just way too easy. There is no middle ground.-You can mainly obtain cash OR items for crafting as the game is setup to make it difficult to obtain both at a reasonable amount. This makes you miss content.While the script is tongue on cheek, it starts getting boring, silly and predictable after season 1.Basically this is a very dumbed down version of X-com tactical fighting. If you are between the ages of 5-80 yrs, I recommend trying X-com 1 or 2.I understand it is an indie game but I just felt I'd save some players the time wasted here. There are way better games out there and X-com enemy unknown is pretty cheap atm.			"

												If you like tactical RPGs and if you like games which do not take themselves seriously then this might be for you. The graphics may not look like much but it does the job. The story is predictable but a funny homage to the old TV shows running the same format. For completionists there is even more gametime in this title because there are different endings depending on one particular choice you make during a playthrough.Bad things probably are that there is only one save game per playthrough (at least I have not found a way to create multiple save games) which kind of limits your possibilities to experiment. The other negative thing for me were the mecha fights. It was fun in the beginning but later on outstayed it's welcome. The hit chance RNG can be frustrating because sometimes 90% just feel like 10%.			"

												It's an easy to pick up tactical RPG inspired by super sentai themed shows (aka Power Rangers, if you're in the USA). The premise is light-hearted and often lends itself to some enjoyable comedy. The balance between RPG and TV studio management at first might seem like a chore, but growing both sides turned out to be enjoyable for me. Struggling to get a leg up and gradually improving your team's costumes to get more fans to get more stuff for your studio/cast is a rewarding cycle of endeavors. I hadn't even heard of this game until I got it in a Humble Bundle with some other things I wanted. I am not disappointed so far!One thing I didn't like was that the mech battles seem to be driven by RNG in the worst possible way. 75% chance to hit = you will miss 90% of the time. Just a heads up.update: if absolutely awful final bosses are a pet peeve of yours, you should avoid this game. 99% of it is *sooo* good. And then the final boss is a teleporting enemy with the worst arena layout. Get close to attack, he teleports and then it takes your squad like 4 turns to reach him. 2 hits, then he teleports across the arena again. Instead of being strategic, it's just unnecessarily drawn out and boring. The game still gets a positive rec from me, but I don't know what the devs were thinking when they made the finale.			"

												A fun little squad based power rangers inspired RPG. I was a little turned off because the game's setting is kind of weird. You are power rangers actors who decide to turn around and actually BE power rangers and fight monsters. This is done for 'comedy' purposes so you fight with cardboard armor yet for some strange reason your cardboard armor and megazord actually are legitimate fighting machines? If you can move past that the tactical system is deep enough and engaging with a few strategic decisions to keep in mind. It somehow manages several multiple endings and party compositions depending on your choices which is kind fo cool and the overall power rangers vibe is strong enough to carry it through.			"

												Just beat it for my first time, it is a fun few hours of gameplay and since they're are multiple endings and diffrent routes I will be playing it once or twice soon to see them. If you love the Power Rangers then this will be extra funny to you I bet. I loved the villain, loved the growth of the characters, I really just loved most of this game. They're are a few issues I have with it though for example it is annoying that if you loose your Assist member you loose 95% of all healing and can never revive anyone unles you Chromatize/power up, and the fact most of the NPC allies aren't seen or mentioned again was a little disapointing though I understood why. All in all I really loved this game especially when I finished it and got to see the Villains 'dance' to the ending theme, kind of wished your squad was dancing during this as well to celebrate they're job well done but whatever.If they make a sequel or DLC I am likely to buy it and I am not the biggest fan of PC gaming, but I would love to see if they keep this story going, have the timeline of this game alter the next, or if we get to see the current squad follow something like the power rangers with the changing of powers and rosters because it's mentioned in game that happened before.Again really love this game and think it is at the least worth a try.

												It's a fun, light-hearted game! It's got good (not fantastic) music, a decent set of strategy mechanics, a fun and mostly light story, giant mechs, and an engaging, but lightweight TV show budget simulatorIt's a jack-of-all-games. It's a turn based strategy, 2-D mech fighting, TV show simulator. Though, by the end of the 4th season (out of 5), money management ceases to exist because your set is bankrolled enough to fund the wildest expenditures with ease. Combat is also too easy, with some straight up OP characters and pants-on-head AI. The enemy will spread out it's attacks amongst your team rather than congregating together to fight a single weak enemy, thus losing is almost laughably hard. That being said, team acrobatics, team attacks, and finding the sweet spot with AOE attacks are honestly delightful.It's not super strategic, but it's a genuinely fun and widely appealing indie game.

												As a huge toku fanboy, I was excited to see a video game based on Super Sentai. One that kept in the spirit of sentai by parodying it, and at the same time, paying tribute to it. I've been following this game since Kickstarter, but only more recently got a chance to buy it with the Steam Sale.As far as the gameplay goes, it actually managed to exceed my expectations. Everything is controlled by mouse and things like the the teamwork mechanic and skills you can switch out are things I've seen in other games, but this is one of the better ones in recent memory. Teamwork is more than just an extra person to help you attack, you can also use teamwork to get to spaces much farther on the field and pull off specials using it. This really helped me when trying to accomplish the special requirements. The game never felt imbalanced, too, which is awesome because it's the easiest trap to fall in with strategy RPGs.When you start a new game, you're given the option of picking your team. While I wish there was more options for party members (DLC/Chroma Squad 2?), what characters they do have are very diverse and I think they have just a right amount of options for character selections. The plot itself is the exact same regardless of who you pick, so the main reason to do this is to decide your character's starting stats and which ones you would like to see for the rest of the game, which I really like a lot. The easy way out would have been to just always have them in the suit and choose their stats, or just have your five chosen for you. It even allows there to be a possible lesbian romance later on in the game depending on what gender you pick a certain ranger. Your main five are completely customizable.As for the story itself, it's not like a mind blowing story or anything like that, but it does it's job of feeling like the power ranger/super sentai shows the game is based on. The end goal is defeating a big bad guy, and on the way, you defeat a ton of different monsters ranging from ridiculous to...well, more ridiculous. There's also trophies, multiple endings, storyline branches, and three difficulties to add some replay value.There's one place this game falls flat for me, and I don't think it's major, because it only really started to bother me nearing the end. The humor in this game can be funny at times, and then at other times can get a little groan worthy with the memes. I don't mind a lot of the refernces. The non-comedic ones for sentai fans in the weapons/equipment/skills that referenced a bunch of different sentai series all made me smile when I realized the references, and certain jokes work really well. At one point, they reference the ""What has science done"" image with the Seagull with massive biceps, and jokes like that and the backstreet boys/lady gaga references work really well, but when it's just meme, after meme, after meme, it starts to get a little grating, not unlike being in the presence of an middle aged person who goes on Reddit.Still, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun and quirky little RPG. It's definitely worth the price. I still have two more ending paths and minor storyline branches to get, so I may update this in the future, but having just completed my first playthrough, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.

												Oh boy, if you're a fan of Fire Emblem this game is just for you. Being the Strategy RPG that it is with the combination of sentai (via Power Rangers) makes for a great concept. Something that takes it away from the feeling of being an RPG such as Fire Emblem is that each character in your party doesn't level up independently. Not that this is a bad thing, but it's something to take note of since your party only gets stronger progressing through the seasons. Another concept that's hard for me to get behind is the fact that mech fights are based on RNG. I can't really be upset by this since it works more well than imagined, it's just a gamble to fight. Other than that, this game has witty humor, silly references, great pixel art, nice tunes, and a compelling story arc. I highly recommend getting a load of this game for how underrated it is.			"

												If you like tactical RPGs and if you like games which do not take themselves seriously then this might be for you. The graphics may not look like much but it does the job. The story is predictable but a funny homage to the old TV shows running the same format. For completionists there is even more gametime in this title because there are different endings depending on one particular choice you make during a playthrough.Bad things probably are that there is only one save game per playthrough (at least I have not found a way to create multiple save games) which kind of limits your possibilities to experiment. The other negative thing for me were the mecha fights. It was fun in the beginning but later on outstayed it's welcome. The hit chance RNG can be frustrating because sometimes 90% just feel like 10%.			"

												Ahhh Chroma Squad, where to begin... I know!TL;DRChroma squad is a fantastic action startegy game with an in depth, self aware story. With a well written set of dialogue, and a surprisingly deep combat system Chroma Squad is sure to please strategy fans... even if you haven't seen power rangers!Chroma Squad, in an depth action strategy game that never ceases to amaze me! With large a (and albeit, very obvious) inspiration from Sabans Power Ranger. Chroma Squad is a game that will make you want to relive your childhood... and at the same time want to destroy it. You see Chroma Squad's difficulty system can be changed on the fly for those of you who don't want to think... If you do enjoy a challenge however, play the game on hard mode (warning! PLAN ABOUT THREE STEPS AHEAD ON HARD). This game can, and will kick you in the rear so hard you won't remember what you planned to do afterwards.Chroma Squad has a very (from what I have played) unique system called teamwork. This system allows your teamates to perform double, tiple, even quadruple attacks (similar fire emblem fates), but there is a catch... teamwork is the only way to use your finisher (a vital tool later on) , and can allow your team to move further on the set! Now you may be wondering what can make this game so difficult, IMO I believe Chroma Squad is one of the few games that got difficulty right. It doesn't just swarm you with hundreds of cheap, or extremely powerful enemies, atleast not in the beginning. Chroma Squad has a real sense of growth meaning that as you get stronger the game can and WILL adapt.Mecha battles, this feature surprised me. when I had my first mecha battle I was pleasently surprised. Though simple the mecha battle can really make you question your ""startegic genius"" and really mke you pull your hair out if not careful.To sum it up, this game seems very simple, and easy on your first run. That fact can be a lie, the game can be very challenging to the extreme on the harder difficulties, and the AI can be very ruthless and capitalize on every mistake you make. The premise is great, and the game has this atmosphere that I find hard to explain, but enjoy. The mecha battles are a nice break from the normal gameplay. Worth a buy. if you watched Power Rangers for sure!My score: 5/5 (6/5 if you enjoyed Power Rangers as a child)			"

												A fun little squad based power rangers inspired RPG. I was a little turned off because the game's setting is kind of weird. You are power rangers actors who decide to turn around and actually BE power rangers and fight monsters. This is done for 'comedy' purposes so you fight with cardboard armor yet for some strange reason your cardboard armor and megazord actually are legitimate fighting machines? If you can move past that the tactical system is deep enough and engaging with a few strategic decisions to keep in mind. It somehow manages several multiple endings and party compositions depending on your choices which is kind fo cool and the overall power rangers vibe is strong enough to carry it through.			"

												This game is overall a fantastic game. It has very fun gameplay, a pretty decent story, and good mechanics to it, but there is a huge flaw with the game in my opinion and that is the mech fights. The reason I think they are flawed is because the fights are extremely luck based. It doesn't have any strategy to it at all. It's pretty much, ""Am I feeling lucky enough to punch again with a 74% chance to hit and leave myself completely vulenerable if I miss and even if I do hit, am I feeling lucky enough to do it again with a now 64% chance to hit?"" You don't get to upgrade your mech very much either which just makes the upgrades extremely obselete the futher you go into the game. My mech is fully upgraded with the max studio buff giving an extra 15% health to my mech, but after 4th season, I have not been able to win any mech battle without failing at least once. the mech battles just seriously disappoint me because other than that there isn't really much to complain about aside from a few non-intrusive bugs and because of how good the rest of the game is, it just accentuates to terribleness of the mech battles. My overall review of the game still comes out to be an 8/10 anyway.			"

												I love this game to bits.Absolutely zero regrets about buying it.I just finished playing through on the Normal difficulty. I wouldn't consider myself good at strategy games, and I found it to be generally rather easy most of the time (while trying to accomplish every Director's Instruction). I also never had to replay any of the levels, though I did put a good amount of thought between missions on what to purchase and upgrade. Anyone who often plays or enjoys strategy games should probably pick the hardest difficulty if they're looking for a proper challenge. It's there, though it probably wouldn't be the hardest game out there, by far.There is so much to love about this game. Adorable and lovably drawn art, simplified but thought-out gameplay, and a very funny and self-aware representation of Indie Sentai filmmaking. You even get to pick your characters out of a good list of choices, choose their colour, and names. The costumes even change depending on what they have equipped, seriously.It comes out as 'one-of-those-games-that-aren't-really-that-deep-but-it-really-doesn't-need-to-be' kind of games. It isn't the longest game out there either (it does have multiple endings though), so if you've only got a few dollars to throw around, you ought to wait for a sale.You have to play this one and really feel the love and spirit put into it. If you even remotely enjoy the strategy genre or enjoy Sentai-style films like Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, or anything of the sort- this is practically a MUST-play.			"

												If you want a nice throwback nintendo handheld feel of a game than you should buy chroma squad. The gameplay doesn't rip off most games of the same genre like fire emblem. The story is told to you in a comical and fun way. The game isn't all that challenging but the fun value of the game allows you to look past that. Overall 4 out of 5 if not 3.5 out of 5. I would definitely buy this game if i had to choose again.			"

It essentially allows you to create your own Power Rangers team.I have had an enemy with 0% dodge chance dodge a team attack, but that's only happened once and I've simply chalked it up to a one-time bug.

												I really liked this.I was never into the Power Rangers myself, nor a lot of the anime this game pays tribute to. But I don't think that's really required here to appreciate that this game is a love letter to cheesy TV and all the fun people have had with it. Everything in this game is so goofy and so fourth wall breaking wink wink, but it's done in a way I found really charming and sweet, as opposed to, say, Retro City Rampage which just bashed you over the head with how funny it thought it was every 5 seconds (hot tip: it wasn't).There are about five million of these faux-16 bit games now, but here is one that actually uses that effect correctly and accurately. The target audience for this game is, at least in part, people like me that actually remember when 16-bit was real and spectacular, and tactics RPG's were just an emerging thing. There's just enough depth here to be interesting without being something overwhelming to work out, both in terms of the combat and the crafting system. The gimmick with the game is you are playing a fight scene in each episode of the show, and you can get bonuses for fulfilling director's instructions, things like ""kill three enemies on a turn"" or ""use team attacks 4 times"", these add enough spice for completionist types without, technically, being neccessary to advance the game.The game isn't flawless, I hit a couple annoying but inconsequential bugs (there's an annoying one with one of the Space Sherrifs where his finisher doesn't actually count as a finisher). There are a couple spelling errors that aren't part of the on-purpose narrator gag (breath/breathe mixup happened at least twice). And I really, really wish this game had saving mid-chapter.But on the whole, I had way more fun with this than I could have ever anticipated. It's cute, almost disgustingly so. But not quite. I got this in the Humble Freedom Bundle which was so large it was inevitable there were several indie games I'd never heard of there. This was the first of those I tried becaue the premise of ""some stuntmen quit a TV show to start their own knockoff"" is a hilarious, great premise. And I really did enjoy the game from start to finish.Save earth with friendship instead of with ultraviolence? Well, why ever not?			"

It's more streamlined and casual-friendly, since there are fewer elements -- no experience points (just upgrades and equipment), no world map (just a main hub) and so on -- but it is still quite difficult on the highest difficulty setting.

												It was hard for me to decide whether to recommend this or not. On the one hand, you've got some fairly smart Power Rangers/Sentai parody work, a fun storyline, and a great aesthetic. On the other hand, the tactical RPG aspect is... very unpolished. Even on medium difficulty, Season 3 really ramps up the challenge level, driven purely by poor design aspects. Unlike most TRPGs, there's no way to undo a move action if you realize you've gone to the wrong square. Healing is also ridiculously thin on the ground given how much damage enemies do the further you go in the game. I had one of my dudes (the scout, who has about average health) taken from full health to zero in a single round.In the end, though, it's still pretty fun, even if the percentages on the material recycling in the crafting menu are complete BS.

												Not a game for me. Reasons off the top of my head:- Story, while ok for a short joke, is extremely boring and cliché for a long game. The conversations between the team members really don't help; ""I am not good enough"" -- ""you are an important team member and we all love you"" -- ""I now know I am good enough"" is just infantile writing.- Mecha fighting is trivial with one repeated QTE that is just annoying. Yet is still a gear check, so if you were silly enough to not upgrade your mecha a lot in the start, you can get to impossible fights.- Fighting with your team is reasonably varied, but gets very repetetive after you get far enough into the game.- Fight setup is sloooooooow. Monsters arrive one at a time when fighting is about to start, and later stages have up to 20-25 monsters slowly jumping in and moving into place. Doesn't help when certain fights also do similar summoning of mobs/mines/etc. during them.- Cutscene skipping is not a thing. At best you can fast forward (much too slowly), while the screen shakes, which quite frankly is annoying after the first time you use it.- Studio upgrades (base upgrades, essentially) are not interesting and by mid-game there aren't any more new ones.- Crafting, while interesting, has the very big weak point, that you buy upgrade packs with random items in it, which makes getting specific items annoying. Also, one item for mecha upgrades can only be found in mid-level fights (and certain one-off event), which makes getting specific upgrades for your mecha impossible once you use the last of that item and move on to higher level fights.- I wish games would stop using the method of slowly typing spech one letter at a time for dialogue. Reading is not done by reading each letter and then building the word, it's based on recognizing the entire word and understanding what word it is, which is why you can read text even when all but the first and last letter have been jumbled up. Also, most people can read much faster than what games devs set the speech speed to.I would not recommend this unless you honestly truly love power rangers in the way that bronies love my little pony; the joke setting really doesn't work for a long game and the core gameplay is not strong enough to make up for it.

												Chroma Squad is a little, cute game that has spend a fair bit of time just laying in my library. I liked the premise and got my hands on the game, but didn't feel the pressure to try and play it for a while. I have finally decided to give it a shot, and I honestly can't say that I regret that decision. The game is a tactical RPG with minor management elements - you control a squad of five (and later - six) characters, who will fight against sets of enemy minions and bosses. I am not going to discuss a premise, because it is very clearly stated in the description. What I will say, that gameplay-wise, the game is pretty good at what it does. Game is split in two phases - episodes (which consist of combat) and studio management. The combat system is simple, but enjoyable - your characters can use simple melee attacks, weapons and their abilities. There is also a teamwork system, which allows you to attack with a few characters at the same time. In some episodes you also get control of special characters which have some unique abilities of their own. The management part of the game is less robust and in many ways confusing. You can craft equipment for your squad, you can upgrade studio equipment which comes with different bonuses, and you can choose a marketing agency, which also provides you with a set of benefits based on your fans. That part of it all is, however, fairly simplistic and lacks any real depth.The game makes good use of it's theme, and most of the game is enjoyably cheesy. If that's something you are not into, you will probably not enjoy your time with Chroma Squad. It does also take a bizzare twist half way through, but it only adds to the experience in my opinion. There is a single place where the story diverges. It isn't a huge difference, honestly, and happens very late into the game. If you are going to unlock all the achievements, you will have to play through the game three times - and about 80% of each playthrough is going to be identical, sadly.There are some minor issues that I have with the game. The mech combat is extremely repetitive, and if you are planning on finishing up the game in short period of time (I personally did last 2 seasons in one sitting), you will have to do A LOT of mech fighting. A system which is a cool idea, but execution of it is rather lackluster, and you will always be doing the same thing. No matter who you are fighting, the enemy will always have the same pattern - either three basic attacks or one large attack. You just sit there and click the same button time after time, hoping for RNG to work out for you. Another issue right now is the scarcity of information - or at least information which is not being presented in a clear way. There are some terms thrown around without much explanation at all, and at other times information that you could need at any given time is not given to you in the right place. Sure, you could remember it - but you shouldn't have to. I didn't realise you could read buffs and debuffs on your enemy until the last season, because of how unintuitive it is.  While the game has it's flaws, I would still recommend it. There is nothing that actively makes it less fun - the mech combat is a bit of a drag, and management could use more work, but the episodes themselves, with turn-based combat and abilities to use, can be really fun. It's a small and enjoyable experience overall.			"

												In this game, you play as a team of stuntmen who play Power Rangers on television, and they've gotten fed up with their director and open their own studio doing the exact same thing instead. The plot is rather tongue-in-cheek and ""dorky,"" but with a fun tone and some pleasant music along the way. The gameplay is a bit like the Shadowrun turn-based strategy games on PC if those were all about melee combat instead of ranged. You might say ""oh, like Banner Saga?"" but I would reply ""No, this is actually kinda enjoyable, so it's not that much like Banner Saga."" As with Shadowrun, you have abilities with cooldowns that give you a nice edge in combat, and the further into the game you get, the game shows you that there are higher tiers of skills to unlock, making things more interesting than just ""run over and punch a dude"" each turn.The game has three difficulty levels: one intended to just get through the game without challenge, one to get through it with a little challenge, and a tough version. I played the middle of these three options and found it to be a nice experience that does a good job of teaching you the basics. In between missions (""episodes""), you can buy new equipment for your team, as well as upgrade your studio to incur running costs that give you bonus attitbutes on missions (worth it, from what I experienced).I personally lack the interest in the narrative and the gameplay hasn't fully hooked me in enough for me to want to really continue, but this game has the rare condition of being one I'm stopping playing that I would actually recommend. I could totally see myself playing it through to completion and liking it if I had more time to spend on games that don't pull me in strong. It commits no grave offenses against the player, seems well-balanced, has a lot of heart, and seems fully intended to be a fun and different experience for gamers. If turn-based strategy, goofy/dorky plot, and/or Power Rangers put a smile on your face, this could be a good buy for you, especially on sale or Humble Bundle.			"

												So Far in these 6 hours i have enjoyed this game very much.The art style is amazing, i love how they went for this tv/pixel style.One thing i found is this game gets very hard in the later stages. If you dont like difficult games you probably should keep it on easy. This is my first turn-based stratagy game i have played and it really gets me into this genre.I would reccomend this to fans of power rangers but if you arent you may be confused and may not understand the refernces. Anyways my final verdict. -Fun Gameplay-Good Story -Good introduction into TBS Games -Gets pretty difficult.8/10 buy this game and have fun with it :).			"

												Chroma Squad is a game that begs to be great -- begs to be loved -- but just doesn't quite get there.There is something lacking to this game in its basic combat system, and the way it feels. It's difficult to describe, whether attacks just don't feel satisfying, the skills your character possessing not being as useful as they ought to be, or maybe something else that somebody else can better elaborate. It doesn't help that it's almost impossible to pin down if the AI is just a little too good or just stupid enough to get lucky too often. Having played for almost two hours, managing budget, character equipment, studio perks, etc. seems just a little too frustrating and nervewracking.The writing goes for light-hearted and funny, but it's just not up to snuff enough to be charming and actually land. Like everything else, it gets close, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Unfortunately, fixing that doesn't really make the game enjoyable.If only the combat system was made a little more in-depth and satisfying, or if studio/equipment/money management didn't seem so futile, this game could be played and enjoyed. It doesn't even require both -- just one of the two will do the trick. But because the game is as it is, it falls flat and is almost perplexingly boring. And that is such a shame, because it looks fun from the outside -- and from the inside it really feels the game deserving of Chroma Squad's hype is buried just a couple inches away, but nobody's digging deep enough to hit it.

												Cute & Fun ""Xcom-like"" tactical RPG with combats and team managment aspect. Hilarious and retro story for a 8h + campaign mode. Not much to say against it, the easy mode will be a great way for newcomers to the genre to try this type of usualy very hardcore tacticals. Sadly the gap between a too easy easy mode and a very hard ""normal"" mode kind of frustrated me. Apart from that it's a perfect try even if you don""t really like the power rangers type of tv series. At least all the more global references to the 80's tv are there.			"

												Homage to classic power rangers. The story is so indie and funny at the same time. Give the finger to your former boss and makes your own superhero TV show. This game mechanics are quirky but works well. Also, how can you not like giant robots fighting monsters? If you like final fantasy tactics, you might like this game.The game is well paced, but it is somewhat hard. Just be aware of what you buy or make for your power rangers. The stat bonuses are not immediately apparent.			"

												Great Game! Very cool Soundtrack! Made with lots of love!Funny story about a Power Rangers film crew. Very trashy and self-ironic.Fighting system is turn-based rpg-strategy mix. You can use a few skills, equip your rangers and so on. Between the battles there is micromanagement: upgrade and manage your film studio.I actually got it in Humble Bundle. Else I would not have bought it. Can recommend it for 4€ or less.			"

												this game is very likeable but it's not my cup of tea for a couple of reasons:1) terrible graphics -- i don't mind pixel-art but this is just terrible.2) the gameplay is misunderstanding, a little too simple, and cheesy3) it's not really a video game or RPG but more like a simulator4) the character progression doesn't really make much sense5) the level scenarios aren't really that funny and i find them weird6) i don't see much variation in the various ""character types"". each character has its own unique stats, but no unique abilities whatsoeveri may have forgotten a few more cons, but i really didn't find anything i liked for the most part.overall 4 out of 10			"

Chroma Squad starts as a simple Strategy Turn-Based Game but it offers many surprises. The teamwork mechanic is a simple concept that opens a lot of choices and suits well with the game genre and setting. Each character has a different role on the team and can be customizable from the name, looks, traits, abilities and equipment, making room for multiple play-styles and different tactics which make the game fell fresh and new as it proceeds. Fans of Sentai (A.K.A. Power Rangers-like shows) will be pleased to see that transforming into your Power Suit and gigantic Mech Battles actually play a role in the game.	Aesthetically the game makes use of Pixel Art with vibrant colors that suits with the lighthearted tone of Chroma Squad. The sound design is spot on with a great Sentai themed main song and a happy chiptune music that fuses together with the game’s vibe. The bosses are really interesting both in abilities and design and also very silly (like the giant pigeon with macho arms) but the minions do start to get a little repetitive specially as they get recycled as stronger versions with a different color scheme. 	The plot is not very forward thriving but it does have some intrigue right from the start and it is a fun setup for the rest of the game. You will most certainly have some good laughs with Chroma Squad as long as you are ready to read through the characters’ dialogues. Although the game is very smartly written, it may sometimes become boresome as the scripted events drag on. As mentioned the game has a very lighthearted tone and it doesn't take itself too seriously which is actually connected to the main story. • Final thoughts	Chroma Squad is a game that excels in the strategic battle gameplay with great, fun core mechanics and offers other pleasant side activities like the Mech Battles, Crafting and Studio Management which make the game flow fell fresh and non-repetitive. The direction of the story may seem a little odd sometimes as the silly, lighthearted, “not taking itself too serious” plot develops but it is a game that I recommend, specially for those who enjoy a really good squad strategy turn-based game.
