												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			"

												As of writing this I am 500+ hours in and I have to say its one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time, It's really easy to just pick up, yet it also has the ability to make you stay playing for hours on end. Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value. When I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer.Another reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same. The game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this.Other than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style.I really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible.

												The Binding of Isaac is a small game with very simple mechanics, but it will catch you with its huge amount of contents, great soundtrack and polished graphics.Sprinkled with humor and nods to gaming's past, The Binding of Isaac is a ballsy game that revels in its absurd moments. Shock value aside, you'll want to play this indie gem over and over again. It's imaginative and  utterly absorbing.I'll put it simply: If you can roll with the macabre toilet humor and if religion jokes don't put you off, AND if you enjoy games with non-optional permadeath, randomized content, tons of secrets and considerable replay value… it's hard to go wrong with The Binding of Isaac. Especially at its low price.			"

												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists....And I mean this in the best way possible.Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things.Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people.

												A stream-lined rouge-like, filled with morbid imagery and religious overtones. Gratifying combat and a punishing yet fair system of bosses and enemies. The few glitches that it holds are more than made up or with a mind bending story, compelling social commentary and a wonderful community. Pros- Consistent, skill based combat       - A multitude of bosses and enemies       - Hundreds of items (Each with their own individual effects)       - Different characters supporting multiple playstyles       - Complex metagame to masterCons- Glitchy        - Learning curve like a brick wall        - Extremely punishing of mistakes and deaths        - Thick subtext (Overkill at time  [Having to literally kill yourself as a boss])A rewarding experience which captures the journey so perfectly, the destination is rendered irrelevent.

												The game is brilliant (and sooo addictive)! One of the best indie games ever. It is interesting, hard, it has exellent dark humor and atmosphere is epic. It is the game you should take with you to a Desert Island. First you will die a lot, but then (if you are curious enough and tenacious) you'll know tricks and secrets, learn every combination and manage to do crazy amazing stuff.  Music is great, very catchy and suitable, the graphics - cute and old-school.PS Mom! I love you mom, I still do :( I will go to the basement, I will meet my inner demons, fight them and win! And you will be proud, right? Or maybe I'll just play with some dead things (that you threw there), get parasites, decide that I am a cat and can fly and kill you, being one happy and absolutely crazy boy! XoXo Isaac			"

												What can I say about The Binding of Isaac. This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.A little game with some really good working dark humor. It's very difficult but that's what makes it lasts for soo long. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those few games I own in my library that despite its unforgiving difficulty and no saves, always keeps me coming back for more.One of the reasons for this is its gameplay. The gameplay is top down shooter brilliance. While there will be times that the game will pull a♥♥♥♥♥♥move on you, (it can be quite luck based at times) you won't be blaming your death on a bug of any description. Unless you're a sore loser, but that's your fault, not the game's.While the atmosphere may gross some very few sensitive souls amongst you, it has a reason for being that way and just enhances the (probably short) experiences throughout the game. If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll feel right at home though, Edmund McMillen's the mastermind behind these two greats, and if you like his work, I also strongly recommend picking up the Basement Collection. Yes, I just recommended a game in another game's recommendation. (Recommendception!)The real reason why I love this game so damn much though, is its stellar replay value. Every single time you start a new game, (and you'll probably start many) everything will be randomized. Enemies, boss fights, of which many are very challenging, items and powerups (good luck getting them all eventually) and rooms (some there to just screw you up with a deadly enemy mix, others with some goodies in) are all always different. Even if you beat the game fully once, there will be more things to do every single time.Be warned though, that the DLC raises difficulty quite a bit. If you feel like you need to be eased into the game first slowly, you should play the vanilla first, and then activate the DLC. Besides that, the DLC adds tons of content and new fights and is most definitely recommended.It has amazing gameplay that keeps you coming back after getting roflstomped, great replay value, and a dirt cheap price. This game is a must in my opinion.			"

Posted: May 4, 2015
												After more than 700 hours I think it's finally time to review this game, since I think I have played a good amount to give my unbiased oppinino on The Binding of Isaac.First and foremost: Yes, I have played Rebirth. I think it was around my 500 hour mark when Rebirth was released and I was hyped like everyone else but my interest for Rebirth died down really fast and I continued playing Classic Isaac (for a more detailed review on why I prefer Classic Isaac over Rebirth, feel free to check my Review for Rebirth.)However, I absolutely love this game. I would even go so far and say that it's the absolute best game I have ever played and I started playing games when I had a SNES, so calling a game that was made in flash my favorite game of all time is a huge accomplishment.The skill cap in this game is something that is insanely good, games where you can feel that you get progressively better are very rare to come across, but the more you play it, the more you learn what which items do how you can get the most out of every single floor and of course dodging, the more you play it, the better you get at it.The cool thing is, that even after 700 hours you might not find any more secrets or anything like that, but the game never feels repetitive, since every run has a different layout of floors, the items you find are different, the bosses you find are different and the drops you find, as well.Also what this game has over Rebirth, in my opinion, is the limited amount of Items.Sure, there are people who say that at some point u just get specific items and just restart a run to the point where you get an item that is useful, so you limit yourself to a certain amount of items. But that's all up to oneself. You can either restart all time until you get your desired item, but you can also start off with a really bad item and get god-tier items along the way. The way how you play a run with a bad item and how you eventually make it work is all up to your skill at the long run.What I was trying to say is, there are less items in Classic Isaac than in Rebirth, so ultimately you have more control and it is more likely that you get an item that you actually like. As I said, some might see that as a negative, since you limit yourself to certain items, but if I play 20+ runs and only get 1 run where I get 1 item that I like, that's no fun to me.All in all The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, I would even say the benchmark for all Rogue-like games.(Eternal Edition) As far as the eternal edition go (which is an update for Isaac that was released a couple of days ago) I totally enjoy this update. It adds a Hard Mode to the gae, so for people who have played this game for 700+ hours and don't wanna switch over to Rebirth, this is a great addition, because the name ""Hard Mode"" is exactly what it says.There are ""eternal forms"" of regular mobs and bosses who are way tougher to beat. They have more hit points and different attacks. Another thing that they fixed, which they also added for the regular version, is the time you freeze whenever you pick up an item, trinket, pill, tarot- or playing card. The frame in which you freeze and can't move has been reduced which makes it easier for you to dodge enemies.Once the bugs have been ironed out (there is currently a bug where you can't get out of a room when you fight the eternal form of ""Loki"" this update will be even more awesome than it already is.As I said, if you love Rogue-likes, chances are that you already have this game, but if not, you should definitely give this game a try.I already have 700+ hours in this game and I plan to invest more hours in the future. This game never gets old.			"

""Yay cancer!"" - just Binding of Isaac quotesThe Binding of Isaac is a Flash-based roguelike dungeon crawler reminiscent of early Legend of Zelda games developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. Inspired heavily from the Biblical story, the game follows Isaac (and a variety of unlockable characters) escaping from his Christian fundamentalist Mother, to whom a voice of God commands to sacrifice Isaac.* GameplayAfter escaping from his Mother’s wrath, Isaac finds himself in a basement filled with monsters. Each floor contains a set amount of rooms culminating with a boss fight that must be cleared in order to advance to the next floor. Along the way Isaac can collect pennies (nickels and dimes as variants) to spend in a Shop or an Arcade, bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies and keys to unlock chests and Treasure rooms. The items found in Treasure rooms, after completing a boss fight and other ways are the core to improving Isaac’s tears (bullets) and fighting abilities. For example, an item can make tears homing, poisonous, increase damage and so on. My favourite is the Ipecac item, which makes your tears explosive and always poisonous. If requirements are fulfilled, Isaac can after a boss fight trade his heart containers to the Devil in exchange for powerful items, or alternatively, avoid taking deals with the Devil to acquire a chance for an Offering from an Angel (Wrath of the Lamb DLC required) which can be useful as well.  The game at first seems very difficult, but as it is completed more and more times, new items, characters, alternate bosses and floors can be unlocked, ensuring there will always be a reason to explore. The game also features many references to McMillen’s other games, such as Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, as well as popular games such as Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and others.* Expansions and the communityWhile the base game is fairly extensive, I heavily recommend obtaining Wrath of the Lamb DLC, which adds 98 new items, a new character, new floors and many other content that improve the experience. Owning said DLC is a prerequisite for the Eternal Update, a free addon developed by Florian Himsl that adds Hard mode, which offers a brutal experience for those feeling the base game was too easy. The Binding of Isaac is very popular and well known, as a result from famous Youtube Let’s Players such as Northernlion and Bisnap. Their unique ways of playing the game have inspired many more to try the game themselves.* Closing commentsThe Binding of Isaac is a very charming (although rather macabre as well) game which is a must have for anyone interested in roguelikes. It can be obtained for 99 cents from Humble Bundles or Steam sales, DLC and awesome soundtrack included. A worthwhile play even after the release of Rebirth.			"

												I love this game! This is one of the best games I've ever played. This game gets even more fun when you download the Community Remix mod to play this. I have most of my hours in the Community Remix mod.This game is epic and nothing but flawless victory, but there are cons which is a minor part:Pros:+Great design+Unique art-style+Epic combinations of items (gets better in Rebirth)+Challenges+Many endings+Epic soundtracks by Danny Baranowski+Gives great challenge+Humorous sound effects, as well as epic onesIs good and bad:+/-Is extremely hard on the beginning, but gets easier overtime once you get used to stuff+/-Some bosses are easy to abuse with some item combosCons:-Is extremely frustrating sometimes-Overall a bit limited once you've played enough (but this is normal for any game)-Wave of bullets is literally impossible to dodge from the gaps of them because of hitbox-FliesLittle breaks sometimes are highly recommended, because it makes it extremely frustrating if you play it alot and keep constantly failing, because failing is a part of games like this.Would recommend to anyone who likes to have a challenge.9.5/10 dying often makes you have a feel of banging your head to the keyboard and scream for help.

												Let's make this Short:TL;DR:+ For that amount of Money (4,99€) you get tons of content. I've played 13 Hours and those games are not even nearly my type of Game.+ You can pick it up whenever you want. You wanna kill 5minutes? Go ahead+ Addictive. You wanna get deeper and deeper into the Dungeon. + The Game even runs on a Potato. Like legit, you can pick it up even on a Toaster.+ you will unlock different characters with specific statistics and abilities. So every run depends on YOU and your Decisions.+/- The deeper you go into the Dungeon, the harder it gets. If you rage pretty fast, don't pick it up!- NONE*RECOMMENDED*			"

												Got this game on summer sales 2015.Played it recently.All I can say is I'm hooked and it's very challenging but it's fun.At first it'll be hard for everyone but once you fully grasp the controls, you'll be fine.Vs Mom is hard but Vs Isaac is harder. Trust me when you get there, it'll be hard unless you've got very powerful upgrades to your character.Also what's nice about this game is you'll never play the same level twice cause everytime you play it'll be different. What I slightly dislike is why does my tears only shoot 4 direction, I want to it shoot where I'm clicking but I guess that is why its hard and challenging I fully recommend this game to everyone simply because it's fun, addictive and challenging.9.9/10			"

												Now, I'm not a fan of these kind of games, but....but...The Binding of Isaac is a game that sticks to you, the game you will play for many days, the game that will invoke frustration mixed with delight, the game that will change your perception on the gaming itself. This is a hard game to play, but it's worth every second of your time. Don't be a stranger - buy it, play it, and after you spend couple of hours playing it, start kicking your head against the wall.

												Where do I start? This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time. I guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point. And you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character. You might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.HOWEVER!The Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle. There is a sense of mystery about this game, mainly regarding the bosses, items you can find and what each pill does in every run.Now stop reading this and go buy The Binding of Isaac!!			"

												     Given the upcoming release of Binding of Issac: Rebirth, I have decided to update my review of The Binding of Issac + The Wrath of Lamb. Having doubled my playtime in the past couple of weeks i have come to the conclusion that my initial response to the game was premature.     For those unfamiliar with Issac, the game is a Rougelike Dual Analogue Shooter. this means you controll Issac (or one of his unlocakble alternates) who fights randomly spawned monsters in a procedurely generated dungeon using his own tears as bullets. Issac is heavially inspired by retro titles, especially the original Legend of Zelda, as can be seen in the way each room is a seperate yet in many ways similar mirror of each other with some room s designated as treasure or boss rooms, and the heart based life meter.     The presentation of Issac is that of a Newgrounds flash game on steriods. To be fair that description is fairly apt. the game is built on the flash engine and if it hadn't had the time, creativity, and vision applied to it that is what it would likely have ended up as. That flash comment is not meant in the derrogative though, the game looks and sounds beautiful (Mostly thanks to Danny Baranowsky). Because it sticks to the limitations of the engine rather than attempt more realistic graphics the game looks perfect for what it is.     Gameplay is where Issac truly shines. The controls are simple and tight, keeping the already difficult gameplay from becoming frustrating. The best part of the gameplay though is the items. The randomly generated items ensure that no two runs are the same. These items are most awesome when they work together (Protip-Polyphimus+Technology =Awesome.). The enemies have unique attack and movement patterns that are easy to learn but will always be able to throw you for a loop.     The only problem I have with the game is the same as it was before. The random nature of the item drops and boss spawns can make some playthroughs almost instant throwaways. This is aliviated by the sortness of the game and the rapidity of the respawn but if a few games in a row with a bad start and even I get frustrated. 8/10. Worthy of a checkout before Rebirth comes out.			"

In short, is the game good?Yes, yes and triple yes.Is it worth my time and money?Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.Is this game for anyone?Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.Linear, open-world or something else?Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, ""champion"" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.Audio design and soundtrack?Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.Plot, story?Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.How does the game run?I have played and ""finished"" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the ""Auto"" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more ""crowded"" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to ""Low"" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.Anything you didn't like?Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a ""recomendation"", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.Final score?I give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.

												Definitely a must-have for any Steam member. I will admit I didn't enjoy the game at first, but over time it grew on me and I soon realized the charm and brilliance of it. Edmund McMillen did great on this revival of the dying genre of Rogue-like games, and added his own element of unique and fascinating artwork, similar to his previous title, Super Meat Boy. Overall, this game is great, because it brings together so many great elements for a game to have into one wholesome title, making it enjoyable for everyone except those who don't take time to see the beauty of a game.

												Few games can truly claim to walk the fine line between fun and frustration as much as The Binding of Isaac, another hellishly difficult title from Edmund McMillen: the man behind Super Meat Boy. It’s a title that delights in pushing players to the point where they want to start taking swings at their computer before attempting another round guiding its titular tyke through a series of nightmarish and randomized dungeons.A brief animated intro sets up the threadbare plot: Isaac is a young boy living a happy life at home with his mom until she starts hearing the voice of God and hiding him from the evils of the world. It isn’t long until Isaac is permanently locked in his room and awaiting execution at the hands of his mother at the almighty’s behest. Escaping into the basement, Isaac begins his bizarre journey.The Binding of Isaac somehow manages to be disturbing as it is endearing with its balance of gruesome monsters and matching setting with its adorable, wide-eyed sprites. Dungeons are splashed in every foul bodily fluid imaginable—blood, guts, tears, urine, and even an uncomfortable amount of feces. Imagine Hellraiser filmed through the lens of a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. The bestiary is equally grotesque. Armies of maggots and flies are frequent foes, and headless children spewing fountains of blood from their necks are a common sight.Bosses take things a distasteful step forward: fetuses, conjoined twins, fat slugs urinating on the floor, and even Isaac’s mother are just a few of the end-level bosses that need to be dealt with. Keep in mind that the protagonist is also a perpetually-naked boy using his tears as projectiles. The Binding of Isaac is a pretty sick game with aesthetics that would appeal to one’s inner horror fan and Splatterhouse enthusiast. It isn’t going to be to everyone’s tastes, but those that enjoyed Super Meat Boy are probably going to find themselves like McMillen’s perverted sense of style.Since the dungeons are randomized, there’s no telling what you’re going to find whether it be a useful power-up or more monsters. This makes memorization of each level impossible and keeps the experience fresh every time. On the downside, this means success depends on good luck and players will often lose because they were dealt a bad hand. Every time Isaac dies, players wind up right back at the start of the game and even the most patient of individuals will become infuriated by such a design choice. After putting in so much effort and acquiring a myriad of useful abilities, it feels way too harsh.The randomness extends to the power-ups themselves, as there are well over a hundred of them and they don’t always have the expected effect. Some even hurt Isaac and if used in a tight spot are going to guarantee death. At the very least, they can be used in conjunction with other power ups and there’s not much of a limit on how many of them can be used at the same time. Still, there’s nothing worse than getting bad power-ups and items with no end in sight. At that point, it’s probably best to just quit and start again.There’s even some replayability to the title with extra characters that can be unlocked and a bit of exploring to see if there’s anything particularly useful in a given dungeon. The Binding of Isaac is a purposefully short title designed to be played many times over, not just due to its unforgiving nature, that will yield a surprise here and there when players think they’re seen everything. Its ability to keep you guessing is its greatest strength and weakness as it violently seesaws between an enjoyable 2D romp and unbridled frustration.The Binding of Isaac is not for those that are easily deterred, and it’s a safe bet that any Super Meat Boy fans are going to sink their teeth into it. For such a small title, there’s a lot of content packed into it and it’s an experience that isn’t always the same from one playthrough to the next. Players will question whether it was their own skill that carried them through to the end or if it was sheer luck, but regardless of the difficulty it’s an approachable game with a unique charm that boils blood just as easily as it encourages laughter at Isaac’s cartoonish spectacle of childhood trauma.A Must Play "

												Great game. I have a lot to say about it, and I think I should start with the bad stuff.*Has no support for resolutions bigger than 1280x900.*Controls are a bit annoyning - you can never put your mouse aside completely because you can't navigate through menus without it.*Can't take screenshots. Maybe it's just for me.*No GamePad support. Yes, I tried JoyToKey, and it doesn't work well.Those are all technical issues that I hope will be solved in Rebirth.NOW - the good stuff.Has so much to explore.Gameplay is amazingly fun. DLC adds a lot off good stuff.RANDOM! You never know what's next.I don't have much to say so just, PLAY IT.			"

												I have no problem whatsoever understanding why people love this game, but unfortunately, I'm not a particular fan of arcade shooters, rogue-like elements OR permadeath, so I was never going to be its greatest champion. The most I've managed so far is killing one boss and thereby progressing to a second level, and I'm just not ""hardcore"" enough to get much past that, I'm afraid.   So sure, I'm a big cry-baby who needs wimpy things like save-points to find a game truly worthwhile. But if you don't have any such failings, and don't mind an aesthetic as fresh and unique as the gameplay is retro and familiar, then you may well be one of the millions of people who swear by the genius of this product. I'm certainly a fan of Mr McMillen's sensibilities, even if I don't share his skillz in gaming.   A word to the wise, though: apparently subsequent, slightly retitled re-releases of this game are more technically finessed, and the consensus seems to be that this ISN'T the version to buy. So you might want to look into that before forking over your hard-earned dosh (mind you, if you just wanted to give it a quick test to see if it's ""you"", this version on sale may well be the ticket).   Normally I would only recommend a game like this to sickos and weirdos like my good self, but its epic sales figures suggest that the gaming world is comprised of nothing but. Who WOULDN'T love a game about a bawling baby who shoots tear-drops at bleeding-eyed monstrosities while dodging around small mountains of poop surrounded by flies? The world truly is a sad and beautiful place...Verdict: 8/10.			"

												Strange is a good word to describe the game overall but that's in the best sense of the word. A lot of fun if you like it's mixture of zelda like labyrinth layouts, SHMUP gameplay plus roguelike elements not to mention the interesting if macabre art direction.The myriad of combinations possible with all the different items you can find in each playthrough really make the game incredibly replayable and a blast to go through each playthrough trying to find new and better builds with Isaac and the other alternate characters that have various strengths and weaknesses relative to the eponymous hero.

												The Binding Of Isaac is an flash indie game developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. The game’s storyline and name are both a reference to the Biblical story known also as Binding of Isaac. In the game, the player controls Isaac, a child that seeks safety in the basement after his mother is given a message of God commanding her to sacrifice her own son in order to proof her faith. In the basement Isaac starts going through dungeons located in the basement having to face his nightmares in form of monsters, in order to escape.    The style and game’s gameplay are inspired by Legend of Zelda series and similar to roguelike, where the rooms of all dungeons are randomly generated, being different each time you play, and this is what makes it so special because every gameplay is totally different. On each floor of the basement, the player must kill monsters in order to proceed to the next room. Along the way, it will be possible to collect keys weapons and power-ups which will increase your chance of surviving because each item has a special effect and you can also pick up coins which are used to buy items in shops spread all over each floor, but need a key to be opened.Each floor of the dungeon ends with a boss room, where a boss must be defeated in order to proceed to the next floor. Each time the bosses are different. At loading screens between floors, Isaac remembers scenarios, of his childhood while crying in fetal position, from rejection of his mother, unlucky moments and even bullying from his friends, some can even be Isaac’s own fears, but you’ll never know.The gameplay is easy to master since does not require very buttons and the soundtrack is not diverse, but it does fit very well the atmosphere of the game.One of the most awesome features of this game, in my opinion, and because due to flash limitation, it’s not possible to save, all your unlockables will stay unlocked and such, but you cannot save mid-game, so you will have to start over every time you go back to main menu, every time you lose and every time you close the game. And that is what makes it so hard and enjoyable since you will not get bored because every time all will be different and new!A DLC to the game was also released, “Wrath of the Lambs”, also a religious reference, and it adds all new content including new items, new rooms, new enemies, new bosses and its totally worth it!     This game has me craving for more every time I play it, the creativity of it is amazing and it will make you spend some good long hours playing it. I totally recommend you to get it.   ~ 9/10  P.s: Brace yourselfes, the remake is here!			"

												Only Steam would allow a game where you play as a naked cartoon child who must drown their enemies in a torrent of upgradeable tears, working your way through a questionably large basement until you can face and take down your disturbed Christian mother who seeks to purify you with her foot. And for that I love them, and the creators of said game.Just ... one more playthrough, and then I'll get back to work.			"

												This is not your average browser flash game: this is some kind of ""Dark souls"" for those stupid easy games.( and have+18 content)We embody Isaac, a normal guy who lives with his mother, they live happy with eachother until his mother starts to heard a ""voice from above"" demanding to sacrifice her own soon, Issac (trapped on his room) find a hatch to the basement, where the adventure begins.There 5 stages + final boss fightEvery single incoming stage increases enemies difficulty (as boss as well), and amount of rooms.The choices can decide your fate, altered by: deals with the devil, tarot cards and pills. You need to know what are they function, to use them effectively and in the right moment.The game is 100% replayable because is never the same on every playthrough, all is randomly generated:-rooms (including enemies, environments, and items to pick), -Boss stages.-Locations of special rooms (which leaves items and others to buy).good sountrack on special partsIt can take plenty of hours to complete :-Fill the vast item collection.-Find the""secrets"".-Unlock all the playable characters (all theirs with unique abylities)-Achieve all endings.

Nice art style, well-fitting soundtrack, addictive gameplay, very high replayability and surprisely deep and dark story of life and fears of Isaac makes you play it over and over again. It's challenging, but rewarding. Random-generated levels and tons of power-ups are not going to let the game bore you. Great indie masterpiece, highly recommended!			"

												The Binding of Isaac follows the bible story of the same name, as you play Isaac, a scared young lad escaping the religious tenacity of his mother. Binding of Isaac is one of my favourite games on Steam. It has huge, huge playability. If you get it, make sure you get the super-cheap DLC too, which essentially doubles the content of the game. It took me 100 hours to fully complete the game (Golden God) and even then I was missing one of the ""hard"" achievements.With the implementation of the DLC, there's tonnes of new content, bosses, items and trinkets to explore and discover. Amazing game for a super, super cheap price. So worth it. The humour is very dark and can be ""gross"", so if you're a little squeemish, you may wish to avoid!-Nilesy			"

												The Binding Of Isaac is a simple but fun indie game.You play as a young boy named Isaac who is forced to face the evil beings of his basement and further on. There are several stages, but to continue each floor, you have to beat a boss. The dungeons and rooms are randomly generated, so that each time you play everything is different. The creator did an amzing job with this point.There are several characters to unlock, by completing challenging objectives to play as them.Lots of items inhabit the dungeons going from a rail from pointless to very helpfull.This game is amazing without the dlc, with so much contect and area to explore each time you play.Few rooms contain slot machines, a devil, and many more.I find this game amazing for its price and would pick it up any day. An absolute well done to the team who made the game.I rate this game 9/10.			"

												At first glance, this game may seem simple; however, it's anything but.You start off with simple levels and enemies, collecting items that will help (or sometimes harm) you, getting you ready to fight progressively tougher enemies. Each time you go to the next level, you are met with different enemies, and all new opportunities to get items. And just when you think you've beat the game...you haven't. I'll let you figure out what that means. The items, enemies, rooms, and level layouts are completely random, so you will likely never have the same exact experience in this game twice. Unlocking new characters adds to the experience, as each one has its own benefits and setbacks, making the game easier in some ways and harder in others. Because of the overwhelming amount of items and enemies, I'd always recommend playing with the wiki for the game open, just so that you never make a bad decision when it comes to picking up items. Still, some things in this game come with a learning curve and you'll just have to find out what items you like to use and which ones will make you rage.It'll be frustrating at first, but once you unlock more items and beat your own personal records, you'll be addicted. Buying the Wrath of the Lamb DLC makes the game even tougher (so I suggest buying it after you have a good feel for the base game), but adds loads of new content, including enemies, items, levels, and more.Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone I knew, even with all of the dark humor and blasphemous jokes. When you look past all of that, it's a great game with excellent replay value.			"

Chock full of references to his other games such as Super Meat Boy, Gish, hell even his game titled *C*u*n*t* is referenced! Now let's move onto the replay value. At the time of writing this I have nearly 150 hours. Don't be surprised if you see 500 or something when you read this. Don't go into this game blind. Go watch youtube videos, streamers, etc. This game is extremely tough too, so if you want to buy the DLC with it I HIGHLY recommend beating the game a few times before you buy it. This game is just a true masterpiece with a ton of awesome bugs that makes it beautiful. The Binding of Isaac is possibly my favorite game of all time on Steam. That is all :)Edit: Some grammatical corrections, and eternal update was released, play without eternal first if you're a noob. Just scroll down in your library and then uncheck eternal edition and you should be set. That is all.			"

												The binding of isaac is one of those games that generate a huge WTF sensation when you first start playing it. You start off as Isaac, a kid whose christian mom decides to sacrifice to Jesus because of reasons, so you run off to your basement to avoid the imminent slaughter. However you soon find out that it is not safe there either, and pave your way to salvation by shooting random monsters with your tears as you progress through the basement's labyrinthine array of rooms. Several power-ups and mom's items (and pills) help you in this battle, while you unlock more of them as well as several other characters with different abilities as you progress in the game. Of course,  you have no idea what each item does when you pick it up and I personally found fun in discovering different items along the way. The binding of Isaac's unique dark humor and artwork have made it instantly recognisable and strangely lovable among other titles of its genre. However it is a difficult and unforgiving game that will send you to your death time an time again.+ Twisted -wtf- humor+ Loads of randomly generated items+ Cool soundtrack+ Great artwork- Can be really hard, especially with the wrath of lamb DLC "

												NOTE: This review is just to inform people who plan on buying this game now. TL;DR is: Dont buy it. This game is out of date by now, and worse yet its just too big for flash to handle. The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.EDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth.  Afterbirth of course includes Rebirth which is the base game.			"

												Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.So, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.Plot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.Gameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.Anything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.Final remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it. The gameplay's fun, yet challenging, the plot's very...odd, but still good, and the soundtrack is just amazing.9.5/10. "

Your weapons are a child’s tears and globules of blood and pus, your enemies are flies the size of cats and toddlers, with their faces stuffed full of spiders. Human excrement litters the floor of almost every randomly generated room, sometimes trailing behind you as you flee from the floating, murderous heads of aborted fetuses.  But!

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game. It is very replayable and addictive, and the random elements make every run a little bit different. Wrath of the Lamb only expands on this, and makes the game even better than it was before. I would give it a positive rating...If not for Flash.Flash ruins this game. The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript ""Low, Medium, High"", and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.			"

												17 hours of my life playing this simple frustrating game.Pros- Cheap, Rooms are random so, no 2 games are the same, you don't require huge specs to run this game. It's also very tiny in file size.Cons- Collectables don't say what they do so when you use them, they can be (usually are) wasted.It's handy to have a cheat sheet open in your browser that says what each item does.7/10EDIT: The trailer is messed up as ♥♥♥♥ - 11/10			"

												This is a game from older generation. There is no saves, no hints, no help. You must remember that gives each piece and how it interacts with others. Plus, it's very random, one game may be simple, the other incredibly difficult. But precisely this is the charm of the game. Challenge the player to deal with all its complexities.This is very good and captivating game. I will continue to play it until I collect all items)			"

												After little hours that i spend playing this game, i want to review The Binding Of IsaacStory:This is The Binding Of Isaac, where you play as boy who his name is Isaac and  he lives with his religiously Mother.One day his Mother received an order from God to kill Isaac where you gonna see it at the opening of the game. When his mother received the order from God, Isaac was locked out in his room, and Isaac sees her already preparing knife to kill Isaac. His mother kicked the Isaac door room. Isaac dont know what to do and underneath his carpet theres like a cave full of evil things where Isaac gonna escape from his mother, this is where the adventure starts. Gameplay:At first when i play, suddenly i get used to it (yeah because it was easy..). Im so addicted to this gane, even if im always losing, i just want to finish it again and again. After you defeat the boss, you get into the different cave and gonna defeat all the boss again, until you reach the main boss fight. To makes thing easy this game gives you like ability, unique items and power-ups! And make your own Isaac looks weird AF. Well i dont know what to say anymore, its just very good and addicting!Dont hesitate if you're buying this game or not, just buy it people! And its actually cheap for me especially when this game on sale, i got this when there's Hallowen Sale last year. It is worth it...			"

												Brutally good game, and I think the most difficult games. The game has a wide variety of laberints,opponents, gifts.When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother. The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety. 8/10			"

												Use your tears to kill your mother and her heart, an unborn fetus version of yourself, and dead babies because apparently they are not dead enough already. You can't fool some of these dead babies when you kill them with tears, lasers, and 13th century explosives because they were not born yesterday. After you kill your mother, you can fight Satan or better yet kill yourself AND an undead version of yourself inside of a toy chest! You will spend hours searching inside poop to find pennies! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is not a Jew or a Christian fundamentalist, although Jews may find collecting pennies enjoyable.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is the quintessential roguelike dungeon-crawling shooter. The player will take control of Isaac, a crying naked young boy trying to escape the basement of his home. Isaacs mother, instructed by god to take his life as a test of faith, is the final boss in the game. Each level is a unique randomly generated dungeon, with 6 to 10 rooms and a boss fight. There are six playable characters that can be unlocked, and more than a hundred different items to discover and use during each random adventure. The gameplay is simple, consisting of dodging enemies attacks and firing Isaacs tears and dropping bombs as a means of offense. The game has a dark sort of humor about it, with each stage seeming to become more and more dangerous and depressing for little Isaac. The gameplay is solid, though the story is quite simple. There are no NPC's, no quests, and no real RPG-like qualities. It is a simple and entertaining romp with a high degree of difficulty, that requires a fair ammount of luck. Created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, The Binding of Isaac is beloved amongst fans of indie games and dungeon crawlers because of its pick-up-and-play nature and simple setup. For casual players, the game will find a place as a quick and easy shoot-em-up that passes time. Hardcore completionists will have plenty to work for, with a collection system that tracks every item the player has found and many varying and difficult achievements and characters to unlock. The game is single player only, and derives much of its value from the procedurally-generated levels and humorous yet difficult gameplay. If you'd like to see some gameplay, check out AGNBs Let's Play series. PROS: Easy to learn, fun to play, lots to discoverCONS: Very difficult, inherently repetitiveGRAPHICS: 3/5 - Originally a flash game, and it shows.SOUND: 5/5 - Perfectly fitting soundtrack and SFX.STORY: 3/5 - Not a lot in the story department, but not much is needed.GAMEPLAY: 5/5 - Highly addicting ""just one more try"" style gameplay.REPLAY VALUE: 5/5 - I find myself returning to it again and again. Great to play while drunk.OVERALL SCORE: 84/100 - A classic indie piece, well worth the $5. Even better if it's on sale.For more reviews by mowse, check out the mowse talks games Steam Community!

												This game is so utterly addictive. I don't know what it is, but the procedural generation of dungeons and items so different from each other that they actually change the gameplay is what makes this game unique.Brought to you by the creators of Super Meat Boy and a personal favorite Aether (check it out if you don't know it), this game is an arcade-like dungeon-exploring with progression based on repetition. Some may hate the fact that you need to kill the first boss about eight times to unlock the second boss, and you need to kill the second main boss some times to unlock the third boss, and so on.Personally I don't mind that sort of thing, specially due to the random factor that affects the items you get. A lot is based on LUCK, since there are items that are far above others in quality and power, but overall the game is very balanced and you can get a kick out of it no matter the hand you are dealt.System of achievements, items and challenges is what marks the progression of this game, besides the number of times you defeated the bosses. Each challenge is unique and sets you with a made up combo of items (or no item at all), and it is a great thing to have for end-game players.Overall, this game is one of my favorites of all time, and I couldn't be more excited for the release of the reboot, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. DEFINETELLY worth to check it out, and you are garanteed your money's worth.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a game about a young child, whose devout christian mother tries to kill him. He escapes into the basement through a trapdoor, and then must navigate through the dungeon that is the Basement. It is a 2D Top-down dungeon crawler, where you can play one of several characters. You start out in Isaac's Mothers Basement working your way throughout. The game is strange, but funny and interesting. It feels a lot like The original Legend of Zelda, though most dungeon crawlers do, and it also features co-op play so you can play with friends. I recommend this game if you enjoy adventuring through dungeons! The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is also a fun play if you want to try other games in the series.			"

												This game is basically a masterpiece and a major success in the realm of randomly-generated games.  I found it quite fun to follow the storyline, and am honestly beginning to wonder who Isaac's dad was, and how he plays into the game. :oPros:- smooth, increasingly simple gameplay- AWESOME soundtrack (Cheers to Danny Baronowsky)- A near infinite variety of how the game could play out- Bosses that actually increase in difficulty and pose quite the challenge (unlike some of today's more modern games)- a challenge in terms of preparing and strategizing, depending on the items you have- There are a few references to other games within it.  (SMB, The Legend of Zelda, for instance)Cons:- It can get quite laggy if there are a lot of things happening at once- It's hard to talk to people while you're in-game, as the fullscreen feature doesn't allow the shift-tab combo to access the community, so you'd have to have it windowed most of the time if you want to talk to peopleThat's all. :3  I DEFINITELY recommend this game. :D			"

												Fantastic new school version of old school games like Zelda 1 mixed with Smash TV. The gameplay is pretty simple. a 3/4ths top down shooter that allows you to shoot in 4 directions. There are also alternate power ups and bombs to use. Really simple controls like Smash TV mixed with Zelda. You are Isaac, stuck in a multi leveled dungeon. Each one of these dungeon levels is in the old Zelda 1 style where each room is 1 screen. The dungeons / basements are randomized, every room and enemy combination is randomly generating. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The only downside is no lives, no continues. There are tons of quirky weapons, enemies, power ups and bosses. Everyone should spend the $5 to play this game.I can understand if its not for everyone, because it is an arcadey retro Zelda 1 meets Smash TV sort of game. The graphics are cute and charming, but portray horrifying things like if you were to ever see a doodle of a fetus or a doodle of someone coughing out flies and poop staining the floor. Like a sad disparagingly sort of awesome. You play as Issac who basically has to get out of randomized Zelda style dungeons. There are dozens of unique enemies with different attack styles. Few enemies seem to have predictable patterns. There are also plenty of boss battles.The controls take some getting used to, but they are basically Smash TV controls. You use your directional pad, then you use an attack direction. So you can move right and shoot left or up, or down or right. You have a bomb button, a special findable item and an auxiliary power up button for things like pills. The main attack are bullets... which are really tears. Bombs sit, but you can push them, pills do good and bad things. Some items / power ups give you dolls for extra weapons, or a dead cat gives you 9 lives but the catch is you have 1 heart energy per life. You can also get metal hearts, that count as energy, but once they're gone you can't get them back like normal heart healths.You play through 'basement' floor after floor marked with a boss at the end. You find keys, bomb walls, kill enemies, gamble, visit stores, danger rooms and so on. Just like Zelda 1. The only thing is that it is all randomized. The room layouts are randomized, the rooms themselves are randomized, the stores, the weapons, the items.It is all randomized, so you'll never play the same game twice. This isn't a story based game, so it won't appeal to everyone. Its highly entertaining especially in short bursts of play. For that price, you can't miss this game.I highly recommend the game for its gameplay, cheap price and its never the same game twice with the random dungeons.			"

												English:After 108 hours I finally 100% completed The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb expansion (all 84 achievements).The amount of hours you can put into it until you don't have nothing else to do is simply incredible given the price you can pay for the pack with the game and expansion (0.99 on a sale).If you never played the game before expect to finish it completely in 150-200+ hours (depending on your skill in this kind of game).For new players the game will probably be kinda difficult and even more with the expansion content so i would recommend playing without it installed (under DLC tab in game properties) at least until you have unlocked It Lives or beaten Sheol once.After that you'll be able to handle most of the new enemies and bosses, and you will appreciate the addition of trinkets and new items.There are several drawbacks with the expansion. Mostly glitches that it introduces such as enemies glitching through some corners, not properly working Brimstone controls, etc. but with all the new game elements you can easily forget about this.PS. Gorgeous soundtrack if you don't know it yet.Español:Despues de 108 horas al fin he completado al 100% The Binding of Isaac + la expansion Wrath of the Lamb (los 84 logros).La cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que no tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego y la expansion (0.99 rebajado).Si nunca has jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de 150-200 horas (dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juego).A los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil y mas aun con el contenido de la expansion, asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada (en la pestaña DLC de las propiedades del juego) al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado It Lives o superado Sheol una vez. Despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos y jefes, y apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos y los trinkets.La expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas, los controles del objeto Brimstone no funcionan muy bien, etc. pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de esto.PD. Si todavia no lo sabes la banda sonora es impresionante.			"

												Binding of Isaac is one of the best games I've played on Steam. It has the right level of difficulty, an interesting base story, and a lot of secrets to uncover. Being able to play as a bunch of different characters, all with different stats and starting items, and random items every time you play through the game, makes the game extremely fun and random. Some runs will work, some won't and a lot does depend on luck, but even in a run where you haven't been particularly lucky you still have a chance to pull it off if you fit in a bit of skill.This is one of the first games I played on Steam, and I didn't really enjoy it at first. I sucked at it, and couldn't even get to the first Mom fight. Eventually though, as I played the game more, I got better and learned how to deal with the various enemies. I learned advantages and disadvantages of picking up certain items, and which items were OP so I could hope for one of those. The wiki really helped a lot at the beginning to help me learn the items, of which there are over 100 each with different effects.Though I believe it's intentional for some characters to be more difficult to play than others, it's not a feature I can fully appreciate. I like when all the characters in a game are balanced, which could have been very possible in BoI but some characters are still distinctly worse than others.This game also takes a long while to get the hang of. At first, I played about 2 hours of this game then quit and didn't play again for almost a year. I was then reintroduced to the game, and I started playing it a lot more. It still took me another long time (maybe 40-50 hours) to beat mom for the first time, and then 100 more hours on top of that to beat ??? at the end of the game. It takes practice and patience to finally beat the game, but it's worth every minute of it.The DLC for this game is definitely required. Wrath of the Lamb adds so much important content and it's not nearly as fun without it. There are significantly fewer items, less end-game content, less enemies, and a lot less fun to be had. Although, with or without the DLC, Binding of Isaac is easily worth the price you pay for it at any time. $8 is nothing compared to the amount of fun you will have playing this game.			"

												Eerie atmosphere, insane item combinations that can make or break a run, difficulty is potentially brutally challenging, absurd amounts of replayability, and JUST the right amount of sacrilege. MORE than worth the $8 for it and Wrath of the Lamb, and I'm practically drooling over the upcoming Rebirth.I don't care who you are, you need this game in your life.			"

												Long version:Ok, so this is a great psychological thriller revolving around fears of a child growing up in a dysfunctional family, being raised by a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, who is experiencing imperative auditory hallucinations which are rigidly and delusionally interpreted and provoke verbal and behavioral responses including obdience. Delusional interpretation manifests in, among others, grandiosity, feeling of a mission, delusions of guilt and sin (the latter being transferred to her child). These result in inappropriate and irresponsible actions which jeopardize the safety of her son, Isaac.Isaac, trying to cope with the family situation, is facing his worst childhood subconscious fears. Subconsciousness is traditionally represented as 'basement' (similarly to e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho). His weapon in fighting those fears is crying and thus, relieving negative emotions. As Isaac goes deeper into the subconscious cleansing himself in a psychoanalytical way, he discovers his most concealed desire - to kill his mom. Short version:It's the only game that your wife will encourage you to play.			"

												I would heartily recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone who isn't too squeamish. While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.The proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.In conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.			"

												Hmm, where should I begin.At first I was quite sceptical, to be honest, towards this game. Running around naked in a maze, collecting mushrooms and syringes, killing flies and spiders. Sounds fuun~~*sarcasm*. NAH-AH mothafacka. Those who think it's 'easy' obviously haven't played it.  It's not repetitive in any way, which I value in an indie/rogue-like games and it's incredibly satisfying to beat the game. Especially for the very first time. Just. Trust me. There is just so much in this game, secrets, treasures, that it's a bit over-whelming. It's like: you think you know a lot about the game (leave alone 'know everything about the game'), but I can almost guarantee that you don't.Oh and it's based mostly around religious stuff and God and Satan and a bit more Satan. Did I mention there's a lot of satanic  things? And Devil + Satan <3All in all, it's one of the funniest, weirdest rogue-like games I have ever played, hands down. Definitely worth every hour I have poured into it. Can't wait what 'Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' has to offer with the whole Co-Op function added to it :3Lastly: There are rare golden piles of crap in the game. Just how awesome is that??!			"

												A simple game with tremendous depth (somehow). You never get tired of finding out what new combination of powerups, trinkets, and items will allow you to... completely fail to escape The Basement.The most rewarding thing I got out of this game is the realization that I really suck at roguelikes and should probably avoid them entirely. I can't thank Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl enough for that. It's just been too long since Temple of Apshai on the C64, and I need to give it a rest.Everyone else will no doubt love Isaac, and I heartily recommended it to them. I'll just stick with easy games like Borderlands and Osmos, and trust that the rest of you can save this little guy, however many times it takes you to 100% the game.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is an arena style, action-adventure game where it follows the main protagonist, Isaac through the depths of his basement and unknown to escape his insane murderous mother after she receives a sacrifice demand from God. It has an interesting story that is based on events in the Christian religion. This being said, there are many other references such as item names and bosses (Scapular item and Satan boss). You start out with playing Isaac (other characters can be unlocked) battling through six floors until you finally meet and battle your own mother. Additional floors are unlocked with a DLC. The DLC is vital if you want to understand and truly enjoy this game. It unlocks an additional five rooms, all filled with new enemies, new items, and new forms of dark humor, and allows you to generate many more endings, featuring an epic battle against Satan and Isaac himself portraying as a disciple of God.

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Binding of Isaac 

			Views: 2,782		

			Binding of Isaac is an RPG Shooter which will have you crawling around randomly generated dungeons collecting items and killing bosses.		

Binding of Isaac may seem like a really simple top down RPG shooter, but trust me when I say that's just a front. If you can look past the cartoonish art style and simplistic look then you'll see a really expansive game with tonnes to find and do.Now first things first: this game is hard. You will spend a lot of your time dying, dying and dying again. If you're gonna whine about a difficult unforgiving game, then don't get this. When you die, that's game over. You start again at the beginning with nothing.Along your journey you'll find a total over 235 items which upgrade your character. I'd say this is what actually makes the game shine, all the items are randomized so every time you play through it, you'll get different items which change how you play. A really nice touch is that the items also change your character's appearance, which is a visually pleasing change.One issue I have with this is that there's usually no indication as to what the items actually do. Unless you have a wiki open whilst you're playing, you're gonna have a bad time. It would have been nice if they at least included an in-game encyclopaedia.Because all the items are randomized, a lot of this game is down to luck which decides whether or not you actually have a successful game which kinda sucks. Overall, considering it's really cheap and a fun game, it gets a 6 out of 10 so pick it up if you have the money!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a good way to waste time. Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent; you never know what's in store for you when you start it up. Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10Because ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.			"

												One of the absolute most brilliant releases of the 21st century. Binding of isaac tells a horrific story with a multitude of disturbing elements that leave you wondering what the designer was thinking when he made this, but whatever he did, it's done in such a way that it gets to people in the best way possibleBinding of isaac is an exploration based adventure with an extremely well thought out progression system, numerous random elements and all that other goodness. The core gameplay can be summed up as ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC once again proves this to be a solid statement.Currently the remake is in progress, but this is what started it, and this is what set the standards for similar games in it's genre. Hardcore roguelike elements and a variety of wacky and impressive in game items provide a fresh experience for a loooong time, with a permadeath mechanic that leaves you on the tip of your chair and wanting more and more each time.To sum up this gem of a game, it's now on sale for an all time low. Less than 2 bucks gets you this beauty of a game and the expansion, but in the end it's priceless.No one will regret picking this up. From the die hards to the softcores, there's a place for everyone in the basement >:)			"

												The Binding of Eye SacA game about a baby whose tear-ducts are so enflamed due to the hardship of his former life, that he sets out into his own basement in order to retrieve a packet of eyedrops that he was given as a christening present.Unfortunately, little does he know, his eyedrops are guarded by the forces of hell (among other things), making it rather difficult for poor Eye Sac to get them back. There's even a giant hairy leg that just so happens to be the true guardian of the eyedrops. It's a bit like that Goron in Ocarina of Time that needs eyedrops because he's been snacking on a few too many delicious Goron ""onions"", but far more dark and depressing.			"

												This game's brilliant.I wanted to try it for a long while thinking it would be a decent game when I actually played it. Needless to say I'm really glad I bought this. This game has it all.It's a rogue-like so it's very challenging and has randomly generated levels, which gives this game high replayablility! Good visuals, awesome music, and great gameplay! It also has a very dark and deppresing mood which fits this game extremely well! It has a a bunch of achievments to get. Has a good amount of unlockable characters. Lots of items and powerups to get. Various enemies that'll try to greet Isaac and friends to their untimley demise. It has fun boss battles. It has a simple and easily understandable story (Which is a good thing and a bad thing). It also has DLC that adds a bunch to the game that's only $3. ALL of the complaints and problems I have with this game are very minor and are instantly stomped on by all of the good things in this game!$5 is a very generous price for a great game like this! It is definetly worth checking out and I highly recommend it!			"

												Not only is the game based on how well you can adapt to certain encounters with what you have, but it's also based on luck. The layout of the area changes each time you play, so while you may get an awful/useless item and immediately be swarmed with enemies in the next room the first time around, you could get extremely lucky and find consecutive unlocked doors with loot inside that will make the next few floors a cakewalk.It's a very good game, and it can get frustrating at times, yes, but it's very enjoyable to play. If you're alright with creepy, disfigured monsters hanging around in the basement, that is.			"

												Personal Rating: 8/10I haven't played much of this game and I can't say I will, but it's good. I got it on sale for 49p with all the DLC and what I got was truly amazing. I'm going to go out on a limb here, I don't like platformers, adventure games or dungeon crawlers. This is an adventure, dungeon crawler type game so we're off to a lovely start. I think the reason I like this game the most is the soundtrack, which is absolutely fantastic and I can listen to it on Steam Music. It's also creepy as hell, I mean, I attacked some sort of uterus with a face attached to it, I killed the behemoth thing and was confronted by a flying face.Every playthrough is different, I learnt that the hard way, thinking that it was safe to go into that room when in fact it was full of mutant Isaac's. If you can get this game cheap then you'll enjoy it, not too keen on the story, seems a little meh to be honest, but who needs a story when your game is this ♥♥♥♥ing creepy?			"

(I actually prefer to watch other people play on my friends list and cry silently that I'll never earn those achieves.)There appear to be about a million levels of this basement-initiated labyrinth, of which you fight the spawn of the Devil until you meet Devils-incarnate herself: your Mother... ...Then it dawns on you that technically you're still related despite her bloodthirsty rampage earlier, which makes YOU involved in this somehow - perhaps even accountable in some terrible way, and just what the heck has been going on under your house all these years? and further still, after all of that, you've been fighting evil with tears the size of bathtubs and may need to see an Optometrist.Isaac is a very disturbed child.

												An incredibly fun, Zelda-like, dungeon crawler with art by the always amazing Edmund McMillen, and programming by Florian Himsl. You play as Isaac, a young boy who is being hunted by his mother, who is on a mission from ""God"" to sacrifice Isaac. You travel through a series of randomly-generated basements and caves, collecting a huge variety of power-ups on your way. The religious themes in Binding are a breath of fresh air, providing some provoking, yet subtle storytelling as you play. The soundtrack as composed by Danny Baranowsky, who had collaborated previously with Edmund McMillen on the critically-acclaimed platformer, Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky created an amazing, metal soundtrack with a few ambient tracks as well. All the music fits the gameplay perfectly. With a huge replay-value and quirky yet creepy environment, there's no way I can't recommend this game, especially at the low price of $4.99.			"

												What can I say about the Binding of Isaac...It is probably the most frustrated I have ever been at a game, yet I love it all the same. Every run is different, and you could die in the first level, or beat the last boss, dependent partially on your skill and partially on your luck. You never know what you're going to get going into this game. With massive replayability, this is probably the best $5 I have ever spent. The game will slow down every once in a while, as it runs on Flash, but this is usually not too much of a problem.Also, it features absolutely amazing music.If you enjoy rogue-likes, I would seriously recommend giving this game a try.

												What can really be said about The Binding of Isaac at this point that hasn't already been said? A devilish little roguelike wrapped up in a highly-interpretive commentary on relgion and religious iconography with a lot of inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and Robotron/Smash TV style gameplay. The sheer variety of items to find and combine and the massive amount of enemy types and bosses you'll come across make the game's super low price for entry seem almost insane, and even when the game starts asking for multiple playthroughs to finally see the ""true end"" it somehow still keeps tossing new things at you to fight and play with. That said, I don't feel that the game is immediately rewarding and doesn't always make the best of first impressions. The artstyle may not be your thing, the four-way firing mechanics and low rate of fire can make it difficult to really get started, and the heavy reliance on random elements won't always gel with everyone, especially when the game spawns rooms where not taking damage is impossible. It can take a while for The Binding of Isaac to really grab you, and for some it may just never happen. If it does manage to grab you though, you're in for an almost endlessly replayable little treat that just keeps giving and giving. It's also highly recommended that you get as much as you want or can out of the vanilla game before investing in the DLC.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is hard, yet enjoyable. You play as a naked baby trying to get revenge on your mom because she tried to kill you since she's a devoted Christian and heard from a higher power that her son (you) is a sin upon this world. You fight through up to six challenging levels fighting many different types of enemies and bosses. There are a lot of Christian references to this game as well, which I think makes this game quite better, because not many games focus on religious aspects. There are 100+ items to collect on your adventures. Some will make you very powerful while others will be dead weight. Each item has a unique effect so you will want to get every item and see which one suits your tastes the best.For 5 dollars, this game is a steal, it has infinite replayability, it can get very difficult if you don't have the right items, and the atmosphere is pretty amazing			"

Posted: July 6, 2014
												The Binding of Isaac is a bit of an oddity for me to review. First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process. Now let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.The game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.While the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.I've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.			"

												One of the best flash player-based games i've ever seen. You can spend hours and days playing this game and it will not bother you, because every time you press ""new game"" - it will always be a random playthrough. A perfect time-killer. Edmund McMillen is a genius. Only one thing that disturbs you during the game - is lags and freezes  even on good PC's. Highly recommend this game.			"

												Highly Addicting Rogue-Like with a cute gruesome storyI would like to point out a few personal criticisms though- All items, rooms, and abilites in the game do not have a description or any information on what they do or used for, there are TONS of different unique items with unique abilities so..you have to pause the game and go look at a Wiki for info (IMO, this is bad game design and is also something I hate about Minecraft)- It's a Rogue-like with VERY RANDOM elements that cause you to fail 9 out of 10 times, and sometimes feels unfair. For instance sometimes you start a run, and you will come across a golden chest, but you can't get to the chest without a bomb, and you can't unlock the chest without a key, and more often than not there won't be any bomb or key pickups on the floor so you are unable to get the chest. (same applies to opening doors, secret rooms, etc.)- As with the previous note abilities are also randomized, so sometimes you can go an entire game without seeing a single dmg + abilitiy making the game feel unfairOther than its a great game that everyone should experience. I know I probably should say more good things about the game, but there's already 99999 positive reviews on the game, so instead I focused on what I didn't like and what I think would make the game better. (criticism = improvements in later games)			"

												If you like a challenge this is the game for you. I have fully completed this game and I must say it can be pretty rage inducing at some points and luck determines a main part of how the game goes, but to win you do need to try pretty hard yourself too and overal the game is pretty balanced. If you buy the game you should buy the Wrath of the Lamb DLC with it since it is really worth it. It includes more items and bosses. There is a remake of the game called The binding of Isaac: Rebirth (And Afterbirth DLC) and if you like this game I would also recommend Rebirth since it's mostly the same game but with even more horrors and challenges. This game does have one major addition called hard mode/ ethernal mode which adds even harder bosses and harder variations on existing monsters.In conclusion, the game is pretty hard and if you like a chalenge you should consider buying this game especially if its on sale.

												Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen who has worked on other indie games like super meat boy. At first glance you will be questioning getting it but is one of the best indie games I have played. The game is a rouge like with hundreds of items to bump into on the way as you go through room after room, floor after floor killing and defeating bosses along the way. WIth 10 different endings that will increase the difficulty each time you beat one and with different alternate endings after increases the play time value giantly. The game does look very dark on the elements but is a great game with refrences to other games Edmund McMillen as made. I would rate this 10/10 with charcters, mulitple endings, hundred of items you will not find that you have done everything and with each room you go into random everytime you will enjoy your time with this game £4.99 well spent. PS a remade version will be comming out early 2014 with new features and better quality ingame.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun, cheap and extremly fun game, with a lot of replayability and almost infinite item combinations that make the game even funnier.The game is incredibly hard when you start playing it but once you get a hang of it you won't want to stop, just like McMillen's Super Meat Boy. In the same way as meat boy, Binding of Isaac also has an flawless sountrack composed by Danny B. with kudos to boss themes.The only ""bad"" aspect of the game i can think is that when you die you have to start all over again, which can get frustrating after a while, but what is a good game without it's difficulty?Overall 10/10			"

												Much like the other offerings from Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily discouraged, frustrated, or require a constant, guiding hand to have a good time. The Binding of Isaac will kill you, a lot, over and over, without mercy. However, the genius of its game design beckons to a bygone era where reward and punishment come purely from reflexes, understanding the game mechanics, how enemies move and fight, and a proper utilization of the tools at hand. Because of this design philosophy, Isaac will demand that you play again and again, slowly honing your skill and understanding until you no longer feel small and defenseless. The game can seem impossibly difficult upon first sitting, yet once the wisdom of time accumulates those impossible bosses will suddenly seem like easy prey compared to the horrors you now contend with on the deeper levels.Mechanically, Isaac suffers slightly from its roots as a Flash based game, denying us some of the features and options we have come to expect even from an indie game. However, the gameplay is still brilliant enough to warrant attention and the gameplay is often spot on. Isaac catches and keeps attention with a reliance on perma-death and random pick-ups which can drastically alter how the game is played. One moment you are shooting ineffective tears at enemies, the next you are firing screen extending lasers, the next you are soaring over pits and obstructions with angelic wings. There is enough constant variety available in every play through to keep the game refreshing even on the three-hundredth run, compounded by the introduction of new bosses, deeper levels, new playable characters, and more powerful and interesting bonuses unlocked upon your continued successes.Beyond the addictive gameplay, McMillen has crafted an art style which is often both beautiful and disturbing. The cartoony characterizations mask the devious implications of many of the enemies and items as well as softening the harsh blows presented by the sheer constant brutality of your actions. There is something about Isaac that gets into your head, a fact not discounted by the catchy, haunting music constantly calling you ever further into the abyss. It is not unreasonable to say that Isaac is not a game you can pick up over a weekend, beat, and then forget; on the contrary it will call to you in the waking world, offering one more game, one more chance to redeem all your failed attempts, one more opportunity to immerse yourself in its twisted, witty, and beautiful world.

												This game is in terms of looks fairly simple, but don't let that fool you. Binding of Isaac will occupy your time and keep you amused for hours if you let it. The games randomizer can be quite frustrating at times, but occassionally you get the perfect run and while you spent some time getting there you will unlock tons and tons of new items and features, which brings something new to the table for every new game you play.This game is for someone who enjoy shoot-em-ups but also enjoy classic platformers such as some retro games as it has a nice element of dungeon-crawl.

												it seems simplebut when you play for 30min then you will see how hard (and beautiful) this game isbecause the game is randomly generated you will never see the same place again(actually you may see some rooms again but the whole map will never be the same)and this game also have no saving so if you quit the game you have to play from the beginingthis game remind me of dark souls ... i mean whenever you die you know that it was your fault and you could do betteri would totaly recommend it			"

												Just buy it and the DLC. It's worth full price but even goes on sale for cheap.The Binding of Isaac's story is quite biblical, and as a result, helps you learn lots of Biblical names (if that's your thing) while having a wonderful time. The constant rewards make you feel like you're doing really good, and keep the game interesting for a long time.Medium 100% Time Consuming Yet Enjoyable10/10 Poops			"

The games randomizer can be quite frustrating at times, but occassionally you get the perfect run and while you spent some time getting there you will unlock tons and tons of new items and features, which brings something new to the table for every new game you play.This game is for someone who enjoy shoot-em-ups but also enjoy classic platformers such as some retro games as it has a nice element of dungeon-crawl.

The Binding of Isaac is an addictive twin-stick shooter that rejuvenated the roguelike genre and gifts players with a memorable gaming experience, though it is thoroughly hampered by technical flaws, creative limitations and the existence of a wholly-superior successor.In Isaac, you play as the titular character, a five-year-old boy, fleeing from his homicidal mother throughout the realms that exist beneath his basement. Isaac uses his tears as bullets to fire at enemies. He's aided by items, trinkets, pills and cards that he finds along the way, which further disfigure him until he is almost unrecognizable by the end of the game. The full game can be beat on average in under an hour - this is the staple element of the ""roguelike"" genre, which developer Edmund McMillen implemented in Isaac, effectively resurrecting the genre among the indie game market. Roguelikes are exceptionally short, but are also permadeath, meaning that a character's death is absolute. Finally, each playthrough of the game is randomly generated, with no two playthroughs featuring the same items, bosses and floor layouts. This all effectively means that Isaac is infinitely replayable, for there is always the motivation of finding undiscovered, superpowerful item combinations to keep players coming back.The unique thematic styles that the game contains provides an experience that can be quite subjective and polarizing, though those coming in with open minds find that they enjoy Isaac's charm over time. The game has significant connection to the Christian faith: the title of the game, the names of the characters (minus one) and many items contain references to the contents of the Bible. Though these references are not explicitly sacriligious, considering the context of the game (surrounded by a naked crying child and rooms full of poop) and its lore (with divine intervention driving Isaac's mother to hunt him down), those who are deeply devout may be turned off by the game's subject matter. The music is somber and melancholic, underscoring Isaac's desperation throughout his journey. Overarching visual presentation possesses an air of artistry, due to the models of characters and enemies being hand-drawn by developer Edmund McMillen, then being directly transplanted into the game. The wide variety of sizes and styles for enemies and item effects allows players to internalize what certain things do, which in turn paves the way for strategic deveopment and improved play upon practice.The issues that this game faces are great in number, and cannot be solely attributed to the game's genre. Technologically, the game has faults that could even lead it to being described as ""broken"". The limitations of the Flash medium the game was designed on is often attributed as the cause of framerate issues, as well as cases of the game freezing while loading certain levels, the latter of which has become so well-known in the community that it even has its own name (""the Pink Glitch""). The in-game stat screen on the pause menu is known to misrepresent the actual stats of the player, and either way is too vague to be useful. Some item descriptions outright lie to the player, and at least one item and one trinket are known to either do nothing or solely harm the player. There are some interactions that allow the player to fall to negative health. Though these facets harm most players, there is an interesting metagame that exists in the Isaac community that calls for exploitation of known bugs and synergies to literally ""break the game"", by getting every item available or forcing the game to crash while trying to get there. What is arguably more dissappointing than these technical issues are the ample lack of synergies. Though some basic tear modifiers can stack on in large numbers to create crazy effects, the strongest items in the game that change your attack from tears to another format largely cancel each other out upon pickup, with invisible stat changes the only possible outcome. The game punted its opporunity to become great by neglecting to implement synergies to so many combinations.Despite the aforementioned issues, Isaac was still the standard-bearer for the roguelike genre and was a phenominally popular game. However, it has been dethroned by its own reimagining: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This recent successor was developed by a new development team and has addressed the numerous technical and synergistic issues noted above. Though the game is not perfect, it is far superior to the original Isaac on virtually all levels. Therefore, in consideration of buyers' finances, if you're new to the franchise then get Rebirth. However, on its own, this is still a brilliantly-conceived title with engaging gameplay and an indefinite lifespan. Considering the price for the original is often so low on the Internet, it may still even be worth purchase now. The Binding of Isaac gets a C+.			"

												I love this game. Also, I hate it. It is just the way it is balanced without even trying to be balanced that makes it really hard and challenging in a dumb, but clever way and any change to any of the mechanics or rates would basicly have the potential to blow up the whole thing. Giving yourself 6 completely random items via spidermod at the very start of the game will nearly always get you a decent set of stuff that is not overpowered and not underpowered- giving yourself 8 or more items will ultimately overpower you in most occasions. I skipped the treasure rooms in these spidermod-runs by the way to make it fair and it was a proof to me that somehow Isaac became a very very complex box of stuff interacting with each other in a very catching way, making you wanna try out new combinations, playstyles, etc. You can play the game super safe for example - or you can just rush it and play sloppy as hell - it doesn't matter. Once you got used to the controls, found out what the items do and basicly go with the flow of the game you can make your own exceptions in playstyle and challenge-stuff. It's a little like maths I guess, but with much more luck involved.			"

												I STRONGLY recommend this game! For $5 you get hours and hours of game play, your life in Isaac might only be from 15-50 minutes but the reason you will want to come back is the randomness of it all! No two Isaac runs are the same, you will always have a different item set. This game is a little hard at first but with over 100 hours in I still love this and it is worth the try!			"

												It's dirt  cheap during any sale and it is as gold as everything else Team Meat has managed to churn out. If you are curious what you are getting into it, it's something strangely familiar and incredibly well made. It is basically a top down shooter reminescent of old Zelda games (my favorite kind) with roguelike elements and some twisted humor.*On a side note: buy the DLC, I don't need to add why, its everything you love topped with more of what you love.Roguelikes have been making a resurgence lately as part of the revisionist mantra of ""real gamers like hardcore challenges"". Which is all well and good, sure I like to be challenged in certain ways, but I definitely like to relax too. More importantly it's not just any challenge that gamers should clamor for, it's the good kind, the fair kind. Team Meat has this down perfectly. When ever you die in one of their games it's not a question of a flaw in the game's design, an enemy that is overpower, or an impossible obstacle, the only the wrong is you. The game has a simple set of mechanics and some secrets in gameplay that you can and should figure out on your own. When you lose in this game you should feel that welcome brand of shame that says ""I should've known better"". This game isn't trying to fool, you know what you are playing and you know what you should've done.The real draw from a game that is continously killing you, besides the superb gamplay, is the sense of progress and reward. There is a plethora of secrets to be found in The Binding of Isaac, all unlocked in a variety of ways and adding to the gameplay. The game starts with Isaac, there are more characters to unlock later, shooting tears and running around naked. From defeating bosses, random chests, or treasure rooms, Isaac unlocks various items that alter his abilities. Most of the abilities are passive and stack, and some are useable abilities like cards or a cat's head. These items are all random ( a treasure may net you a spiffy spider upgrade to your tears or just a teleporter) and the levels are procedurally generated. On top of all  the game altering the items can do, they also change your character's appearance into something that is usually atrocious and hilarious.The Binding of Isaac will kill you a lot (and not in the Dark Souls way where  you can still get something back and respawn from the last campfire), but you will never feel like it was a waste. I've had some two minute sessions of this game that netted me a new secret item, and there is always something to unlock in The Binding of Isaac. After dying so many times you will get better, and then you will still keep dying, but you'll enjoy it.  "

												The Binding of Isaac is a superb rougelike game featureing over 200 items and 50+ monsters the replayablity is endless.I personally think that if you going to buy this game and you are clueless of what this game is, you should figure it out for yourself rather than watching a Let's play or any sort of walktrough of it.And why you may ask?Because one of the biggest strong points about this game is learning what everything does and what should bosses and enemies you should be thirlled from.Altrough this game is pretty modern game it is more based on retro games and the diffuclty curve is alot bigger then other exsisting game which adds to the fun of this gameOver the top you have the awesome looking artstyle and the amazingly fitting religious soundtrack made by Danny B. which made also the soundtrack for another one of Edmund Mcmillen games Super Meat BoyI find that the weakset point of this game is the fact it runs on flash and it means it very limited by performance and on rooms with alot of enemies and particle effects the game may run poorly even on high-end machines.I think that in this 5$ price point, and it is a must have for any type of gamer.Not convinced yet?Go to Newgrounds and try the demo for yourself!

												The Binding of Isaac is a remarkably enjoyable game, and deserving of much of the praise it receives. While implementing tougher Roguelike elements, it manages to retain the fundamental accessibility and shallow learning curve that hallmark the most well-received indie titles. This is a commendable achievement, and is probably what makes it a foregone conclusion that this game will be remembered as one of the best indie games of all time. But the game does have a very glaring flaw that is too rarely pointed out. The game is short and the dungeons are small, which has the effect of making progression and completion nearly impossible unless you have a lucky start. This is really the worst that can be said of The Binding of Isaac, though, and the game is fun and rewarding at least as often as it is frustrating and unfair. Make sure that you have a very solid handle on the base game before you even consider getting the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, as it ramps up difficulty considerably.			"

												It is one of the best and toughest games that i have played, the beginning is easy, but the difficulty level to level increases considerably, not forgetting the key points in this game:- Simple gameplay, but challenging.- Simple Atmosphere.- A great touch of humor that developers added to this great title.- Tons of items, enemies and abilities.- The soundtrack and sound effects give a very special touch.I bought this game in steam sales (Ultra cheap) and i do not regret purchasing it.10 / 10			"

												The Binding of Isaac Game ReviewThe binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.Controls and GameplayThe controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively. You first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads.  The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.Graphics and SoundThe graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison. The music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on.  The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing. Replayability and MultiplayerThe Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked. There has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.To ConcludeI found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses.  So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a:•	Easy to learn controls ✓•	Gameplay ✓•	Graphics ✓•	Sound/Music ✓•	Replayable ✓•	Multiplayer  XRATED 5/6			"

												As of writing this review I'm still trying to get the no hit womb achievement which is a ***** to get but Issac is a game that I'm willing to give my time to as it may be the most value for money I've ever seen in a game.If you try to complete everything that the game has you will be playing for more than 800 hours (or that my time spend in the game anyway) and for the price the game asks for expecially when it's on sale you will get every cent out of it.my only problem with the game is the fullscreen isn't that great and you can't seem to rebind the keys or use a controller.though Rebirth is out I highly recommend this game if you don't have the money for it or you want a good time waster.

												It was the Winter Sale and everyone was all aboard the hype train. Choo Choooo! I jumped on board.But after hours and hours of playing, I have to say, this is what Extra Credits was talking about when they spoke about the difference between a challenging game and a punishing game. In a challenging game, one is forced to rely on skill, sometimes within a steep learning curve, but there's a high risk reward factor because you know if you do a good job, put in the time and effort to get better, make the smarter calls, you will be rewarded with greater success. There is a system to master, not game or exploit, but master- and when you manage to, you feel like the Master. In a punishing game, like so, you can in one run through be given 2 power ups per room and 2 spiders to defeat per room or NO power ups for 6 straight levels, 8 monsters per room, and every chest gives you multiple bombs that chase you until they explode. Because the effects of the same actions can produce such varying results, the overall feeling over time is that your actions aren't what matters.The end result for me is that instead of feeling challenged, I feel Punished for playing. I might as well have enjoyed rolling a die. To its credit, this has better graphics than just rolling a die and lots of kooky 3spooky5me atmosphere to immerse itself in, good music, and decent controls. But I don't really care if it's a high-spec 120 fps HD sensory feast factory. If the end result is still that it's all a crap shoot, that half the time I should just restart until I get a better first few levels, then there comes a painful awareness the more one plays that the outcome has less to do with me than with all those die rolls.

												I told myself I wasn't going to write a review until I beat the game. But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.Pros:- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss- Vague yet incapturing story- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to- There are indeed multiple endings- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay valueCons:- This game is impossibly difficultI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the ""Mom Fight"". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive. My final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon. 8.5/10			"

												I told myself I wasn't going to write a review until I beat the game. But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game.

												Binding of Isaac..Yes, the Binding of Isaac is one of the deepest, heart touching and emotionful game about life of a little boy named Isaac. It has many Bible references, those make the game more mysterious and interesting. Not willing to spoil anything, but it's more like how Isaacs life turned into hell. He just lived a happy, joyful and simple life with his Mother in a small house on a hill. But one day Isaacs Mom heard a voice from above.. The God tells his Mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac.The gameplay reminded me a lot of Zelda games - Bombs: used to break rocks, kill enemies and cut Your way through closed doors if needed. Coins: Used to play slot machines, buy items and etc. Keys: Unlock treasure rooms and other locked doors. It is also a very random, no two runs are the same, random pick-ups and enemies. Variety of items - over 250 items! every collectible You pick will be shown on Your character. Make Your shots (tears) stronger by collecting those items to defeat more difficult bosses, make Your Character faster by collecting other types of items, to dodge enemy attacks and so on! I'm definitely recommending it! You won't regret! The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the game. Many endings will keep You satisfied to play more, even if You die (Death is permanent in game).But the game has a deeper meaning to it, wayy deeper, it is what it makes so original and very different, from the other games, even games from the same creator. Yes, it is sad and You'll understand it once You've beaten the game 10th time..Have a nice time playing this amazing game!-Circumflex			"

												This is a very popular Real Time Strategy game. It has over 270 champions to choose from. The only playable one, however, is a kid named Isaac, because all the others champions cost $75 to play. Even so, the champion Isaac has many strengths that help him along his path. He can pick up many items and use them to his advantage to contact Child Services to take him away from his abusive family. Once you contact CPS, your family decides to shoot you, and you die. This game has made me very sad and depressed, so I don't reccomend playing this game at all. "

												I have a personal connection with this game because it combined something I love which is videogames & something I hate which is religion. This game is a breath of fresh air against all the crap in religion & I honestly recommend this game if you have a gloomy day or you just want to let off some steam so if you like classic Zelda games & you hate religion go play this game.

												The ultimate Bible FPS game. The Binding of Isaac shows great Christian morality and teaches the truths of God. You play as Isaac Newton, master of magnet, who must defeat the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Metallica, Bill Clinton, Cyberdemon, Evilness, and Mass Debating) and fight the Lord of Darkness himself using only a club and an apple. The game is very challenging, with lots of challenge and challenging moments. However, first time players might have difficulty on the ""Throw the controller at the wall"" part. I know I did. 666/100.*SPOILER STUFF*------------------If you have issues fighting Satin, you must use the JebusMobile powerup and ride it up Satin's♥♥♥♥♥♥(real talk: the game is pretty good and you should get it)			"

THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME and rarely anyone dislikes it. And hey, its cheap so you won't lose a lot if you don't like it. You do spend a lot of time playing this game because its SO different everytime you play. Then if you buy the DLC its even MORE different and adds another 100+ hours to the game. Great game.

With many unique abilities but a random level/dungeon generator, it ultimately becomes an addicting quest to be the strongest or fastest or ANYTHING you're going for (it's not like you're going to have a choice) and has a heck of a lot of replayability.

												This game is a very good one as long as you don't mind the fact that it has the most satanic backstory that I have ever seen! Do not buy this game if you aren't ok with that. This game was made by Edmund Mcmillen who by the way made Super Meat Boy.  Great dungeon game. 10/10.			"

												So many different ways to play this game, so much verity between each of the different play-throughs. It's incredibly hard to finish the game the first few times but when you get more and more used to the style of game and dodging enemies instead of being destructive and offensive, you'll be okay. Rebirth will be out soon anyway, so play both!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a easy and fun RPG Shooter. The controls are easy to pick up in a short amount of time. The radomization makes you keep intrest every time, and the items also add some spice to the game. The story isn't too bad either for what it's going for. I would really advise you to play it as it's a game with never ending fun.			"

												 Little late to the party, but I want to try out this new ""Steam Reviews"" thing by reviewing The Binding of Isaac. Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than ""hard"". Yes, there is a difference.""Well, what do you mean?"", says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against. Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a ""lucky"" run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.  ""So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?"", says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps. Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as ""hard"" join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself. Bye, and I hope to see you all again in 2014.			"

												I am really liking this new trend of 'Roguelikes For Actual People'. This is essentially a mash between Zelda and a roguelike. It also has a lot of creepiness attached to it. It's also a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of fun. You walk into rooms, cry at monsters until they die, take their things, cry at a big monster, die, reload, enjoy. It's simple but effective as hell, mainly because there's always something you haven't seen just yet and the tension when going into a new room is high.			"

												Top-down 2D dungeon crawler roguelike.A game that relies on replayability by giving the player different runs every time he plays through the game. By completing the game multiple times, more items and areas are unlocked.The game is structured through floors that consist of rooms, which are randomly generated and can include various things from enemies to special Items.Each floor features an itemroom that includes a passive or activatible item to aid the player in the rather hard rooms filled with treacherous enemies. If the player is unable to dodge correctly, he will find himself getting damages quite often and ending runs preemptively.To progress from floor to floor the player has to defeat the boss of each floor, who also drop passive items that increase health, damage or other stats.Since the release of Rebirth I would not recommend buying the original game, mostly because of performance issues related to the flash-engine that the game uses.

												The Bnding of Issac is a (like most people all it) a Zelda-like dungeon crawler. Yep, damn straight that's what it is. While this game is awesome, there are a few things that I have issues with. Let's start with the good things, shall we? Okay, the art style is awesome! I love the cartoony yet dark feel this game has to it. While it is a game that is dead serious, it's pretty funny with all of it's power-ups (which there are a frigging ton of) and bosses. Oh and good GOD ALMIGHTY that soundtrack. The music is creepy and also very catchy. PLUS! Every dungeon/ basement or whatthe♥♥♥♥ ever is random EVERY TIME, making every playthrough different. The characters and story are cool and funny (and down-right terrifying sometimes) and the enemies are also creepy and sometimes cute-ish. Now, those 'bad things' I said earlier? They really don't matter; but here we go. First, it's a flash game; therefore, it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥(for me. I have an awfull computer). The lag, yes, can really pull me from the game, but it's something I get used to. And finally is that a lot of the power-ups are kindda crappy. But all-in-all, it's a great game, and I can easily recomend everyone to it.     Final Score=8.75/10Edit: I got Windows 8.1 and somehow my game runs like 50% better. Final FINAL Score =9.75/10			"

												Binding of Isaac has provided me with one of the most frustrating, yet funnest and most addicting game experiences ever. This is the only game where you can defeat devil himself and die to a fly in the next room. Then swear to uninstall the game or swing at your computer but after 5 seconds proceed to play 10 more games.Game has a lot of replay value because of its randomized features and several unlockable characters, multiple endings, tons of enemy types and items and big learning curve.The music is superb, and the art style is charmingly disturbing as is the story. Overall I recomend this game 100% to everyone who can get past the bizarre aesthetic and sometimes irritating rogue like elements.			"

												Having just gotten 100% on this game, I think it's time that I give my review. To put it simply, this is my favorite game. Period. Since everything in the game is quite literally random (room layout, floor layout, power-ups, items, enemies, bosses etc.) it provides an immense level of replayability. I have put 270 hours into this game and have had to start from scratch due to a corrupted save and still I absolutely love it and play it nearly every day.I always love a high level of challenge and difficulty and The Binding of Isaac provides this in SPADES.At $8 for the game and the DLC (which is essential, in my opinion) this game is a great value. Better yet, it is often on sale for a couple dollars and this makes it a MUST BUY if you also enjoy a challenging and highly replayable game.			"

												     Após a sua mãe receber uma ordem de deus, pedindo para que ela purifique teu filho, ela decide sacrifica-lo.     O menino por tua vez corre e se tranca no quarto. No desespero ele descobre um alçapão em baixo de um tapete e então decide pular para salvar tua vida.    Ao cair no porão da casa descobre que não está sozinho, e que existem criaturas horrendas e bizzarras... que com o tempo ele descobre ser teus irmãos deformados.   O jogo tem uma dificuldade muito elevada, na qual para cada ""boss"" que for enfrentar precisará de itens decentes... Pelo contrario eles podem se tornar muito chatos.   Outro fator que eu achei bem interressante, é o fato de as stages se criarem randonicamente. Com isso Itens e lugares totalmente diferentes estarão disponiveis sempre que começar um game.    O jogo não possui vidas, nem check-points... então, morreu acabou o jogo. O que torna o jogo insano e extremo no quesito dificuldade. "

												This game is not for everyone. It's tough as nails and very dependant on luck. If you like roguelikes, exploration, and finding great combos, this is the game for you. Don't touch it if you prefer more casual experiences, if dying bothers you or if you don't like starting for the beginning on each run, without saves.Once you put that aside, it has a very deep meaning hidden behind those cartoonish graphics. The game will keep you on your toes, making you wonder what's next and how to overcome them. Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.However, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement. You'll get beams, lasers, chocolate and more to fight your enemies, which get increasingly hard. Even with bad luck, good reflexes and strategy will make you survive each run. "

Very simple and basic controls used for this game. The endless amount of upgrades/bosses randomly found within keep the player going. Although I must point  out the game is quite frustrating when first starting out so prepare to rage a few times before you get the hang of it.

												This game is addictive, It's so unique in it's genre,The drawn art style, the humour, the characters, the items,This game is just epic, It's NOT about gun skins or hats (well it does contain hats, but they have effects on your gameplay, like damage...) I give it a 9.9/10 Even  if it's a girl it shows Isaac's nightmare during the travel to another area...			"

You could spend HOURS in one play session alone, trying to get to mom! You will most likely die, but your compelled to try and try again till finally you do it! This game ain't for quiters is what I'm trying to say. Buy it if you loves a challange and loves it good! P.S: Also, this game ain't for your kids here, dispite its cartoony looks. It's plot is actually darn disturbing.......................HAVE FUN!			"

												Having just gotten 100% on this game, I think it's time that I give my review. To put it simply, this is my favorite game. Period. Since everything in the game is quite literally random (room layout, floor layout, power-ups, items, enemies, bosses etc.) it provides an immense level of replayability. I have put 270 hours into this game and have had to start from scratch due to a corrupted save and still I absolutely love it and play it nearly every day.I always love a high level of challenge and difficulty and The Binding of Isaac provides this in SPADES.At $8 for the game and the DLC (which is essential, in my opinion) this game is a great value. Better yet, it is often on sale for a couple dollars and this makes it a MUST BUY if you also enjoy a challenging and highly replayable game.			"

												This game is hard. Very hard. It throws you right in at the deep end with no knowledge of any of the huge catalogue of items, or enemies you will face, or even the rooms you will go through, but it has so much replay value. I must have played this game at least 1000 times by now, and I'm not even close to being bored, or even finishing the game. There is so much variability in this game's randomely generated rooms, floors, enemies and bosses, and you feel a huge sense of accomplishment every time you beat that tough boss or get past that awful room, and if and when you get lucky with items, you feel unstoppable, until you die, start again, and are as weak and pathetic as you always were. Enjoy.			"

None the less, extremely satisfying to master and dominate. Controls could be tighter, but are sufficient. Huge fan of Edmund, and Florian. I actually started this Steam account, a few years back just to download The Binding of Isaac, and it definitely needs a spot in your indie collection, as well. So please, for the sake of Isaac, BUY this game.			"

												Dark and twisted. When I was first shown this game, I really didn't know what to think of it. However, this has been one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. In essence the game itself is a fairly fast paced action where your tears are your weapon. The sheer amount of unlockable content is what kept me replaying over and over. Still not 100% the game and I dont think I will do for a while, but it is a game I can see myself going back to for years!Although this is not a traditional genre for me, it was worth the plunge. Rebirth is coming out soon and I cannot wait!			"

												""Man what kind of f...ed up kind of game is this?""Lemme tell ya, it'll be your life by the end of the day. Which could be today if you buy it now *wink wink*Simple game mechanics, tons of items, randomized stages, lots and lots of dirty little secrets to discover.Three factors on beating this game consistently to reach the very end:> your ability to shoot> your ability to dodge> and your luckTwo of those things are under your control, and it's most definitely not luck.You'll be praying to those RNG gods to give a piece of goodie heaven to make the game feel easier.But other than that, learn to dodge and shoot. Can't dodge and shoot? Go play Touhou or some other bullet hell gameOnce you get better, you'll be able to clear more stages and the playthrough itself. Keep in mind that the more playthroughs you clear, the number of stages lengthen and the enemies get increasingly bloodthirsty.This game launches in a blink of an eye and it will bring 200hrs+ of fun, frustration, and curiousity. Waiting for Netflix to load the movie? Launch Binding of IsaacSomeone is hogging your restroom? Launch Binding of IsaacCooking some turkey? Launch Binding of IsaacShort homework break? Uhh no please, this will further extend the ""short break"" into a ""day off""By the time you actually invested 200hrs, you'll either be a rambling looney, or a person enlightened with the patience and humility of a saint! But what's the difference? Just a deduction of $4.99 from your wallet. Is it worth it? Do my sleep deprived eyes tell you otherwise? This game is totally worth it "

												From the makers of Super Meat Boy comes this great, terryifyingly bizarre game. This game mixes overhead third person shooting with the dungeon exploration of the original Legend of Zelda. The is is a roguelike, meaning it has RPG like stats, randomly generated levels, and if you die you have to start all over. Various enemies require strategy and skill, and the bosses have the game feeling like a SHUMP bullet hell game at times. There are TONS of items and skills, that boost stats, changes your ammo, or giving you unique skills like shooting through walls. The game varies difficulty, sometimes being a walk in the park or frustratingly difficult, but it's pick up and play style mixed with the short game time and endless replayability make this a great game at a very cheap price.

												I am really liking this new trend of 'Roguelikes For Actual People'. This is essentially a mash between Zelda and a roguelike. It also has a lot of creepiness attached to it. It's also a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of fun. You walk into rooms, cry at monsters until they die, take their things, cry at a big monster, die, reload, enjoy. It's simple but effective as hell, mainly because there's always something you haven't seen just yet and the tension when going into a new room is high.			"

												     Após a sua mãe receber uma ordem de deus, pedindo para que ela purifique teu filho, ela decide sacrifica-lo.     O menino por tua vez corre e se tranca no quarto. No desespero ele descobre um alçapão em baixo de um tapete e então decide pular para salvar tua vida.    Ao cair no porão da casa descobre que não está sozinho, e que existem criaturas horrendas e bizzarras... que com o tempo ele descobre ser teus irmãos deformados.   O jogo tem uma dificuldade muito elevada, na qual para cada ""boss"" que for enfrentar precisará de itens decentes... Pelo contrario eles podem se tornar muito chatos.   Outro fator que eu achei bem interressante, é o fato de as stages se criarem randonicamente. Com isso Itens e lugares totalmente diferentes estarão disponiveis sempre que começar um game.    O jogo não possui vidas, nem check-points... então, morreu acabou o jogo. O que torna o jogo insano e extremo no quesito dificuldade. "

												Gameplay is incredibly similar to Zelda 1 and the game doesn't have to hide it, they have several enemies that even have the same movement, they even have tektites. Regardless, most people won't even notice, considering the game is really fun and infinitely replayable, I recommend this game to anyone, it will provide hours of entertainment at a great price.			"

												I first thought I would never like this game: it was weird, creepy and roguelike (something im terrible at).But after a while i grew to like it because of its ability to fit into one half of my screen while I watched youtube in the other.It also does a really good job of giving you a sense of achievement: when i beat mom's heart for the fikrst time i was the most excited about beating a boss than i ever was.In conclusion i would recommend getting this game on a sale with wrath of the lamb.it makes a huge difference.

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game to those who love the feel of the first zelda dungeons and bosses because it feels just like that go throught different rooms, find items, collect keys for item rooms or doors, and fight bosses along the way to find the secret of Isaac's basement for this game i would give it a 8/10 but i must say it's a bit hard you have to get used to the fast reaction times of not getting hit because every heart counts have fun.

												I bought this game with the DLC for something around 0.65€ on sale (lol, almost for free!), but it offers far more than you'd expect from the game costing so little. At first I was like:""Dude, what the F. There's poop everywhere, disgusting stuff..."" and all that....but I gave this game a chance, and I sincerely don't have any regrets. Of course, it has its minor flaws - Flash makes this game little bit slow.BUT: the gameplay is excellent, it has brilliant OST that will never get boring, it's highly addictive.Rebirth (renewed version) is much more better-er, but if you can't afford it, this one will do just fine too.

That's really the only complaint I have. If memes get you angry this is probably not the game for you, but if they actually make you angry you have bigger problems than videogames.Highly recommend, there's a reason it's eaten up 2 entire weeks of my life.

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

												The ultimate Bible FPS game. The Binding of Isaac shows great Christian morality and teaches the truths of God. You play as Isaac Newton, master of magnet, who must defeat the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Metallica, Bill Clinton, Cyberdemon, Evilness, and Mass Debating) and fight the Lord of Darkness himself using only a club and an apple. The game is very challenging, with lots of challenge and challenging moments. However, first time players might have difficulty on the ""Throw the controller at the wall"" part. I know I did. 666/100.*SPOILER STUFF*------------------If you have issues fighting Satin, you must use the JebusMobile powerup and ride it up Satin's♥♥♥♥♥♥(real talk: the game is pretty good and you should get it)			"

Most of the difficulty doesnt come from the enemies or the bosses bt it comes from learning how each item works and how to work with it because most of the items  you pick up you cannot get rid of ,meaning  that if you get an item that you hate you have to deal with it. Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention.

												One of my favorite games of all time!The binding of Isaac is a rough like game, where you have to go through a sereis of rooms, in order to omplete a level.The game is acually difficult, amnd at times, you will have geat challanges to overcome, like bosses or big pulls of enemyes.The story is simple, you are playing as Isaac (or some of the charectes you can unlock) and has to escape Mom, becouse she is trying to kill you in gods name. The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.The controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.The funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.There are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.There are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.The plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.There is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.There is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.Then there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.There is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.Then there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.And then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.So about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.The game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.This is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10			"

												I passed up on this game a while ago because I wasn't entirely sure about it. Just a while ago, I purchased the game for $5 on Steam and started playing it. This game is extremely fun. There is no reason for anyone who likes games to not get this game. The game costs $5 and I've already played it longer than some $20-$40 games.STORY:You play as Isaac, a small child who has been thrown into the basement under his house after his mother supposedly heard a message from god telling her to sacrifice her son. You, as Isaac, must traverse the basement, going deeper and deeper in an effort to survive the horrors in the depths below.GAMEPLAY:The game takes place from a Birds-eye viewpoint, and you control Isaac using WASD and his tear shots using the arrow keys or the mouse. His tears can shoot in 4 cardinal directions (NSEW) and are used as Isaacs primary attack. On your way, there are secret rooms to find coins, shops to purchase items, treasure rooms to get new abilities, boss rooms to fight bosses, devil rooms to give up some hearts for a rare and special item, and so forth. The game has enough variety to keep me coming back for more and trying to perfect my ""run"".GRAPHICS:The game uses a sort-of cutesy vector graphics format, which works well in contrast of the dark undertones of the game. Elements and enemies that need to stand out do so, while things that aren't as important don't attract your eyes attention, something very important in games similar to The Binding of Isaac.BALANCE:The Binding of Isaac is well balanced, but it is easier to talk about what is not balanced rather than talk about what is. Tears Upgrades tend to be rather useless, as they are outshadowed in usefullness by their bigger brother ""The Damage Upgrade"", and the knockback produced from tears can go out of control with enough tears upgrades, sending enemies flying in all directions and making it harder to dodge. The game is also based on luck quite a bit, from the upgrades you draw to the rooms that you find, but it also requires a lot of skill, something you earn from playing the game. Additionally, some of the upgrades just plain suck. Other than that, the game is well balanced.OVERVIEW:The Binding of Isaac is a Birds-Eye dungeon crawler with a fantastic concept and huge buckets of replayability. This game would be high up on my Top 10 Favorite Games list if I had one.			"

												I bought this game with the DLC for something around 0.65€ on sale (lol, almost for free!), but it offers far more than you'd expect from the game costing so little. At first I was like:""Dude, what the F. There's poop everywhere, disgusting stuff..."" and all that....but I gave this game a chance, and I sincerely don't have any regrets. Of course, it has its minor flaws - Flash makes this game little bit slow.BUT: the gameplay is excellent, it has brilliant OST that will never get boring, it's highly addictive.Rebirth (renewed version) is much more better-er, but if you can't afford it, this one will do just fine too.

												A great game. Truly awesome graphics with perfect gameplay. It is very difficult for me though; when I bought the game I bought the DLC (Wrath of the Lamb) with it and you cannot turn the DLC off. The DLC makes it much harder so it's taking me some time to adapt but it is still extremely fun. Great game, especially for it's price of $5. You cannot find anything better for it's price. It is much better than many $10 - $20 I've played! This is a must-buy.			"

												Story: A bit dark and filled with jabs at religion. That doesn't bother me, but the game is definitly not appropriate for a younger audience and those who don't take religion jokes lightly.  Also, some of the bosses/mobs are a bit gruesome and distrubing (but I dont mind!!).The game without the DLC has about 7 levels, takes me about an hour (on a good run) to beat the game. Considering that I have more than 20 hours into this game and have only beaten it 5 times :C. The trick to this game is that death is permanent for your current playthrough. Once you die you have to restart at the beginning and pray for good items. IF you aren't accustomed to the perma-death scenario I don't reccommend this game. I enjoy it purely because of the flexibility of the levels and the ever-changing drops. This game is a great game and has a good price imo.			"

												It will creep you out, and disgust you, and make you wish you could have a physical copy just to burn it. But it's so fun. Think a rogue-like legend of zelda, minus 99% of the puzzles, since items are the only way to progress your character and the only experience points are the ones in steam badges. The bullet-hell style shooting is hard but fair, like the platforming in Super Meat Boy. Plus, now's a good time to buy for the loyalty discount on Binding of Issac: Rebirth. I'll leave the negative stuff to someone else. I hope I helped!			"

Despite its cute gooryness, its a very entertaining game with lots of items to upgrade one of the 5 unlockable characters.It fun to dodge and run trough all the little mutated babies, trying to kill them with your upgradable spit.The variety in items and enemies is really impressive. While playing i'm guarantiing you will be curious to see what comes next in each room you will enter, or seeiing how an item changes the appearance of your character.TIP: when taking an offer from satan, don't pick the cat item, it gives you 9 lives, but 1 life is just 1 heart unless you're looking to increase the difficulty of the game then go ahead:) "

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that grows on you. The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me. A couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.  To appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay. I've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest ""Eternals"" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours. TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.			"

												Perhaps the best indie game I've played to date. The Binding of Isaac is such an addictive game. One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10			"

												This is a rather fun game that will test your patience, skill, and luck. No two runs are the same and it's an enjoyable experience that will leave you coming back for more.That being said, there is a slightly learning curve, but that's part of the fun right?Also, if you can, wait till you meat Mom's Heart 6 times before buying the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, if you want it to feel truer to the creators original intention.

												The name Isaac is derived from a Hebrew word that means '' He laughs '' which is ironic since the character that you play kills his enemies with his own tears. If that isn't unsettling enough, the game itself is inspired by the biblical story of the binding of Isaac, where a father (Abraham) is commanded by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac. (In this case, Isaac's mother hears God who commands her to kill him to purge him of all his sins, yikes).Please, do not shy away from this game from all the religious undertones and various symbolisms scattered throughout it, because The Binding of Isaac is so much more than that.After playing it for 230 hours, I was finally able to 100% the game. Some players might take more time to achieve this and some less. And I can strongly say, this is a very well constructed and very addictive game that offers much replayability and challenges, especially for such a low price (DLC a must!). It's a rogue-like ''zelda-esque'' game with randomly generated floors, rooms, items, enemy fights and bosses. It's the type of game that, indeed, has to do with luck but also skill. While everything is somehow random, by learning what items do and how to fully take advantage of all the tools and mechanics the game offers, you will eventually become comfortable adventuring floors with each playthrough.The game will be frustrating and very hard, but when you finally get your first win, it's oh so satisfiying ^w^b and it can only get better from there hehehe...

												The ultimate Bible FPS game. The Binding of Isaac shows great Christian morality and teaches the truths of God. You play as Isaac Newton, master of magnet, who must defeat the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Metallica, Bill Clinton, Cyberdemon, Evilness, and Mass Debating) and fight the Lord of Darkness himself using only a club and an apple. The game is very challenging, with lots of challenge and challenging moments. However, first time players might have difficulty on the ""Throw the controller at the wall"" part. I know I did. 666/100.*SPOILER STUFF*------------------If you have issues fighting Satin, you must use the JebusMobile powerup and ride it up Satin's♥♥♥♥♥♥(real talk: the game is pretty good and you should get it)			"

												Do you like rougelikes? Great. Get this game.Do you hate rougelikes and got BoI to try to make yourself like it? Don't bother. This game will not convince you. It runs on the idea that you WILL go back to it and try to beat level after level. Thats great. Those that like that will love it.The art style has a childish creepiness that I honestly like. Each powerup changes issac a bit to add some kind of progression. The powerups are great by the way.If there was a mod that would auto save after each level I'd actually play it and most likely beat it.As far as I'm concerned this game only makes me wish the refund system existed when I bought it.No, I won't uninstall it. I want people to know I gave it a very fair shot several times.I even bought Wrath of the Lamb, but I do not know what it does.But just because I hated it does not mean you won't like it. if you like roguelikes this is literally the perfect game for you.I did not enjoy this experince.

												The Binding of Isaac is a pretty faithful rogue-like title mixed with a twin stick shooter style dungeon crawler. Although rather than using twin analogue sticks you use WSAD and the arrow keys. On paper this only allows 4 directions of fire but the bullets actually respond to your characters momentum so they can be directed diagonally with well planned movement. In addition to being very competent in what it does, The Binding of Isaac has a ridiculous amount of content and secrets to discover.The game plays great and has wonderful replayability, but where it shines is in the background story and the atmosphere. The core theme is a very dark look at a fanatically religious mother and her abused/neglected son. I could easily understand the argument that I'm looking too deep into it, but if you let it get to you I think the story is as impacting and disturbing as the gameplay.			"

This is the only game where you can defeat devil himself and die to a fly in the next room. Then swear to uninstall the game or swing at your computer but after 5 seconds proceed to play 10 more games.Game has a lot of replay value because of its randomized features and several unlockable characters, multiple endings, tons of enemy types and items and big learning curve.The music is superb, and the art style is charmingly disturbing as is the story.

												Positive: A game with high replayability, captivating because you can complete all the challenges, with all the characters. And even ending the game you keep playing because many different combinations, because you never have an equal race. Diversity is the wealth of this game. The fact of having a DLC also features, it is not a DLC any, is a DLC that adds several items, increased playing time, has a very good price, and hence boost the passion for the game. And do not forget the ""rewards"" of the game, the fact that you fail to pass the challenge, and after a while trying and trying, finally you can and that's where you animate to play the game more and more, yielding hours and more hours of play.Negative: A great game, more done in a platform that harmed no doubt the same. The fact that the achievements are not synchronized also damages. The game is not as fluid through the platform of fact in this case is the JAVA.			"

That's really the only complaint I have. If memes get you angry this is probably not the game for you, but if they actually make you angry you have bigger problems than videogames.Highly recommend, there's a reason it's eaten up 2 entire weeks of my life.

												The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike indie game devloped by Edmund McMillen, which I have owned for a few years. It presents a unique stoyline, focusing around Isaac, a small boy who it is presumed wishes for his mother's affection. As the game has a heavy religion focus, a god speaks to his mother with the order to end Isaac's life. Isaac, fearful of his mother finds a hidden trapdoor in his room, and delves into the depths of what is under the house. The game itself is mainly skill based, but partially luck based. Certain combinations of items can ensure an easy and victorious playthrough while other item comboes make a challenging and tedious one.  It contains endless tilesets aswell as a total of 11 different settings along with 7 characters. This game is insanely fun, and provides a testament to your dodging skills. There are many more positive things I can say about this game, but I advise you pick it up and find out yourself ;)			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun and addictive flash game well worth the price you're paying for it.I have already put more hours in this simple little flash of 5 euros full priced than in a ''Next-gen revolutionary'' game.The gameplay is easy to learn and understand and the later levels are always challenging.But all good things must have a bad side.Once you get an fair amount of items the game starts dropping in framerate which can be a bit frustrating.Also the game can get really easy or really difficult depending on certain item drops.Such as the ''Mom's knife'' and ''Sacred Heart'' combo which basicly allows you to 1-shot almost all enemies in the game (Including bosses).Otherwise it is possible to receive only activateable items which you can only carry 1 of at a time, resulting in getting no proper stats making the game near-impossible to complete.All things set aside I think it's a great game which is fun to play or watch others play.The price can drop below 2 euros during steam sales so if you need a fun game that's easy to pick up, look no further!

												Positive: A game with high replayability, captivating because you can complete all the challenges, with all the characters. And even ending the game you keep playing because many different combinations, because you never have an equal race. Diversity is the wealth of this game. The fact of having a DLC also features, it is not a DLC any, is a DLC that adds several items, increased playing time, has a very good price, and hence boost the passion for the game. And do not forget the ""rewards"" of the game, the fact that you fail to pass the challenge, and after a while trying and trying, finally you can and that's where you animate to play the game more and more, yielding hours and more hours of play.Negative: A great game, more done in a platform that harmed no doubt the same. The fact that the achievements are not synchronized also damages. The game is not as fluid through the platform of fact in this case is the JAVA.			"

This game is probably one of my favourite games I have on my Steam account and is rightfully so. I'm glad I bought this game when I first did.			"

												If a game where you shoot poop with your projectile tears to get tiny blue hearts for sustanence can keep so many people entertained for hundreds of hours each, it is something special. It has simple mechanics and is easy to get into for any gamer who likes to be constantly challenged. People who have played thousands of hours of this game can still pick it up at any time for a run. Not to mention its price, which at times of sale can be as low as 2 dollars WITH the DLC. There is no reason for everybody to not have this game already.			"

												NOTE: Please buy the 'Wrath of the Lamb' DLC if you're going to get this. It will make TBoI a million times better, and will allow you to update the game to get the Hard Mode.With randomly generated dungeons for every playthrough and a top down dungeon crawling experience in the same vein of the original Zelda trilogy, The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game that can be picked up for less than a dollar and provides hours and hours of fun on end.Following Isaac, a young boy who is trying to defeat his murderous mother after almost getting killed by her, TBoI has hundreds of items, ranging from the cutest of fashion accessories to the most grotesque parasites and diseases. With a randomisation system that makes no two playthroughs the same, TBoI is an adventure, a big step forward in the world of indie gaming, and ultimately, you'll have a hell of a time playing it.My criticisms with the game are that it's impossible to predict what items you're going to get, and while this adds to the mystery, this also means you can become obscenely OP or obscenely UP and it can become frustrating having to play through with what could be called a dead weight on your leg, which combined with the VERY steep learning curve, makes for a frustrating time with some playthroughs. Nonetheless, with a game that you can pick up for less than one dollar, where can you go wrong? I highly reccommend TBoI, and if you like it, go pick up the remake, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth!

												Edmund Mcmillian, you did another successful job of making another indie game. Binding of Isaac is an adventure and a lot of relegious things including the title. The story gets better and makes more sensesince the beginning isnt enough. The story is about you (Isaac) and your mother just chillin until your mother thinks God is talking to her and tells her to get rid of everything in your life since they are sins of his life. So she obeyed 'God' and took everything in Isaac's life (including his cloths and your naked the whole game). 'God' now tells her to go KILL Isaac if she truly loves 'God' more than Isaac. Well guess what she literally grabbed a knife and attempted to barge in his room. Luckly, Isaac finds a basement door in his room and your adventure starts.As you go through the basement, you encounter enemies which you kill them by SHOOTING YOUR OWN TEARS (total logic).You also find items which most of them help you by increasing speed, length of tears and damage. and give you wings.There are special rooms like stores, death chambers and challenge rooms this is how you get to those 3 rooms:Store: open it with a key or if theres a secret room beside it, just cheat and blow up the wall beside the store.Death Chamber: a room with only spikes, if your stupid enough (joke) to go to the spike and attempt to kill yourself, you actually can make a chest appear.Challenge room: if you beat the room beside the challenge room without taking damage, you can get in.Health in this game is hard to get since you start with 3 hearts and finding them wont be easy. Now let's see how long you can survive under your house besides being a 2-floor basement.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficulity and the most shocking thing about the game is that theres 7 characters (all mentioned in the bible) and you gotta beat the entire game 32 TIMES IN TOTAL. So have fun i know you can do it (not).			"

												I played the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. Pretty nice dungeon crawler that has Zelda 1 like dungeons that are different each time you play, but still keeps some things similiar. The difficulty sure is a challenge and very entertaining. because each playthrough is different, this game has a high replayability value. Also you unlock multiple characters with different abilities. The DLC is worth every cent too and the Soundtrack is fantastic.What i personally dislike however is the giant overuse of internet references and memes, the game tries a little too often to be funny without actually coming uo with real humor, mostly just relying on internet memes from 8 years ago.Great game nonetheless, can recommend this one.

It's fantastic, the art style is cute if not disturbing, which fits the tone of the game, which puts you in the mindset of a child and how they see their fears and such. The game itself isn't too long, but it doesn't need to be, its short and sweet, but also challening and rewarding, this is one game you can play over 100 times over.If your any way a fan of challenging games, top down shooters and enjoy game that are different, you'll enjoy this alot.

												When I bought this game I didn't think about spending a lot of time by playing it. But as far as I was playing i wanted more and more. This game is really awesome and have random system that gives player the gift of the lack of boredom.Soundtrack is one of the best parts of this game. Can't stop listening to it.+ Mechanics+ Monsters and bosses + Items and ideas + Soundtrack <3 + Come on it's Isaac!SPOILER!!!!- After defeating Issac we have to fight with ???. These ones are similiar to each so that's not really splendid work, but at least it's harder than Issac itself.10/10 IMO			"

												This game is immensely immersive and offers a randomly generated experience that will keep you playing and trying to get every achievement. The reason it's so good is because it's simple, it never gets boring, and is a bullet hell that will always keep you on your toes.TENNOUTTATEN!			"

												What can be said of this game? It's fantastic, the art style is cute if not disturbing, which fits the tone of the game, which puts you in the mindset of a child and how they see their fears and such. The game itself isn't too long, but it doesn't need to be, its short and sweet, but also challening and rewarding, this is one game you can play over 100 times over.If your any way a fan of challenging games, top down shooters and enjoy game that are different, you'll enjoy this alot.

												tldr:6/10 - A rather mediocre top-down rogue action game with dark humor. I keep returning to it when I have a minute and I don't feel like doing anything complex or time consuming.

Still very recommended at a reasonable price if you're looking for a simple casual game which is easy to get into.too long part:STORY - ?/10You're playing as Isaac - a little kid whose mom is nuts and wants to kill him, so he descends through a trap door in his room to fight his way through creepy places with creepy monsters in them.GAMEPLAY - 6/10- Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.- The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.- Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice. From this point of view the game offers infinite replayability, but...- The fact that everything is so heavily randomized prevents you from forming any sort of your own strategy. You just dive in and keep going until you win or die. Over time, this reduces the cool variety to the point where you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's only a liiiiiiiittle bit different because of some dice roll. - There is not much persistence to keep you returning for more. There are few unlockable characters and mandatory achievements but upgrades and skills are limited for each run where you find them. While it's nice to know that the game doesn't have you on a leash trying to unlock everything, it doesn't really motivate you to achieve anything when you start from zero every single time.			"

												I'm just waiting for the nice men in white suits to escort me to rehab. In the mean time, I thought I would share my experience with future addicts.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will destroy your life.I have lost sleep, skipped meals and needed to invest in a pee bag because of this atrocity. At no point during the research process was I warned that buying this game would result in a heroin-level addiction.If all the above hyperbole isn't a clear enough indication, this game is amazing, and Edmund McMillen is an evil genuis.You play as Isaac, a creative, imaginitive little boy who plays by himself and draws pictures while his mother watches Christian programming. One day The Lord(TM) speaks to her and asks her to kill Isaac to prove her faith. In his attempts to escape, Isaac finds his way into a cellar conveniently located underneath his bedroom. Now, his only way to escape is to venture down into the depths and battle his way through the hoardes of abominations that wait for him.As you join Isaac on his journey, you will find a multitude of upgrades and items that can help or hinder him on his quest to escape his lunatic mother and battle the wide variety of monsters that stand between him and that ultimate goal. This includes but is not limited to eating pills you find on the ground, consuming dog food (YUM!) and sticking toothpicks through your eyelids.In short, stock up on Slim-jims and Redbull, strap on a pee bag and prepare for one wild trip.PROS:-The controls couldn't get much simpler. Every time I play it brings me back to the days when I would blow my entire allowance on double-joystick arcade machines.-Wide range of upgrades, items, enemies and bosses.-Almost endless replayability.-The game is challenging, but not unfair.

However, I wonder if this was a design choice rather than a bug, as this has resulted in Matrix-level projectile dodging in multiple playthroughs.-The noises some of the enemies make can be grating, but they tend to be dispatched so quickly that this isn't much of an issue.-The humor and themes presented in this game are not for everyone. If you're one of those Little House on the Prairie types, you expereience heart palpitations when people tell off-color jokes, or you take the Christian faith very seriously, choose a different title.

""Christianity is a religion of peace and love"" they said...This little piece of artwork called Binding of Isaac is a really enjoyable game in its simplicity. Longevity is definitely his strong point, thanks to the mechanical ""roguelike"" which allows the player to deal with the levels in a different way, with power-ups, items, monsters and rooms mixed in an infinite number of combinations.

												The binding of Isaac is a brilliant little procedurally generated dungeon crawler in which you must make it through each level of your toy box in order to defeat your mother. This game recquires huge levels of concentration and multi-tasking as you'll be ducking around to avoid flies and enemy tears. This game however is not as innocent as it looks though as if you fail or make the slightest mistake it may come back to bite you later when you need just the tinniest part of health. Anyway this game is an amazing sign of just what a small group of people can achieve and you can see to this day that edmund mcmillin has created many of amazing games. This game is perfect for when your kicking back and want just a small dose of this game or want to play hardcore. This is brilliant, I'm giving it a 7.5/10			"

												At first, once I bought this game, I thought it was quite fun, but quickly it sort of just became one of the games that I don't usually play. When that point in time is reached where you don't really feel like playing The Binding of Isaac anymore, it becomes a great game to play in short, spare time because of quick play. It requires you to really, not use tactics (doesn't help when you can't see what's in the rooms next to you), but to think about how you want to approach the game. This idea of 'approaching the game' includes: the character you choose to play (which affects much of how you play, depending on their stats) or the risks that you wish to take in the hopes of gaining a higher benefit. It might not seem very understandable in the way that I've put it, but any past players of this game should realise what I'm trying to say.This game has a lot to offer for players who want a difference and a challenge compared to other games. Nevertheless, the Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game and I recommend it to anyone that wishes to purchase this game.			"

												I puchased this game during the winter steam sale of 2013 as my first game and it is addicting. It has a oldschool top down dungeon crawler like feel, very much to the dungeons of old school legend of zelda on the NES. The graphics are in 2-D, 16-bit , and the fact that the visuals looks like it was drawn by a 5th grade, brings a unique blend of cute,grotesque, perhaps morbid feel to the aesthetics of this humorus and twisted game. This game was devloped by the geniuses behind Super Meat boy. The gameplay is simple moving with AWSD and shooting tears with the arrow button and droping bombs. The random generated dungeons, powerups,and the hardcore difficulty are some of the mechanics that makes the game shine. The comvination of these mechanics of gameplay is also what can be its weakness to some people. There over 100 difrent items and powerups within the game and sometimes these can make or break your dungeon run. While playing this game you may have moments between ""woot this is awsome"" and ""dman.. this sucks alil"" when it comes to what you find, but dont let that slow you down it's uncommon for the later but it dose happen.  It's a hillarious, brutal and fun game to play. If you happen to see this game on sale it's a must have!			"

												64 hours of nightmare... I think I'm lucky to beat this game to 100% in 64 hours. I don't even know, should I recommend this game? I think I should. The Binding of Isaac, an amazing roguelike game. The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to the dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels. Every room you enter, you must clear it if you wanna get outta there or put a bomb in front of the door that will do it too. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which you must defeat before continuing to the next level. Oh yeah, they have item rooms too. You can unlock new characters if you can get some achievements. This game has a lotta religious refences, oh wait, not only refences this games is about the Christianity. We can say that I suppose. So, this is the best roguelike, dungeon crawler game I've ever played. I can't wait for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. I'm ready for it! Buy this game and prepare yourself for Rebirth! Oh I almost forgot, this is a flash game so you know what it means. Whatever, just buy it!			"

												If you look at this game from the side, you might think ""Oh it's another indie game..."" well, I said the same before I bought it.This game is about a kid named Isaac after the bible story ""Binding of Isaac"". Isaac's psychopath mother hears a voice from above, ordering her to kill her son Isaac. Our naked kid Isaac hears his mother rushing to his room, with a knife, and crashing his door while saying ""I'LL DO MY LORD"". Isaac finds a trapdoor under a carped that leads him to the deep horrors. This game is about cleaning monts in rooms, and collecting upgrades. There are upgrades that gives Isaac unique abillities as Homing Tears n' stuff. Did I mentioned that Isaac deals with monsters with tears? Yes you heard me right, you will be using tears as bullets. There's a lot of stuff to collect and even more if you have the DLC. The DLC will make the game toughter and add more loot , monsters and bosses.This game will make you scream and swear hard at the monster who killed you, It's because there's perma-death. After playing this game, you may say it's an humoristic indie game (shooting tears? duh) wich wont have a seriouse 'deep' story. If you'll take your time and check every little thing, you will notice that the game has a really great story wiithin it.I'll put 7.5/10 because perma death is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Especially when fighting end-bosses. Also the game has FPS drops even if your graphic card is a beast. (Compare to the game ofc).			"

												I have had this game for around 2 years now and oh my god do i love it, When i lost my internet for over a year this game was the main reason i stayed sane, regardless of the fact steam says i have about 240 hours clocked on the game in actual fact it is closer to 1500 hours.The first ever time i played this game i hated it, i despised its difficulty and lack of explination for the items. It wasnt untill i didnt play it for about a week after my first time that i started to feel an urge to play it again ( it doesnt help that i was watching a lot of streams of a guy who played it a lot) and this time when i went back to the game i found my self enjoying the game, yeah i was still dieing a hella load ( i think i had around 40 deaths before i killed moms foot for the first time) but i wasnt raging about it, i was just thinking "" huh so thats what this little bugger does well imma getcha next time mister""  and with the randomness of the items and the lackj of explination of what they do, i felt my self enjoying finding new items and figuring out what they do on my own, like an adventure, it was a sad day when i knew what all the items and trinkets and cards did.  For those who are checking this game out because of rebirth i highly recommend you get  this game and play it first, it is a great way to get the feel how the game plays and what it was like before we got them fancy pancy 16 bit graphicsReveiw word of the day : Randomness			"

												The Binding of Isaac is similar in a number of ways (difficulty, room layout, enemy types) to the original Legend of Zelda for the NES. The main difference being of course that this game is top-down shooter with largely random item/power-up drops, which changes gameplay considerably. I HEARTILY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a serious challenge, wants massive replay value, and is not going to be driven away by the rogue-like elements and the clever, but unsettling art direction. I've laid out the most pertinent pros and cons below to give a better understanding of whether you'll want to play this game.Pros:Huge replay value (randomization, a number of unique playable characters, additional levels unlocked after beating the game)Great level and enemy design (despite being somewhat derivative of the original Zelda)Medium/High difficulty level (you have to work for it)Brilliant and meaningful achievement system (every achievement unlocks a new item to be obtained in-game)Cons:Occasional fps slowdown when a number of enemies are onscreen (can be fixed by reducing quality settings)Freezes occasionally when loading later levels (simply needs time to fix itself)There are a number of bugs related to ahievement unlocks in Steam, but seems have almost everything right in-game (playthroughs with one character count as wins with another, for example)Art style makes frequent references to abuse and other somewhat taboo themes and can be very unsettling at firstThe sheer number of items available can force a decision between on-the-fly play (with weird item interactions) and having the wiki open in the background to understand your items			"

												If you liked Super Meat Boy, you'll love this game. The art style and punishing roguelike difficulty are attributed to the geniuses that are Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat) and Florian Himsl. The game is accompanied by the beautiful musical stylings of Danny Baranowsky (who also scored Super Meat Boy). Imagine Legend of Zelda, dungeons only, one life, with a dark, ""cute-grotesque"" art style. The more you play, the more items you'll be able to use. The more times you complete the game, the further you can progress. I can not recommend this game enough. Continually patched to add new things and fix bugs. The replayability is endless.			"

												Twisted comedy, endless replayability and hundrads of upgrades make the Binding of Issac one of my most played games. It is a dark twisted roguelike mixed with a layout lifted from the original zelda leading to simple controlls and easy to learn concepts with an ochean of underlieing complexity. Due to its random nature no two runs are the same and while I cant say the Asthetic is for everyone, if you are even slightly interested i would strongly suggest you give it a whirl.			"

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

												Edmund McMillen is a freaking genius, Part 2. (For Redux version go here.)'Isaac' is simply the best rogue-like I've ever played. Even with slightly more rogue-like experience under my belt now, I still love to go back to this game. It sets the bar freaking high.Released just under a year after Super Meat Boy, with a jumbo DLC expansion another year after that, the game plays like a top-down dungeon-crawler-shooter with randomised levels - no 2 playthroughs are exactly the same! (Unless you use a certain program that can pull the map seeds, but that's a different story.)The base game itself was very good, difficult at first but gets slightly easier as you unlock the more OP items and collectibles. The DLC adds a ton more content. Not to say that the items take away from the difficulty of the game though - some levels with the new Wrath monsters (and quite a few of the old monsters as well) feel somewhat akin to bullet curtain-like games.The only real gripe I have with this is that I cannot save my game mid-way! It's still a small flaw, and one that is corrected in its remake, 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth'. :)In the meantime, to circumvent this during super epic games, I recommend hibernating your computer with the game still running. Okay, well, my computer has survived the hibernation, but I'm not sure about yours...Well, okay, one more gripe - the game engine is in Flash, which is laggy at times and hard to play. For the most part though I didn't have any problems or let that detract from the fun of the game.If you can get this and the DLC for a cheap price, a must buy. It has possibly one of the highest ratios of time spent in game to money spent on game. (Excluding F2Ps, of course.)When to buy In May 2015, an all-new hard mode (Edmund M has called it names ranging from ""Trololololol hell mode"" to ""Florian's ♥♥♥♥ You Mod"") was released for owners of the WotL DLC - and it is hard as heck. You'll probably spend a lot of time trying to beat this mode with all characters, even if you are a veteran. Getting it on a steep discount will give you a lot of hours worth of gameplay for your dollar, but even full price for both game and DLC is not such a bad idea - Florian deserves to be rewarded for his new fiendishly unfair eternal manifestations. I genuinely mean that. It got me to re-look at, and re-evaluate, an old game which I thought I was done with.9.5/10 "

												Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-verbal communication, and by restricted, repetitive or stereotyped behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.[2] Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[3] It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.[4] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[5] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[6] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[7] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[8] The prevalence of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2012 (up from 11 per 1,000 in 2008).[7][9][10] The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;[10] the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[11] Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[12] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[13] Early behavioral, cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.[12] Although there is no known cure,[12] there have been reported cases of children who recovered.[14] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[15] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[16] "

												Pretty awesome game here.  This plus the Wrath of the Lamb DLC will provide many many hours of fun.  It takes a decent bit of learning what items do what, and you'll die a lot, but every run is a fresh take with new things thrown at you.  I really enjoy it and like a good challenge, but sometimes you can just get very unlucky with the drops you're given.  On the other hand you can get very lucky and feel overpowered until you go down deep enough and die anyway from a new boss you haven't fought yet.Overall though, pretty great. 9/10			"

												Pretty awesome game here.  This plus the Wrath of the Lamb DLC will provide many many hours of fun.  It takes a decent bit of learning what items do what, and you'll die a lot, but every run is a fresh take with new things thrown at you.  I really enjoy it and like a good challenge, but sometimes you can just get very unlucky with the drops you're given.  On the other hand you can get very lucky and feel overpowered until you go down deep enough and die anyway from a new boss you haven't fought yet.Overall though, pretty great. 9/10			"

												A beautifully made game that is amazing in almost every way. Aside from the fact that you can't save, it is still absolutely wonderful! The graphics, design, randomness of the items and location, and the way it increasingly gets difficult. The Binding of Issac pulls you in. It is like an addiction that cannot be satisfied until the game is beaten, and the way that you cannot save just fuels the addiction more to beat the game. Imagine being on the last level fighting against the boss. You are left with only half a heart left and the boss with only less then 6% of health. Almost to the end you get hit. You die. Game over.Time to restart... Again.			"

												A really fun game.  You play as a young child who constantly gets bullied by his mother.  He is ridiculed at school and everyone around him defecates on him.  The goal of this game is to progress through floors of your basement in order to kill your mum - the big poo monster.  It is fun to just chill in your house and play.  There is a wide range of items to collect in the game which help you on a run such as trinkets or cards.  There are also 5 characters other than Isaac which are unlocked via various methods.  Overall I would give this an 8.5/10.  The music and visuals are brilliant.  The levels are randomly generated to some extent.  The one downside to me would be that it gets repetitive but the range of characters can make up for it.			"

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221I'm not sure I can accurately describe how much I respect this game.  And alright, I'll say it, I LOVE this game.  Or to be more accurate, I am ADDICTED to this game.  I want to say I hate it's brutal unforgiving difficulty (especially after you hit the last treasure room and you get the poop or some equally useless item and yes there are more useless items than the poop), but in all reality, it is it's randomness and roguelike nature that made me fall in love with it.  The enemies are incredibly varied for a game style that is so simplistic and yet beautiful.  The story, captivating to the point that it has spawned HUNDREDS of theories on what the hell is really going on in Isaac's nightmarish world.  This is truly a once in a lifetime type of game in how magnificent it is and how well it keeps dragging you back in until you've beaten EVERYTHING.  You beat Mom?  Good job!  But did you really kill her?You beat her heart?  Awesome!  But how many times did you kill it?  Not enough...You beat It Lives??  Wow, you're really dedicated!  But Satan is still laughing at you...Satan has been brought down???  Time for a real challenge in yourself...You killed yourself????  Incredible!!  But the real last boss is still crying in his chest...Of course the main reason I keep coming back are the items.  THE ITEMS!!!  The activated items, the trinkets, the bombs, the tarot cards, every item is unique and forces you to play with a certain strategy.  Yes there are ""crap"" items, but if there is one thing I've learned, it is to never give up on a run.  I learned that one by obtaining the incredible combo of Polyphemus and Brimstone.  And you never know what you're going to stumble upon in Isaac's world.I've put 70 hours into Fallout 3, 45 into Dark Souls, and 70+ hours into Binding of Isaac.  I'm not saying it's a better game than either of those, but those numbers should speak for themselves.  Score: 9.5/10 (damn poop)			"

												The Binding of Isaac is by far my favorite game of all time. The gameplay  is smooth, with a bit of lag from here to there, but that really doesn't matter. Level floors are randomly generated. So many unique items, and such different ways to play. Besides Isaac there are six different characters to play as, each having there own pros and cons. The game is also mac compatible, which is great. The game is only 5.00 and the DLC is 3.00 dollars. I am amazed on how well Edmund McMillen did with this game and I can't wait for the remake!			"

												This game is great. There is a grotesque atmosphere when it comes to the games contents, but the controls are easy and quick to learn. Fans of the gameboy versions of Zelda will find this game to be very enjoyable. There are many similarities between the two games. The game is like a series of dungeons. Each time you beat the dungeon you get one of over 250 power ups. There is a lot of replayability in the game because of the different variations of power ups you can have. Each time you play, it is like starting with a new hero. You just have to make use of what you stumble upon.			"

You shoot ♥♥♥♥ing tears at dead children, fat worms, and the HORSEMEN OF THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING APOCOLYPSE. You can find items to increase your stats, and Isaac uses them accordingly. For ♥♥♥♥ing example; you find a coat hanger? He sticks it in his head. (As you ♥♥♥♥ing do) You find a noose? He becomes a floating head. You find drugs? You take them. Isaac can become a ♥♥♥♥ing flying head with a nun hood on, sticks keeping his eyes open, demon horns, and have four eyes. If that isn't metal as ♥♥♥♥ then I don't even know WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING IS.Oh, and I haven't even begun on the ♥♥♥♥ing story.

The Binding of Isaac. A flash semi-bullet hell satirical game on Christianity.The story goes that you are a young child named Isaac whom is stripped of fun and enjoyment in simple life after Mother has heard the voice of God demand that all things sin is removed. Hearing His one last wish from the high heavens, Mother grabs a knife and traps Isaac in his room, his only escape being a trapdoor leading below the foundation of the house. One powerful bash through the door and down goes the poor child.The objective of the game is the clear any rooms you enter of monstrosities that lie in your way as you travel deeper and deeper in the depths of your own basement, or maybe a cellar; crawling around the caves and catacombs, throughout the Depths of Nercopolis; and facing the one they call... Mom! Along the way, you find pick-ups, items, tarot cards, and pills that could do good or could do harm to Isaac as you take him on a somewhat sad (but fun!) venture to escape.ReviewThe GoodThough I had originally thought this game was kinda sad, I eventually got it, played it, and actually found myself excited over playing it over and over, unlocking a variety of cool items and using sweet powers. Aside from Isaac, you can also play other characters that have different starter abilites (ex. Magdalene, Cain, Eve), each unlocking a new item with every successful playthrough. If you add in the Wrath of the Lamb DLC, there are also challenges that start you out with preset powers and curses--another method of unlocking fantastic pick-ups.The BadIt is possible that anything kinda bad in this game were cleared up in the ""sequel,"" Rebirth. (This portion of the review will be edited at a later time.)Concluding CommentsSeeing everyone (at one point) playing this game persuaded me to make an attempt to give it a go, and I do not at all regret making such a decision. The Binding of Isaac is an excellent action game that deserves the amount of support it has gotten. And Rebirth has done great justice. --Hermix.			"

												Fun and addicting to play with over 100 items and many bosses. Each game is never the same with always a different stages/monsters/bosses/rooms and bosses. The game differs in difficulty and changes in each item you get. Fun and cheap game to play as well as an amazing soundtrack.			"

												I know what you're thinking, ""What the hell is he saying?"" It's true that we've had so many biographies about presidents in which some of the movies told about historic incidents, why not have a fictional president that could kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names? Harrison Ford is the man for the job.""The Binding of Isaac"" is a thriller that involves Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and his gang of criminals hijacking the first plane along with the president's wife and child and his staff. Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.The film itself is a nail bitter thriller with an all star cast as Ford and Oldman play their usual good guy/villain roles with Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkerly and William H. Macy in supporting roles. If there was such thing where Harrison Ford had a nomination for president, I would vote.			"

												One of the first games i bought when I got my new PC, and it exceeded all expectations. It can be very challenging, but to me it has near infinite replayability.Most people compare it to any of the top down zelda games, but taking place 100% in the dungeons. What makes this better is the dark humor, the hundreds of items, the unlockable playable characters, and as i said before the replayabiltiy due to the randomly generated levels. Definitly worth $5, but its on sale for less than $2 a lot of the time and anyone would be stupid to pass it up at that price.			"

Run, Fight, Die, Repeat!In a few words, this would be the game. It's a weird rogue like, quite addictive little game. It's one of the few games where getting an achievement actually helps in-game, the majority of them are unlocking new items, items that you might or might not need in your ""dungeon"" exploring. Filled with a variety of items, which give you new powers and new aesthetics as well, every time getting randomized, one gameplay in 100 isn't even nearly the same, despite having the same levels, the maps and items are always random, but you could slowly but surly start figuring out some patterns, despite having a minimalistic tutorial at the start, you will be on your own after room 1. The whole game is a combination of LUCK and SKILL, both of them which are raised by EXPERIENCE (actually playing and replaying the game), it also involves some currency/item management and some though decisions, despite the lack of an actual inventory, you will gamble your way to the top or you will play it safe, the decision is yours.WARNING: The game uses flash, not just once it happened to me that the game would crash due to high number of powerups/items picked up during the gameplay, resulting to a laggy/crashy gameplay. I played it a while ago, I heard of an upcoming new version, not sure if they updated or fixed the current one.In rest, nothing bad that I could say about it, except that you will probably die a lot and it has good ambiental music.

												I'll be honest. When I first saw this game I thought that it was one of the most stupid things I had ever seen. The artstyle looked childish to me and I found that it didn't match the dark atmosphere of the rest of the game. The fact that the main character is constantly crying seemed absurd and the gameplay looked boring and unappealing.But daaaamn was I wrong.Once you get the hang of the game mechanics (which may take a few hours) you'll really get addicted to it. There is so much to find out, so many different enemies, so many secrets, so many items with so many different effects.Each run is truly unique and the combat has an unexpected depth to it so that you will get constantly better which is again very motivating and fun.The game is difficult (at the beginning at least) and it is a bit of luck involved but that just adds to the uniqueness of every run and makes it even more satisfying when you get good items and have good run.The soundtrack is also just glorious and fits the creepy atmosphere perfectly.And the artstyle...you'll learn to love it. It may look very peculiar at the beginning but with the sick character design and the soundtrack it creates a very morbid experience which pulls you in again and again.It's easily the best rogue-like game I've ever played and it may just be the best out there.If you are intrested I suggest just give it a try. It's cheap, so you can't go wrong. It really has a lot more to offer then it seems and chances are high that, despite the first impression, you will fall in love with it.			"

It's one game you won't want to miss out on! Not to mention it's a steal at $4.99 (base value).			"

												Binding of Isaac is a great example of a well-executed indie title that marries interestingly odd and obscure art and story references with engaging twitch-reflex  gameplay. It's essentially a twin-stick shooter with power ups set in an unique dungeon environment. It has numerous rogue-like elements as well. It's lacking resolutions higher than 720P, and when in Windowed mode it plays in a 4:3 square that looks fairly small on a 1080 screen. While in fullscreen mode, you cannot access the Steam overlay. Other than few minor gripes listed above, this is a fun little rogue-like twin-stick-style adventure shooter set in a level-by-level dungeon design.			"

												So basicly long story short here i'm playing COD:GHOSTS and my PC decides to get sum errors and it crashed so I call Geek Squad in to fix it and lo and behold it ends up taking about 11 hours to fix so i'm on my ipad thinking hey I could use a cool gamme to hold me over until I can beef up my KDR som e more so browsing the steam front page best sellers I see this gemOK actual review starts nowSo yeah obviously I was drawn to this game becuase judging by the graphix this game can DEF. run on lower end rigs/tablets which was perfect for me. Gameplay wise it's great you basicaly press 4-5 buttons at the monsters and theres blood and humour ha the maps could be better, def. expected more especially after playing a game like COD GHOSTS but they're ok for this indie bit. I hear there are people who play thsi game for like a lot of hours 60+ and are reely into it and its like lol go outside or just take a trip to gamestop XD Overall this game is a lot of fun so I give The Binding of Isaac a FIVEout of Five :)			"

												I bought this game for 1$ and was quite amazed about how interesting it was. Basically, you play Isaac and have to defeat ennemies and bosses in various rooms. You kill ennemies by shooting them with your tears or by ""bombing"" them. This game is a ""rogue-like"" : you go through doors, not knowing what you'll get, and have to find the bosses in the various different floors, along with the ""item-rooms"" that level-up your tears or give you new abilities.The whole game is RNG, every floor is always randomly generated and this is the main point of the game : no playthrough will be identical, ever, and that's what offers a great replay value.Another important thing : permadeath. If you die in this game, you have to start back at the beginning  (with another layout of course, since everything is RNG), and trust me, you'll die often. But each time you die, you learn from your mistakes and make better the next time. At the beginning, you'll be happy if you reach level 5, but at the end, reaching level 8 is quite normal. (Note : if you unlock new item, death doesn't affect that)[Pros] : + RNG all around the place = infinite replay value+ 2 minutes to get the point of the game and the controlls, 200 hours to fully master it+ A ton of items and stuff, you will learn something new at each playthrough and get better and better+ Items have synergies and can be ""combined"" for powerful results+ Awesome price for awesome game (under 1$ in sale)+ Will train your reflexes, strategy and learning abilities + Cool graphic style+ You can make it work smoothly even on a potato computer+ Simple controls : WASD to move, Arrows to Shoot, E to Bomb, Space to Use Item, Q to use Pill/Card ; that's all.+ A ton of ""secrets"" to master to get better+ ""Humoristic"" items with Internet Memes References (Lemon, Hoop de Loop, Forever Alone, Super Meat Boy...)[Cons] : - Hard at the beginning, can be very frustrating if you don't like the ""learn by mistakes"" approach (=/= die and retry)- The game engine can lag sometimes, the game isn't fully oprimized- Don't hope beating the ""last"" boss with under 60 hours of /played (but the game is fun even if you never finish it)- RNG land, sometimes, you'll get f*** up hard by bad RNG[Conslusion] : Anyone that is ok with games that involve reflexes should try this, at least if it's in sale for less than 1 buck. 10/10 "

There are a lot of things to like about it, most notably the wonderfully grotesque design, but I personally hate the core mechanics. I really really tried to love it (largely because it was a game that was easy to play on the bus), but eventually gave up.Ok, so Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like, so we already know you're going to be dying and restarting a lot. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that you don't get better with each subsequent death. There's no lineage system or inventory hold over that helps you make a little more progress with each new game, you are just literally starting from scratch each time. And the controls are not complicated, so there isn't even an element of mastering the game's mechanics as progression.And then there's other major design decision that I hate, the complete randomness. Procedurally generated games can be a ton of fun and help to keep things interesting, but your success in each run of this game is largely decided before you even leave the first room. The enemies being random is great, it keeps things from being rote. However, the power-ups being random is a huge problem because of the disparity between them. Power-ups can be utterly worthless, or god-tier, and you never know what you're going to go get. But because your previous attempts don't have any impact, you're relying entirely on the much necessary power-ups, which are sometimes just going to be useless.One of my best runs was actually one of my first. In one of the first rooms I picked up a power-up that just devastated every enemy I came across. I've never been that lucky again. I enjoy challenging games, but there needs to be some sort of progression either through leveling or mastery of the mechanics, and Binding of Isaac has neither. There are of course going to be minor improvements to how you play, but for the most part, your 100th attempt has just as much chance of success as your 2nd attempt, and it's going to be based on what procedural roll you got. While this clearly doesn't deter most people, I find it to be an uninteresting set of mechanics that generally lead to wasting time on a run that was doomed to fail.			"

												A fun place to rage. Well, it did well to me atleast.Everytime you start a game, you wish you would survive till the end.Every floor are randomly-generated with random power ups, you wish to get hold all of them.When tear away through all the rooms and find something you like, you killed by a freaking fly.10/10 would rage everytime i see a fly.

												This is a pretty great game. I've spent some time playing this again and there are some pretty gross parts to it but overall I found my experience enjoyable. I come from an age where games like this were best played with a controller. However after long hours of playing Realm of the Mad God playing this game seemed somehow easier with the mouse and keyboard.The best part about this game is its replayability. With random dungeons and different characters all of which play in a different way this game will give you a ton of enjoyment.			"

The Binding of Isaac will suck you into its humorous world, motivating you through failure and actively rewarding you for accomplishments with new items and possibilities every step of the way.  This game is the reason I got a C in statics in college. My buddies and I would play during class.  So don't do that, but you should get this game anyway.  It's worth so much more than $5			"

												After playing this game for hours, I can honestly say this is in my top 5 games of all time. The gameplay is random, some rooms insanely easy (here kill a black fly) sometimes more difficult (like the bosses post floor 3). It is this sheer randomness and constant change in difficulty that makes it a game you will always want to play. Although the difficulty changes randomly, one bad move can mess up your game and it is this necessity to think before you act on a certain item that makes it great. My personal rating 9/10.			"

												The binding of Isaac does many things right when it comes to getting the player straight into the action. This action requires very precise and accurate reflexes to get into the end game. This is a very good game to exercise those reflexes and hone in quick decision making. This DOES require some outside research as to what certain upgrades do. Item choice matters greatly as some do more harm than good to your power. Overall, 9/10. The 1 dock being the amount of sheer repetition needed to unock later level tiers. I find it necessary for the game design and is implemented well, but just a tad bit too much for my taste.			"

												Punishing, disturbing, tight, and atmospheric; I *LOVE* The Binding of Isaac! A huge mix of items, each with their own unique and sometimes mysterious effects, excellent difficulty ramp, gut-wrenching enemies and environments, and little touches that makes each new game a brand-new adventure. The art-style is very simplistic, but effective in evoking the twisted and disgusting views of an abused child. If you like punishing, randomly generated, visceral games, there are few that do it as well as The Binding of Isaac.			"

												Very addictive, with random levels and lots of itens. Always trying differents plans, and killing mom and get in the womb's. Beside that there is lots of achivements and secret characters to open.Recommended, if you like a dungeon crawler, it's the game for you.Jogo muito divertido e muito viciante, com muitos levels randomicos e muitos itens diferentes por jogo. Sempre precisando montar um plano baseado nos tipos de itens que aparecem para matar a mãe e ir para o ""Womb Level"". Além disso tem muitas conquistas e personagens secretos para abrir.Recomendo o jogo se vc gosta de um jogo tipo exploração de dungeon.			"

												An absolutely amazing and extremely addictive roguelike that will leave you wanting more and more and more. At least 100 hours in and I can never get enough this is by far one of the best values you can get for your money on this site.-GraphicsNothing mind blowing to see here, keep in mind this is an indie title, but the visuals are very sharp and crisp and the hand drawn style is something I think everyone could appreciate. Ed Mcmillen brings his dark imagination alive with cute enemy design with dark tones in a vivid and smooth way. 9/10-SoundAnother excellent aspect of this game, Danny Baranowsky graces this game with an intoxicating score that never gets old and is always welcomed. The sound effects also nail it with gross tones and excellent notes that bring more life into the game. 10/10-ControlsOne of the few areas I believed needed work. A game that is a pain to play with mouse and keyboard, but feels amazing with controller, just needs mapping attention. I feel like this game deserved some native controller support. Once you get the controller mapped and configured however, it feels like a dream, I highly recommend using an Xbox controller when mapping. 7/10-GameplayA randomly generated dungeon crawler, you'll complete a set number of levels and floors all ending with a boss fight. The level structure for this game as well as item placement and boss encounters are all random, which the only strategy for this game has to come from experience which is completely amazing. You clear rooms, discover treasure, acquire upgrades, fight bosses in the end. Will you make it? Will you get all the way to the end and choke? That's up to you. This is definitely the shining tower in this title which is most important in any game. 10/10-Replayability I believe I already used the term ""Random"" so I really cant stress enough just how impressive and addictive this title is. Everything about this game is random, item placement, loadout possibility, the structure and all is a random dip. 11/10Overall while no game is perfect, this game comes pretty damn close. 9/10. Buy it if you don't have it, there are no regrets here.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a game where your mother is corrupted by sin and tries to kill you to please her ""lord"" and just before death you escape into a mysterious cave hidden under your rug. Within said cave you must acquire upgrades and kill ugly, vile, and probably smelly enemies such as flies, zombie headless things... And not to forget bosses. Some bosses include but are not limited to: Monstro, Larry Jr., Chub, and last but not least...*drum roll* Steven! As you make your way to the final floor you must kill your mother with all the items you've acquired. (By the way the whole game revolves around killing your mother for the most part.).Once your mother is dead you must delve into her ""womb"" and make your way to her heart. To wrap things up, this game is pretty Bad... BADASS! The game can provide you with endless hours of gameplay, so try it out, I mean really, it's only $5.			"

												The binding of Isaac does many things right when it comes to getting the player straight into the action. This action requires very precise and accurate reflexes to get into the end game. This is a very good game to exercise those reflexes and hone in quick decision making. This DOES require some outside research as to what certain upgrades do. Item choice matters greatly as some do more harm than good to your power. Overall, 9/10. The 1 dock being the amount of sheer repetition needed to unock later level tiers. I find it necessary for the game design and is implemented well, but just a tad bit too much for my taste.			"

												Strange action roguelike. It's very random, and I don't mean roguelike-random. I mean all the item effects and enemy patterns are so randomly put together that it feels badly designed and unfair almost all the time. It also runs like poop because it's made in flash. Regardless of its flaws, it's still surprisingly fun and addictive.			"

												As someone who has not put a great amount of hours into the game, my review comes with some understandable questioning. However, I still feel as though I have a good feel of the game already, going through many different playthroughs until I finally reached the point where I had the power to beat the final boss and the second final boss in the second playthrough. With that in mind, I find myself going through spurts of loving this game to pieces, playing it bit by bit and getting better as time goes by, collecting more and more items as my personal list of achievements grows. With that in mind, The Binding of Issac more than delivers on its content for the price of 5 dollars (plus seven if you get the incredibly fun ""Wrath of the Lamb"" DLC). The game runs as an overhead shooter that drops you in the middle of a basement of horrors, pitting you against enemy after enemy as you struggle to survive against the different waves. At its very core the game is very simple: Kill the enemies with your weapon of choice while also avoiding the enemies with WASD at the same time. Once you are able to grasp the difficulty, it makes this game a very rewarding experience. But the true gold of the game shines through as you realize that there is a great deal of items available. In fact, there are so many items available that it makes for a different experience every time you play the game. Add the randomly generated dungeons and enemies throughout the game and you get to the point where you find yourself with an entirely different experience each time you play through the game. That being said, the game is not for those who are easily frustrated, as you will find yourself playing through it multiple times before you even get close to your desired goal. Despite that fact, I find the game well worth the seven dollars it is sold for.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is one of my favorite games that I never expected to like at all.  With its brown and gray levels, pictures of a lo-fi crying naked kid on the splash screen, I wasn't sure what to think at first.  When I first bought the game during a sale, I played it a few times, died, and shut down the game.  I didn't get it at all.  Then, a few months later, I tried again.  I found a better way to use the controls (I used a mouse and keyboard, instead of just the keyboard) and I picked up the item My Little Unicorn.  I was hooked.  I died milions of times.  I wanted to see what other messed up items the game held - Mom's bra?  Demon lasers?  The best part was that the items changed the appearance of your character.  Every playthrough was different.  I unlocked other characters.  I struggled to fight Mom.  When I finally defeated Mom I cheered aloud.  I hadn't felt such exuberance over a boss fight since early raiding in World of Warcraft.Who shouldn't play this game?  Christian literalists with no sense of humor... otherwise, I highly recommend it to anyone else.			"

												Although the game can be buggy at times, and there can be frame rate issues due to the fact it was made on flash, this is still a very fun and rewarding game to play. It is very challenging to start out, but as you unlock more items for later runs and learn the attack patterns of enemies and what items suit you, it becomes easier to progress farther each run. Even for experienced players, getting to the final boss and beating it on a run is a challenge, and the randomly generated floors add a lot of replay-ability. Excellent game from Team Meat.			"

												Roguelike meets bullet hell. Another instant classic from Edmund McMillen. That name alone should make you buy it, but the game is so awesome in all departments: gameplay, replayability, nightmarish yet funny design, insane number of items which affect your character. I love it. You will love it. Don't forget to get the single DLC for more bizzare items and monsters.The only sad thing is that your PC should be decent enough to run it, though you wouldn't think that if you judge by the screenshots. This is because the game is made with Flash and is huge, so I can't play it comfortably (too much lag) on my cheap laptop I take with me when travelling.

												""So if I die I start over?""""yes. you start over with nothing.""""You star over with knowledge.""Binding o' Isaac is an action-arcade game, or 2D Zelda games mashed with random elements and perma-death. Crawling through your dungeon basement, you fight minion and boss abominations with your tears, while collecting stuff. You know, classic kid adventures.You will not win on your first game. The controls are odd and frustrating at first, but can be learned. And half the fun is doing it again, applying what you learned and having it pay off (and getting different loot!) Fighting itself is as fun as LttP (read: it gets the job done.)And everything is tongue-in-cheek dark. Made by half of Meat Boy's team, Ed says the story was based off some old christian VHS tapes he found. And upgrades are things like Isaac's puppy's head, which brings back the trauma and causes more tears.$5 (or $6, and get the ost, which is great.) Tons to unlock (characters, new items appear, cutscenes), Bible lore spin, and pretty fun. Check it.			"

												Sort of a game where you don't have to think about the story to play it, but has a pretty interesting plot if you do. Which can be pretty disturbing. Between the religious and pop culture references, there is a pretty dark story that might be about parental abandonment, abuse, and/or a child's overactive imagination.The graphics are simple and not too detailed, but even with such cartoony proportions, you might get some... peculiar upgrades to your character that might just cause your stomach to do a frontflip.It's a bit of a dungeon roguelike game, a bit of a bullet hell game -- specially in later levels where there's more enemies on the screen. You need good reflexes and a bit of strategy when it comes to choosing which items to keep and which to leave behind when you're on your way down the basement. A very good time killer, you're encouraged to play it to the end in one sitting, since, well, you lose all your progress when you die.If you can stand the gory, gross imagery you might come by in this game, it's definitely one I recommend playing.

												Caution: This game is really hard! The game has an expansion pack called ""Wrath of the Lamb"" wich I higly sugest getting. It is also the version I'm going to talk about.(If you're reading this after 4/11 you should go get rebirth instead)To beat the entire game, you have to get the ""Platinum God"" achievement. To get get this, you must unlock everything and complete the game 200 times. Yes. 200 times. Beating the game takes around 45 minutes so you can calculate for yourself how much you have to play to win.  I've played this game a lot, and I'm nearing completion. But let me tell you. When you finally get that Platinum God in your achievemnt showcase on your profile it will be amazing. Except that noone knows how hard it is so they won't be impressed.9/10 Has some minor flaws that can easily be forgotten when playing this endurance test of a game.Conclusion: Rub money on your screen untill it accepts your purchase.

Well now you can, Binding of Issac is an excellent game which makes you truly feel the wrath of an abusive neglective household. Run endlessly fighting off abominations while your mother does everything in her power to murder you. Fun game, I give it four drunk and abusive dads out of five!			"

Graphics are extremely simple, yet so suitable for the whole atmosphere of the game. The gameplay is also quite simple actually, but all the different ""special items"" with their varied godd and bad effects on your character make each run you play unique and interesting.I like to come home late and tired, put my headphones and enjoy a couple of hours of chill gameplay on this one!

												The Binding of Isaac is a game where your mother is corrupted by sin and tries to kill you to please her ""lord"" and just before death you escape into a mysterious cave hidden under your rug. Within said cave you must acquire upgrades and kill ugly, vile, and probably smelly enemies such as flies, zombie headless things... And not to forget bosses. Some bosses include but are not limited to: Monstro, Larry Jr., Chub, and last but not least...*drum roll* Steven! As you make your way to the final floor you must kill your mother with all the items you've acquired. (By the way the whole game revolves around killing your mother for the most part.).Once your mother is dead you must delve into her ""womb"" and make your way to her heart. To wrap things up, this game is pretty Bad... BADASS! The game can provide you with endless hours of gameplay, so try it out, I mean really, it's only $5.			"

That, is the whole game of The Binding of Issac. But what I like about the game is that they built around that, and they made really creative boss battles, just a hilarious story-line, and lots of enemies. Did I mention lots of loot? Yes, there is more loot in this game then you could ever imagine, way farther than LOZ standards. So, should you buy the game? Well, if you love adventure mixed with humor, then YES.			"

												This game was made by Edmund McMuffinMan, the same guy who made Super Meat Boy so I picked it up one day when it was on sale. I mainly got it because it was recommended and it had trading cards so I didn't give it a fair chance when i first played it. A few months later I heard about Rebirth so I thought hmm, maybe I should give that game another chance... a real chance. So I did and now I love it! It's addicting and now I'm eagerly waiting for Rebirth as it is so fun. I definately would reccomend picking this up. It was a game that surprised me on just how great it really was!			"

												The Binding of Isaac, and its DLC Wrath of the Lamb is an old school dungeon crawl, reminiscent of Legend of Zelda, and your worst nightmares and or mindscrews. I HIGHLY recommend it.to make it clear: this game takes the concept of grimdark and elopes with it. you might want a strong drink once you're done crying from its crippling difficulty, but just as with an abusive relationship, you can't help but come back to it for another helping. definitely a great game, with the simplicity you want in the controls, the difficulty you crave, unique graphics, and a soundtrack that will chill you right down your spine.have a listen here, this guy fell in love with the OST, while i go back to playing it.

												Very difficult,but very good game!You play as a little child called Isaac(there are more characters,but he's the main one) that wanders around horrific places after you realized that your mom wants to kill you for the ""God's Sacrifice"".This game has an Endless Replayability so you can play as much as you can.Wander around the Basement,Caves,Depths and in Mom's Womb? as you collect cursed,blessed items or even the food!Fight against fallen children,monsters,creatures,Satans and Mom!Game too easy for you,hmm?Then take your time and buy Wrath of the Lamb DLC!More Stages,more monsters,more items...The Binding of Isaac is a game that you need to buy!

You'll make it to the end again...and die again.  Eventually, you'll make it to the end...and...wait...was that the end?  No, it actually wasn't the end.

Tough and unforgiving at times, there's a real sense of accomplishment when you get through the harder rooms and bosses, especially later on. Contains disturbing imagery and themes, so not for the squeamish or easily offended.			"

What can I say, it's my favourite game on Steam, buy it! :PEDIT: and now we have year 2015 and thanks to one of developers (Florian Himsl) this game gets yet another awesome (free) DLC - Eternal Edition which brings hard mode and couple of fixes. New enemies attack patterns, more bullethelly gameplay and 15 new achievements to get! A must-play for every hardcore Isaac fan!This is the ultimate edition of the game, I doubt if anybody could squeeze anything more from this flash version of the game. And one last thing: hard mode is optional. If you're one of those people who completely reverses his rating because of this update - you're out of your mind :)			"

												The Binding of Isaac has all you expect from a rogue-like: permadeath, randomized levels and items, tons of secrets and achievements to discover, unlockables...What did it for me is the ambiance. The story is minimal but still original, and is served well by a gorgeous soundtrack, simple yet nice looking graphics, and surprises like the arcade, the secret rooms, and so on.A downside of the game, for me, is the utter randomness of it. Sometimes you'll get lucky and have a super build, sometimes you'll just get crappy items over crappy items. I should warn you about it's difficulty, too. Some rooms are very hard and you need extra quick reaction time not to get hurt, and this is where Flash was a bad choice, making the game laggy when too many elements are on screen.Overall, it's still an awesome game that I recommended to lots of my friends, and some of them are even more hooked than me.

												This game is stylish, dark, mean, and *hard*. The good kind of hard, where your skill and practice *pay off*. Expect to die, a lot, but keep at it--some day, you'll rise to the occasion, and the Depths that were once a nightmare you couldn't imagine getting through alive will be just another level, even while the game's difficulty level gradually increases as you complete in-game challenges and stronger enemies start showing up earlier and earlier. Not to mention the long, long list of little accomplishments that will unlock some new plaything for future dungeons. This is easily one of the best uses for a five-spot (or less, some days--seriously, I've bought sodas more expensive than what this game will cost you during a good sale) you will ever find.			"

												I've had my fair share of The Binding of Isaac and what I can say for certain is that this easily falls in my favourite games list. At first when you get into the game nothing really makes much sense, items, goals, levels, story - it's all pretty confusing. But after 2-3 hours of playing and after a bit (20-ish) restarts you'll see that everything is well executed with infinte replayability in mind. Items are the most helpful and most weird aspect of the game, maybe the only thing that can compare to their weirdness is the story. Every item has its own effect on Isaac's stats and his visual appearance. I can guarantee that at the end Isaac will never look human. Items are randomly generated, like the levels, and add tons of variety and make sure that every run you do you'll get a different experience. The story is something that most people will probably ignore, or will not notice at all, but it is there. The end game cutscenes are the key component and after a few replays you'll get what it's all about and will probably want to find out more, to which I say that you should pick up the DLC for the game. It finishes the story and fills in some missing parts.The DLC is awesome, since it adds even more variety to the game, but be warned that if you're new to The Binding of Isaac and if you haven't put in a bit over 10 hours don't buy it just yet, because it makes the game a lot harder and might leave you struggling at the starting floors again. But aside from that all the new items and the new trinket system involved really help the game feel even more genuine and diverse.In conclusion, I'd just like to state again that the game is awesome and well worth the money. It's a good option to have when you want a fun and new experience and only have an hour to spare. When you get into the game it's gonna be hard to put it down. So why wait, start your experience now!			"

Also, I just can't take how everything is randomized, down to the enemies you meet. If you like the game, you can get the DLC which for some reason makes the game even more difficult!

												Isaac comes to in the upper level of the basement and you, the player, must guide him through the dangers that lurk below. The UI is very similar to what you’d expect from an early Zelda title. You have three heart containers. Three counters keep track of your amount of coins, bombs, and keys. The dungeon layout is shown on the upper left and your current items are listed next to your heart containers. You start out with only your tears to fight off the grotesque creatures of the basement. Each floor of the basement is littered with a slew of enemies, chests, items, a treasure room, and a boss room. Upon entering a room, all of the doors will lock until every enemy in it has been defeated. You can blow open a door, but it will cost a single bomb. Useable items can often be found in chests, but are also dropped from enemies. These could be tarot cards, pills, or some other miscellaneous item. Where as the tarot cards have a specific use, pills have random uses. These range from incredibly useful to potentially harmful, so consume them at your own risk. Treasure rooms are marked by their gold outlines, and within them lies a single power-up. These power-ups can increase your speed, change your projectile type, increase your max HP, etc. Some power-ups are weak and their effects can leave more to be desired, while others can be complete game changers and turn the tide of battles in your favor. They’re creatively designed and include some pretty outlandish things like a pair of high heels and even dog food. They also change your physical appearance, and seeing as they stack infinitely, this can result in some pretty hilarious or gruesome appearances. As you progress throughout the game, Isaac’s exterior begins to reflect the hell that is the basement. There are a plethora of bosses and they all battle in different ways. Defeating a boss will open a trapdoor to the next level, and between each floor of the basement a cutscene plays that shows Isaac having a nightmare, often of him being publicly embarrassed. The cutscenes, although oddly humorous, add little depth to Isaac’s character as it can be assumed that the events he worries over never actually took place, seeing as some are pretty over-the-top, such as one where he dreams he was being pooped on by a group of people. The final boss is no other than Isaac’s mother. And even after you’ve managed to beat her, your adventure still isn’t over. There still remains another set of levels and a whole mess of enemies, secrets, items, and power-ups to find.Through and through, The Binding of Isaac is a bonafide roguelike in every sense of the term. Every dungeon is randomly generated, resulting in no two runs feeling exactly the same. You’re given simple controls and absolutely no tutorial of any sort. Like any self-respecting roguelike, this is a game of trial and error, and it isn’t afraid to hand you your behind on a silver platter. The staggering amount of enemies will force you to adapt to any situation, and you’ll find yourself dying often before you’ve learned most of the enemies’ maneuvers. Bosses deal a lot of damage fast and some will even spawn smaller enemies around themselves. Even after you’ve learned the behavior of every enemy in the game, you’ll still find yourself dying quite often. Useable items and power-ups add variation to the gameplay and the tactics you’ll use in combat. With the unbelievable amount of depth found in the seemingly simple game, The Binding of Isaac produces an experience that becomes insanely addictive and rarely feels stale, even after dozens of hours of playtime.The Binding of Isaac’s visual presentation is something straight from the mind of a madman. Its art style is sleek, simple, and endearing. The various brown hues of the basement stand apart from each other, enhanced by the excellent shading, but they’re just pieces in a whole that create an immersive and beautiful environment. The story is primarily told through Isaac’s drawings. It’s all nice and cutesy, that is until you actually walk around and see the dreadful conditions of the basement. A myriad of deformed and bloody enemies stalk the rooms and each seem to spout blood like a fountain upon dying. There are these worm-like enemies that actually look somewhat adorable, until they charge at you with their fangs bared, trying to eat your face off. Piles of poop lay scattered on the ground. The changes that accompany the power-ups can be humorous, but others completely change the way Isaac looks, essentially turning him into one of the monsters that he faces. The fact that you aren’t alone suggests that you aren’t the first to face the wickedness of Isaac’s mother, and the possibility that the enemies could be related to him makes the adventure even more cringe worthy. In some dungeons you’ll find a room in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. Each of these shops feature a hanging Isaac-lookalike, their faces twisted with expressions of despair. It’s an enthralling visual endeavor that shocks you from the start and carries out its dark themes with precise execution.The Binding of Isaac’s soundtrack aims to emphasize the same contrast brought about by the art style, and it manages to do so quite well. The music is slightly upbeat and detracts from the hopelessness that Isaac feels as he wanders through the basement. At times the music speeds up just a bit and the volume increases, ramping up your adrenaline at the same time. There is a slight feeling of loneliness in the unknown created by the soundtrack, and this is where it slightly fractures the contrast and actually melds with the setting. Enemy and projectile sounds are squishy in nature, but impactful overall. The contrast between the game’s dark themes and relatively uplifting music is genuinely interesting and adds another layer of depth.Despite its numerous references and tie-ins to other forms of media, The Binding of Isaac does plenty to set itself apart from the pack. There are some really laughable moments in the otherwise grim depths of the basement: there’s a certain enemy that will scurry away from you, whimpering as it tries desperately to flee; of the hanging Isaac-lookalikes in the shops, one of them has a huge grin on his face; some of the items and power-ups are just meant to make you burst out laughing, like Mom’s Pad – a useable item that makes all enemies in a room retreat for several seconds. Also, it raises some very serious questions that most games wouldn’t dare ask. It ventures into often-untraveled territory by challenging our understanding of organized religion, mental illness, and child abuse. These are very touchy subjects and it’s admirable to see developers who aren’t afraid to speak on them. The Binding of Isaac proves to be a unique and addictive adventure. Its humor is welcoming and its roguelike nature results in an unbelievable amount of replay value. While it may look simple at first, there is a surprising amount of depth to be found. Its endearing art style and aesthetically pleasing soundtrack is welcoming, while its dark themes are perfectly executed in the story and character designs. More than just a fun game, it questions what we as a society perceive to be norms and challenges us to think differently. The only real downsides to the game are the lack of characterization on Isaac and the slight capitalization on nostalgia. Aside from that, it’s an incredible game that should be played by anyone who enjoys a solid roguelike – or just a good game in general – because it stands head and shoulders above its competition in the genre.

The huge variation of upgrades available to you as you progress through the unknown helps not only to help you proceed but also makes the game a unique experience through each subsequent attempt to clear the dark twisted world that it offers.

Though it is a rouge like every time you complete an achievement you unlock a possible item and add it to the possible item pool giving you a definite sense of progression within the context of a rouge like game. At this point if you are reading this far into some random comment on the page you have either already bought the game and are just curious of what other people think of it or are just really cautious about what game you buy. Either way you already know that it is an amazing game. If you are in the latter group what are you waiting for BUY IT!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game to spend a few minutes or even hours playing.The game is about a boy who's mom is overly religious When God asks her to lock her son away andtake all his things away, even clothes, she is more than happy to do as instructed. God then says Isaacis still ""corrupted"" and tells Mom to kill Isaac, which she goes to do without a second thought. Isaac, in desperation searches his room for a way out and finds a trap door under a rug which he flings open andjumps in just as Mom lunges into Isacc's room with a knife.In the basement is where the game takes place. Isaac has to fight through countless monsters with onlyhis tears. The goal is to get out of the basement but that is where all of the monsters come in makingIsaac's world a living hell, by cornering him and killing him.The game is permadeath and is really quite fun and challenging.  There are plenty of items to enhance Isaac's powers. One can make a deal with the devil or meet Crampus himself.			"

												A twinstick shooter/roguelike hybrid, The Binding Of Isaac combines a tough but mostly fair difficulty with near-infinite replay value. Each playthrough lasts only an hour or two (assuming you don't die early on), but the procedurally generated levels, enemies, and item spawns make each one unique. The sheer amount of content is also impressive: I've sunk over 115 hours into the game as of this writing, and there's still a good bit more I haven't unlocked or discovered yet.TBOI has an old school mindset to it, in that there are tons of different enemies and powerups, but the game does not spell out for you the best way to take on the enemies or make use of the powers, or sometimes even what the powers do. This might sound off-putting, but I find it provides for a highly satisfying sensation of skill progression as you work these things out for yourself. Over time, you will even begin making tactical decisions about when to skip a powerup that doesn't work well with your current build.The Wrath Of The Lamb DLC is also heartily recommended, which provides a huge increase to the number of powerups in the game, a new character to unlock, and an entirely new class of pickup, all of which make for even more build possibilities; special challenges that unlock new powerups upon completion; a plethora of new enemies, bosses, and level permutations; and even a brand new level at the endgame.In the interest of full disclosure, the game does have a number of bugs and glitches, including a rather annoying bug regarding unlocks that can result in 4 specific ones being removed from your save history, making you have to unlock them all over again. Very few of these bugs are gamebreaking though, and the few that do cause you to have to cancel your current playthrough are extremely rare (I've never encountered one in all my playtime). Reading the wiki page on bugs, and keeping a spare copy of your most recent so.sol file (which records your unlocks and settings), will help you avoid nearly all of them, and those that can't be avoided tend to be completely trivial at worst, so I would strongly advise you to not let these few minor annoyances dissuade you from picking up one of the best values for the money you can possibly find on Steam.

												They need to add difficulties or something, I'm not someone who plays a game for two seconds then gives up because it's ""too hard', but this is ridiculous. Also, I just can't take how everything is randomized, down to the enemies you meet. If you like the game, you can get the DLC which for some reason makes the game even more difficult! (Check the BoI wiki, it states the DLC is more difficult than the normal game)			"

												Isaac comes to in the upper level of the basement and you, the player, must guide him through the dangers that lurk below. The UI is very similar to what you’d expect from an early Zelda title. You have three heart containers. Three counters keep track of your amount of coins, bombs, and keys. The dungeon layout is shown on the upper left and your current items are listed next to your heart containers. You start out with only your tears to fight off the grotesque creatures of the basement. Each floor of the basement is littered with a slew of enemies, chests, items, a treasure room, and a boss room. Upon entering a room, all of the doors will lock until every enemy in it has been defeated. You can blow open a door, but it will cost a single bomb. Useable items can often be found in chests, but are also dropped from enemies. These could be tarot cards, pills, or some other miscellaneous item. Where as the tarot cards have a specific use, pills have random uses. These range from incredibly useful to potentially harmful, so consume them at your own risk. Treasure rooms are marked by their gold outlines, and within them lies a single power-up. These power-ups can increase your speed, change your projectile type, increase your max HP, etc. Some power-ups are weak and their effects can leave more to be desired, while others can be complete game changers and turn the tide of battles in your favor. They’re creatively designed and include some pretty outlandish things like a pair of high heels and even dog food. They also change your physical appearance, and seeing as they stack infinitely, this can result in some pretty hilarious or gruesome appearances. As you progress throughout the game, Isaac’s exterior begins to reflect the hell that is the basement. There are a plethora of bosses and they all battle in different ways. Defeating a boss will open a trapdoor to the next level, and between each floor of the basement a cutscene plays that shows Isaac having a nightmare, often of him being publicly embarrassed. The cutscenes, although oddly humorous, add little depth to Isaac’s character as it can be assumed that the events he worries over never actually took place, seeing as some are pretty over-the-top, such as one where he dreams he was being pooped on by a group of people. The final boss is no other than Isaac’s mother. And even after you’ve managed to beat her, your adventure still isn’t over. There still remains another set of levels and a whole mess of enemies, secrets, items, and power-ups to find.Through and through, The Binding of Isaac is a bonafide roguelike in every sense of the term. Every dungeon is randomly generated, resulting in no two runs feeling exactly the same. You’re given simple controls and absolutely no tutorial of any sort. Like any self-respecting roguelike, this is a game of trial and error, and it isn’t afraid to hand you your behind on a silver platter. The staggering amount of enemies will force you to adapt to any situation, and you’ll find yourself dying often before you’ve learned most of the enemies’ maneuvers. Bosses deal a lot of damage fast and some will even spawn smaller enemies around themselves. Even after you’ve learned the behavior of every enemy in the game, you’ll still find yourself dying quite often. Useable items and power-ups add variation to the gameplay and the tactics you’ll use in combat. With the unbelievable amount of depth found in the seemingly simple game, The Binding of Isaac produces an experience that becomes insanely addictive and rarely feels stale, even after dozens of hours of playtime.The Binding of Isaac’s visual presentation is something straight from the mind of a madman. Its art style is sleek, simple, and endearing. The various brown hues of the basement stand apart from each other, enhanced by the excellent shading, but they’re just pieces in a whole that create an immersive and beautiful environment. The story is primarily told through Isaac’s drawings. It’s all nice and cutesy, that is until you actually walk around and see the dreadful conditions of the basement. A myriad of deformed and bloody enemies stalk the rooms and each seem to spout blood like a fountain upon dying. There are these worm-like enemies that actually look somewhat adorable, until they charge at you with their fangs bared, trying to eat your face off. Piles of poop lay scattered on the ground. The changes that accompany the power-ups can be humorous, but others completely change the way Isaac looks, essentially turning him into one of the monsters that he faces. The fact that you aren’t alone suggests that you aren’t the first to face the wickedness of Isaac’s mother, and the possibility that the enemies could be related to him makes the adventure even more cringe worthy. In some dungeons you’ll find a room in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. Each of these shops feature a hanging Isaac-lookalike, their faces twisted with expressions of despair. It’s an enthralling visual endeavor that shocks you from the start and carries out its dark themes with precise execution.The Binding of Isaac’s soundtrack aims to emphasize the same contrast brought about by the art style, and it manages to do so quite well. The music is slightly upbeat and detracts from the hopelessness that Isaac feels as he wanders through the basement. At times the music speeds up just a bit and the volume increases, ramping up your adrenaline at the same time. There is a slight feeling of loneliness in the unknown created by the soundtrack, and this is where it slightly fractures the contrast and actually melds with the setting. Enemy and projectile sounds are squishy in nature, but impactful overall. The contrast between the game’s dark themes and relatively uplifting music is genuinely interesting and adds another layer of depth.Despite its numerous references and tie-ins to other forms of media, The Binding of Isaac does plenty to set itself apart from the pack. There are some really laughable moments in the otherwise grim depths of the basement: there’s a certain enemy that will scurry away from you, whimpering as it tries desperately to flee; of the hanging Isaac-lookalikes in the shops, one of them has a huge grin on his face; some of the items and power-ups are just meant to make you burst out laughing, like Mom’s Pad – a useable item that makes all enemies in a room retreat for several seconds. Also, it raises some very serious questions that most games wouldn’t dare ask. It ventures into often-untraveled territory by challenging our understanding of organized religion, mental illness, and child abuse. These are very touchy subjects and it’s admirable to see developers who aren’t afraid to speak on them. The Binding of Isaac proves to be a unique and addictive adventure. Its humor is welcoming and its roguelike nature results in an unbelievable amount of replay value. While it may look simple at first, there is a surprising amount of depth to be found. Its endearing art style and aesthetically pleasing soundtrack is welcoming, while its dark themes are perfectly executed in the story and character designs. More than just a fun game, it questions what we as a society perceive to be norms and challenges us to think differently. The only real downsides to the game are the lack of characterization on Isaac and the slight capitalization on nostalgia. Aside from that, it’s an incredible game that should be played by anyone who enjoys a solid roguelike – or just a good game in general – because it stands head and shoulders above its competition in the genre.

												Binding of Isaac is one of my favorite roguelike rpg/dungeon crawlers of all time.  There didn't seem to be much of a demand for games like Binding of Isaac before it came out, but when I played it, with its irreverent Legend of Zelda-esque dungeons full of interesting monsters and items, I simply could not put it down.  I highly recommend this to any gamer, but especially one who loved old school Legend of Zelda games.			"

												The Binding of Isaac is a Randomly Generated, Roguelike dungeon-Crawler game with difficulty being it's strong suit. This game will make you quit and rage on multiple occasions, but I gurantee to you this is worth it. Heck, even pick up the DLC if you've got the money to spare. It's worth every penny.There will be times where you wish you hadn't bought it, but you will learn to become good at this, and you will learn to respect this. The amount of random generation gives this game a gargantuan amount of replayability. I very strongly recommend that anyone who is a fan of rogue-like dungeon crawlers to pick this game up. It will rock your world, and your weekend.			"

												Take the original legend of zelda, a generous helping of heavy religious themes and overtones, internet culture and then throw political correctness out of the nearest window and put it all in a blender.  what you end up with is a truly great game where every single playthrough is completely random and unique from the items and powerups you find to the layout and enemies you find in each and every room you enter. half of the fun of isaac is never quite knowing what you're going to find or come across in that particular playthrough and finding new items and discovering what they do and how they combine with the other items you've discovered, the fact that your characters appearance also changes, sometimes drastically, depending on what you've found is another aspect that adds to the discovery of the game.in terms of negatives if you don't do well with bullet hell games then you will definitely find the later areas of the game challenging as it can be unforgiving, but rewarding, at times, also if you think you would take offence to the idea of a small child fighting off the corpses of his dead siblings with his own tears then you should probably give the game a miss lolbut overall i love the game, has become one of my favourites of all time and im just waiting for rebirth now.

												Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above:""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.""""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.Again the voice called to her:""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.One last time Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove you love me above all else.""""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butchers knife from the kitchen.Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below...			"

												This indie is simple, creepy, and well thought out. Its a great little graphic platfromer/shooter if you have any morals about killing deranged malformed children well its not for you or if your an extreme relegious person with a dark sense of humour well get it. Great game worth the money.			"

												Binding of Isaac is a lot like your third wife. You're not really expecting a lot out of her, but she surprises you some. My first glimpses at the game via screenshots showed a disturbing creation that I was not interested. Eventually it's standards dropped low enough, and I picked it up.  After I sank a little time in, I could tell this one was good. This game also imrpessed me with the amount of time that it can be played.. So although the visuals may not be what you are use to, you will be very happy if you let your friend set you up with this game.			"

												Meet Isaac, a child raised by his mother.  One day she is told by God that her son has become corrupted and must be relieved of his earthly possessions.  God then tells her to she needs to kill her son, which Isaac doesn't think is a very good idea.  He then plunges himself down a trapdoor to escape his mothers lust to please her God.This Zelda-like dungeon crawler has virtually endless replayability.  Each time you begin, the game randomly generates floors for you to fight through to get to your mom, the main antagonist.  The variety continues as you unlock other characters to start out as, each having his/her own special attributes.  The Wrath of the Lamb DLC adds many new bosses and items.Gameplay on keyboard uses the wasd keys for movement and arrow keys for directional shooting by default.  On controller, it acts much the same, utilizing both analog sticks.  This game was made in flash and isn't very well optimized.  It lags often (and occasionally crashes), mostly dependent on how crazy the items you picked up are, which brings me to the item combinations.  There are many items in The Binding of Isaac that synergize with each other, adding to the uniqueness of each run.  There are also many unlockable playable characters.The game is played from a top-down perspective.  The floor is separated by rooms that are all the same size, but there is a ton of variety between them.  The aforementioned Wrath of the Lamb DLC adds many more rooms to discover and explore.  The sound effects in The Binding of Isaac would be unsettling for any new player, but it grows on you the more you play.  The soundtrack was constructed by Danny Baranowsky, who's work is also in Crypt of the NecroDancer.Although it has its flaws, it's an amazing roguelike  I'd recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone looking to get the most out of their money.  Isaac has given me over 500 hours of gameplay, and I'll still feel like knocking out a run from time to time.  With the amount of characters, items, and rooms it's possible to encounter, no two runs through this game will ever be the same.Pros:*Great soundtrack*Many different enemies*Replayability*No two games are ever the sameCons:*Poorly optimized*Lags often*Crashes on occasion7/10			"

												This awesomely fun game is everything a roguelike should be:  quick and dirty, with lots of gross monsters and more items that help than hinder.  These items, by the way, often change up the gameplay in dramatic and surprising ways (example: you start off shooting teardrops at enemies, but you might suddenly find a devil head that lets you barf huge streams of blood across the screen).  It's like a cutely sacrilegious Zelda (NES) meets Robotron: The Cardinal Direction-only Edition.  Only negative that I have is that the game runs in Flash, and you have to run JoytoKey or some such to be able to use your gamepad.  And believe you me, the gamepad is a must.			"

												This is my first review so feedback on how I did would be appreciated. This was one of the first games I got on steam. Some friends told me that it was not worth its full price and I should just wait for the discount but I didnt listen to them. This game is completely worth its price. Its only five dollars without the DLC and eight dollars with the DLC making it extremely cheap. This game requires very little power so I could play it on my terrible laptop. When I first started playing this game I was so bad at it and I wondered how anyone could ever beat it. But if you play this game for the first few rounds you will start to want to play more and more and beat what you got last game. The first ten times you beat the game, even if its with the same character, you get something new. Then you can beat it with all the other characters. Every character has their good parts and bad parts. Character choice is also a crucial decision even in the late game making you really have to figure out who you like to pay as. Some poeple say that this game is very small and that is true but you have to remember that this actually started out as a flash game. ocne youve beat the game a lot it starts to feel a bit repetative but to give you an example of what I mean by a lot, I have played over 200 hours of this game and only in the past 2 hours or so did I start to feel it getting boring. But that means that I got about 25 hours of gameplay for every dollar I spent. This is a great game if you like roguelike games. Every run is either a bit or completely different from the others depending on what items you choose to pick up. This isnt a multiplayer game but its fun to play around friends to see peoples different strategys. I really enjoyed this game and all my friends hate me because I played to much of it. 9.5/10Stats:Money: 10/10 (Really cheap game)Controls: 10/10 (They work and they're easy to learn)Sound: 8/10 (The soundtrack is ok, I dont normally play with volume on)Replayability 10/10 (200 hours, each run is about a half an hour need I say more?)

												Fuggin hard as shet. This game uses a lot of references, including quite a few biblical references, not to mention metaphors that are fairly obvious to the player; if they have any religious or biblical knowledge, they'll probably be able to understand them all.The fact that every time you 'die' you restart at the beginning makes this game quite unique- as well as one of the most challenging videogames I've ever played, comparable to Dead Space 2 on Hard Core mode, except not even three saves, but in fact none at all.Every playthrough is a new experience, with a plentitude of items that upgrade your abilities; a different variety of which the player collects throughout the game. It's a pretty fun game despite the challenge, and it's garaunteed to get you frustrated after the first 80 or so deaths.			"

												Good ol' binding of isaac. At first I hated this game, but that was because I didn't get it. You HAVE to enjoy for what it is, not for what it isn't. It's simply some adventure-ish game like 'dem 2D Zeldas, with randomized dungeons and randomized item gets.Your playthrough is greatly affected by the items you find, you could be very lucky and unlucky, which is kinda frustrating.other than that, great game!overall: 7.5/10			"

 ""Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, (...) and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."" A kind of game that I(and probably a lot of other gamers) really like- a game where it has great gameplay, combined with deep and great story.The entire story is a satire about a bible story The Binding of Issac, where Abraham tried to sacrifice his son Issac because he heard(or thought he heard) a voice from the God. The Binding of Issac(video game), BoI for short, has a similiar story, but is set in a more modern setting.Issac(not that Issac from before) and his mother(name not revealed) lived in a small house. While Issac played with his toys, his mom watched Christian broadcasts from the TV. One day, his mom thought she heard a voice from the God, and he ordered her to kill Issac to prove her devotion. Issac, heard all of it and tried to escape. He found a trapdoor to his basement, and the game begins with him jumping down to it.McMillen wanted to show the positive yet the nagative affects of the game's developer Edmund McMillen had from the Scripture. McMillen makes a lot of dark humour and satire based games, and most of his creativity with the story of those games came from his Catholic mother and grandmother, and he thanks them for that. But his Christian dad was harsh on him, saying that playing games such as Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons will lead him to hell.McMillen tried to tell this bible's positive effects and nagative effects on a child. It is very interesting, and it is even more so that even though 3 years have passed since the launch of this game, a solid explanation to the game's story hasn't been found yet. This was intended, as McMillen wanted this game to have many interpretations of it's endings, just like the Scripture.Now, to the gameplay aspects- it's a roguelike with some real-time aspect, combined with basic Legend of Zelda dungeon structure. The game has insane replay values, with over 100(or 200) items in the game, and 70(or more) of them is all stackable. You can trie out new combos with different enemies and bosses, such as combining a rapid fire laser weapon with a item that lets you charge, or combining a item which lowers your range but increases your damage with a weapon that inscreases your range.The game is lot like Zelda in this aspect where you don't know what things does until you try them out. The game also drops you bombs, keys, coins and health in various rooms, which is much like Zelda as well.The soundtrack is amazing, Danny Baranowsky did a fantastic job. It's one of those soundtracks that you would download to your phone or iTunes.This aspects makes this game really addicting, with you always telling to yourself ""What will I get this time?"". These games that makes you excited everytime you launch your game is a proof of a great game.The Binding of Issac definitely deserves an 8/10- it's a great game. I saw people saying this game is bad because it's too 'hard'. But that's the core mechanic of the game, you need to retry and see what happens next time. That's the general concept of a rogue-like. Some says that this game's only fun is it's item-combining aspects, but that's not true. If you look deeply into it's story as well, you will find it very interesting. The game's fun also comes from not only the Zelda aspects, but also from the rogue-like aspects.Unfortunately, The Binding of Issac is not a masterpiece(9/10). I want it to be, but I just feel like there's something missing here. Maybe it will be a masterpiece in The Binding of Issac: Rebirth, a remake to this game, which will not be made in 3 mouths. Yay.			"

Even if you're not a completionist this game has so many items to offer and so many different chances, it's based on RNG for so many things, and others you can just get better at the game and at manipulating enemies and bosses. It's very skill based and I recommend you try it.			"

The game is $5 you can't complain, for an extra $2.50 it's $7.50 which is lunch money. Some times it can be $3.75 for the game and it's DLC. The DLC unlcoks more wepons, powerups, enemies, bosses and stages so it's worth the pocket change. There are unlockable characters bossess tons of secrets, wepons and power ups half the game is luck half the game is skill which do u have? Fun Indie Game 7/10			"

It's a pretty addictive game, but it's also nice to sit down and play for 30-40 mins at a time, which is about a full run if you complete the whole thing.  There is a ton of replayability as well, if you can get over the initial hurdle of it being slightly difficult until you unlock more items. Definitely my favorite game I own on steam, and I'd certainly suggest buying it, because it's so cheap for so many hours of enjoyment.			"

												When there is a 2010's 'Indie Game Hall of Fame', The Binding of Issac will be one of its first inductees. Ed McMillen and Florian Himsl's top down rougelike dungeon crawler is a zebra in a field of wild horses. Its themes are what videogames and films try to avoid like the bubonic plague. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if one of the bosses in this game has the bubonic plague (I'm looking at you, Gurdy). Infanticide, abortion, child abuse, and the idea that religion brainwashes would have some marketing departments cleaning out their desks. But this beautful departure isn't where The Binding of Issac shines. The gameplay is solid gold. The Legend of Zelda is a huge influence, and the game touts it well. Replayabilty is off the charts thanks to randomized levels, items, and boss fights. The pacing of difficulty and item unlocks as you progess feels reasonable. The soundtrack composed by Danny Baranowsky provides an added dimension into the hell that is Issac's basement, and its a damn good one. The community surrounding this game is extremely dedicated, constantly creating lore for a game that leaves a lot of blanks. The ""Wrath of the Lamb DLC"" (2012), and recently added ""Eternal Edition"" (2015) added substantial content to the game. Do yourself a favor and play this game until your eyes bleed (I hear toothpicks for your eyelids will help).			"

												I've played this game for about 100 or so hours, just not on steam. And if you don't own this, at the time of this review, you can get the base game and the DLC for $1. Or 100 pennies. 20 nickels. 4 quarters. You can't beat that. Pick it up.Anyways, actual review time.TONS of replayability. But be warned: if you're playing this game for the first time, it's hard. It does not hold your hand. The items that you pick up don't even have descriptions of what they do. But fear not! The Binding of Isaac wiki will be your new Bible (pun slightly intended, for those of you that have played Isaac) for about the first 50 runs or so. But about that difficulty....it's hard, yes. But the satisfaction you feel after killing Mom for the first time is probably the most accomplished I've felt pressing certain keys and watching things happen on a screen. Worth every penny.			"

I'm going to go on a record and say that I can't play the same game without stopping unless i absolutely worship it. This is one of the rare cases where I can play this game FOREVER. It's confusing, makes you think, it's funny, its gross, it's crazy, and downright addicting! Also, it's one of my favorite type of games, being a fan of randomly generated rogue-likes. I would also extremely highly reccomend getting the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, as it is probably one of the largest and best DLCs I have ever seen. It's like if you grabbed a cake and smashed 10 more onto it and it made a perfect 11-layer cake. That's what this game is when you have the DLC, a perfected 11-layer cake!

												Let me start this review by saying that I hated the game at the beginning so much that I wrote a negative review about it. I hated the bugs, the lags because of the poor (flash based) game engine and of course the ultra-hard difficulty. So why did I change my opinion about it? Well, I still kinda hate it but not in a bad way :)The Binding of Isaac is a game for hardcore gamers! Period. We all have been spoiled by the new(er) games with lengthy tutorials, huge amounts of hints and by a difficulty so easy that you're asking yourself if the game is made for kids. Not with this game! The difficulty is hard. Extremely hard! You need to have fast reflexes, think and move smart and if all else fails then only luck can save you. Even when you know all of the dirty tricks and moves of your enemies, there's still no guarantee you won't get hit and eventually die. It's always a challenge no matter how good you're at it and on top of that the randomly generated levels offer endless replay value.Long story short; this game will make you a better gamer overall. You don't believe me? Now hear me out. I just collected the final achievement called ""Platinum God!"" and the feeling is amazing. I feel like I can tackle and complete every game out there. It was worth every hour I spent with the game even though I was mad, frustrated, angry and in a rage quit mood quite often. Be warned though. You need a lot of patience, skills and balls of steel to beat this game. So if you're a casual gamer avoid it all cost.GG!			"

												I just realized, I haven't written a positive review for this game, even though it is my second most played game in my library!Even with the obviously superior Rebirth out now, the original Flash-Isaac is still a very compelling, yet rock hard experience. As far as flash games go, this is probably one of the very best - if not THE very best - positive example. Like many roguelites (is this the correct classification for purists?) it is brutally hard and unforgiving in the beginning, but the more you play it, the more you get the hang of it, the further you will get, until eventually, you can start a run and know ""okay, I will most probably finish it after an hour, if the items I get aren't COMPLETELY garbage.""Now, with the new ""eternal edition"" update out, it's worth revisiting the old times.I recommend buying the original, IF you are already through with Rebirth and:-Want to see, where Rebirth came from and how the original incarnation played differently-Want to listen to an, in my humble opinion, slightly better soundtrack - but that's highly subjective!Otherwise, if you haven't played any of Isaac at all yet, you might want to skip this and start with Rebirth instead, except if you want to relive the process of improvement.Recommended.

												The Binding of Isaac. Where do I even start?When i first viewed this game on the steam store page it looked like another boring simple fail.My brother then showed me some gameplay on youtube showing Dan Gheesling doing an average run of the game.So since I had 7 dollars left in my credits I decided to give it a try.At first, It was nothing special. But as I got better and better I got addicted. The concept is simple. Explore rooms, Get items, coins, bombs, and keys. Fight mini bosses and going through floors trying to get to the final boss. YOUR OWN MOTHER.  I cant really explain why you fight your own mother, But for more information on that watch the trailer here:  .Anyway The Binding Of Isaac is super addicting. I rate it 10/10 for gameplay and soundtrack.BEWARE: If you purchase this game and dont like it, Dont blame me I never forced you to buy it.If you do infact buy it, I hope you enjoy it and spend your whole life playing it for countless hours until you start to rought for the inside out. :)Thank you and goodbye~Rellik298			"

Cry or DieA former shell of a boy turned lump-of-flesh, Isaac must endure the horrors of lost siblings that never came to be. These undead fetuses are hellbent on destroying Isaac's very way of living and are very angry, that is to say, not only at him but at his mother even more so. Mom receives a godsend message from the Lord one day, asking her to prove her devotion and faith by sacrificing her son, Isaac. Who knows if his late brothers and sisters suffered the same fate, but one thing's for certain, Isaac isn't going to wait to find out!Overall, the top-down arcade style of The Binding of Isaac is great fun to be had. The levels are generated at random each time, and knowing this, makes for high replay value... from an indie game no doubt! Enemies are unique in appearance, there are various items with special capabliities, and plus, you take down your foes by crying a surge of tear drops! Poor Isaac... more fun for us then!			"

The gameplay pretty much consists in experience, skill and luck. You will commit a lot of mistakes before you can become skilled in this game, but lack of luck will also perplex you.

												The games good. I have had it for ages, and i still play it every now and again, its a fun game to burn time. can be frustrating at times when you are doing really well but get into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t room D: but that's how it goes. Some stuff in the game can be slightly disturbing, and some stuff can be quite funny and humorous, and some stuff can make you think 'well, what the ♥♥♥♥?' the game is filled with unusual things that you really wouldnt expect (especially in wrath of the lamb) which is good and what makes the game unique, a long with how items stack. The amount of thought the developers put into the game is pretty amazing. There's loads of hidden content, hidden rooms in some basements, TONS of achievements, and there's no game quite like it. One thing that gets me a bit frustrated at times is when i get extraordinarily bad luck, and some of those bosses that seem a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me, or maybe that's just me being bad at the game :p. Definitely fun times where you just roll enemies without a care. Such a good game and very unique. If you are strongly religious, there is content that mocks religion jokingly.			"

												When there is a 2010's 'Indie Game Hall of Fame', The Binding of Issac will be one of its first inductees. Ed McMillen and Florian Himsl's top down rougelike dungeon crawler is a zebra in a field of wild horses. Its themes are what videogames and films try to avoid like the bubonic plague. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if one of the bosses in this game has the bubonic plague (I'm looking at you, Gurdy). Infanticide, abortion, child abuse, and the idea that religion brainwashes would have some marketing departments cleaning out their desks. But this beautful departure isn't where The Binding of Issac shines. The gameplay is solid gold. The Legend of Zelda is a huge influence, and the game touts it well. Replayabilty is off the charts thanks to randomized levels, items, and boss fights. The pacing of difficulty and item unlocks as you progess feels reasonable. The soundtrack composed by Danny Baranowsky provides an added dimension into the hell that is Issac's basement, and its a damn good one. The community surrounding this game is extremely dedicated, constantly creating lore for a game that leaves a lot of blanks. The ""Wrath of the Lamb DLC"" (2012), and recently added ""Eternal Edition"" (2015) added substantial content to the game. Do yourself a favor and play this game until your eyes bleed (I hear toothpicks for your eyelids will help).			"

												This game teaches you to wash your hands before food.Indeed, if you pay attention - you'll see that all your enemies are, in fact, hallucinations of your vivid unstable child's mind. They are grotesque versions of himself, trying to bully him.The reason for all this is quite simple: your hero (Isaac) doesn't like wearing clothes and touches a lot of dirty things: spoons, shoes, hourglass (very dirty), mom's panties, etc.Germs are transmitted very easily, and since you play as a child with a weak immune system, it's very likely that you've caught something because of your careless behaviour.You deserve to die.

Though it is a rouge like every time you complete an achievement you unlock a possible item and add it to the possible item pool giving you a definite sense of progression within the context of a rouge like game. At this point if you are reading this far into some random comment on the page you have either already bought the game and are just curious of what other people think of it or are just really cautious about what game you buy. Either way you already know that it is an amazing game. If you are in the latter group what are you waiting for BUY IT!			"

												Challenging, fun, addicting, and highly replayable.  I would recommend it to anybody really.  Controls are simple, items are unique and varied, and the art style is cute but at the same time a bit crude(in a good way of course).  There is a pretty noticeable problem when it comes to performance, since this game was made in Flash, it will lag like crazy during intense moments in the game. While this is a great game, at this point there really isn't any reason to buy this game over Rebirth now that that's out.			"

Firs off, the gameplay is so old-school yet so rewarding and satisfying that reminds you of the classic Legend of Zelda games. The graphics are 2D but the amazing and beautiful art style make up for it. The sound as well as the soundtrack are great too. To be honest, I can't really complain about this game, it's amazing and almost anyone can fall in love with it right away. I'm actually addicted to it and can't stop playing it. I recommend it even at full price.			"

The game has a good depth to it, while at the same time, has a very straight forward play style and linear story-line. This game makes me think of a young child trapped in the paranormal fears of Courage the Cowardly Dog in an attempt to escape from Gannon's Castle.			"

												This game is fantastic, something other games should strive towards. With an extremely cheap price,  (less than a dollar during most sales), this game offers more replay value than most others, with randomly generated floors, items, and layouts of individual rooms. This game is easy to learn how to play, but difficult to master, but that's why I find it so great. With challenges, tons of items to unlock, different characters and over 10 endings, this game has lots of things to find, use, and synergize with eachother. I've played this game for over 100 hours because there is no one way of doing things when everything is randomized. I give this game a 10/10			"

												The best flash based game I've ever played, The only bad thing about it is that it is pretty luck based. Though It isn't that much of a problem really, the music is great one of the things why I like it so much, so if you've got an extra 1€ over, buy it. Not only that, there's a huge replay value too, I think that there is 13 endings. But it doesn't end there, there's even more to it! But I won't tell you because I don't want to spoil it...Great game for less than 5€! And then there is the Wrath of the Lamb DLC, wich adds even more items, enemies and bosses!Edit 2014-10-30: While my point from above still stands, there is no point in buying this game when Rebirth is at our doorstep.Still a good game tho.

												I haven't recommended this yet?Well, basically, even for a guy like me who isn't usually into the macabre and creepy style this kind of game exudes, you end up becoming so addicted that none of it matters.  The unique feel of each run despite going down the technically-same labyrinth over and over is surprising, and the amount of stuff to do is just ridiculous.			"

												Binding of Isaac is that kind of game that has a relatively long learning curve but it´s fun is mostly hidden in mad combinations of items and passive abilities and almost total randomness. Even though Isaac has no theme in common with FTL, I found these two games briliant in their way of making you playing it again and again just because you might find something new, the game is never the same and the more you play the more you are actually able to enjoy it (maybe exploit it?).For me, I found 0 bugs or glithces , so gameplay is more than enjoyable on both fronts : fun from the game itself (plot, mechanisms, easter eggs and hidden references...) and the actual game programming (AI, smoothly running, no bugs...). I guess that at the start, I was a lot confused about all the items, trinkets and cards because it is really immersive when it comes to quantity, but few visits of wikia now and then makes it more clear as you pass more time playing it. Don´t let that make you stop playing this game! Those few stats, cards, pills and items with no self-explainitory describtions are really worth to learn because you will want to play it again and again and again...One big recommendation when it comes to this game : buy it! Play it! It´s crazy how addictive and good it is. And from what i heard th creators made it in only few months!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game that mixes elements from The Legend of Zelda dungeon crawling all the way to games like Minecraft with it's randomization. In the Binding of Isaac, you play as a small boy called, Issac who is chased down into the basement of his house due to his Mother believing that she is hearing the voice of God.      You can collect many different types of Weapons in the Binding of Isaac. Ranging from arrows, to bombs, to stranger things such as ipecac, to brimstone, to chocolate milk! There more items than just weapons. You can collect things that will aid you on your journey such as dog food (Additional health), and Pyro (You grow fuses in your head that give you 99 bombs). There is a great diversity of items in the game and it is very unlikely that you will get the same items in next playthroughs.     Now, all of these items don't mean much if the combat is bad. And it is not. Rooms are randomly generated and there is quite a selection of enemies to fight. All the enemies in the game serve a specific role to play. There are not many different types of bosses however in the game, which does mean that you repeat a boss that you fought in a previous run.     All in all, the binding of isaac is a great dungeon crawling game and plenty of randomization to make each run different.			"

												""If there are two people who I believe are going to save hardcore gaming, it's Hideki Kamiya and Edmund McMillen.""-SelfCreated behind the same mind that brought you Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac is a randomly-generated dungeon crawler with light rpg elements present and constant action. Set in a twisted atmosphere with dark themes ranging from child abuse, gender identity, suicide, abortion and how religion might negatively affect a child, you play as Isaac; a child who is relentlessly being hunted by his mother, who believes her son is corrupted by sin and must sacrifice him to prove her love to her god after hearing his voice. The game can be brutal at moments, due to not knowing how the game is played and randomly generated levels. However, the longer you play the game, the better you will understand how the game is played and where secrets are placed, what the items do and attack patterns your enemies display. It instructs you with trial and error gameplay and it's random but understandable level design. This is easily one of the best designed games I've ever played, and look forward to the remake of this game.Since this is a flash game,however, expect to have random framerate crashes, as the game is packed with so much content there will be moments where the game will slow down and may even stop responding.If you are a fan of the NES Legend of Zelda dungeioneering and/or a challenging game with a test of wits and reflexes, this is for you.

												From the team behind Super meat boy comes this game. A Roguelike aka Survival Action Shooter game based on the Original Legend of Zelda 1 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.This game is deeply disturbing, featuring the life and experiences of an abused child of a mother who's a christian fundamentalist. Not only is this game a religion critique that will make your fedora spin, its also a deep delve into the mind and insanity à la being John Malkovich.The graphics are alright and characterful, simple drawings with a fat black outline, yet manage to make the hair on your neck stand up. Soundtrack delivered by the mastermind Danny Baranowsky. He offers a mishmash of techno, dubstep and chip music that will enhance the feeling of anxiety that you will get playing this. A weak point of this game is, that it gets repetitive. Once you threw yourself at this broad meat grinder of monsters and traps often enough and given that you get lucky with the items, you practically breeze though the floors all in the same fashion.Hopefully this will get mixed up with a future update. ALSO important is to mention that this game lacks a safe function.This definately needs to changeAlso that this game is required to run on flash is ridicoulous, making it hard to interact with steam, but not impossible.As it stands you get a great bargain of a game with inexpensive yet filling DLC, loads of collectibles, challenges, achievements and a statistic score. Its yours for 5,00 Euros.Prepare to meet a form of fear and disturbance you've never expected to be presented in this kind of formate.			"

												The binding of isaac, Well what is there to say about this, this game is all the way about religion with a cartoon twist. Isaac who is about to be killed by his mom, jumps down to the basement where he will have to fight his way to survive and at the end, he will fight his mom. Binding of isaac is a very rage inducing game. You might of gotten to the last level and die and go to the very begginning. But thats what makes it addiciting. I think binding of isaac is a great game, especially with the DLC (WRATH OF LAMB) I give Binding Of Isaac a 8.5/10			"

												Binding of Issac is a small indie game from the offices of Newgrounds, and like every Newground game, its simple and sweet to keep your attention for your torrent of ""The Dark Knight"" to download.The game is a simple thriller, 3rd person static shooter around the character of Issac as he escapes his homicidal, Christian mother through a maze of dungeons. Using tears and demonic and unique items to kill his chlorinated genepool creations of his  (I guess) brothers. The game is small in size and relatively simple mechanics to grasp the game play easily. Plus the graphical style is so good it looked develpoted in the designers' Mother's basement. Overall it's a good game to play when you don't want to spend the time loading Fallout or a heavy game like L4D.			"

												I'm going to write down what I feel about this game because I'm not a professional reviewer of games...The Binding of Isaac is a gem withing the indie genre and you know it, I know it, hell...even your granny knows it. The game offers tons and tons of hours of play time. Through the randomly generated dungeons and over 100 items to help you kill many different types of enemies and difficult yes fun bosses. Yes the game has a learning curve, and not a easy one, but once you get in the hang of things in this game it really shows what its got. One of the best things about this game is the music, oh boy the sweet sounds of this game given to us by Mr. Baranowski are freaking unforgettable. Every level having its own theme and even bosses have their own music to get pumped to. BOI also features different characters to play as, each woth their strength and weaknesses. So to summarize here is a pro/con list!PROS:-Randomly generated levels-Over 100 items to master-Tons of different enemies and bosses to defeat-THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS GIVEN TO US BY THE GODS-Different characters to play and master, each with strenghts and weaknesses-Tons of different kinds of enemies CONS :(-Steep learning curve Yeah that's it for cons :)And don't even get me started on the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, because it's a whole another experienceProdigy OUT			"

												This game...This game is many things, at most times though, it feels like an abusive spouse; it lures you in with lovely goodies and maybe even a deal with the devil if you want to vomit blood, and then, it sticks you in a room with fifteen floating heads shooting blood at you... you come back the next day.Personally, while im not exactly good at this game, i like it, but i hate it just as much. Ive ragequit from this game every day since its purchase, and i keep coming back for more.There`s a bit of a learning curve, most is knowing what a card or pill does, because they can harm you, and will if you`re not careful. You also want to know the enemy types and create strategies. Its almost like Dark Souls in a sense, especially when you consider the lore.There is a ton of story and lore if you just look a little bit between the lines, very deep messages about issac present and past conditions. There`s a youtuber, i believe he is named vaati vidya, that goes into depth about this and the game in general, i suggest checking him out.			"

												This game is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It sort of reminds me of old school Zelda dungeons mixed with Super Meat Boy (but that's just because it's the same creator which gives it the same art style). This game literally has an infinite replay value. It takes a little while to get used to it, and may require a lot of practice, but there is a MAJOR feeling of gratitude once you kill mom (you'll understand once you play it). And if you think it stops after that, you are painfully wrong. There is a DLC that EVERYONE should buy day one. It makes the game nearly impossible to beat...nearly. This game deserves all the praise it reseves. 10/10, definetly buy. Plus, it's like 5 bucks, that's practically nothing for an unlimited amount of fun!			"

												This is a magical game. Think original Legend of Zelda crossed with Risk of Rain and you're probably starting to get an idea. The wonder of discovering new items, the horror of unlocking new creepy music (!), the despair of watching Isaac's family fall apart at the final ending. It's all there. From Edmund McMillen's lovable, twisted art style to the game's deceptively simple and addictive mechanics, this game is one of the best I have ever seen. There really aren't any bad points about it. It takes a while to master, but boy is it worth it when you do. This is one of the few games where completing objectives actually feels rewarding. I have played this game for 2 years and still have 25% to go before I'm finished. At full price, you will get your money's worth and discover the true meaning of replayability.			"

												Take a cross between the original Legend of Zelda's dungeons, bullet hell games like R-Type, and rogue-like games and you've got The Binding of Isaac. The game is simple yet very fluid. It's chock full of grotesque humor (one of the power ups is a Wire Coat Hanger) and disturbing imagery. The difficulty varies room to room and can be pretty brutal. There is no saving, so you only have one life (unless you find a 1-UP or other item). Each time you play the game everything - bosses, items, rooms, everything - is random. For a measly five bucks, six with the sound track, it's totally worth buying. Plus, hey, not only is it made by the creators of Super Meat Boy it also has one helluva awesome soundtrack, too.			"

												Well, considering I recently logged my 100th hour, I figured I would write a review.What can I say about this game? Well...anyone who asks me, I tell them that it's the wierdest game you'll ever see. Perhaps that's not entirely true, but it's rather close.Isaac is a rouguelike that is probably the hardest game that I've ever played. It's incredably frustraiting to simply play it for fun, but thankfully the game has nice tiers of bosses to defeat, and some bosses are just simply rewarding to kill due to their difficulty.Anyone new to the game will die, and any veteran will die often as well. The game is unforgiving and, as I said, incredibly difficult. One aspect that I don't like is it's heavily RNG, but the game does kinda adress that once you've beat it a few times *cough10-15cough*I honestly don't know why I still play it. I think it's because the challenge itself allures me, and the fact that I have 100 hours there's still so much to do. The game has a few gates requiring you to beat it again in order to proceed, and that's what i like about it. If you don't like difficulty, anger, and death, don't buy this. But if you're willing to struggle through and recieve the great feeling of awesomeness when you succeed after 200 runs, then this is for you.			"

												The Binding of Isaac looks and feels like a flash game; something you could play for free online. It looks like someone had an idea, said ""hey, wouldn't this be cool?"" and made it.But if you can get past that, The Binding of Isaac is surprisingly thorough. It's a Roguelike - you die, you start again. You gather items and powerups in order to ramp up your character and clear the dungeon. And boy are there a lot of items; it wasn't until at the very least my fifth playthrough that I started to see repeats at all, and according to the wiki, there are dozens of things left to discover.That being said, there's no way to see what some of these items actually do before using them. The tarot cards which are usually one-time effects have consistent effects through all playthroughs, but there's so many of them it's hard to remember. There's multitudes of passive collectables you could potentially find which end up helping you create a 'build', and you never know what you'll get (or what they even do, if they require an activation).Despite finding multitudes of what I thought were ""broken OP"" items, the difficulty in this game is fairly high, and despite at least twenty attempts, I've only managed to beat the game once. And like any Roguelike game, exploration, while rewarding, is extremely dangerous! Unlike a game such as FTL where you are encouraged to finish every encounter you can in order to build up enough power, Isaac's hard limit on healing items forces players to rethink trying to explore the entire dungeon, and for once, NOT exploring can sometimes be the tactical choice.The game produces mountains of tough little choices. Do you permanently lower your health for a good item? Which active ability is best to keep, since you can only have one? Do you go through the spiked door where you will take guaranteed damage for a shot at loot? Do you use your key on the chest in front of you, or is there a shop down the road that can help you unload cash?Unfortunately, these decisions are sometimes uninformed. Again, without a way to see what an item does before picking it up, experimentation is required. This can be painful when you are asked to pay a health container or two before even figuring out what it does, or you activate something that teleports you, or some other unexpected event.If you can handle the sort of gross nature of the environment, this is a Roguelike which'll keep you busy for a few hours.

												I think this is the sort of game that grows on you with time.Initially I found this game very challenging to the point that I was very close to giving up. But, if you're persistent with this game you'll get better, to the point at which completing the game 9 times over (for the achievements) is do-able.It's worth mentioning though that the first completion gives you a false sense of victory. If you dare to play it again you'll realise that it goes to a whole new level of difficulty (2 more levels to be precise). Everything will start damaging you double and the game has suddenly gone hardcore. But as I say, if you're persistent you will get good at this game and you'll find it enjoyable - especially if you're the achievement-hunting type.So, to summarise I'd recommend this game as a self-purchase or a gift for more experienced gamers with at least a few years under their belt. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted though, or those less experienced (i.e. casual or intermediate gamers) simply because this is a difficult game, and they might be a bit quick to give up the game forever.

												The Binding of Issac is a fun dungeon crawler that brings the rogue-like genre back to it's roots. The Binding of Issac understands how pacing works and that players need to spend most of the game gearing up for the final boss battle. It mixes a memerable soundtrack with an intriguing art style to create a difficult yet nostalgic game that will keep you playing for hours. While I am on the subject of The Binding of Issac, the DLC, Wrath of The Lamb, adds TONS more content for the mere price of £1.99. This is how I believe expansion packs should be handled rather than the current expectation of ""a couple more skins"". I would reccomend this game to gamers who enjoy dungeon crawlers, intense soundtracks and a beautiful aethstetics style.			"

												Love this game. The Binding of Isaac is a game with twists and turns. You never know who, or what, is around the corner. There are items that assist you, are overpowered, or completely useless. You can play this over and over again and never have the same run. There is a multitude of bosses and they are also randomised (bar four bosses; Mom, Mom's Heart/It Lives, Isaac and ??? [Blue Baby]) There are characters with different stats and starting items (you start with Isaac, then unlock the rest) I love this game.			"

												What can you say about The Binding of Isaac...In this game you control Isaac or one of the other unfortunate characters trapped within its twisted world through randomly generated ""basement"" based levels, fighting your way through various warped creatures searching for an entry to a deeper level of the basement which in order to access you must first face and defeat the boss of said floor. The huge variation of upgrades available to you as you progress through the unknown helps not only to help you proceed but also makes the game a unique experience through each subsequent attempt to clear the dark twisted world that it offers.

												It is very hard to review this game. It is inspired by the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, so you think it would be amazing, right? Well, just think of being in a dungeon on LOZ. That, is the whole game of The Binding of Issac. But what I like about the game is that they built around that, and they made really creative boss battles, just a hilarious story-line, and lots of enemies. Did I mention lots of loot? Yes, there is more loot in this game then you could ever imagine, way farther than LOZ standards. So, should you buy the game? Well, if you love adventure mixed with humor, then YES.			"

												A classic up there with the likes of Super Mario Bros. and Legend of Zelda (who it pays homage to). THE rogue-like of all rogue-likes and one of only four 10/10 games I have ever experienced (another of which is Binding of Isaac: Rebirth). If you haven't played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. For the hours upon hours of replay value that you'll get from this game, you CAN NOT beat the price. Seriously. I have put in an easy 120 hours into this one alone not counting the other 100 hours I have invested in Rebirth so far (and I've just barely scratched the surface on that one).The game seems so simple the first time you play it. And then you play it again and realize it's like playing an entirely different game. And so on, and so on. There are just so many builds, unlockables and other variables, no 2 runs ever feel exactly the same. One of, if not THE most replayable game I've ever played.			"

												This game is really addictive and really hard. I would recommend keeping its wikia open when you play it. If you are looking for a serious challenge then buy this game and its one DLC. Remeber, the more you play the harder it gets.You might be thinking ""Doesn't every game do that?"" Well yes at least for the most part. THIS GAME DOES IT DIFFERENTLY! With every boss you beat for the first time, a enemy type of enemy spawns on your current and later attempts.This means that the more you fail, the harder it gets. You'll find yourself checking the wikia on every item you find and sometimes what may sound really good turns out to be really bad.If you really want to trust your luck, rage, or challenge yourself, buy this game.

												It's not quite Dungeons of Dredmor--which is by far the better deal--but it is fun in its own right, mixing the most shallow the roguelike experience can offer with the most shallow of Zelda dungeon-crawling.  It works darn well as a pick-up-and-play title, with you either victorious (unlikely) or dead all under 20 minutes.  However far you get is largely determined by the luck of the randomly-generated draw: power-ups you get, health available, enemies you face.The perfect title if ye're lookin' for a time-killer.  You'll probably never see all the collectables and secrets the game has to offer.			"

												Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above:""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.""""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.Again the voice called to her:""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.One last time Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove you love me above all else.""""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butchers knife from the kitchen.Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below...			"

												It plays like a shmup but feels like the original Legend of Zelda in many ways (from level design to music and items). Everything is randomly generated. Everything from the treasures within each dungeon to the bosses you face at the end. Sometimes you'll get a really awesome item like the Book of Relevations or a Dinner, and sometimes you might just find Mr. Boom! or The Belt. Sometimes you might face Monstro or sometimes you might have to deal with War or Famine. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a game with high replayability. The music is great, the gameplay is simple yet addictive, and I'm always trying to find new  treasures and beat that next boss.So, are you ready to hear Isaac's story?			"

												Probably the best Rouge like game to ever come to this world we call earth. The replay value is unmatchable and the randomness it brings to the table is unrivaled. This game is just SO MUCH FUN, you can't deny that fact, at first it may seem Irritating, but after playing the game for awhile; learning what various items do, and getting a grasp on enemy rhythm you'll become better and better, and everytime you fail, you'll just want to try again. I've managed to 100% the game, and I still play it to this day. This review is really late for a person who plays this game religiously, knows all the tips and tricks to it, and has cleared the game over 300 times, but I can promise you would not regret purchasing this game I could type out a long description of what you do and how you go about playing the game, but that's boring take it from me, you'll love it. 10/10 Play it till the end. <3			"

												Although the game can be buggy at times, and there can be frame rate issues due to the fact it was made on flash, this is still a very fun and rewarding game to play. It is very challenging to start out, but as you unlock more items for later runs and learn the attack patterns of enemies and what items suit you, it becomes easier to progress farther each run. Even for experienced players, getting to the final boss and beating it on a run is a challenge, and the randomly generated floors add a lot of replay-ability. Excellent game from Team Meat.			"

It combines brutal difficulty, random dungeons, hundreds of items, and that classic Legend of Zelda feel into one really awesome and challenging game. It will take some getting used too, but once you have got the basics down, you'll have tonnes of fun playing this game.If you are good at running and gunning, you'll love this game... Now, just combine fast paced gaming, brutal enemies, hundreds of item combinations, random dungeon structures, and a wide variety of bosses, and you've pretty much summed up this epic game.8.5 out of 10.

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game that mixes elements from The Legend of Zelda dungeon crawling all the way to games like Minecraft with it's randomization. In the Binding of Isaac, you play as a small boy called, Issac who is chased down into the basement of his house due to his Mother believing that she is hearing the voice of God.      You can collect many different types of Weapons in the Binding of Isaac. Ranging from arrows, to bombs, to stranger things such as ipecac, to brimstone, to chocolate milk! There more items than just weapons. You can collect things that will aid you on your journey such as dog food (Additional health), and Pyro (You grow fuses in your head that give you 99 bombs). There is a great diversity of items in the game and it is very unlikely that you will get the same items in next playthroughs.     Now, all of these items don't mean much if the combat is bad. And it is not. Rooms are randomly generated and there is quite a selection of enemies to fight. All the enemies in the game serve a specific role to play. There are not many different types of bosses however in the game, which does mean that you repeat a boss that you fought in a previous run.     All in all, the binding of isaac is a great dungeon crawling game and plenty of randomization to make each run different.			"

												A dark twist on a familiar play style.  I have to say that Team Meat has never surprised me when it comes to the games that they make.  Often times I find myself playing the title because of their team name.  If you are a fan of Super Meat Boy, and want to play a game drawn by them but similar to the play style of Zelda a link to the past, then this is the game for you!  Two thumbs up if I do say so myself.			"

												This game was made by Edmund McMuffinMan, the same guy who made Super Meat Boy so I picked it up one day when it was on sale. I mainly got it because it was recommended and it had trading cards so I didn't give it a fair chance when i first played it. A few months later I heard about Rebirth so I thought hmm, maybe I should give that game another chance... a real chance. So I did and now I love it! It's addicting and now I'm eagerly waiting for Rebirth as it is so fun. I definately would reccomend picking this up. It was a game that surprised me on just how great it really was!			"

												I guess I'm late to the party, but that this game is more than recommended can't be stressed enough.The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike with almost unlimited replay value, lots of black humor and a story skillfully told with just a hand full of spoken words.Playing through the game multiple times unlocks new items, levels and difficulties and the ride does not seem to ever stop. Other than many roguelike games, it manages to never get unfair - the player always has strategies at hand that can get him through the game. It may take him some (or some more) tries in the beginning tho :)Add this up with a lovely soundtrack and a DLC that doubles the already vast content and you've got a month, a quarter, maybe even half a year covered.There's just one downside: The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is now out - a remake improving on almost every aspect whilst also adding massive content. You may consider getting this one instead.			"

												Binding of Isaac is easily one of the greatest games I've ever played. Given the simplicity in controls, pure randomness in not only floor design but in items given and the seemingly short story that we see unfold into a wide span of 10+ endings and different characters and challenges each with their own unique abilities and downfalls. In short, Binding of Isaac is a fantastic game.			"

												Challenging, fun, addicting, and highly replayable.  I would recommend it to anybody really.  Controls are simple, items are unique and varied, and the art style is cute but at the same time a bit crude(in a good way of course).  There is a pretty noticeable problem when it comes to performance, since this game was made in Flash, it will lag like crazy during intense moments in the game. While this is a great game, at this point there really isn't any reason to buy this game over Rebirth now that that's out.			"

Though it is a rouge like every time you complete an achievement you unlock a possible item and add it to the possible item pool giving you a definite sense of progression within the context of a rouge like game. At this point if you are reading this far into some random comment on the page you have either already bought the game and are just curious of what other people think of it or are just really cautious about what game you buy. Either way you already know that it is an amazing game. If you are in the latter group what are you waiting for BUY IT!			"

The game itself is a great, challenging experience, full of raunchy humour, fast paced gameplay, fun-to-kill enemies and action-packed boss battles but once you get to the ""Wrath of the Lamb"" DLC, you'll be pulling your hair out and begging for more. WOTL is not only a small DLC, it's a HUGE expansion pack, adding unique, and terrifying new items, enemies and characters. This is a solid 9.3/10, if anyone cares. Get it NOW, don't wait for the summer sale! It's like 2 bucks dude!			"

												The Binding of Isaac is much better than any idea you could have only by watching gameplays or reading reviews. It is a game that I should consider as basic for every gamer.Sound and music are great, really makes you get inside the story and live the game in a deeper way; but what I think is the best point of The Binding of Isaac is the gameplay and how incredibly replayable it is. It will give you lot of hours of fun as its maps are completely different every time you play and the ""dungeons"" are randomly generated, something that is challenging for any player.I completely recommend this game, it has everything what is needed to be a great game.

												Bindin of Issac is a true gem, it's artwork sets a strange tone, the monsters are -as i said- monsters that make you panick extremely when you have low hp, and the powerups are vast and all unique. The monsters are simply no pushover, each one has to potiental to kill you, and therefore a gamer has to think about strategies to defeat them. Also there are plenty of secrets thrown around for the player to discover and defeat (Bosses). And the Biblic references strewn about add another, calming and sometimes sinister, tone. Overall, Binding of Issac is a true test of a gamer and a true gem, this review can't even do this justice!			"

												So far, this game has given me the most replayability value of all time. The maps and monsters are all randomly generated in each play, so even though the experience is similar each time, it is always a bit different on each play. The myriad of achievements allows for countless goals for those who like to complete tasks, and it is always fun to see what kinds of monsters and item combinations you can work with next for those who enjoy seeing the possibilities of a game.The graphics are dorky, gross, and simplistic, but I think that is part of the appeal for a McMillen game. Also, though the story with Isaac and his Mother is not exactly the most emphatic or traditionally presented part of the game, or what really keeps a person playing it (I imagine), it definitely adds a boost in character to the game and really opens a lot to think on if one decides they feel like doing so.TLDR; play it. Its pretty awesome.			"

												Love this game. The Binding of Isaac is a game with twists and turns. You never know who, or what, is around the corner. There are items that assist you, are overpowered, or completely useless. You can play this over and over again and never have the same run. There is a multitude of bosses and they are also randomised (bar four bosses; Mom, Mom's Heart/It Lives, Isaac and ??? [Blue Baby]) There are characters with different stats and starting items (you start with Isaac, then unlock the rest) I love this game.			"

												The Binding of Isaac. Where do I even start?When i first viewed this game on the steam store page it looked like another boring simple fail.My brother then showed me some gameplay on youtube showing Dan Gheesling doing an average run of the game.So since I had 7 dollars left in my credits I decided to give it a try.At first, It was nothing special. But as I got better and better I got addicted. The concept is simple. Explore rooms, Get items, coins, bombs, and keys. Fight mini bosses and going through floors trying to get to the final boss. YOUR OWN MOTHER.  I cant really explain why you fight your own mother, But for more information on that watch the trailer here:  .Anyway The Binding Of Isaac is super addicting. I rate it 10/10 for gameplay and soundtrack.BEWARE: If you purchase this game and dont like it, Dont blame me I never forced you to buy it.If you do infact buy it, I hope you enjoy it and spend your whole life playing it for countless hours until you start to rought for the inside out. :)Thank you and goodbye~Rellik298			"

												Isaac and his Isaac, Lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs while his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac. Life was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That it, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac:""Your Isaac has become Isaaced by Isaac. He needs to be Isaaced"" ""I will do my best to Isaac him my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he Isaac open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and Isaac himself Isaac, into the Isaac Isaacs below...The Isaac of Isaac: Isaac of the Isaac.﻿Isaac/Isaac would Isaac again.IsaacGN approved.

												What can you say about The Binding of Isaac...In this game you control Isaac or one of the other unfortunate characters trapped within its twisted world through randomly generated ""basement"" based levels, fighting your way through various warped creatures searching for an entry to a deeper level of the basement which in order to access you must first face and defeat the boss of said floor. The huge variation of upgrades available to you as you progress through the unknown helps not only to help you proceed but also makes the game a unique experience through each subsequent attempt to clear the dark twisted world that it offers.

												Isaac comes to in the upper level of the basement and you, the player, must guide him through the dangers that lurk below. The UI is very similar to what you’d expect from an early Zelda title. You have three heart containers. Three counters keep track of your amount of coins, bombs, and keys. The dungeon layout is shown on the upper left and your current items are listed next to your heart containers. You start out with only your tears to fight off the grotesque creatures of the basement. Each floor of the basement is littered with a slew of enemies, chests, items, a treasure room, and a boss room. Upon entering a room, all of the doors will lock until every enemy in it has been defeated. You can blow open a door, but it will cost a single bomb. Useable items can often be found in chests, but are also dropped from enemies. These could be tarot cards, pills, or some other miscellaneous item. Where as the tarot cards have a specific use, pills have random uses. These range from incredibly useful to potentially harmful, so consume them at your own risk. Treasure rooms are marked by their gold outlines, and within them lies a single power-up. These power-ups can increase your speed, change your projectile type, increase your max HP, etc. Some power-ups are weak and their effects can leave more to be desired, while others can be complete game changers and turn the tide of battles in your favor. They’re creatively designed and include some pretty outlandish things like a pair of high heels and even dog food. They also change your physical appearance, and seeing as they stack infinitely, this can result in some pretty hilarious or gruesome appearances. As you progress throughout the game, Isaac’s exterior begins to reflect the hell that is the basement. There are a plethora of bosses and they all battle in different ways. Defeating a boss will open a trapdoor to the next level, and between each floor of the basement a cutscene plays that shows Isaac having a nightmare, often of him being publicly embarrassed. The cutscenes, although oddly humorous, add little depth to Isaac’s character as it can be assumed that the events he worries over never actually took place, seeing as some are pretty over-the-top, such as one where he dreams he was being pooped on by a group of people. The final boss is no other than Isaac’s mother. And even after you’ve managed to beat her, your adventure still isn’t over. There still remains another set of levels and a whole mess of enemies, secrets, items, and power-ups to find.Through and through, The Binding of Isaac is a bonafide roguelike in every sense of the term. Every dungeon is randomly generated, resulting in no two runs feeling exactly the same. You’re given simple controls and absolutely no tutorial of any sort. Like any self-respecting roguelike, this is a game of trial and error, and it isn’t afraid to hand you your behind on a silver platter. The staggering amount of enemies will force you to adapt to any situation, and you’ll find yourself dying often before you’ve learned most of the enemies’ maneuvers. Bosses deal a lot of damage fast and some will even spawn smaller enemies around themselves. Even after you’ve learned the behavior of every enemy in the game, you’ll still find yourself dying quite often. Useable items and power-ups add variation to the gameplay and the tactics you’ll use in combat. With the unbelievable amount of depth found in the seemingly simple game, The Binding of Isaac produces an experience that becomes insanely addictive and rarely feels stale, even after dozens of hours of playtime.The Binding of Isaac’s visual presentation is something straight from the mind of a madman. Its art style is sleek, simple, and endearing. The various brown hues of the basement stand apart from each other, enhanced by the excellent shading, but they’re just pieces in a whole that create an immersive and beautiful environment. The story is primarily told through Isaac’s drawings. It’s all nice and cutesy, that is until you actually walk around and see the dreadful conditions of the basement. A myriad of deformed and bloody enemies stalk the rooms and each seem to spout blood like a fountain upon dying. There are these worm-like enemies that actually look somewhat adorable, until they charge at you with their fangs bared, trying to eat your face off. Piles of poop lay scattered on the ground. The changes that accompany the power-ups can be humorous, but others completely change the way Isaac looks, essentially turning him into one of the monsters that he faces. The fact that you aren’t alone suggests that you aren’t the first to face the wickedness of Isaac’s mother, and the possibility that the enemies could be related to him makes the adventure even more cringe worthy. In some dungeons you’ll find a room in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. Each of these shops feature a hanging Isaac-lookalike, their faces twisted with expressions of despair. It’s an enthralling visual endeavor that shocks you from the start and carries out its dark themes with precise execution.The Binding of Isaac’s soundtrack aims to emphasize the same contrast brought about by the art style, and it manages to do so quite well. The music is slightly upbeat and detracts from the hopelessness that Isaac feels as he wanders through the basement. At times the music speeds up just a bit and the volume increases, ramping up your adrenaline at the same time. There is a slight feeling of loneliness in the unknown created by the soundtrack, and this is where it slightly fractures the contrast and actually melds with the setting. Enemy and projectile sounds are squishy in nature, but impactful overall. The contrast between the game’s dark themes and relatively uplifting music is genuinely interesting and adds another layer of depth.Despite its numerous references and tie-ins to other forms of media, The Binding of Isaac does plenty to set itself apart from the pack. There are some really laughable moments in the otherwise grim depths of the basement: there’s a certain enemy that will scurry away from you, whimpering as it tries desperately to flee; of the hanging Isaac-lookalikes in the shops, one of them has a huge grin on his face; some of the items and power-ups are just meant to make you burst out laughing, like Mom’s Pad – a useable item that makes all enemies in a room retreat for several seconds. Also, it raises some very serious questions that most games wouldn’t dare ask. It ventures into often-untraveled territory by challenging our understanding of organized religion, mental illness, and child abuse. These are very touchy subjects and it’s admirable to see developers who aren’t afraid to speak on them. The Binding of Isaac proves to be a unique and addictive adventure. Its humor is welcoming and its roguelike nature results in an unbelievable amount of replay value. While it may look simple at first, there is a surprising amount of depth to be found. Its endearing art style and aesthetically pleasing soundtrack is welcoming, while its dark themes are perfectly executed in the story and character designs. More than just a fun game, it questions what we as a society perceive to be norms and challenges us to think differently. The only real downsides to the game are the lack of characterization on Isaac and the slight capitalization on nostalgia. Aside from that, it’s an incredible game that should be played by anyone who enjoys a solid roguelike – or just a good game in general – because it stands head and shoulders above its competition in the genre.

												I've played 300+ hours of The Binding of Isaac. If anyone's qualified to talk about this game, it's people like me. I love this game so much that I bought the $40.00 on-disc copy. Now, without further ado, let's get down to brass tacks. TBoI is a randomly-generated ""rougue-like"" heavily inspired by games such as The Legend of Zelda, which happens to be one my all time favorite franchises. The items you acquire on each new and different run alter both your playstyle and your appearance, forcing you to adapt to new strategies and find new ways to overcome your foes. All of these elements combine to create one of the most complete packages I've ever seen in a game. Tack on a DLC that doubles the content and a remake on the horizen, and you've got the best game $5.00 (or $1.24) can buy.			"

												The binding of Isaac is indeed a Very addicting game to play when you just wan't to play something fun!The game itself is unique in it's own way, that meaning it has randomly generated rooms appearing every time you visit the game. The entities in the game have diffrent powerups so the game doesn't feel dull at all. I personally have not beat the final boss ""Mom"", but I do really enjoy getting there and it's about the gameplay not finishing the game! I would give this game a 4/5 just because I wish there was more options then to change the sound and resolution for Example the difficulty or how many entities spawn in certain rooms e.t.c My opinion isn't based on the fact that I haven't beat the game, those options would simply make the game even better! All in all even though the game is 2 years old it still holds as one of the best, if not best room-to-room games! I would certantly recommend this game to anyone who is willing to give in on an addicting fun game!			"

												It might look simple at first sight, but believe me, The Binding of Isaac is one of the deepest roguelikes out there, without being too complex. It might look cute at first sight, but don't be fooled, this biblical inspired game is disgusting and will throw lots of gore and poop at you. All this in a randomly generated world filled with secrets and hundreds of items. It's like playing an entire new game each time. It will challenge you, surprise you, attach you, and entertain you for hours, days, months, years. An instant classic and one of my favourite games of all time. I still recommend this while Rebirth (the remastered edition) is out, because it still has charm, having a separate soundtrack and different visual style. It's the one that started it all.			"

												  Binding of Isaac is a game that gives a ton for the price it's offered at. I have spent 226 hours on the game (Wrath of the Lamb included) and still from time to time play it. The game is difficult and has randomized elements in it, so some playtroughs you might just get bad items and die quickly, but usually it's still your fault. When playing it also is ""mysterious"" with what the items given do with short and sometimes cryptic descriptions, so you can try to learn them by playing or look up from a wiki (wich is what I did).  The story of the game is not really anything great (as it is not the main focus of the game) but it sets the mood and does add to the game in a way.  The music ( composed by Danny Baranowsky) in Binding of Isaac is quite odd, but fits the game in question very well and isn't bad on its own either.  The game is clearly not for everyone and if wanted to be compleated, it takes a long time as you'll be dying so often. I, personally still liked the game very much and will still keep playing it from time to time. I recommend the game wholeheartedly to anyone interested in it, especially for its cheap price.			"

												At 5 dollars, The Binding of Issac is one of those little gems that pays for itself within a few minutes.From start to finish it's only about 20 - 25 min in length.Of course that's when you manage to not die over and over and over.After you manage to beat the game the first time, is when Isaac really begins to shine.I personally like a challenging games, but when it takes you two or more hours to beat the game for the first time,considering how small it is, and after dying more times than I can count, it really makes it frustrating, and difficult to buckle down and start from scratch time after time.However, after you do manage to beat it, the feeling of overwhelming accomplishment is more than enough to convince me to keep playing.Another detracting feature is the redundancy of the soundtrack. While the music they have is great, and really sets the tone for the game, they could really benefit from producing more tracks.			"

												One of the simplest but best single player action games out there, random dugeons make every playthrough unique, challenging enough to take a chunk of anyones time and then there are all the secrets and unlockables. Definietly worth the price, even better on sale, get it next to nothing. A great lil game inbetween waiting for bigger titles or when you want to chill out and play something very simple and pleasing to the eye.			"

												Binding of Issac is a Perma-Death Duegeon Crawler where you must go through a series of different room consisting of different enemy types and special variations and bonus rooms that can cause positive or negative effects depending on your own judgement. The game has a great feel due to the simple yet appealing graphic style aswell as the creative soundtrack which will put in a good mood. As you progress through the game you will realise the difficulty curve spikes, you will find yourself dying frequently however this is the beauty of the Binding of Issac. Every time you start a new journey your rooms are completely randomised and this maybe the difference between life or death. Overall the Binding of Issac is a fun game to play for awhile but i got rather frustated 7/10			"

												Binding of Isaac is that kind of game that has a relatively long learning curve but it´s fun is mostly hidden in mad combinations of items and passive abilities and almost total randomness. Even though Isaac has no theme in common with FTL, I found these two games briliant in their way of making you playing it again and again just because you might find something new, the game is never the same and the more you play the more you are actually able to enjoy it (maybe exploit it?).For me, I found 0 bugs or glithces , so gameplay is more than enjoyable on both fronts : fun from the game itself (plot, mechanisms, easter eggs and hidden references...) and the actual game programming (AI, smoothly running, no bugs...). I guess that at the start, I was a lot confused about all the items, trinkets and cards because it is really immersive when it comes to quantity, but few visits of wikia now and then makes it more clear as you pass more time playing it. Don´t let that make you stop playing this game! Those few stats, cards, pills and items with no self-explainitory describtions are really worth to learn because you will want to play it again and again and again...One big recommendation when it comes to this game : buy it! Play it! It´s crazy how addictive and good it is. And from what i heard th creators made it in only few months!			"

Isaac who is about to be killed by his mom, jumps down to the basement where he will have to fight his way to survive and at the end, he will fight his mom. Binding of isaac is a very rage inducing game. You might of gotten to the last level and die and go to the very begginning. But thats what makes it addiciting. I think binding of isaac is a great game, especially with the DLC (WRATH OF LAMB) I give Binding Of Isaac a 8.5/10			"

So there is something for the people that just want to play for a few hours, aswell as the hardcore players. The way the game is made it constantly pushes you to try again, and beat that boss or layer that destroyed you last time. The first few times you play the game, you won't get that far, but when you start learning the patterns of the creatures that is when the game really starts!

												I just realized, I haven't written a positive review for this game, even though it is my second most played game in my library!Even with the obviously superior Rebirth out now, the original Flash-Isaac is still a very compelling, yet rock hard experience. As far as flash games go, this is probably one of the very best - if not THE very best - positive example. Like many roguelites (is this the correct classification for purists?) it is brutally hard and unforgiving in the beginning, but the more you play it, the more you get the hang of it, the further you will get, until eventually, you can start a run and know ""okay, I will most probably finish it after an hour, if the items I get aren't COMPLETELY garbage.""Now, with the new ""eternal edition"" update out, it's worth revisiting the old times.I recommend buying the original, IF you are already through with Rebirth and:-Want to see, where Rebirth came from and how the original incarnation played differently-Want to listen to an, in my humble opinion, slightly better soundtrack - but that's highly subjective!Otherwise, if you haven't played any of Isaac at all yet, you might want to skip this and start with Rebirth instead, except if you want to relive the process of improvement.Recommended.

												This game is truly amazing. It's jsut so damn fun. I bought the Binding of Isaac Collection for less than $0.75, I expected it to be decent but it really is awesome. If I would have known how fun this game was, i would have even paid full price for it; definetly worth it.*Pros:- Tons of Bosses- They even added mini-bosses!- Tons of items and many categories (Trinkets, cards, pills, etc) - Different types of rooms, chest, and more- This game actually presents gradual difficulty, each room gets harder- The rooms are generated, so each play through is never the same- Cheap!- The DLC actually changes gameplay whilst keeping the best aspects*Cons:- During the first couple of levels, I often encounter the same bosses (Pin, Duke of flies, etc) then I start seeing variety- When you pick up a pill, it gives the player of getting a good or bad item and is very rage inducing- If you die towards the end near the final levels, it causing lots of rage- Doesnt show the current stat changes, so the player has to remember the stats, and gets tougher to remember towards the later levels15/10 Stewie Simulator 2011-2015 "

												Binding of Isaac22 After these events, God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!”Abraham answered, “I’m here.”2 God said, “Take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him up as an entirely burned offering there on one of the mountains that I will show you.” 3 Abraham got up early in the morning, harnessed his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, together with his son Isaac. He split the wood for the entirely burned offering, set out, and went to the place God had described to him.4 On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance. 5 Abraham said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will walk up there, worship, and then come back to you.”6 Abraham took the wood for the entirely burned offering and laid it on his son Isaac. He took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them walked on together. 7 Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father?”Abraham said, “I’m here, my son.”Isaac said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the entirely burned offering?”8 Abraham said, “The lamb for the entirely burned offering? God will see to it,[a] my son.” The two of them walked on together.9 They arrived at the place God had described to him. Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice. 11 But the Lord’s messenger called out to Abraham from heaven, “Abraham? Abraham?”Abraham said, “I’m here.”12 The messenger said, “Don’t stretch out your hand against the young man, and don’t do anything to him. I now know that you revere God and didn’t hold back your son, your only son, from me.” 13 Abraham looked up and saw a single ram caught by its horns in the dense underbrush. Abraham went over, took the ram, and offered it as an entirely burned offering instead of his son. 14 Abraham named that place “the Lord sees.”[c] That is the reason people today say, “On this mountain the Lord is seen.”[d]15 The Lord’s messenger called out to Abraham from heaven a second time 16 and said, “I give my word as the Lord that because you did this and didn’t hold back your son, your only son, 17 I will bless you richly and I will give you countless descendants, as many as the stars in the sky and as the grains of sand on the seashore. They will conquer their enemies’ cities. 18 All the nations of the earth will be blessed because of your descendants, because you obeyed me.” 19 After Abraham returned to the young men, they got up and went to Beer-sheba where Abraham lived.☺/☃ "

												Oh Lord, where to start?This. Game. Oh my God. I'm almost speechless of how much i adore this game.The Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game from the amazing minds of Team Meat/Edmund McMillen (Super Meat Boy, Aether, Time ♥♥♥♥). I'm going to go on a record and say that I can't play the same game without stopping unless i absolutely worship it. This is one of the rare cases where I can play this game FOREVER. It's confusing, makes you think, it's funny, its gross, it's crazy, and downright addicting! Also, it's one of my favorite type of games, being a fan of randomly generated rogue-likes. I would also extremely highly reccomend getting the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, as it is probably one of the largest and best DLCs I have ever seen. It's like if you grabbed a cake and smashed 10 more onto it and it made a perfect 11-layer cake. That's what this game is when you have the DLC, a perfected 11-layer cake! Just seriously please buy this game you will NOT regret it!			"

												""So if I die I start over?""""yes. you start over with nothing.""""You star over with knowledge.""Binding o' Isaac is an action-arcade game, or 2D Zelda games mashed with random elements and perma-death. Crawling through your dungeon basement, you fight minion and boss abominations with your tears, while collecting stuff. You know, classic kid adventures.You will not win on your first game. The controls are odd and frustrating at first, but can be learned. And half the fun is doing it again, applying what you learned and having it pay off (and getting different loot!) Fighting itself is as fun as LttP (read: it gets the job done.)And everything is tongue-in-cheek dark. Made by half of Meat Boy's team, Ed says the story was based off some old christian VHS tapes he found. And upgrades are things like Isaac's puppy's head, which brings back the trauma and causes more tears.$5 (or $6, and get the ost, which is great.) Tons to unlock (characters, new items appear, cutscenes), Bible lore spin, and pretty fun. Check it.			"

												Roguelike meets bullet hell. Another instant classic from Edmund McMillen. That name alone should make you buy it, but the game is so awesome in all departments: gameplay, replayability, nightmarish yet funny design, insane number of items which affect your character. I love it. You will love it. Don't forget to get the single DLC for more bizzare items and monsters.The only sad thing is that your PC should be decent enough to run it, though you wouldn't think that if you judge by the screenshots. This is because the game is made with Flash and is huge, so I can't play it comfortably (too much lag) on my cheap laptop I take with me when travelling. Too bad.Can't wait for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth! It will rock!			"

												I'm not a fan of horror, I also get nauseous easy and panic easily. Binding of Isaac since it's debut was a game I mentally boxed as something other people with stronger mental fortitude play. It's creepy and disturbing, with a disarming art style and hearing the story second hand (And knowing the roots of Abraham and Isaac) did intrigue me but also made me uneasy. The Winter steam sale gave little more incentive for at least buying it, but I wouldn't recommending waiting for another sale, this game is immensely fun.There's a few games that walk, and talk like a horror like Gregory Horror Show and their ilk, which did put me off initially easily became a cult-classic, and this outclasses 'bubblegum goth' genre for quirky horror games. The game has little in way of a tutorial, and even less explanation of what every item does, but part of it's charm is exploration in a dark basement of the unknown and working things out for better or worse. Each run and level is randomly generated to keep you on your toes, there's various items that will help deal with the hideous enemies of Isaac's long-begotten and far less loved (or Lovely) siblings, of which they are legion and twisted in their variations. The game also while simple to grasp, does involve a deal of strategy later on; particularly when you find you can make a deal with the Devil for items that could turn the tide of your misfortune. Other more common rooms make such promises, that you'll need to crawl through a spiked door way to get to. Some items affect your primary weapon, which is a gag in itself, that you fight through the waves with your own tears. Give the game a simple test run, and you'll understand why this has unlimited ammo. The items also affect Isaac visually, and accumulating into making him just as horrifying as the abyss around him, and to be helpful: Even if you look like a Demon's Spermatozoa decked in black membrane with long, sharp gnashy teeth touching enemies will still kill you. I still have no idea why I thought I could eat them, .. but apparently this form gives me flight to get over ledges.Still Enjoy. "

												Probably one of the most addictive games I have everplayed ever. Takes a bit of luck and a bit of skill, but  once you get the hang of it its almost impossible to stop playing.			"

												Overall this has to be one of my favorite games. This is what got me into steam. It has a lot of re-playability. It is a good game to just jump into and do a couple runs and stop. Do nto play it for hours on end and get burnt out. Take it easy and enjoy :D			"
