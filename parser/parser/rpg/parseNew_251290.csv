												I'm 29 years old and just over 2 months ago i lost my job. I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise. I'm going through the toughest time of my life right now with personal issues and the troubles that come along with being unemployed during a crisis in your life is weighing heavy on me. Don't worry this is not a sob story, everything ties in with the game.So, being depressed and unable to get out of bed and generally live my life ( no exaggeration i swear ) i found myself reading up on old video games that i loved as a kid, in an attempt to try and feel happy again. Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VIII were my favorite games growing up. In recent years i haven't been that much into games as i was as teenager. Work commitments and adulthood takes a hold of you and gaming kind of took a back seat.Anyway, i stumbled upon Trails In The Sky FC whilst reading up on good JRPGS on Steam ( JRPG's were my thing as a kid ). I saw one review that described Trails as better than Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, and it was going so cheap on Steam, i had to see what the fuss was about. Thank god i did.As i played FC and SC consecutively i'll count this as a combined review but as i mentioned above. I haven't played games much in recent years and an in depth review is something i wouldn't be good at so i'll keep it short and sweet.First things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that. A game without good text/dialogue will struggle to be a good game. Trails has the best storyline i have ever came across in a game. It's very long but well worth it, look at it this way. Would The Lord Of The Rings be the story it was if it were not a gigantic beast of a novel? This kind of is the same with Trails. It's a slow burner at the the start but about 20 hours into FC it picks up and does not stop. It grips you in and will have you laughing, crying and screaming before you know it.The characters and character relations are amazing. Sometime the highlights for me weren't beating a tough boss or finishing long quests/chapters it was the small moments when the full team are together and each individual character shines through in the dialogue. Simply fantastic.I had mentioned before playing SC that the only thing i could say that was keeping it from being the complete game was the music, although the music is great i did say that it wasn't comparable to say a Nobou Uematsu score ( but what is eh? ). I'm going to backtrack on this now, after playing SC ( Which is considerably longer than FC ) i can say that the music is absolutely fantastic. It's up there with Nobou's Chrono Trigger soundtrack for me now.Well, that's about as much as i can say without tangling myself up in knots over a game review. The reasons i wanted to write this wasn't to critique the game but to get the message out there that games ( no matter what your preference is ) are magical. I'm now in better spirits and feeling more optimisitc about life after finishing this game. Yes, that may sound sad to some people but the joy this game brought to me will be something i will forever cherish. Given the impact this game has had on me, it will now be my "" Greatest Game Of All Time "". Sometimes you need somthing in your life to pick you up and Trails was my shoulder to cry on. Thanks Falcom and Xseed, you basically saved my life.If you like long JRPG's with amazing storytelling, characters, combat systems and addictive side quests. You need to get this game. It's an absolute must.10/10			"

												I don't even know where to begin. I finished the game today and loved it enough to immediately want to write a review, but... frankly, I can't find the words. Let's start with the ending, perhaps: this is by far the best JRPG on Steam, and one of the best of all time.With that aside, let's gets down to business: this game is a direct sequel to another game on Steam entitled simply ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"". You should absolutely not play this game if you haven't played the previous title first, because this game is an incredibly direct sequel to it. That game, henceforth ""FC"" (for ""First Chapter""), should prove to be a pretty decisive litmus test determining whether or not you'll like this game -- and if you're on the fence, know that SC has everything FC did well and more.As you should know from FC, there are a few things that will either make or break the game for a lot of people:-This is a turn-based game-This is a game from the mid-2000s-This game heavily involves anime-like aesthetics in its character and world designAnd if any of those things turned you off, SC won't really change them. If you're fine with all three of those things, though, then you're in for a real treat. SC is basically the perfect sequel to FC, expertly answering many questions FC asked and resolving a great number of personal conflicts, taking great pain to give character even to those who previously had little. The orbment system is drastically refined for the better, and while combat is largely the same, the greater focus on crafts makes it feel significantly more strategic. The game as a whole feels more challenging than FC even from the outset, but never to the point where it feels unfair -- at least, on Normal mode -- so that extra bit of strategy is necessary. Even the artwork is nicer and crisper than anything from FC, and the soundtrack is just as excellent as you'd expect from Nihon Falcom. And, of course, the localization -- the part that took four years, you might remember -- is just as high-quality as the excellence that was this game's predecessor, worth every second of effort XSEED and others put into it.To those who find no issue with the three points above, this game might well be one of the best things you ever play. In all my hours of playing the game (66, and not even on a completionist run), I only had two trivial issues: a somewhat slow prologue and enemies that feel a touch too bulky at two specific points in the game. Both of these things are fairly transient and do little to diminish the game's overall quality, which shines through at almost every other point.This game's predecessor released in English over four years ago. Ever since then, I've been waiting patiently for this title. Four years of hype, four years of expectations... and I'm the sort of person too prone to disappointment to ever get hyped for anything anymore. And with this game finished, it would be an understatement to say that I'm not disappointed. Every expectation I had was met, every bit of hype I had was exceeded, and this game will likely end up being one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had. If you're reading this, you had the luxury of not waiting that long -- and you'll likely find the game even better for it.I give this game no less than the highest recommendation I possibly can. This game is the culmination of practically a decade of work between Nihon Falcom's development and XSEED's localization; I thank both of them, from the bottom of my heart, for the many wonderful hours I spent playing the game. My only wish now is that other people can share in the joy I felt while playing Trails in the Sky SC.			"

Pre-ReviewThis 'review' is aimed to help players interested in, but not yet resolved to buy the game, so to say it is not yet a complete review but I will definitely update it as I progress in the story.SummaryJust a quick overview of what I can already tell you.For this game, even more so than the first one - you will be reading. A lot. But even if you are not into reading I do advise this game to you, it may even change your opinion on the topic altogether.  Positive Mediocre Negative   + Finally the conclusion ~ definitely don't play it if you haven't finished FC      + NPCs welcome you home ~ don't know if it's from my save file of FC      + Breathtaking locations (old and new)        + MORE loveable characters ~ you still have to part with them at some points     + Improved Orbment -> more Arts       + More Crafts, especially Chain Crafts       + I found the 'moving' more useful  ~ is it just me?      + Extremely fun minigames       + Still beautiful art style ~ and still old textures     + HD Portraits of characters in dialogues ~ for important characters only     + Goosebumps music ~ not the opening of FC       ~ no more all different chest-catchphrases     + Increased replay value     RecommendationIf you haven't played through The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (First Chapter) yet, don't consider playing this game either.Better head back there, read my review ;-), get this masterpiece of a game, play through it and then come back here! Seriously, this is in your best interest since this game is a direct spoiler to the first one, the best would be to not even watch the trailer and not to go into the community hub of this game!If on the other hand you played through the first one and still couldn't get yourself to buy this one - then I don't understand you...Second Chapter takes off where FC left you and you will definitely feel right back at home in this game, the music is great as ever, the atmosphere takes you in and you want to keep playing until the end.In the first two hours I played the game it already brought me to the edge of tears and made me laugh out loud in front of my PC - just to convey some of the early feelings in the game.So do yourself a favor and grab it!And if that still couldn't change your opinion - you can defeat enemies with Estelle's cooking - I guess some Monsters would die to get a bite ;-)CombatYou can really tell they made an effort to improve the combat in this sequel and... they succeeded.If you read my review of FC you know about my opinion on turn-based combat and the combat in this series and they made me enjoy myself even more with the additions they made. OK, I'm not to sure on this one, this will need some confirmation ;-). I used the 'moving' in my first 12h more than in the 52h of playing the first one. Somehow it felt more useful and the delay until the next attack not so huge. At certain points 'moving' is the only logical move to make - to dodge an enemy's attack, get into the healing range of an AoE-heal or position yourself for your own AoE attack.I still have a slight problem with the mechanic of it, but then again I found it more useful.Secondly, the introduction of a brand new - fresh out of the Central Factory - Orbment, (check back my review of FC for explanations) which enables you to use more quartz resulting in higher stats and, more importantly, more arts to play with, turns diversity in combat up a notch.Last but not least due to your extensive training as a 'Senior Bracer' you acquire the ability to utilize a new, so-called 'Chain-Craft' which lets your party members join in an attack that grows stronger in range and damage the more combatants take part in it.Naturally you will also gain access to new 'normal' crafts for each bracer you get to add to your fellowship, as their levels increase.Additionally, as I already mentioned above - you can now use certain kinds of food to hit your foes with, with different damage and varying 'target systems' (if anyone knows a better word, tell me please), meaning if it will effect a circle around your enemy, a line outgoing from the point you are standing at, etc.Mini-GamesOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing.Of my first about 8h or so, about 1.5h were spend doing these activities.While gambling you can choose from a slot-machine, poker, black-jack and roulette.After exchanging some of your mira for medals, you can start in the fun of losing it to the bank again. Personally, I enjoyed poker the most (as I did not lose as hard there).For fishing, you will need a fishing rod, bait and obviously - a place to dip your pole into. Different combinations of all these factors will result in a different game (mostly location and bait, but without the right rod and line you can't utilize higher level bait), but stay focused not to let those slippery suckers get away.ThanksOn the one hand to Nihon Falcom who developed this series and on the other one, even more so to XSeed and Carpe Fulgur for putting in all the localization work including all the extras they made for us to enjoy and the great translation.Also, remember that it cost these companies a lot of blood, tears, sweat and the tiny thing that some people tend to forget - money. Well, we can't help much with all those body liquids but the latter one is something we can help them with.So don't be a cheapskate, get this game - full price - so that we all may enjoy wonderful localizations of this series to come.BugsQuite a few bugs already got fixed, for those still in the game read this thread to see how bad it still is and how to fix problems if you encountered some yourself.Personally, I didn't have any problems whatsoever.NoteAs this is a pre-review you might as well not do anything yet, since I will change the whole thing over but otherwise --I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

												This is a special game.Picking up right where the first chapter left off, Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC brings us back to the wonderful land of Liberl, and if feels just as vibrant and real as it did before.Much like the first entry, when analyzing the individual pieces that make up this game, it may not sound like a revolutionary experience.  But the level of detail and effort that is poured into the whole thing really elevates the experience into something far more than the sum of its parts.  Not only do the main characters change and grow in believable and appropriate ways as the story progresses but so too do hundreds, yes hundreds, of minor characters that populate the setting.  It’s the kind of storytelling that is only really available to games.  Trails in the Sky SC does it with style.While it may not change anyone’s mind about JRPGs as a genre, I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend the Trails in the Sky games.			"

												This game (as well as First Chapter since you can't separate the games) is one of the best JRPGs out there, not only in steam.If you like a really good-developed characters, really good plot, entertaining and dinamic turn-based combat system and really good OST, this is your game.TLoH: Trails in the Sky SC concluding the story arc of Liberl and the background and development of most characters. It improves/balances a bit the combat system and introduces new and great characters.Just play the game. Both FC and SC have a really good price and you will not regret it. I hope this game sells enough so XSEED can localize more of these games.PS: LOVE IS ETERNAL!			"

												In Chapter 4, there is a segment of the story where, if you choose to visit the general store, you can spend a little bit of money to buy chocolate for your party members that have been staying up patrolling the whole night. This action does not change the course of the main story or unlock additional sidequests or equipment. It provides absolutely no benefit other than a couple of lines of dialogue.It is the little details like these, put into the game with the hearts of the developers, that are what makes Trails in the Sky SC amazing.Trails in the Sky is not an open world sandbox game, but the amount of effort put into the world and characters of the story is simply astounding. Your party members are a vibrant, well-developed cast of some of the most memorable characters you will meet, and a great deal of thought was put into each and every line of dialogue as the characters interact with each other, bringing their personalities to life. The NPCs which inhabit the cities and villages of Liberl are also lavished upon the same treatment, with almost all the NPCs having unique names and distinct personalities, down to even the airship crew and shop owners. And given that all of the NPC dialogue changes after each segment of the main story, you'll also be able to follow the little happenings in their daily lives. Yes that's right---most NPCs in the game have their own mini-storylines, a few which will tie into your Bracer Guild sidequests, but most which are just their to simply add life to the world. My favourite of these even spans multiple regions and games, involving the grandma of Rinon, your Rolent General Store owner, who wants to find a wife for her son. She eventually gives up on Rolent and travels to Grancel at the end of FC, to no success. On the airship back though, she meets Kitty, a tea seller girl from Edel Department store, who is on the way to Bose, and gets along quite well with her (while her sister rejoices at being able to take over as #1 tea seller). Well, thanks to the airships being grounded, Kitty ends up working at the store in Rolent, and Rinon while suspicious of his grandma, can't help but admire the girl's enthusiasm and hard work. Later, in Chapter 8 the wedding of a couple (whose story began in FC, and whose ring you retrieve on a sidequest in Chapter 4) takes place, and well, no points for guessing who catches the bridal bouquet. To anyone who loves a sprawling world with many secrets and lifelike characters, I can't recommend Trails in the Sky more.			"

												I usually dont do reviews, but ill do for this one. I've played contless games and rpg's especially and i find this game story to be one of the best. Despite it might look ""childish"" etc, it's really well designed from start to very end, with ridiciously attention to every detail going in game. There is no ""side missions"" or ""quests"". Whole game is one big story.Somehow it strikes more like a book, rather than a game. I had this feeling only few times probably, it's really close to the planescape torment story level in my opinion. Even so, some fights are interesting and even challenging. I finished a game on hard difficulty, would probably do at nightmare, but prologue has ridiciolus last boss so i decided to play hard. Most fights with enforces are really cool, especially with number II. It might have disbalance in battle design, like Zane being absolutely the best with his crafts and Kevin is actually super handy when you going to fights with enforcers, i kinda couldnt change Zane and Kevin since they are amazingly good thought i wanted to see some different interactions :) Also one of really good sides of this game - despite it being jrpg it doesnt force you to grind anything, level your teammates is really easy if you need to bring them on. After playing ""tales of zesteria"" which has very good combat system but really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, and forcing you to grind equipment with it stupid system ( on highest difficulty levels ).I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who look for deep story with unexpecting twists and lovely ending.Really looking forward for more ""Legend of heroes"" series on PC.And yes, you definetelly want to start from original game.

												A great follow up for the first game. This game not only met my expectations, it exceeded them. The turn based battle mechanics are easy to follow and understand, the game is rather well balanced(normal/hard difficulty), and the story is just great. I can guarantee you that once you start to play it, you will find it very hard to stop playing it. The game has crashed maybe once or twice in my two playthroughs, and there's little to no bugs. Every playthrough lasts for around 50-80hours. Trust me, you will not regret spending those time on this game. 1000 hours of game time speaks for itself.GET THIS GAME.  NOW.			"

												If you're a fan of the series (or just of JRPGs in general), then The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky SC will offer you an intense Story sequel.I've played the first Trails in the Sky and was easily hooked up for straight 50 Hours and completed the Game to 100%. I Guess i will not do it on SC, but that doesn't mean its bad in any Case.Wonderful Soundtrack, Smooth Controlls, a bit lag spikes sometimes but not Gamebreaking for me and omg...

												So before I actually give my opinion on this game, it took me over 120 hours to beat it (and I was playing it on only hard difficulty - also my first try) with almost over 200 save datas of trying hard not to mess up and experiencing mostly failure throughout my time playing the game I finally beaten it! And I must admit; my expectations are overwhelmingly met. Now onto the review:  The story started as the previous game ended, the levels on characters remained untouched (or rather were modified) and the plot expanded from the epilogue, the gameplay remained the same(with slight adjustments with craft moves, orbments/orbment arts, monster variety, etc.) which most people would think that it's bad, but it's actually in the spirit of the game, anything changed apart from mentioned would make the game seem out of bounds in my opinion.You play in the same area (Liberl Kingdom) but there are a lot more areas to explore now, you meet new friends & enemies and as I stated previously; I was highly rewarded upon progressing (sooner beating) the game, especially since it took me that long to beat it, I honestly can't wait for the other chapters to be announced on steam because I don't play through an emulator I rather support the company and buy the content so they will surely make more of it.If you played the first game this is your next stop, this game will deeply fulfill you in any way/shape/or form, now... Time to play the 2 games again and relive a happy experience!			"

												Second Chapter follows the story directly where Trails in the Sky First Chapter ended. The game goes on a much grander scale in both story and battles, and does it well. You're expected to have have played First Chapter in many places and are rewarded for remembering small details.Like the first game SC has a bit of a slow start as it builds the world and backstory but really picks up and gets crazy later on.There's some small changes to the combat system with 'chain crafts', new spells and crafts but it's still very much the same. It's sort of like a grid-based strategy RPG battle system but simplified. However there is a lot of customizability to your characters and party and many ways to approach each battle. For environments the dungeon design is good and varied, especially later on.Unlike a lot of JRPGs there is almost no reason to grind enemies for experience. The experience gained from battles scales massively with your level so if you bring an underleveled character to a boss it might actually gain enough XP to go above the others.A big part of what made FC great for me was that the characters had a lot of personality and the dialogue was well written. In SC a lot of characters remain effectively the same and there aren't a ton of new ones you learn to know. But especially Estelle and Joshua have a lot of character growth as you might expect. At the same time you certainly get a lot of backstory on everyone as the story progresses.The music throughout the game is superb. Especially in the final areas of the game I was really awed by this. In my opinion it's a big part of what makes the game so good, as it's effectively switched around to set the mood.In general the game builds on all of the things I liked about the first chapter. As for a few (mostly minor) dislikes:I expected Second Chapter to be darker toned than the first. The 'secret society' tends to follow anime tropes and hide behind mystery rather than truly seem evil or do horrible things (with some exceptions). This is a matter of taste of course. I sort of preferred the political plotting of the first game and how the society appeared very sinister there. Speaking of anime tropes, the 'saved at the last second' thing is used so many times in SC that it gets pretty silly.I think the game could've had a little less of the same kind of content as First Chapter. Things like fetch quests walking around Liberl to progress the story. A playthrough of SC can easily take 70 hours. I wouldn't have minded it being some hours shorter and having less of the same from FC.In a way because of recycling many areas SC obsoletes FC content wise, which isn't necessarily a good thing. They're two halves of the same story, and the first half should still be fun to revisit after playing SC.The battle system is fun, but like First Chapter normal difficulty doesn't have many challenging encounters if you use all the tools at your disposal. While it's easy to make your own challenges by setting limitations you can't be expected to know which ones work well on your first playthrough.This is personal preference but being able to mindlessly beat certain bosses by repeating the same strategy draws me out of the story, so better difficulty options could make it more fun. Hard and Nightmare difficulty don't appear balanced without a New Game+ save file. Most people seem to agree that the final prologue boss is impossible to beat without getting a lucky pattern when starting a new save. Difficulties apart from normal were unlocked after beating the game once in the PSP version so it's not intentional but still unfortunate.Just like in First Chapter all animations in battles are still unskippable and watching them makes up a lot of time in a playthrough. I didn't mind the slow pace caused by this because the game is so good overall. But I'm sure it could get annoying, especially on repeat playthroughs.In short, if you enjoyed the first chapter this is a must buy. It's a bigger game that expands on the world and directly continues the same story bringing it to a satisfying end. The game is well paced without much filler and has an impressive endgame. The combat system is fun and tactical but on normal difficulty will not be particularly challenging for veterans of the first game. A great soundtrack brings the story and combat together nicely.For people new to the series I would still recommend starting with First Chapter, since SC assumes you remember what happens there without recapping it.

												This is the kind of game I wish I could have played as a kid, though if I did it likely would have spoiled most other JRPGs for me. World building and character development is second to none. The myriad insane ways it pays off the various threads set up in the first game are ambitious, risky, subversive, and most importantly, all pulled off without a hitch.Buying this on all 3 store fronts, I can't wait for more from this world.

												The second chapter of one of the greatest, and most underappreciated RPGs of its time. Had this game come out in the US during the RPG boom of the early-mid 2000s, it would be talked about in the same breath as games like Lunar, Grandia, Tales and the like. Sadly the game isn't as well known as it should be. If you like great characters, a fun old school plot, great turn based JRPG gameplay and the polish and worldbulding that Falcom is known for, then BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												I have been waiting on this patiently.  Painfully reading the XSEED forums for any nugget of information on SC.  I am so happy that its finally here and it does not dissapoint.  Story, gameplay, Graphics, Value.  It's all here.  Support Xseed and let's get 3C here as well.  Bravo Xseed, bravo.  AS GOOD AS IT GETS.			"

												The sun, against its will, can dispel shadows cast by the staff—when the staff disappears with its light, what becomes of these shadows? Trails in the Sky Second Chapter completes this metaphor absolutely. Trails in the Sky 3rd, a bridge installment in the series, answers lingering questions for details/characters from FC and SC, but the most important conflicts and holes resolve by the end of SC, a massive Japanese adventure wargame. It's no coincidence that, going by interpretations of the Japanese name for this franchise (""Kiseki""), Trails in the Sky also means Miracle in the Sky. Falcom, back in the mid-2000s when they were juggling games like Ys Origin, Gurumin, and Xanadu Next within a tight schedule, released SC to finish a JRPG epic of local scale, one they needed to make when FC proved too little. XSEED's localization of this game, meanwhile,  approaches the miraculous, augmenting it with PC-exclusive improvements even long-time Kiseki fans in East Asia have been wanting. The only caution I must offer to series neophytes: try playing through FC before tackling SC (at worst you can read/watch an LP for the story). Much of SC's hidden story depth depends on you making connections with events and characters revealed in the prequel, and playing FC makes the process of learning all this more satisfying.I'll be direct about SC's flaws: accessibility + quality-of-life features are in limited supply, and new, non-East Asian players accustomed to refined menu systems could have a rough time playing SC (and FC to a lesser extent). Sara, the programmer for the Steam/GOG PC version, did a great job making SC's launch smoother compared with FC's, but perhaps it would have taken much too long to fix how you switch playable characters' equipment when in Camp mode. At every point in SC where you have too many characters to fit into your 4-member battle set-up, you need to manually reset party formation just so you can access non-party-mandatory characters' items and Orbments (personal instruments needed for casting magic/having stat bonuses during battle). This becomes tedious later on when your full party reaches 10 members and beyond. Falcom could have let you switch between every character instantaneously when at HQ areas! Then comparing equipment between characters and specializing your immediate party would be easier and faster, something that feels protracted in the final chapter but also earlier. I'll say the same for SC not giving you an Orbment Quartz to increase your in-game running speed. The reasons Falcom gives in-game for you not having fast travel are fine, but not providing a means of fast-ish travel when you want it is disappointing. Also, few if any of the in-game animations can be skipped, which drags out playtime more than necessary.The writing style in this game is predominantly like that of a play, where telling, not showing per se, is critical. I personally love the dialogue in FC and SC, as there's plenty of nuance to conversations and internal monologue for main characters. But more than a few characters wait around during the story for the right time and place to reveal more about themselves, which can seem evasive on the scenario writers' part. The gambit here is that Liberl is so multi-faceted that much of the kingdom and its characters needs description, then mystery. At no point did I ever LOL at the story Falcom's written here—I laughed with it for most of my playthrough, rarely feeling coddled. Other JRPGs would handle MCs and non-player characters like Joshua and Mirano in a ham-fisted manner. The level of emotional contrast and development of character relationships in SC is complex, yet never for complexity's sake. When death finally comes, it's only after you've gotten to know these characters so well, almost as if you were there in person alongside Estelle. All the while comedy in Trails in the Sky has both levity that stands out and implications of despair, landmines which bomb you into thinking deeply about what you've read. Those expecting darkness akin to stories like Berserk or Watchmen aren't going to find that here, but SC, within its trope and genre confines, runs a roller-coaster spectrum of introspection and plot twists bound to entertain and affirm its central theme of mutual redemption under powerful skies.Dungeons in this game aren't strong, though I can't say they're awful. Chapter 7 illustrates this by having a few new dungeons, half of which smartly adapt their region's characteristics into cool areas to explore, the other half being easy dull corridors. What is clever, though, is the final chapter remixing FC's last dungeon's concept, and that's not the only standout. There's generally a sense of history to dungeons both old and new in this game, which is essential.SC isn't a hard game, though unlike FC it's not easy-ish. Having a battle system where you can view, then manipulate turn order using stat buffs/de-buffs, the Move command, and effects like Faint and AT Delay makes for dynamic fights even against mob enemies in dungeons and on the overworld. There's more than a few challenging monsters to exterminate as a member of the Bracer Guild, and many ways you can beat the game using different party members. On top of the non-linearity found here, you're still a licensed vigilante after everything that happened in FC, so fulfilling side-quests is a helpful duty. You're encouraged to get as many Bracer Points in each chapter so you can earn items from the Guild, and the side-quests in this game are genuinely fun, developing many NPCs in detail other genre examples reserve only for plot-relevant individuals. Such a mix of battling mobs in new areas, doing exterminations for the Guild, fighting off members of the Society and their peons, and ultimately making a huge difference in the lives of Liberl's citizens helps you embody the game's heroes and their struggles. Chapter 8 has all of the above, in fact, yet still manages to avoid being formulaic due to things I cannot spoil. Formulas definitely persist throughout SC, particularly the monster-of-the-week plot structure defining the chapters between the prologue and your return to the Bose region—I don't think being a little predictable in that sense hurts SC, making but a mere nick.Those ragging on graphics might be ignoring Falcom's great art-style and world design here; same goes for elevating SC's music at FC's expense when both clearly play to strengths needed for their stories. SC's OST introduces many new context themes for cinema scenes, dialogues, and boss fights which heighten the adrenaline and gravity of so many plot and exploration sequences. Once again the series leitmotifs are in play, constantly renewing in the face of complacency just like the dramatis personae. I won't hesitate to proclaim the game's score as era-defining for the developers, though Ys Origin's music is more familiar over here. The graphics have aged, especially whenever you visits areas where backgrounds are large 2D backdrops meant to evoke space without crushing (presumably) under-powered PCs Japanese players used in 2006, but the Tetracyclic Towers and other places still impress. Monster designs here are underrated, ranging from benign to alien often even in earlier parts of the game; Art and Craft animations, though slow (and which can't be skipped, argh), are superb to watch, especially when you've just decimated an entire battle's worth of foes. Bugs aside, the optimized performance and engine scaling means anyone can enjoy SC the way they wish on most PCs, even toasters. Falcom, using their limited resources, did their best to invest reused content from FC with new dungeons/areas and even a few dramatic changes to centers like Rolent and Grancel. You'll be investigating every nook and cranny of Liberl in SC, such that each vista's implanted in memory.SC is honest, reverent Japanese-made video gaming, deserving its place in the limelight.			"

												Ok....maybe I should actually write a serious review for a game for once...maybe...nope. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter is a turn based strategy JRPG set in Liberl Kingdom, a smaller country in Zemuria (the continent that the Trails franchise is set in). SC is the second game of the series set in Liberl, so play the First Chapter first. You play as Estelle (yes, a female protagonist, and most definitely best one I have ever seen) just like in FC.This game paints one of the most developed fantasy worlds ever. Unique geopolitcs, history, resource production areas, pop culture, underground groups, etc all bundled into one game.The character interaction is stellar. I love watching the characters go through their struggles together, and learn from their interactions with one another. The NPCs all have their own story. They don't seem like just NPCs, but people that actually have a life and don't rely on the player characters so much to do everything. They travel around and react to different situations in the game. The villians have their own reasons to be the villian and not just ""because lel""In other words, people actually act like people instead of random anime tropes.The gameplay is pretty good. The battle screen uses a grid based system, where positioning matters. Staying close together increases your chances of taking AOE damage, but makes healing and buffing easier. The orbment system allows you to customize what your characters do... especially people like Estelle who have balanced orbment slot setup. Art casters (magic casters) became more balanced vs taking physical attackers than in FC, which were generally less powerful than art casters. Sidequests don't seem repetitive (except a very certain thief), and can range from monster hunting to helping a guy impress a girl by keeping sober while drinking lots of alcohol... (don't ask.) The most important part of the sidequests is not the content, but that the sidequests actually develop the characters, the people who gave the quest, and the world around them, instead of silly fetch quests and ""Save my family!""The music brings it all together. Falcom Sound Team jdk really does do an amazing job at creating music that fits into the themes and feeling of what is going on. And of course, we can't forget the localization team that brought this game to the West. Hats off to XSEED for pushing through a project that was cursed by Murphy's Law, and delivering an amazing localization.Buy this game right now. It is absolutely worth it at $30. The game will probably take 80-120 hours depending on how much extra stuff you do and difficulty level. Even then, replayability level is very high as you can go back and find the all the little hints that led up to the end, and man, Nightmare mode in this game is pretty difficult, so it's a fun challenge.

												With the cliffhanger FC left off on, it goes without saying that SC has a lot to say in the terms of story and characters. To say SC is a lengthy game, is a bit of an understatement. SC's average run will probably be around 70-80 hours give or take. What SC excels in is building upon the first titles gameplay in pretty much every sense. Party management, character skills, and it's turn based combat have all had tweaks and updates in SC. It's as addictive and enjoyable as ever, with the added bulk of choosing from a bigger selection of part members as the game goes on.However, Some of the games story elements leave me a bit impartial to it when compared to FC. I don't exactly agree with the games pacing either, which gives a prologue/tutorial that overstays it's welcome for returning players.Once the game builds up it becomes appearent that most of the game is running across FC's world in an opposing direction with additions of previously sealed off areas, this could be a turn off for some, but I managed to enjoy it regardless. In short: It's a good lengthy follow-up to FC, I'll just be the odd one out in saying I enjoyed FC more.			"

												Combined with the previous chapter, this is one of the absolute best games I've ever played. Gorgeous soundtrack, an aesthetic that has resisted aging, and a plotline that stays engaging throughout, along with a basically grind-free gameplay arc and some really interesting mechanics - these things are all well and good, but it's the writing (and localisation!) that take the crown. For a jRPG villain to monologue usually means switching off your brain for five minutes while they babble some incoherent Babby's First Negative Utilitarianism half-baked philosophy, and conversely the heroes' response is typically pretty vacuous as well. Not so here, to say the least. And in every scene, there'll be some character saying something that's just *phrased right*, in some hard to define way, and it makes you smile or laugh or cry along with them. This game takes the jRPG genre's flaws - edgy protagonists with dark pasts, settings that seem confused about whether to be sci-fi or fantasy, daft plotlines that take forever to get anywhere - and doesn't so much refute them as forgive them, accepting that they're going to do those things and then showing how they can be done right and more than right. Given that this is also in a sense a large part of what happens in-game, I think it's safe to call this one of the great reconstructions. It's not often you see a game this good. Play this series.

												200 hours later and I feel that I have to review this game.In general, I enjoy stories with crazy twists and things going to places where I do not expect. Case in point: Novels like 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors and Danganronpa 2, while they're not JRPG's definitely fulfill the crazy story criteria, and I love them.Every now and then, I enjoy indulging in some generic ""tropey"" storytelling, as long as the execution is interesting enough for me to care. This is Trails in the Sky. This is also the moment that I'm telling you to start with the first game in case you're interested, simply because First Chapter and Second Chapter are one story, the Estelle & Joshua arc. Also, in case you played the first game and you didn't liked the story, you shouldn't really bother with the second. Contrary to the fans' belief, while the story does get better it doesn't get less generic and tropey, so if those points were your turn-off for the first game they will be your turn-off for the second one too.Gameplay-wise here's what you'll expect: Turn-based combat, a magic system kinda similar to how FF7 materia work (you link Quartz together to use spells and you slot them in a certain way on an Orbment - the device where you place Quartz on - to use spells you couldn't use before), no random encounters but you can see the enemy roaming and choose to approach from behind (preemptive attack) or avoid him altogether, grinding is possible but really unecessary and discouraged. The game is OK challenging in normal mode, hard as steel in Hard mode and ""you gotta be batshit insane to play this"" in Nightmare (it's what I'm currently doing). Although I already mentioned story elements, it's worth noting that the game is text-heavy. I mean REALLY text-heavy. Here's a picture[i.imgur.com] to understand. Now, I'm not saying that more means that you'll like it. I'm saying that reading dialogues in JRPG games shouldn't be an issue for you.Last, but not least, the music. Fans complained that the first chapter lacked in the music department, which I have to agree given the kind of soundtrack people in Falcom are capable of composing. And oh they did, the absolute madmen.All in all, a solid game if you don't mind generic stories (I don't believe that generic is inherently bad but that's just me) and turn-based combat, coupled with ""Falcom-tier"" soundtrack. I'm giving it 2 thumbs up because I got exactly what I expected and 200 hours and 2 playthroughs later I'm still enjoying it.Trails in the Sky the 3rd is scheduled to be released in the West for the first time around spring 2017. Just adding that up. Also, the games ""Trails of Cold Steel"" that are currently available for Playstation 3 and Vita are part of the same saga, but the stories aren't related.			"

												Trails in the sky second chapter is one of the best JRPGs that I ever had the chance to play. I recommend this game to every JRPG fan....unless you REALLY hate text. This game has a lot of dialogues, it always flow exceptionally well but If you don't like text, go see some gameplay footage before buying the game. The dialogues are always good to read, they're never meaningless and are very well written. They make you laugh and sometimes you feel the need to shed a tear. This game focus heavily on story and character development but even if you're not interested in theses you may find Trails in the sky sc to be one of your favorite games thanks to it's gameplay. I think the trails's series gameplay is awesome. This game use the same battle system than the first chapter and makes it even better. The heavier emphasis on crafts (rather than arts) makes regular battles faster. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Trails in the sky's battle system, it's a turn by turn battle system that takes place on a field in which you can move your characters. You have to consider both you positioning and the time bar that indicates when comes your turn to succeed. It's a solid system that requires the use of careful planning. Don't worry tough, the game's difficulty is well balanced and if you found it too hard or too easy, you can always change the game's difficulty settings. I recommend anyone who haven't played the first game to play it before playing this one as sc's story begin the day after fc's ending. I won't spoil the first game just in case. I don't think anyone ever disliked Trails in the sky's story. It is at worst good. I personally think the story is amazing. Far better than theses confusing and complicated stories that makes no sense. If you're expecting a revolutionary story, you're at the wrong place. Trails in the sky's story is simple yet excellent and it's better that way. The game have some really good plot twists and the way the story is presented to you makes it even better. If you're a fan of good stories, this is a must have and I'm sure the story will please you and you'll end up thinking like me that this story could only be surpassed by the trails games to come.Story and gameplay are top-notch but sometimes, you need you take a break from all that non-stop greatness. It's at theses time that you can fish, take a look at the casino or take on some sides quests and there are a LOT of side quests. If you're tired of side quests, you can read the in-game news or read an in-game novel. Yes there are in-game novels and they are very good. What you'd expect from Trails in the sky. There are three sets of books in sc (don't forget to check out the embassies). One of theses sets is only obtainable by talking to npcs. What!! Talking to npcs? That's boring! may be what you're thinking right now but worry not. Talking to npcs IS fun in this game. They each have their own stories. Not always relevant to the main plot and the writing in this game make dialogues flow very well. This game should serve as a model for JRPGs to come. Hopefully, it will sell well and the future installments will be localized. There is one thing that I forgot to mention higher and this may be what will make you like the game the most, The soundtrack. It's a Falcom game! Do I need to say anymore? In case I do, In my opinion, this game has one of the best soundtracks ever created. I particularly like fateful confrontation and silver will which sound greater than ever when they play in-game. This game is a masterpiece that will keep you occupied for at least 60 hours and there's a new game plus option. In case you were wondering about replayability. You can choose between numerous characters to make a party of four. Each of them having different dialogue. You also have a choice to make early on between two characters that will accompany you during half the game.    If you haven't played the first game, I urge you to go play it. If you have played the first game and still aren't sure whether or not to buy this one then you should know that this game practically take everything FC did and makes it better. If you liked this game than you should try to play the other game of the series At the date I'm writing this, the only games available to us non-Japanese speakers are The Trails in the sky duology(Yes, I did say duology. The 3rd chapter is more like a bridge to future games and isn't needed to finish the trails in the sky duology). The cold steel games which are part of the same series should come out soon  (2015 for cold steel 1 and 2016 for cold steel 2).			"

												Very nice continuation of the First Chapter; do NOT play this game until you've finished The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. You will be hopelessly lost without prior knowledge of characters and locations from the first game, and wiki summaries are simply not enough to bridge the gap.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (or Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki SC in weebspeak) is quite simply one of the best games I've ever been sucked into. It's not perfect, but it comes close in pretty much every area.The gameplay is as refreshing as ever; the battles are still on a tactical grid, where you and your enemies take turns to attack each other (and depending on how fast you are, you can potentially take multiple turns before your opponent even moves your way). However, there were several features added to the Trails in the Sky battle system. The addition of combo crafts, where you and your whole party can gang up and wreak havoc on enemies is a fun feature, though outclassed towards the end of the game. New spells are also available for use; if you detested Lt. Lorence spamming Silver Thorn on your♥♥♥♥♥ you can now do the same to those annoying monsters blocking your path, among other great spells.The overworld has a few minigames to help melt the time away, such as a casino and fishing. Fishing's especially something to note, since there's an achievement tied to it, if that's your thing.Additionally, XSEED's even taken some PSP-exclusive content and backported it to the PC version. One of those features won't be seen until the end of the game, but it's worth the wait.However, the overall story lacks a bit, especially when compared to FC's gradual but well-tempered buildup. Excluding the Prologue, every chapter from Chapter 1 up to and including Chapter 5 is rather formulaic in nature; strange happenings in a province lead to Estelle and friends investigating them, only to find out that an Ouroboros Enforcer is behind it all. The game picks up pace during Chapters 6 and 7, but leaves you at a pretty bad drop during Chapter 8 (which I can honestly say was my least favorite chapter in all the Trails games I've played, gameplay-wise). The Final Chapter more than makes up for the tedium of Chapter 8, however, and wraps up Estelle and Joshua's story very cleanly.Speaking of which, the characters and dialogue in SC are top notch; while the plot may be  predictable at times, the characters more than make up for the lacking moments. Party members receive actual character development, and characters you may have despised in FC have a chance at redemption; Agate comes to mind easily. Additionally, new characters enter the fray, and they're just as good as the established characters; Kevin Graham, for one, is absolutely phenomenal in all the right ways.Again, the dialogue flows naturally, and outside of one very, very small encounter in Zeiss, I couldn't help but eagerly read every line of dialogue that popped up. Even NPCs are relatively lively, which you might not expect from JRPGs; I've seen others where town NPCs get a single flavor line at best.Lastly, the quality of the game is just perfect; I haven't encountered any technical issues at all, despite the somewhat troubled localization process. It even works quite well using Wine and/or WineSkin, if you're using Linux or OSX. Here's to Trails in the Sky the 3rd, Trails of Cold Steel II, and hopefully Zero/Ao no Kiseki!			"

												What a game. Really. By that I mean two games, because theres FC (First Chapter) and SC (Second Chapter). Both monsters of games in their own right. I spent around 50 hours on both, to total about 100 hours. I can't say I enjoyed every moment. The game is paced pretty slow and the combat isn't very in-depth. But nonethless I played to the end of both. FC made me want to keep going the whole way through, while SC you see the old dungeons revisited and repurposed. In the end I ended up being WAY too overleveled and skipped through most of the fights (which actually speeds up the game, which is nice). But still the story in SC takes a long time to really pick up steam. At about half way into SC I wanted to just finish. Once I got to the ending sequence of events (last 2-3 chapters) though, I didn't want to stop playing. The story ended fantastically and really makes the whole journey worth it.Suggest you pick it up if: you like JRPGs, you are dedicated to a good story, and like turn-based combat.			"

												Trails in the Sky SC is the second chapter in the series.The game starts off right where the first left off.  Exactly where it left off.  Estelle has been dumped and she is confused and refuses to believe it.While searching for her lost friend she will again meet many new people and some old favorites.The attention to detail in this game is apparent.  Very few glitches in the launch version.  Maybe the odd text glitch like a missing space here and there.  No big deal really.  If you loved the first game, you will love this game too.  It's basically the same style dungeons and combat.  Combat has slightly evolved in that now you can chain combos together which gives a nice option for those time when you need to hit a few enemies, do burst damage, or just manipulate the turn order to line yourself up for a critical hit.Even the opening ""Training"" dungeon is quite large and the early bosses can be somewhat challenging.  So you will really feel like your resuming a grand adventure rather than starting a new one.I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed the first game.  It's well worth the price.  You won't regret it, I promise.			"

The story is just sooo good... it's too good that i can't wait for the third chapter to get released.the other reason to buy the game is you'll be pushing the localization for the third chapter of the game. if you're not gonna buy now, there's a small possibility the localization will get delayed and possibily cancelled... and unless you can understand japanese, it'll be one of those game that you'll never get to know the ending..... so cmon buy the bloody game			"

												Before anything else, I cleared the game in around 50 hours (a bit rushed) but did so offline. That should explain my playtimeThis game is what I call a proper sequel, it jumps straight to where the last game ended and spares no second to throw you in it's plot. You visit the same places and talk to the same people, however, the circumstances are different. The game gives off the feeling of continuity that a lot of sequels fail to live up to, an environment that progresses along with the player.Having just recently finished LoH♥♥♥♥♥♥FC, the intro of SC was gratifying for me in the sense that I immediately get to jump to exactly where I left off, no vague introductions, direct to the point I've been craving for. After the rush of familiarity settles, you quickly become oriented to the world that you've already explored. You're confident that you know every nook and canny, you're ready to sprint and blaze through the game...but not so fast Mr. Sonic the Hedgehog. Although the map is still technically the same, the quests will push you in places that were inaccessible before. This gives the Liberl the aura of authentic reality, just because you can't go somewhere doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's a world that you happened to explore not a world that happened because you're exploring it.Plot-wise, a lot foreshadowing pays off and more of those questions are answered although not all. This game may fall short in novelty in terms of the ""first time"" adventure experience (since you've already been here) but it doubles your vision, letting you see the bigger picture as your role increases in relevance to the events you couldn't affect before, hence giving you the satisfaction from all your hard work in the previous title.The battles are harder but you and your friends are stronger. Having more skills, orbment patterns, and party members really gives you the creative freedom to develop your own fighting style. Thanks to these upgrades, you can try multiple ""builds"" to tackle bosses using your own personal style. It also gives you more reason to leave no chest unturned and no monster unslayed. Characters are as lovable as ever, though not all get the equal amount of spotlight they had during the FC, but they don't fade into the background either. Your choices on whom your party is made up of greatly affects the important and minor dialogues, this really increases the game's replay value as well as giving the player a personal touch on how to influence the flow of the story. You can really explore each character's personality in-depth in this game compared to FC. Their uniqueness really shines as their responses to different situations vary greatly (depending on who's on your party) PLUS, they don't just randomly speak up they actually interact with the rest of your party which leads to some of the funniest moments in RPG I've ever witnessed, all the more reason to replay and mix up your party.The game feels faster than the first for me, maybe because of the sense of urgency in the plot that doesn't give a lot of room to breathe, but don't let that fool you, though there may be less ""official"" grace periods, you still have plenty of time to finish every quest and simply explore the world. Personally I was just so engulfed by the story that I really felt it was a rush against time and blazed my way through the game because I wanted a happy resolution ASAP. Eagerly looking forward for my replay as I'll surely take it slow next time around. I hope XSEED works on the Third Chapter, having things end here might just give me blue-rpg-balls.If you need any more opinions about the game, just ask the NPCS, I'm sure they'll give you a piece of their individual minds.

												This is by far the best JRPG I've played in recent years. Trails in the Sky FC was pretty much the appetizer of the trilogy, but here is the real meat of the story. The game starts right after that heartbreaking cliffhanger from the first game, so obviously it's absolutely required you play FC before SC, otherwise nothing will make sense to you.I think Trails in the Sky SC's biggest strength is definitely the writing. It's a surprisingly well thoughtout world, richly developed and lovable cast of characters, and memorable story that will reward you with a satisfying JRPG experience. I would even go as far as saying it's better than any of the Final Fantasy or Tales of franchise I played. Although the characters are pretty much your standard anime or Japanese game character archetypes, each one is fleshed out and executed well. The interactions between characters are gold, especially anything involving Estelle and Oliver since they add comedic value. While I can't say much about SC's storyline due to avoiding spoilers, if you thought FC's story was great, well you're in for one hell of a ride. FC took me around 20 hours to beat, SC took me 60 hours. Just let that sink in. Yes, the story has a few extra layers added but it's not overly complicated as long as you pay attention.The gameplay is the same as FC but with some improvements to the turn based battle system. I really liked the addition of chained special attacks which let's you use multiple characters attack at once. More artes have been added and crafts upgraded for stronger effects. Other than that, just expect FC's gameplay.I would describe the visual to be modernized retro style graphics you see in playstation rpg games, except a lot sharper. You can tell the production values just by looking at it and the presentation. Let's not forget the wonderful soundtrack. It adds a perfect level of immersiveness invoking a spectrum of emotions on certain scenes of events.Lastly, I really have to give props to XSEED for their amazing efforts in localizing SC. They released the game not out of business/profit priority, but labor of love. And double props to them for announcing the final game of the trilogy that's currently in the works. While SC can be seen as the finale story, there are some loose ends that will be resolved in the 3rd chapter (I hope). So once the 3rd chapter is up for pre-order, I'll immediately snatch that up paying full price showing my support just like how I did with FC and SC. Thank you XSEED for letting me experience such a magnificent game. Normally, I don't replay JRPGs as much, but this is worth going through the 2nd time. Overall, Trails in the Sky SC gets my highest recommendation for any RPG players out there.			"

												Super underrated JRPG series.Definitely one of the better series of the last 5 years when it comes to delivering a well told story with great characters to fall in love with. It's all the more impressive considering all the groundwork laid 10 years ago when you play your way through the latter games in the series. Musing about most of the recent JRPG releases for me personally this probably just about comes a little behind Persona 5. "

												Short version of the review:  If you hate JRPGs, slow-paced JRPGs or non-action games, play something else.  Otherwise, if you can get past a bit of rust you can enjoy a very well explored, lengthy setting with good customization and competent combat that has related titles still releasing as of 2016.  There isn't much in the genre that can compete with this series in terms of scope, interconnectivity and character development.  This game also taught me that force-feeding your angriest friend tomato sandwiches will allow them to kill anything.Long version of the review: This recommendation comes with a few caveats: First, play the first chapter first.  If you didn't make it through that, you definitely won't make it through this.  In a more general sense for the series, Trails in the Sky is a very long trilogy with a sort of plodding pace to it and antiquated system- if you even have to ask if that's your thing, it probably isn't.  This is a game that nearly made the localizer nearly kill himself, it's got more text than more books and if you want to do more than scratch the surface you can expect a playtime approaching mine.SC continues on almost exactly where the first chapter left off- both plotwise and mechanics-wise.  They quickly update you on what's changed in what is actually one of the more cut-throat tutorials I've ever seen.  I don't recommend starting on hard like I did, and I strongly urge no one to start on nightmare- you will be stuck a long while grinding and possibly crying in the prologue if you do.The game eventually expands into a partially de-lineated JRPG wherein the sidequests and talking multiple times to everyone is the focus.  Completing the sidequests is for the most part worth your time, as it gives much needed money and equips which random encounters do not provide, a great deal of dialogue and sometimes insight into the setting.  Some of the objectives to maximize quest rewards are pretty obtuse, and even missing talking to a single person between important plot points can be a serious frustration.Trails in the sky is fairly well seperated into ten chapters with either a different focus on geographical location or situation.  While there is a lot of re-used assets from the first game, part of the appeal is the familiarity mixed with some of the new stuff, and continuing relationships with the characters your character strives to protect.  Given the sheer volume of quests, lack of auto-travel and length of the game, however, you may be inspired to take breaks.  I certainly did.The combat in this game was fairly novel for its time way back in 2003, but runs into limitations when being pushed.  Eschewing turn-based combat for delay-based actions makes speed and numbers relevant, but also hyper-relevant.  When the game robs you of party members or ambushes you or surrounds you, your options are very limited and generally you're going to be relying on luck.  While this can be nice and tense and result in memorable fights, once you get down a character or two you're probably just waiting to die.  On the harder difficulties, cheese is kind of mandatory, especially since grinding isn't really an option.  There's a bit of depth in how one, say, spams the equivlent of limit breaks known as S-Crafts, since they generate a lot of delay, but once your game plan is set you generally stick to it.Orbments (Basically a fancy magic pocketwatch with replaceable magic stones), equipment and character selection do allow for some interesting customization, but a lot of the more interesting options are only provided if you keep up religiously with sidequests.  Towards the end of the game however, it's easy to realize that most of the gems fall into certain colours and that due to the action economy there's a few must-haves for act time that you can't really live without that your options almost become more limited.  Customization is also fraught with complications like leaving your good gems with characters that leave temporarily or just the fact that you can't unequip everyone at once (or equip them if you get them during a cutscene/fight).  Being able to save anywhere and the sheer number of slots available help alleviate this, however.The closest thing to a crafting component to the game is the cooking system.  Food is obnoxiously powerful and generally much more economical than any equivelent items once you fork out an initial investment.  I personally love incongruous attack item spam in these sorts of games, so being able to defeat many early and difficult encounters by throwing stale cookies and meatballs at them was very enjoyable for me.  For a long time there are logistical concerns about what food you bring and cook, but towards the end of the game it's fairly trivial to make a few dozen tomato sandwiches and shove them down your character's gullets until everything is dead.  Even the rather terrifying optional battle was won through liberal use of tomato sandwiches with a side of cheese.On the subject of cheese, the villainous elements of the game tend to fall on the cartoonish side.  This isn't exactly strange for the genre, and it's called out by the much more well-rounded player character cast to some degree, but some of the dialogue is so flamboyant it'll make you roll your eyes around and around.  There's plenty of other goofiness and sort of misplaced levity at times, but given that the main characters are teenagers and the localization is pretty well done I'd say it's not really out of place.  There's some good dialogue, a tremendous number of characters and unique lines, consistent characterization including growth and reaction to different events over time... when you build a comparable relationship to any given airship engineer that you'd expect to build with the Yarl of Whiterun in Skyrim, you know they've got something a bit special.  It's on a level that isn't easily matched in terms of concurrent narratives that you can explore, and that's pretty rad.  It just takes a lot of time, is all.Graphics are dated but serviceable.  Lack of camera rotation and re-used tiling in certain places can be a pain, and it's part of the generation of JRPGs that loaded in long♥♥♥♥♥spells and special moves to show off that particle effects were a thing.  Very little looks outright bad or indistinct, and some of the monster animations and designs are so bizarre they manage to come off as horrifying.  The cutscenes are pretty good for their time however, and have excellent detail and fairly good length the odd time they show up.  The final cutscene in particular is very elaborate, and I appreciated how it conveyed the scope of the aftermath of the conflict.The music is incredible as always- it's Falcom.  Problems arise from the fact that the number of tracks don't really match the game length- as much as I love the combat theme, they needed a bit more variety, especially since a lot of themes are variants of ""The Whereabouts of Light"" or ""Golden eyes, Silver Will""- while I love variants and leitmotifs, more was needed.In summary, there aren't a lot of games that can match the scope of this duology and its continuation beyond simply because of breadth of content, depth of optional storylines and relationships with characters and customization options.  The tone is a bit juvenile and anime, but if you want something heartwarming and intricate it certainly has its moments.  If you wanted to sink a hundred hours plus into an old-fashioned JRPG series, I'd probably point you here first, and for that this game and its predecessor has my approval.  Looking forward to The 3rd.			"

												I have some things to say about this game, not all positive, but do keep in mind it is definitely a great RPG and a mostly-worthy followup to FC despite its faults. There might be mild spoilers in this review.I wasn't a big fan of all of the story threads this game introduced. The first game had a cunning and scary villain who puts together a grand conspiracy, and even though it doesn't give you all the answers up front it gave you enough motivation to want to stop him. In SC, there are too many bad guys and their characterization is hit and miss. They are just doing Bad Stuff that seems mostly isolated in each chapter and you have to stop them. And even when you do stop them it was just ""part of their plan"", which is a common thing on both moral sides in this game. It's really silly how many times something happens that seems like a pro for your party but turns out it was just part of the bad dude's plans, or part of Estelle's dad's plan, the game overuses this trope so hard. It also overuses the whole ""bad guy is about to [actually kill] someone but then someone shows up and saves them at the last minute"" trope. Maybe the first game had these issues as well, I don't remember being so annoyed by it. Overall the chapters are hit and miss, as are the villains, and the overarching story doesn't really come together in a very satisfying way like the first game does.What the game does have is a really great arc for most of its main characters. Estelle and Joshua shine throughout, there's some great sisterly conversations between Estelle, Kloe, and Scharz, and overall the game does a great job of giving you a lot of party members you care about. It's actually kinda disappointing you can only pick 4 of them at a time,  as the game is really good about giving your optional party members dialog and you miss out on a lot of it. That's a good problem to have, honestly, given how rote a lot of RPG party members can be. Even when the overarching narrative gets drab at times, the main characters really carry this story and ultimately make it worthwhile.The combat remains strong...though the more powerful nature of the quartz you get in SC compared to the first means that it is much easier to trivialize the combat by the end of the game. The whole experience could have been about 15 hours shorter, there's so much combat for the sake of combat towards the end. Chapter 7 has a bunch of boss battles that seem ultimately pointless (and are indeed lampshaded as such by the characters). The world of Liberl is still an amazingly detailed place to run around in, which is good because you will sure be doing a lot of backtracking in the main story. What makes the backtracking more bareable is that the game is really good about changing the NPC dialog based on stuff that has happened in the world, which makes it nice to just walk around talking to random people. Graphically the game is of course fairly primitive, but it's still very good at making each environment unique, and the final area of the game is amazing.This game doesn't make good on all of the promise of FC's amazing cliffhanger ending, but it's still a stunningly crafted RPG world with great main characters. If you've played FC I definitely recommend it.			"

												Here's another thumbs up for this amazing video game!In every possible way it's bigger and better than the already superb First Chapter. The stakes get to ridiculous heights towards the end, which I couldn't help but love. You also learn more about the previous game's characters touching pasts. The same goes for all the bosses of this game, who your party members have somekind of history with. It really is great to learn more about what the kind of persons they are who you're fighting! And realize their true motives.The combat has new added depth to it with the new Orbal Arts and 3-ranks system to it. You can give each character unique builds with those. Although certain characters do specialize in specific school of Orbs. The boss fights are really excellent, and offer great amount of challenge where your tactics and timings play important role.I gotta give extra praise for the finale chapter which is just excellent in design of its boss fights, but also adding a completely new area to explore your way through. It's optional, but learning about the history of the place through old computer terminals was something I found really cool.I dare say it's one of the best J-RPG series of all time! The cast of characters is super likeable, the story is really engaging and yeah I really can't wait for the 3rd and final chapter!			"

The amount of content you get from buying at full price is amazing!Pros- Maintains a great story- More character development - Great soundtrack - Longer game than chapter 1- More playable charactersCons - Hard to think of any.... maybe that some of the chest messages are re-used. However, the person who wrote all these messages deserves a pay rise just for having to come up with that many messages :)Overall, it is a great jrpg (Both chapter 1 and 2) that really tells a good story and makes you want to find out what will happen to the main characters.

												The Trails in the Sky duology are the best RPGs of all time. If you want to get lost in a the purest jRPG experience, then this is the game for you.  No, I am not talking about lame anime trope nonsense like tsunderes, schoolgirls, or any of that garbage. I am talking about: well-writen characters that provide fun dialogue, an insanely deep storyline that keeps you entertained all the way through, and a plot that ties between both games smoothly while wrapping up nicely. I wish I can tell you how great the stories and characters are without spoiling any of it but it's just something you have to play for yourself. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to enjoy it to the fullest. It's a masterfully crafted video game and we are blessed to have the best localization possible thanks to XSEED. Battle-wise, it's easily one of the greatest turn-based combat systems out there because of how fun your strategic options are. Position is important for optimal plays, buffing allies actually makes a difference rather than being a minor nusiance and the same goes for debuffing. And lastly, its customization option makes anyone and everyone a fun and viable character. Everyone has a place in the party, in terms of both the story and party composition. Unfortunately, the battle speed IS a bit on the slow side but that shouldn't turn you off completely. In terms of content, this is by no means a grinding game. I spent 87 hours on this game and this was all for the story, doing sidequests, and exploring every nook and cranny for all of the possible secrets in the game. All of those hours spent was pure fun and not because I was grinding my characters up, getting lost in a dungeon, or retrying difficult boss fights over and over again. But that's just me being crazy in love with this game, anyone else can beat it in probably even half the time if you really wanted to. Like I said, this is one of the best jRPGs of all time. It shares a lot of good traits as Xenoblade Chronicles so if you've played that, then you'd love the Trails duo. Please give this game a try or recommend it to a friend so we can support XSEED, Falcom, and more masterpieces like these coming over to us!			"

												I'll start off by saying that having played through the first one, this game is SOOO LONG with more than double the playtime of the original. That being said, I don't regret a single hour of this beautiful sequel.Although the gameplay hasn't significantly changed much from the original, the magic (orbment) and skills (crafts) system has been expanded upon tremendously. The original three pages of magic has been expanded to five; introducing newer strategies to the abundant amount of character choices. The new skill, chains, finds itself to be useful in some scenarios. These additions made the gameplay always refreshing, seeing that I've played more than 100 hours fighting shiny pom poms.The team system has significantly improved since the first chapter. This shouldn't be a surprise since the entire game revolves around changing teammates and parties, but first let me explain the difference. (Minor Spoilers) In the original game, two characters (Joshua and Estelle) would always be playable characters while each chapter offers two other characters that make up the rest of your party. Each chapter changed the party and thus your team strategy. The game struck a nice balance of difficulty and adaptation except for the last chapter. The chapter which allowed you to make your own team with all the characters you've met along the way wasn't very balanced. The enemy encounters grew extremely repetitive and boring, and the final boss could be described in the same manner.However, the second chapter struck a good balance while letting the player create a team themselves. Although the first chapter was pretty repetitive since your options were limited, I found difficult monsters and interesting monster attacks that kept the combat intriguing. In general, bosses were more interesting and carried a 'mood' about them. Again (minor spoilers), but the last chapter's boss fights were beyond amazing. By far the bosses and 'road monsters' are the best thing about Trails in the Sky SC's gameplay.Now a small paragraph about the OST. I read on a forum somewhere that the OST for SC was supposed to better than FC. For the majority of the game, I questioned this opinion since it reused alot of songs from the first game. But all of a sudden near the end of the game, the soundtrack dramatically improved with new songs. The credits song gave me chills. Good job music writers, although I'd appreciate if the same songs weren't used every single time in the first few chapters.Retrospectively, I should've talked about the graphics/textures of the game in the first paragraph. If you've gotten used to the graphics in Trails in the Sky FC, then this game should be no problem. Although walking through the same landscape as Trails in the Sky FC is a bit boring, some of the new landscapes introduced are beautiful and well worth it.Story and characters. Amazing. Marvelous. Hella GOOD JOB Nihon Falcom. Pretty much every character gets their back stories introduced and expanded upon. Some scenes are so fantastic that they definitely should've made a scene select option in the menu. The hidden nature of the Society and some of the plot twists make the game so much more interesting and hooks you back in the next day even after you've spent one entire day playing the game. Afterall, story and character development feels like such a lovely reward after defeating bosses with a sliver of health remaining. By far, Estelle's character development was done beautifully well. My only complaint is that you have to switch around characters in your party to obtain extra dialogue which sometimes can't be done without grinding character levels (looking at you, last area last chapter). Otherwise, the story is great if you enjoy anime stories with a touch of the shounen genre.Honestly if you enjoyed Trails in the Sky FC, then this game is a must buy. As anyone does, I EXTREMELY HIGHLY recommend playing through the first game first. This game assumes you've already played through FC, so there are many spoilers and the difficulty curve is quite steep in the beginning. If you haven't tried either, I'd recommend buying the FC on sale and testing the waters before you delve deep into this trilogy.I'm writing this review as I just finished this game and it feels great. However, I can see in the future I'll be impatient and sad waiting for the third chapter. Xseed, you better deliver the damned third chapter or I'll be coming over there with a Bo Staff.			"

												This game was worth the wait,and a beautiful one too! The first time I played FC was back in 2011 when I was in the 3rd year of junior high,today I'm sitting at the 7th semester in a university. The unique & complex storyline is what I found in this game & what makes me interested in it.They have an obsessive levels of detail about everything especially how important all the characters relationships that turned out it's all connected,it's like no one is being left out in this game! They're putting a lot of effort into this universe especially how they're able to tell the specific economies of cities & how every new technology affect the NPCs,even NPC have their own story!I guess playing Trails is like playing a novel book in a form of video game,the shocking ending in FC is what makes me patient enough to wait. May not as great as the JRPGs giant like FF,Tales, or maybe Suikoden,but Trails have something that the other great JRPGs don't have. And if you want to fulfill your nostalgia of 90's PS1 RPG,Trails in the Sky is definitely a game for you :) !			"

												Trails in the Sky SC is an outstanding continuation of the story of the first chapter and in many ways improves on almost  all aspects of its predecessor. If you've already played and liked Trails in the Sky and saw the ending, my only words for you are to do yourself a favor and do what you should already know you must do.If you're thinking about trying out Trails in the Sky games in general and you like any of the following:- oldschool JRPGs- interesting turn based battle systems- catchy and epic soundtracks- Studio Ghibli movies (some parts give off really strong Miyazaki feel)- characters who outgrow the cliches of their stereotypes, whom you grow to love  and whose plights leave you at the edge of your seat- well crafted stories that seem simple, add a lot of complexity as they go and yet never loose their focus- stories that are lighthearted most of the time but can also get surprisingly dark- love stories you want to end happily and that don't get in the way of the plot- lively fantasy worlds to explore, where even unimportant NPCs have their own personalities and little stories and sidequests...then I think you should enjoy Trails in the Sky. A lot. A lot a lot. "

												Frankly one of my favorite games in my library. A complete call back to the classic JRPGs of the mid-90s, Trails in the Sky easily belongs in the same category as Final Fantasy V, VI, and Chrono Trigger. It's got a well-detailed world, individual NPCs who almost all each have their own name (if they don't all), memorable music, fun characters, and an excellent storyline for the genre. Combat is turn-based with tiles, giving it the tactics sense where you position characters to avoid enemy attacks, and knock enemies around to maximize area attacks. If you think more JRPGs need to be on Steam, then get this game to say so.As a side note, I level grinded for maybe 20 minutes total at the end of the game, so that really is 70+ hours of just gameplay, exploration, and side quests.

												Alright, after the exceptional First Chapter which I reviewed here, the story of Estelle Bright and her adoptive brother Joshua continues from the rather iffy situation it ended with.A newly minted senior bracer, Estelle, sets of in search of Joshua who disappeared on her, thanks to his dark and shadowy past which brings her to a path that crosses a malevolent and probably quite ancient secret society Joshua used to be part of before he was taken in by Estelle's father; and the journey will be long and hard, a bit like Estelle's weapon of choice (her weapon being that way is a fact that she likes to point out whenever someone annoys her).Second Chapter takes what the first gave us and builds on it. The land of Liberl is still a living, breathing thing, and Estelle's is not the only story that unfolds. Keeping up with NPCs and their travels and experiences keeps being fun, and there are many mentions of past exploits, and if you did extremely well in the first game, a carry-over save bonus is going to be rather neat.Now, it's not wrong to say that SC is ""more of the same"" compared to FC, but that's not a bad thing, oh not at all - in fact, they were supposed to be a single game in the first place...but then the project kind of got too big to handle. Just for reference, playing through both, I put 150+ hours into it (maybe minus 5-10 thanks to reloads and distractions). Thanks to that, however, many things I would say about SC are already covered in my aforementioned review of FC. Go read that for more info.The protagonist dynamic, however, has changed. While the first game had us guide both Estelle and Joshua through a story that was bigger than themselves, this one is Estelle's show, this time it's personal, and her growth as a character is simply wonderful to follow. And yet even so, things happen on a larger scale, many other characters could be heroes of this same story if it was told from their perspective. A nice refresher from the common JRPG problem of static and homogenous world being driven purely by the actions of the protagonist - quite the opposite, a huge national crisis in the kingdom of Liberl has the population, both civilian and uniformed, act realistically (as in, there sure are *some* people who talk of doom and gloom, while others ponder more immediate practical concerns), and even an international response to the affair will occur. Estelle herself also brings a nice refresher with a protagonist that's not a cynical, brooding bishonen type with lots of emotional baggage - even managing to help snap Joshua out of it somehow.The battle system is pretty much the same as in First, arts and crafts and all; with the addition of ""chain crafts"" that lets you have several characters attack together. Limit break interrupts are still a thing, and managing the initiative order to steal turn bonuses from the enemy is still what will mean the difference between life and death (or at least ""life and a distinctly more battered and bloodied life""). Good luck beating the later bosses without a sound tactical plan.The Nihon Falcom musical team brings back some awesome tracks from FC and adds some awesome new tracks (my favorite being a certain very dynamic boss theme), but Falcom games having good music is nothing new. Even so, ""Silver Will"" must be one of the best soundtracks ever created.Final judgment: Highly recommended, but whatever you do, *don't* start playing this one before you finish the first game.PS: Oh, there's also a fishing minigame now.PPS: Sieg is one seriously overpowered bird.PPPS: Thanks to the story, I had to nominate this for ""Whoaaaaa, dude""			"

												Wahhey, Trails is back! And isn't that the truth - Trails is BACK. The atmosphere hasn't changed much from the first game, and honestly, that's a great thing to see. The characters are very lighthearted & happy go lucky, despite their being a lot of bad stuff going on. It's a refreshing break from other RPGs, where cracking so much as a smile is a rarity. Trails' approach to storytelling, combined with the quality of writing and attention to detail, put it above most JRPG franchises out there. The Bracer quests are also back, and while the ol' familiar ""X Monster needs to be eliminated"" request, there's also plenty of new & unique sidequests to go on. It's pretty amazing how varied the dozens upon dozens of quests are, but if you see one you don't like, you needn't worry about missing out on the rewards because the game is generous enough to give you what's required to get by well with just picking the ones you fancy (personally, I try to do them all).A lot of music from the original game has popped back up without so much as an alternate mix, which is somewhat disappointing, honestly. I do like the soundtrack to the original game, and while I do like the new additions made in SC, I feel the original pieces could've done with a bit of oomph to help them stand out, y'know?One thing I will say though is that you definitely want to play FC before jumping into SC. Not only will EVERYTHING make a lot more sense, but you can effortlessly carry over some of your choices & interactions from the first game into SC, which will make the experience both more personal & enjoyable.Just like FC before it, I recommend Trails in the Sky SC 110%. SC is probably the stronger entry, but the entire series deserves playing through from start to... Well, SC and beyond.Thanks to XSEED for bringing this over!			"

												Having played the Original on PSP I was relieved to hear we were getting the sequel on PC so we'd get a chance to continue the story of Estelle, Joshua, Agate, Olivier and the others.  The 2nd entry didn't disappoint!  This entry is really a coming of age story for Estelle and Co. as we follow there stories to becoming elite Bracers.  Each character is developed whole in the sequel opposed to just focusing on Estelle.  I really enjoyed this and feel like it made the Universe that much richer.  The down side to this was I felt it tripped up the pacing a bit as I feel like the 1st one flowed a bit better and didn't care much for the new character Father Kevin.  He's not bad per se but didn't really add anything of real value to the crew IMO but it looks like we'll learn more about him in the 3rd entry!If you enjoyed the 1st one I think you'll really enjoy this game as well.  As they both stand on their own feet and add value while both having great stories.  If you plan on playing this game and haven't played the 1st... I'd advise going back and playing the 1st entry before this.  It's very much a sequel and things won't make a ton of sense a lot at times if you start off cold on the 2nd entry.  Overall 9/10 experience! "

												I'll be honest this is probably my favorite game of all time. I LOVE the characters, the story is good, the gameplay is interesting I spent way too much time fiddling with my orbments and the ending is... feelsy. (I love it)The voice acting is great at the times that its there (Only in combat) but i really wish there was more.Do i think you should buy this game and its prequel?♥♥♥♥ yes! Partly because of depending on the success of those games the chance of getting more games from this series increases and partly because its a great damn game.My main complaint about the game as of writing moment, is that it ends. I WANT MORE DAMNIT!			"

												First off, if you HAVEN'T played the first game yet, then stop reading, go get it, play it, complete it 100%, and THEN get this game and carry it over. It's worth it in more ways than one, believe me, and you won't feel totally lost here!This is one of my highly recommended JRPG series for a good reason - excellent gameplay mechanics, great in-depth and compelling storyline carried straight over from the first game without missing a beat, and of course the characters - of which you get to control some new characters you didn't in the first game.You will probably spend a lot of time exploring and talking to NPCs just like in the first game, but that's the beauty of it - the game world is so beautifully done it makes you WANT to explore every nook and cranny of it, it makes you WANT to actually do those side quests. Sure, the graphics are a bit dated, but the level of detail is still overwhelmingly good for a game like this. Oh and there are a few places outside of battle where the environment itself does damage to you/your party, which is new to SC.I also have to give high marks for the music. A lot of the music was carried over from FC (and hey the music in that game was great too!), but many new tracks were added in as well, especially for the various combat themes.The combat system is the same as it was in FC, with some nice enhancements to it - the least of which I'll mention is the addition of new crafts (including the Chain Craft system) and new orbal arts thanks to enhanced Orbments. Oh. And attack food. You heard me right. Nothing more satisfying than to chuck a cookie at an enemy and watch it do the damage.And of course the witty treasure chests are back! I will make a note here that initially when I first played through, they weren't all that unique at first, you had to play through a bit before you saw much in that. It may have changed in the meantime, but just keep that in mind.The fishing minigame has been enhanced (you can now fish in many more spots and there's more challenge to it), and there's also gambling minigames now - you can play poker, blackjack, roulette. You even have a side quest involving gambling now. I spent a fair amount of time in the gambling minigames because like the real deal they were ADDICTING!Enough of me rambling on about the game. IF you've played the first game, then hurry up and get this game and continue the story! If you don't have the first game, GET IT FIRST, play it through, then get SC and carry over your completed FC save over! I promise you'll be sucked in by this game.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (or ""SC"") is a rarity as far as video games go. Not only is it a direct sequel, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing the first game (typically called ""FC"") in the series. Story is the main draw of this series and you'll be lost if you play this one first. It's also worth noting that it's hard to discuss this game without spoiling the first to some degree. With that out of the way, how does it stack up?FC introduced us to the region of Liberl, its host of characters, its technology, and the geopolitical landscape of the series as a whole. Its gameplay was a bit lackluster and simplistic, but boy did it have a fantastic story. If Final Fantasy is dominated by artists, Trails in the Sky is dominated by writers all the same. Every character, every city, every country, and every extranational organization is chock full of detailed backstory and the characters are brimming with personality. The pacing is slow, but the payoff is far greater than one would expect from a game.SC continues that tradition and gives us a bigger picture of Liberl Kingdom, its neighbors, and the organization known as Ouroboros which is undermining its stability. As in FC, you will be greeted with walls of text wherever you visit. Hour long story breaks are commonplace but they tell it so well. The localization is impeccable and remarkably witty, characters are deep and intelligent, and character interactions are fantastic and surprisingly detailed. If the game weren't so ridiculously long, you could see any number of interactions by going back and choosing different character combinations for your party. Even the sidequests that aren't basic monster hunts(common) or fetch quests(rare) are story rich -- for sidequests anyway. If you're a ""story in games"" junkie like I am, you'll absorb every last detail of the world they've created and still be itching for more.SC also vastly improves the battle system. It has a wider variety of arts (spells), crafts (skills), orbments (augment/spellcraft), and status ailments which make gameplay far more interesting than the original. Battles require more intricate strategy than the original, and a number of optional (sidequest) bosses offer interesting challenges as well. As with FC, the gameplay is not grindy. Experience scales down with level which makes catching up pretty simple -- a mere 10 minutes of grinding is the most you'd ever need, and that's only if you usually run past monsters to begin with. You also get an orbment early on that allows you to avoid monsters entirely. To avoid frustration, you can save anywhere and retry battles upon game over.The one major downside is that a large amount of the game's content is recycled from the original game. A lot of the SC's music is from FC. Maybe 3/5th of the maps are straight from FC, albeit with new events and quests. Character sprites aside from Estelle and Joshua are exactly the same. It comes with the territory, being a direct sequel, but some might find it disappointing. On the bright side, if you completed FC and carried over your save, you can get a lot of new dialogue (and even some items) based on sidequests you completed in FC.Speaking of graphics and sound, the sound effects are solid and the voices are clear. The music is catchy but somewhat lacking in variety seeing how FC and SC are a combined 140 or so hours if you do all the sidequests and don't skip cutscenes. The graphics are...graphics. They probably won't wow you, and there haven't been any fixes put in for widescreen, but the sprites are cute.The final chapter (aka ""The 3rd"") has been announced for 2017, so it's definitely worth grabbing FC and this game. We'll all get to find out how it ends soon enough!			"

												After half a decade, one of the best JRPG ever made is finally released in English. Get ready to embark on a trail to the skies for an adventure filled with happenings and the greatest non-blood related incest love story ever told. Select your party from a cast of cheerful tomboy with the smuggest grin you’ll ever see, seductive Gypsy, red haired Cloud Strife who is a lolicon, priest with bowgun who speaks in Brooklyn accent, loli mechanic with loli cannon, fabulous bard prince, and Chinese Sundowner as you rip and tear your way through baddies to reunite with your brooding boyfriend/ brother. Combat system is standard turn-based affair set in a grid. Best part about combat is absolutely 0 grinding is needed. Don’t want to fight field enemy? You get 100% escape chance. Level scaling makes it so you get more exp the high the level difference there is between your party and the enemy. You have to play Trails in the Sky FC to fully enjoy this game. But once you start on SC, it’s one hell of an emotional rollercoaster that’ll make you wish you can forget about this game just to replay again. Support this game as much as you can for more fantastic entries in the Trails series like 3rd, Zero, and Ao no Kiseki to be localized to the West.			"

												After getting, playing, and finishing the First Chapter a year ago and waiting for the Second Chapter to come out and finally finishing it, there are no words to describe the experience. The story is once again just amazing in all respects. The characters felt alive and vibrant, contrasting and complimenting one another perfectly. The music was astounding, even better than the First Chapter. The gameplay is just as solid as it was in the previous but with even more crafts and arts to experiment with. I cannot recommend this game more than I have to anyone even slightly interested in this series. And thus begins the hope and waiting for the Third Chapter to be released onto. May Aidios grant us that small favor.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC and SC combined create the best RPG experience of all time. Before playing FC my favorite RPG series was Fire Emblem. I love the Fire Emblem series for the huge amount of character interaction, the great gameplay, great music, great stories, extremely charming graphics/animations/art styles, and amazing replay value. In my opinon those features are what make RPGs the best video game genre. Trails in the sky FC alone bests Fire Emblem in most of those aspects and is equal in art style and gameplay. Obviously two very different games but speaking in over all RPG experience. Add the Second Chapter (which picks up mere hours after FC's story making it basically the same game) and there is no longer any room for comparison. There is just too much (good meaty) content in Trails in the sky for any other RPG to compare. There are 13 games in the Fire emblem series and I believe there is more content in just these 2 games.If you plan on trying out FC just prepare to sit back and read for hours on end. These games are mostly reading, they are RPGs after all. Don't go in expecting action packed gameplay or amazing AAA graphics. You are going to read, explore, talk to 100s of unique NPCs who all have something to say, read, do sidequests that have their own little storylines, read, and sometimes play through some satisfying turnbased combat (which in my opinon is on par with the fire emblem games)Also Hard mode in SC is very challenging and really forces you to utilize the items/skills at your disposal immediately after the tutorial. If you are looking for a challenge then SC delivers. You can also choose Hard for FC as well although I haven't tried FC on hard.			"

												I have played this game for 75.8 hours, and the best part is it has taken just over two weeks to do it. Once you get sucked into this story, you'll only want more and more. I rarely write reviews but I'll do it for this one. Let's get into the meat of it.Trails on the Sky: SC starts immediately after the conclusion of the First Chapter and concludes the story of Estelle. Just so I don't spoil anything accidentally, I'll just say the identity of your enemy is revealed to you from the beginning, which is a nice change of pace compared to most JRPGs, which throw evil guy after evil guy at you only to reveal there's an even bigger evil guy pulling the strings from behind.This doesn't make the journey to beat that enemy boring, though. The lengths said enemy will go in order to fulfill their evil plot will make you shudder every step of the way. And there resides one of the strongest selling points of the game. You will FEEL what's happening in that beautifully crafted pixel world. The anger, the joy, the fear... every character is so well written and developed that their emotions can touch you quite deeply. We should thank the localization team for that, too, thank you based XSEED and Carpe Fulgur for a job well done.The attention to detail gets a honorable mention here too. There are TONS of dialogue lines which you will never see in a single playthrough, but only because every possible choice (mainly party configuration choice) you make is covered. Special dialogues if certain characters are present, interaction between characters even in the most menial of sidequests, a lot of NPCs reacting to a particular teammate because they know each other... Detail, detail everywhere, and everything adds up to the feeling that those characters have ties to people and places, that they live in cities and know half the neighbourhood, that they're not just personality clichés detached from the world and designed just to fill a particular role in your party.That's about it for the story and immersion parts. The graphics are... well, Trails graphics. If you're interested enough in the game to look at the reviews, you don't give a damn about the graphics. The only particularly ugly thing I've noticed is that certain characters are introduced by showing a full screen image of them against the background, and the borders are BADLY pixelated. This could be easily patched, so pls fix. Slight framedrops/stutter occur in certain areas, I'm almost 100% certain it's a game issue, since it always happens in the same places (Grancel entrance, for example) and my computer runs it at 120 FPS with zero problems the rest of the time.The soundtrack is so exquisite I have a playlist of jdk songs saved on youtube so I can listen to it whenever I'm just fooling around in my computer. A friend of mine described it like this: ""I'm feeling nostalgia listening to songs of a game genre I've never played"".Finally, the only downside I can think about: the game abuses the mechanic of having someone appear juuuust a little too late and save the day for our heroes. It happens a number of times and it's pretty well explained so it always makes sense but... how about appearing five minutes earlier and saving me the trouble of going through that boss fight?			"

												10/10 would cast earth wall again.This is one of the best JRPGs I've had the pleasure of playing. I thought the first game was good, but this sequel really surprised me. The incredibly well written story is its strongest aspect, with many likeable characters in an interesting world. The gameplay, while fairly simple, is solid fun that leaves plenty of room for strategy. The soundtrack is great, if a bit tedious at times. Challenging battles, secret optional stuff, cheeky treasure chest messages, all icing on the cake.Impatient players beware - this game has tons of dialogue and the game takes a while to finish. Some may feel that it drags on for too long.3rd will be an instant buy for me on release.			"

												I have been in love with the JRPG genre ever since my early days as a kid playing the original final fantasy and dragon quest games.  Unfortunately, it has become rather difficult to find any new RPG's nowadays that can inspire the same fascination that those originals gave me.  That is, until I found this series.  Both the first game and this sequal are in a word, amazing.  With a deep story, engaging combat system with massive options for customization, and characters you cannot help but love, this game has it all.  An absolutely wonderful gaming experience from front to back.  I salute the men and women who made this game.  Bravo.			"

I loved this game so much, that I decided to give it my review virginity.Having just beat the game, there is only one thing you should ask yourself before you buy this game: Are you a fan of JRPGS?If you are, then get this game, because it has:- An amazing storyline stretching across many different games.- A colorful, and loveable, cast of characters. Both villain and comrade alike.- A little bit of romance that is WELL DONE and feels REAL.- One of the best female protagonists in gaming.- A world that is truly alive. NPCs have their own unique personas, dreams, goals and lives. They frequently recieve updated dialogue, and that helps make the world a unique entity I have never experienced before in gaming.- Characters are deep and multi-faceted (almost as if they were real people)!- That old school JRPG gameplay that has aged well.- There is a sequel coming out in the US in 2017! I'm so excited :)!- Very long, so there is much to enjoy.- Many sidequests without any hand-holding.- A decent level of difficulty on normal, bordering on insanity at higher difficulties for those who love a challenge.Of course, there were a few cons as well, but I consider them minor:- A slow, but juicy, start.- Dated graphics.- Lack of voice acting (however, knowing modern jrpgs that fine with me)!I'd leave a little summary of the plot, but the game does it so much better than I can ever do. Get. This. Game. And. Beat. It. This experience has been the metaphorical gold of Japanese Role-Playing Games.			"

												Trails SC is one interesting example for an old school style JRPG experienceJust like FC, SC might not be the prime example in top notch visuals and high res textures, but -imho- it points in several other, maybe even more important, aspects like gameplay, likeable characters that manage to fascinate in terms of character development over the two installments and last but not least - in storytelling.Especially the last point, is something, I as a person who learned to love RPGs und JRPGs in particular with titles like Breath of Fire 3, Grandia 2 and the like, missed dearly in the last few recent years. Don´t get me wrong - the Storyline of LoH: Trails FC and SC is far from being very inventive. It feels more like the ""do it yourself RPG Kit"" ... it´s nothing you´ve never seen before, but nevetheless - Falcom and XSeed with their localization still manage it to make you play further on - you´ll still want to know how the story will develop any further and how the individual paths of your (possible) party members will turn out. In my case, thats something no game since DAO has archieved.The gameplay is rock solid and fun to play - combat is strategic and deep enough, to keep you busy with various Quartz / Magic combinations but at the same time it´s easy and understandable enough for not to overburden you - in my opinion it´s simply almost the perfect mix.One last point: in this game you´ll read. You´ll read LOTS. I´d probably even say, this game (as well as FC) is almost as much a VN as it is an RPG. XSeed managed it to localize and write it in a way, which is easy-going and fun to read (at least for me, as an vivid reader) and at the same time, it won´t overburden people not native in the english language, as myself, for example. So, once more, i´d like to tip my hat to XSeed for granting us a game which must have been one hell-of-a-struggle to translate and localize. Please keep going like that, your work on these two games as well on the others you´ve published, is very very appreciated.Okay - last but not least - Recommendation or not ?Well ... for people like myself, who already ""devoured"" FC I don´t think I have to recommend it, do I ? But what about other players, perhaps even those never to have laid hands on a JRPG ? If you like classical RPGs, like Baldurs Gate or Albion ... I think, you should give it a try - get the first part, it might turn out quite an interesting experience.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, is a good indicator of how JRPG sequels should be. It everything the first games, but heavily improves on almost every aspects. It even more challenging then the first game. The reason why this game is good, it based on the game's dedication on it npcs for world building, and the emotional baggage that affect each and every character throughout the game. This is easily one of the best JRPG on PC, if not of this generation. Objectively, the gameplay requires strategy over mindlessly hacking and slashing your way through, thus creating a much needed challange. In addition, the massive improvement on the orb system is so much fun. I waited 4-5 years for this game, and the payoff so far is Superb and Amazing. If you haven't played the first one, do so now. This game is all about investment.			"

												What an amazing experience. The first one was great and SC is even better. Still, there were some problems, but nothing ""destructive"". Some major ups and downs:+The story was great. Also, there were really intense moments that made the events/characters more interesting overall.+It wasn't as easy as the first one.+It was a traditional JRPG without modern ""atrocities"".+It was really hard to stop playing. Really addictive gameplay.+The playable characters are more balanced, but...-Leveling Olivier and Kloe is pointless. They are pretty useless in the Finale.-Having two last minute additional playable characters during the Finale.-Glorius is really FKN glitchy. There are random points where you may get stuck forever.Most of the downs concern the Finale. The bosses are great, especially the last boss fight is really great. However, you may find yourself dying instantly at times during The Finale... Overall, SC is an amazing experience. The downs are not too hard to overcome, but they'll annoy you. Hopefully the third chapter will be available in 2017.			"

												I usuallly don't write reviews before finishing a game, but at this point my opinion is pretty set.This game is awesome. Buy it. On a more serious note, if you haven't played the first game in the Trails in the Sky series (available on steam), well I cannot recommend you this game. You must have played the first game.Also, do note that the difficulty in this game is way higher than in its first iteration, so don't go on an play on nightmare just to make you seem tough, this game gives you challenge even on normal.

												One of my favorite JRPG with a great storyline and soundtrack. The gameplay is about the same as the First Chapter so I highly recommend you buy the first one to try out the game. It's much cheaper and it's essential for you to finish the first chapter for the storyline anyways. And if you do like the first chapter, this one is a must-buy.			"

												An hour into the game, it's pretty damn obvious why it took forever for SC to be released in English.It was worth the wait.All right, all joking aside, a more serious review: I haven't actually finished the game but -- 20 hours into it, I'm just BARELY starting chapter two. And if there's nine chapters, I'm pretty sure the amount of playtime for SC is going to be double or even triple that of FC (I averaged about 45 hours in FC; 90 in two playthroughs). There's TONS of content in the game and, if you are playing the game with an imported save from FC, it's worth it to talk to all the NPCs. They actually remember you! And stuff you did! There's even a SC achievement for talking to a specific NPC multiple times! Even aside from the frankly remarkable amount of effort that went into integrating the two games (enough I was grateful I replayed FC a few weeks before SC's launch), the story itself is compelling, the character interactions are great, and I spent pretty much every cut scene going ""why am I not fraps'ing this????"" Even more, there's enough variation to make replay worth it as there's a choice early on if you want to travel with Schera or Agate as your primary companion (basically filling the space Joshua did in FC); I understand the main jist of the quests, main, side, and hidden, aren't changed but the interactions and dialogue do have some differences depending on your choice (for the record, the Agate path which I'm playing is great and every single interaction between Agate and Olivier is basically magic).As far as game play, there's a lot less bugs than I would expect from a freshly launched game; especially since I remember some of the gamebreaking bugs of FC's launch. Basically the only thing that actually effects gameplay is the lack of chest phases (which I read on the forums that will be fixed in a later patch?). There's about five or six different chest phrases that seem to be on rotation, rather than individual phases of the first game. Something that's a minor disappointment but ultimately I'd rather have the game than the return of Chairman Meow.			"

												""SC"" is for the second chapter. If you haven't played the first, go find that one. It's excellent. You'll need the pair, btw. As for SC, it's an overall improvement and a great closer of the story (as it is the second half). The whole game system of the previous game is similar, but many improvements were made to the combat and a few expansions. Combat was made a bit faster due to shorter animations and enter/exits, some complexity was added here and there. One major improvement I loved was a lot of equipment has downsides so you have to debate over certain pieces for certain builds. Not just constant upgrades like the last game. The whole orb mechanic was overhauled and feels much better. (SPOILER FREE) Story, for the most part, is very fulfilling and ties up well as a large part of the overall LoH larger series. If you enjoyed the First Chapter, you won't be dissapointed. Still a bit slow and sluggish in some areas (especially if you're going for all the side-quests and chests and such), but doesn't get too dull and pays off in the end. Overall, the duo is an amazing set of JRPG games. Just amazing. If the combat (for the time) wasn't a bit dull and the story was a bit quicker, I wouldn't think for a second this wouldn't be considered a masterpiece of the RPG genre. As for now, it's close. Really close. Side note: There's a small bug to watch out for if you're using a gamepad. Some menus in the final chapter couldn't be used with a gamepad, and it took me forever to find out via Steam forums that the mouse can be used to click on menu items when this happens. Duh, right? Stupid me. If this happens, remember the mouse!Second side note: I had quite a few problems running the previous chapter, nothing game-breaking, but a few jolts. Many of those problems don't exist in the SC. I still get frame-stuttering in certain areas, but not as bad. Outside of that there's the final chapter menu/mouse problem. That's all. Pretty well ported this time.			"

I love every single character this series offers and Trails SC is so action-packed I had a hard time putting it down!  There aren't many RPGs out there that I can say I played for 72 hours and ejoyed every last minute on ONE play through.If you haven't played the first one, YOU MUST; it is a direct continuation of the original story line.The good: See above.The bad: It probably doesn't have a load of replayability after two play-throughs.

												Gameplay is nearly identical to the first chapter. Knowledge of the first chapter is pretty much necessary (why would anyone play the second chapter before the first?). Side quests, orbal arts, battle system - very little has changed. There are more spells available, but, to me, they seem mostly underwhelming.I would say FC is the better of the two. SC is MUCH longer and that means a lot more dialogue. It does mostly wrap up the story; though, many questions are left unanswered. It's nothing like FC's cliffhanger, though.Basically, if you enjoyed FC and are dying to see how it plays out, SC is a no-brainer. If FC felt like you were getting murdered with story and dialogue, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

												To be honest, I hate the branching path designs in most of the games; it usually end up being sad excuse for pitiful attempt of extending playtime. This game however, I want to choose every possible branching patch available; the game took its time to build up the character in FC, and now, you care about all this characters and want to hear what they have to say about the events that occur in this game. It makes you care about the characters, plots, and lores but not in the painful way. I always loved reading, but I wasn't able to find the game that is engaging enough to do so. I was really starting to think that I was just being a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can't appreciate good stories. But I found what I deserved to love in the most unlikely place; an JRPG that my older brother used to play. Thank you Xseed games. I think I finally found my passion. Buy the game, support Xseed games and Falcom, they earned their reputation and fandom. I have always been a bit of a console hater, but this game made me want to buy PS just so that I can play remastered version of Trails in the sky.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky series are among my favorite RPGs of all time. There have only been a handful of games I've played where I've felt a deep level of emotion connection with the characters. The biggest PRO of this game has to be the compelling character development. Without giving spoilers, there is a part near the end of this game where all of the demoralizing and disheartening losses up to that point are resurfacing, forcing you to relfect on the emotional roller coaster it has been thus far. But then.. when you least expect it, everything is made right again and the game ties together so many loose ends; I actually shed tears of joy. No game has ever done that for me. It is a MUST play if you call yourself an RPG fan. The gameplay, story, characters, soundtrack, just everything is perfect.			"

												i have been waiting this game for 4 years, i played FC on PSP first, and bought it again when released on steam last year.does this game live up to the expectation?absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥YESjust a word of caution, this game is really not meant to be played back to back. Reason? all Legend of Heroes series have a really slow beginning and intro. After the very fast pace and intense climax of FC, you may want to take a break before tackling this. the game however pick up around 1/3 in the game. And  oh god, when it picks up, its absolutely worth it. Your teammate story gets really really developed.The concept of the story to be honest is cliche, but when all the dialogue is beautifully written... oh gosh.. I even feel so much for FACELESS NPC. I even cried for them... w t f?The game actually has Faaar more content than FC, in fact 80% of area in FC will be revisited in SC (in addition of tonnes more new location). music of this game? absolutely gorgeous, and it is always played at the correct time and pacing.cons:- slow start- reused assetspros:- great characters and dialogue- beautiful soundtrackrating : 8/10comparing FC and SC , I think SC won by tiny margin.

When i bought this, i was more than a little worried that the game would never be able to live up to my expectations and i'd be let down in the end. Rarely am i so glad to be wrong.-One of if not the greatest world building I've ever seen-Amazing characters, both good guys and bad, hell even the random npcs are interesting-set pieces that top the ones in the first massively despite the graphics-Great music nuff said-Awesome story-Large roster of characters-Badass magic and special moves-different difficulty levels, new game plus and no overleveling-challenging bosses-the treasure chest messages :Dcons-Magic system leads to overspeciallisation. Most of the strongest spells can only be used by dedicated spell casters who have virtually 0 attack strength.One of the best games i have ever had the joy of playing100/10			"

Oh, you priest and your humor!Love the soundtrack, too, of course! One of the things that you would appreciate in this game. And I'm being a huge softie in here because the bgm is a factor on an emotional ride.Haaa, I wish the game was longer. I got really sad when it ended.			"

												Thank you Falcom for making this legendary game, thanks XSEED for bringing it to the western world and the amount of effort put into translating it.This is must play if you're a JRPG/Final Fantasy fan like myself, SC keeps you gripped to the main story with many MANY! twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat making you want to play for a few more hours (even if it's 3am in the morning), for the next action packed piece of drama. It's the best romantic and emotionally character connected game I've played in a long time and it further builds on the first chapter and the cliffhanger that left you begging for more and well... the SC hasn't failed to deliver!I'm coming towards the end of the game now as I write this, it's been one hell of a ride worth playing I'm just so glad I stumbled across this series less than a year ago.

												Simply cannot give enough praise for this gem.I didn't think that something like this would capture my attention, but after playing FC on a whim as I was looking for an old school JRPG I could not have gotten luckier that I chose this.The music, the story, the characters, the combat...all polished and amazing...The only game I felt that came with this level of polish on release in recent memory was the witcher 3do yourself a favor and buy this game.

												I've played a lot of RPGs in 2016 but SC definitely has the best story ever. The storytelling, characters and soundtracks do made the game an epic story. Since the game is a direct sequel without any gap in time, you need to play FC (First Chapter) first. Another thing to note is that the normal mode in SC is a bit harder than FC (at least that's what I felt) so you might want to play on easy if you just want to enjoy the story. SC is just pure greatness.			"

												This game was fantastic. Plain and simple. The battle system offered the right amount of challenge and it was really really fun. The story was compelling and the characters were amazing. The translation is one of the best out there and the writing is superb, along with that the world building is next to none. Buy this game and the first part and you'll be in for 100+ hours of pure joy			"

 The Dream Continues In my review of Trails in the Sky First Chapter (FC), I felt inclined to refrain from mentioning any criticisms, largely because the only criticisms I had were nit-picky. I was full of praise as to how this game differs from any other JRPG I had played prior to the games in the Legend of Heroes series. As result, I purchased Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (SC) almost immediately after it was released on steam. In terms of gameplay and the overall mechanics in SC, they remain largely identical to FC and therefore there is no need to dwell on them in this review. I recognise that this review probably will not mean much to those who loved FC as it is likely they have already bought and finished SC. Likewise if you did not like FC, then I would be surprised if you are considering buying SC. I can confidently say right off the bat that FC and SC together are among the best games I have ever played, with SC expanding on the greatness that was FC.The consequence of playing and adoring FC is that I had extremely high expectations going into SC. Whilst those expectations were entirely met, this time around my review cannot be so clear cut as it was for FC. In order to review this game fairly and without bias, I intend to mention a noticeable flaw I identified because it would be ignorant to ignore it.*No spoilers*  Story  The story in SC is definitely a step up from FC, with enough plot twists to make you run around the room in excitement... I know I did. Every main character is developed from the first game in a meaningful way. Even Estelle develops from a largely clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person to a more mature... clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person.  Like FC, the story is split into a series of well-structured chapters, however in SC the game is separated into 9 different chapters rather than the 4 main chapters in FC. As expected the story neatly follows from FC. My main criticism of the game is based on the first 4 chapters. The problem with these chapters is that by chapter 2, the story gets largely predictable with the similar kind of occurrence happening in each chapter (I'll spare the details). Of course the predictability ends soon after the 4th chapter. This may not necessarily be a problem for many who have played SC, but it did get a tad repetitive, especially in conjunction with the side quests which do not vary that much. However, this is largely where my noticeable criticisms end and I appreciate this is largely a subjective criticism. To this day, the 5th and 6th chapters of SC were... Some of the best segments of a game I have played in my entire life... And I have played a lot of games! Although I will not describe the contents of those chapters, they were the most deeply engaging, emotional and thrilling parts of a game I have ever played, galvanizing anyone into adoring the game. I wish I could describe the details.The ending of the game is satisfying. That is my greatest hope for any sequel of a JRPG. It is far too easy for games to conclude having left more questions than answers. Although there is a cliff-hanger which sets up the Third Chapter (TC), it is not the kind of cliff-hanger which leaves a lack of fulfilment and a taste of disappointment. As I mentioned to a friend, I would not mind if the Third Chapter is never localized... That’s not to say that when it is finished being localized I won't play it. I will buy it on the day it is released! Hell I will stay up all night with a countdown clock till its release! Nevertheless, what I am concluding is that the Second Chapter had a satisfying ending; it felt like the hours I had put into the game actually meant something significant in the end, rather than leaving a lingering anticipation for what happens next.  Gameplay There is very little which can be said about gameplay other than it is almost identical to the First Chapter. In my review of FC, I mentioned the way in which gameplay differs from other JRPG's I am familiar with such as games in the Final Fantasy franchise. This difference remains the same in SC. The main new mechanic in SC is the ability to combine attacks with different characters (Chain attacks). They were a nice new addition to the game, but nothing revolutionary. If you loved the gameplay and the battle system in FC, then it follows that you should feel the same about SC.  Music The first thing I wanted to know when I bought the game is how the music would differ from FC. I have invested hours into listening to the music of FC outside of the game and I will probably spend many hours more listening to FC's OST. I can gladly say, the soundtrack in SC is a masterpiece - my favourites being: 'The Dream Continues,' 'Silver Will' and 'I Swear.' I do not recommend listening to any of the soundtrack before playing the game, solely because of the emotional effect they have within the game. None of the pieces are overused or underused. The first thing I did after finishing the game was search for the pieces on YouTube.  Conclusion FC and SC felt like a dream. I say this as the two games felt like perfect games with very few flaws. Although I stated my noticeable criticism of SC, it is insignificant when looking at the overall standard of the game. The characters remain as funny as they were in FC, the story is brilliant, the music is sensational and the localization is without flaws. Only Aidios knows why this game is not as popular as it should be. I have always felt that it is the most well-made games which receive the least credit. I am now in the process of playing Trails of Cold Steel. As for the Third Chapter, I can only hope the dream continues.  9.5/ 10  "

												Been playing JRPGS since I was young. The final fantasies, the Chrono Triggers. I had lots of time back then to play these games in their entirety. Times, and priorities have changed as I grew older (early 30s now) and had less time to play games, especially long ones like RPGs.Trails in the Sky SC and FC were the only games that actually made me want to allocate time to play through and finish in years. Story? Good and Immersive.Cast? All of them have their place, and their own backstories that keep you immersed and invested in them.Cast diversity in battle?  You can literally use whoever you want and be able to beat the game (unless you playing Nightmare, in which case you need Kevin in most cases).And the music...the MUSIC... and I thought Nobou was great. This game has some of the best soundtracks in a JRPG, more than a match for the ones from the FF series and Tales series.This game and series is so good to the point where I had to post a review (and I don't often post reviews).Hope the 3rd comes out as scheduled! Will definitely make time for that too.  "

												Worthy successor to the first game. The first couple chapters are a bit slow. Everyone I have talked to personally that's played it has found it hard to push through them. Ultimately, the game is worth it if you do. Things pick up around Chapter 4 or so and continue escalating in a great way to the end.Combat starts off tedious in this one with the fights being more annoying than hard but that evens out eventually as well.Overall, a great sequel to a great game. If you enjoyed the first, you should definitely play this. Just tough out the early slow stuff.			"

Trails in the Sky SC (short for Second Chapter) is the long awaited and direct sequel of Trails in the Sky (often called FC, meaning First Chapter). If you played FC and you're wondering if SC is any better, let me tell you: it is, in every way you can imagine. Trails in the Sky: The 3rd, the next game in this series, has its own story and Estelle and Joshua aren't even the main characters in it. The 3rd will likely be localized in the future, but even if it isn't, rest assured that SC delivers a satisfying conclusion.If you haven't played any Trails games before, here's an overview of why you should direct your attention to FC and SC.As most fans of Trails in the Sky will tell you, these games do an excellent job of world building. You'll learn plenty about the Zemurian continent and its regions and citizens just by following the story. What really sets this series apart from most JRPGs is that if you like the fictional setting and want to learn more about it, there is a lot of optional reading that you can indulge in at your own leisure. There are over 500 portraitless NPCs, each with their own side-story, and their dialogue will change after every story event. There's also a plethora of optional but entertaining side quests that further flesh out characters and locations, and even short novels that you can read. NPCs that you helped in the first game will remember you if you carry over your save file, which I thought was a nice touch. The in-game universe feels well built and ever-changing, and the result is a story that flows logically. With everything being so well planned, there is no room for deus ex machinas, and plenty of room for masterful foreshadowing.These games have a lot of text so sometimes you'll feel like you're reading a book rather than playing a game. Luckily, the English translation is wonderful. The dialogue is brimming with personality, helping to make even the least important characters feel somewhat memorable. The visuals, as you've probably seen, are dated but not awful by any means. What the series lacks in eye candy, it makes up for in other areas. In terms of music, FC's soundtrack is good, but SC's soundtrack is amazing, greeting you with one of the best piano pieces right at the title screen, and sending you off with one of the best final boss themes ever composed. The battle system isn't groundbreaking but it is refreshing. Each character can be equipped with ""quartz""; different quartz combinations will grant you different magic, which the game refers to as ""arts"", and they consume (EP - energy points). There are also ""crafts"", which are skills unique to each character, and they use craft points (CP). Whenever you attack or receive damage, you will recover CP, and filling the CP gauge grants you access powerful turn-interrupting moves called S-crafts (which are also unique for each character) at the click of a mouse. SC differs adds new arts and crafts (heh), as well as chain crafts: combo attacks that can deal serious damage when abused. The turn order and turn bonuses are displayed on the left side of the screen, and unlike the usual turn-based game, manipulation of delay to take the turn bonuses for yourself adds an extra layer of strategy to the combat.Trails in the Sky isn't the most original series, and its story isn't full of plot twists, so you shouldn't come into it expecting a mind blowing story. What this series offers is something that I feel a lot of JRPGs today lack: a coherent plot with a few well placed plot twists and excellent use of foreshadowing + layered, realistic, and developed characters, all wrapped up in a cozy setting that's rich with lore. Depending on how fast you read, FC takes about 30-45 hours to beat and SC takes about 50-70 hours. Double that if you're going to talk to everyone and do all the side quests (which you will need a guide for, since this series is notorious for missables). With the NG+ feature and difficulty settings, these games are designed to be replayed and you have no obligation to be a completionist the first time around. You also get 999 save slots in FC and SC, which you can take advantage of to revisit pretty much any point in the story.These games makes me feel like a kid again while somehow meeting and even surpassing the high standards I've developed from 18 or so years of video gaming. Considering how much quality content is packed into each, they are worth every penny, especially if you're a JRPG fan who likes reading.			"

TLDR:The storyline will grab you by the balls/ovaries and will not let you go. AND YOU'LL LIKE IT, CAUSE YOU'RE A NAUGHTY PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥Combat doesn't boil down to a battle of who can subtract higher numbers while adding high enough numbers.You aren't punished for picking the wrong party members, you can make anything work (just don't go above normal difficulty).All the music is memorable, and with how Falcom choreographs the cutscenes, seemingly innocent music will invoke feels.Wait, I shouldn't be making a TLDR, because this game is bigger than any novel you could probably think of in terms of reading. So, if you're just going to overlook the rest of the review, you probably should just turn away right now because you may not have the mental stamina to endure this game. It would be a massive mistake to ignore the story in this game.I'm going to put my grievances with this game FIRST so you know if you want to commit to this series.You _NEED_ to have played the first chapter before you tackle this game. The game is balanced such that you apply your knowledge from the first game into this one; no tutorials on how to attack or anything that was already present.You ♥♥♥♥ing better dare not even try hard or nightmare difficulty. There's no additional reward except artificially inflating your playtime by granting every single enemy in the game a monstrous stat increase across the board. The community will not judge you for playing on easy. Even normal difficulty will ♥♥♥♥ you up at some points.If you're an achievement hunter, a lot of them are glitched and unfinishable no matter how detailed a guide you use. A glance at the global achievement stats will give you enough hints as to which ones are flat out broken.A large resolution makes this game a little rough around the edges; you can start seeing into the nether space the devs didn't want you to see.There are a couple of glitches regarding missing sprites, and in one case, a sequence break that you may not even notice happening.There's a third chapter that may not get translated for a few years.As mentioned before this game is INCREDIBLY text heavy and if you're the kind of person that usually mashes the 'skip cutscene button', well too bad, because you cannot skip any cutscene in this game. You can flip through text fast by holding down control, but that's only text; and some cutscenes can go on for at least ten minutes straight when you're reading.The developers are cruel ♥♥♥♥ers when it comes to missables; essentially everything in the game is missable. This is what you call a gamefaqs game. They're also going to be testing your patience quite frequently with some tasks being monumentally tedious and/or obscure. There is no fast travelling of any kind unless the story demands you to.On the theme of missables, getting the full amount of Bracer Points is impossible without a guide. It is simply im-♥♥♥♥ing-possible to have the intuition to do every quest, every sidequest, every HIDDEN sidequest, answer every dialogue branch correctly, and meet criteria during quests for extra Bracer Points on your own. If you want the achievement for getting all the Bracer Points, you better crack open that walkthrough and bookmark that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Make sure you make a separate save every single time you decide to save, so that if you do end up missing something you have plenty of points in the game to load to. At the end of the game I had about 135 save files, and that still wasn't quite enough. Don't worry, they give you 999 save files to work with, and 10 autosaves that happen with each map transition or battle.Mouse controls are the best way to play this game, but you will need to get used to the fact that every time a menu appears, the mouse will instantly teleport to the first option of the menu as this game originates from the PSP. That can get annoying, but you get used to it. You can play the entire game with the mouse and Z/X to spin the camera.If none of the above is enough to make you turn away, then you'll be able to enjoy what follows. If it is, I'm afraid it may be too much of a problem and will get in the way of you soaking in the story.Never before have I gotten so invested in a RPG's storyline. The combined 95 hours it took me to finish both games had me by the balls the entire time. Almost every single playable character and the villains have their own backstories, that at some point during either game get a portion of screen time. You feel for everyone at some point. Select NPCs have their own mini-stories which still feel integral to the plot, and often make you think ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ what if I didn't do this sidequest?"". If you import a complete save file from the first chapter (and you will because you absolutely must play the first game to even care about what's going on in this game), depending on your performance you'll get some neat little goodies, plus some little mentions here and there about what you did. Even the little things like keeping your notebook from the first game to flick through.If you pay attention to the story (as a byproduct of it being amazingly enticing), you'll often be able to figure out what's coming next and feel like a badass when you predict the next plot twist. You feel like you're actually immersed in this world because you can tie things together without them being explicitly told to you point-blank. You get an idea of the world, its mythos, and you become part of it to an extent. The arts system allows you to bend any party member into whatever role you see fit. That's important because there are many points where you're stuck with a certain character with no ability to get rid of them; but that's fine, you can just equip them and you're good to go. While it's true that some characters are better suited as a caster or a melee, nobody really feels useless. Speaking of combat, it takes place on a Final Fantasy Tactics style grid adding some strategy as to where to position party members, predicting enemy movement so they'll fit in your AoE spells, and positioning to get as many enemies in a line for line spells. Unlike some more traditional JRPGs you actually have the means to avoid damage by simply moving out before an enemy finishes casting, by spreading your party out wide enough, by interrupting their casts, or hijacking enemy turns to eke out that last bit of health; so battles don't necessarily always end up as trying to keep an ever-leaking bucket from emptying as the boss spams spells that hit all party members with naught you can do to stop it except constant healing. Party members falling behind on levels get to reap the benefits of the relative EXP gains from defeating higher level monsters (e.g. you have 3 party members at level 55, you dig up your level 45 character; ordinarily you'd spend hours grinding just for them, but instead a level 57 monster can potentially give them at least four levels). I was worried I was going to be saying ""I wish I could use you, but I'd have to grind experience with you for about five hours just so I can use you"" quite a lot with how often party members switch in and out because of the storyline, and was relieved that never happened.DEAR GOD THE MUSIC WILL STICK WITH YOU FOREVER. By the time you finish the first chapter and load up the second chapter, you're going to have some feels hit you with the first chapter's most recent events fresh in your mind as soon as you hear that title screen music. You'll appreciate _all_ the music too, from the calm field map music to the myriad of evocative battle themes.This game is responsible for any lowering in grades I may suffer in the coming weeks. Thank you Falcom for making me stay up until 4am nightly because I can't put the god damn game down.			"

Short Review:If you enjoyed the first game you will enjoy this game.Simple as that.(Check out my review of the first game (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pikmar/recommended/251150)Slightly Longer Review:Pros + Picks up literally right where the first game left off+ The same great battle system is here and its better than before! Fixed a lot of balance issues and added tons of new arts, crafts, and S-Crafts's.+ Writing is still amazing and keeps you wanting more+ Character development is still superb.+ Game keeps the old sountrack while adding tons of new tracks.+ Side quests are even better this time around.+ Lots of new faces+ Story continues to impressCons- Not a spoiler at all, but some people may not want to know this. Ending leaves you with WAY more questions than answers. Will probably all be answered in the third game though.Again.. If you enjoyed the first part of this trilogy then this one is worth your time and money. Final Score - ★★★★★			"

												Trails in the Sky.... boy, is THAT a name that takes me back.I'm five chapters in to Second Chapter, and I have to say... it eclipses FC in plenty of ways, although it still has it's flaws.  It's hard to review something you like as opposed to something you dislike, so I'm going to do my best to not sound biased.I'm gonna start with the bad:First off, the Heaven's Eye Quartz is bugged.  It does not have it's secondary 'radar' function, which can be irritating until you get a Quartz that can replicate the second function.Second,  this game has some fairly easily done exploits that make mass enemy destruction easy, removing from the intended tactical portion of combat.  And even then, some of the pre-existing encounters can feel sloppy at times, requiring these exploits to survive.With that out of the way....Second Chapter is a lot better than first chapter was, and it gets started a lot faster.  I refuse to spoil first chapter here, but Estelle's goal isn't to save the world or anything lofty like that (at first), but a more personal goal, which helps make the plot something that can be related to.  And as the story develops, the world around you (That is, the Kingdom of Liberl and it's neighboring countries) get ever moreso fleshed out, with every NPC having something unique to say, sometimes changing what they say midway through a chapter.  While the plot is very trope-y, it's how it is written that makes it such a joy to play through.  The player characters, while having their defining traits, have multiple layers to their personalities that prevent them from being one-note characters, a problem that is alarmingly frequent in most games released these days.Moving onto the actual gameplay, there's a ton of sidequests to do, involving tasks ranging from slaying monsters that block roads, to finding missing people and stolen items.  Some of these sidequests help flesh characters out and help build the world around the player characters, while some are just for money.  100% Completion can be quite a task, and it'll take more than one playthrough without a guide to achieve it.  As for the combat, discounting the flaws above, is fun and tactical, requiring the player to understand and manipulate enemy positioning and turn order to eke out a victory.Adding a layer of depth to the system is the Arts system, requiring the player to slot quartz into one of seven slots on their character's Orbment, which can be best described as a device that creates magic from technology.  Now, while this might sound like FFVII's Materia System, it is in fact it's own beast.  The initial placement of quartz provides stat boosts and penalties, but creating a certain combination across the same line gives you increasingly better spells based on the total Elemental Value of the different quartz on the same line.  There's an in game list of spells and EV requirements, so you will not need a guide.  Fortunately, the lines are easier to read than they were in first chapter, with them being more easily marked on your orbment.Now, the real star of the show (for me at least) is the music, which is leaps and bounds above the already impressive first chapter, with songs like Silver Will and it's arrangements especially standing out, with special mention to the calming world map theme.  The new battle theme is also more fiting than Sophisticated Fight in the first game, and the mid boss theme and boss theme's feeling more fitting and more pleasing to the ears as well.  The soundtrack is actually available on Amazon, and I reccomend picking it up sometime.  I also hope XSEED gets permission to sell it on Steam as well.In closing, Trails in the Sky SC is a wonderful experience so far, and I am looking forward to the ending of this beautiful dualogy.  And if you haven't played the first game yet, play that one, then pick this up.			"

												In terms of story and character development this is probably one of the greatest jRPGs I have ever played. The wonderful cast of Trails in The Sky is what makies this title stand out and on top of that you'll find player friendly core gameplay with satisfying turn-based battles all wrapped in graphics and soundtrack that revoke the greatest greats of the genre. If you love jRPGs from the golden SNES/PS1 era this should be right up your alley. Trails has everything that made Chrono Trigger, Suikoden, FFVII and such awesome minus the chore of grinding, random encounters etc. This makes for an ideal entry point for newcomers, while the fantastic boss battles (a Falcom staple!) should still provide the right challenge for veterans. This is as close to a 10/10 a game can get in my book. Really recommend anyone who has a little love for the genre to play BOTH parts of Trails in The Sky. Important! You NEED to play the first part to fully understand whats going on in SC and get the most out of the story.			"

												I finished this game about a week and a half ago but haven't had the chance to write a review until now due to schoolwork. Yes, I've played the first game back on the psp and have been waiting for this sequel for years (like many others here). I think it was worth the wait (though it was dreadful the first time I got FC's ending...and I wanted SC right away). Xseed clearly put a lot of time and effort into this game and it is also worth the price (spent so many hours on my first playthrough). I HIGHLY recommend people to play this gem of a game (play FC first though!). I look forward to playing future Kiseki games!! (so please support them so we can get moooooore~)			"

												Combined with the first game possibly one of the greatest RPGs out there, phenomenal story, incredible worldbuilding and easy to get into yet deep gameplay. Every NPC has their own little story and personality and reacts to quest and story events so it really feels like you're in a living world. Its also one of the few games that manages to create bosses that are supposed to be powerful in the story and are powerful in the fights without destroying the tension by having to load all saves. If a boss is described as powerful in the story you can expect to have a hard fight that requires thought to win but the retry offset function means you never reach a point where the story tension vanishes due to constant reloading.

												I was on a JRPG kick, and it was on sale. And from those humble beginnings, my journey with the greatest RPG in a decade began.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky feels more like a novel than a video game. This is somewhat true in a literal sense: there's a lot of text! But where it really shows up is in the intentional design decision to have the story be the central focus. And what a story it is. It starts out small. You play as a teenager cutting her teeth at her newfound vocation, with the stakes to match: a lost cat, a maintenance kit for a lighthouse, unreturned library books. Nothing life-changing. Certainly nothing world-changing. But these seemingly trivial tasks allow the world and the characters to establish themselves and breathe, allowing them to become more than nameless faces. A dizzying amount of random townsfolk NPCs have their own storylines going on, and the game lets you watch these threads unfold. The main plot is slowly building in the background, but the game unapologetically focuses on letting the player slowly absorb the country of Liberl for the first thirty hours or so and watching the slow growth of Estelle. And it's the better for it, because when the plot gets into gear, all that time spent with her starts to really pay off. The game mechanics are decent, but they're obviously secondary: like a novel, the real meat of the game is the characterization and worldbuilding.That's what happened in the prequel. Which you have to play before this one, because this one is where that characterization and worldbuilding established in the first one starts to pay incredible dividends.In SC, the stakes are increased from the very start, but again, the game lets the central plot take the back seat for a while and focuses on worldbuilding and character development. You go back through the same towns as the first game, with the same NPCs and even the same dungeon layouts. And it's like visiting an old friend. You see how the NPCs handle the ongoing crises, how they've adapted, how they've soldiered on, how they've gone about the business of living their lives. It gives a richness and depth to the setting that is matched by few other games, and almost no other JRPGs. I can't stress this enough: the focus on world-building isn't a seasoning trying to add depth to the main course, it's part of the main course itself. I could spend the entire game running errands and talking to NPCs (and listening to the fantastic soundtrack!), and it'd be worth it. That's how good this element is.Of course, like in the first game, the main plot is always slowly building up in the background. And like in the first game, it starts to take center stage around 30 hours in. And like in the first game, the hours upon hours spent with following Estelle and her growth add a depth to the narrative that causes it to shine. Trails in the Sky is a story about Liberl, but it's primarily a story about Estelle, and the game does a beautiful job of linking the world-changing events happening to the personal growth of Estelle and her companions. It's a complete masterclass in writing, and if the country of Liberl is the soul of the game, then the journey of Estelle is unquestionably the heart. There are some improvements to the battle system, but again, this game isn't about the battle system. It's the story of a country and the story of a girl, masterfully weaved together into a single must-play experience.There's been much written elsewhere about the long, hard, probably cursed journey this game took to Western shores, so I won't repeat the story here. But I would be remiss to not offer my gratitude to Falcom, to Carpe Fulgar, and to Xseed. Blood and tears were given to bring me this game, and my thanks and money seem woefully inadequate a recompense. But it's all I can offer for now, so it will have to do. So thank you to everyone involved in the development and localization of this game, for your fantastic job at giving me one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.			"

												First off, this is a wonderful game, and a sequel to another wonderful game, Trails in the Sky: FC.  It's somewhat odd to be saying that, considering a month ago I didn't own SC, and had had Trails in the SKY: FC sitting on my hard drive for a year.  I started playing FC in late 2014, but the story is a bit of a slow burn.  10 or so hours in and not much had happened, and so I ended up shelving it for awhile.  In December of last year, I decided I needed to start playing it again and finish it.  It's interesting what happens sometimes when you take a break from a game you're not into at the time - after only a few hours back into FC, the character and plot needles had moved enough to keep me going, and before long I had become well and truly sucked in.I played FC religiously at that point, fully-invested in the detailed characters, the growth they displayed throughout the game, and the ever-growing story.  That game, as you may have heard, has a real doozy of a cliffhanger, one with a lot of emotional punch.  So, there was only one thing for it - immediately purchase Trails in the Sky: SC and plunge headlong back into the world of Liberl.  Was it worth it?  Damn straight it was.The character and world-building elements of SC are every bit as great as in FC, to which game it is a direct sequel.  I loved the characters, loved the story and loved that you could tell a lot of care was put into this game.  One of the things that's especially nice is that there's a true sense of humor on display at points, as well.  The anime-style character portraits do a wonderful and often-humorous job of conveying the characters' emotions, and, as in FC, there are treasure chests that, if you interact with them post-looting will give you a sarcastic message about doing so.So emotion and humor and character and all of those nice RPG elements are present.  What about the gameplay?  I tend to be a fan of JRPGs that show you the monsters onscreen instead of having random battles (not that I don't love a number of those, as well), and if you're careful or have the right equipment you can always decide if you want to stop and fight or are in too much of a hurry to be bothered with it at the time.  You shouldn't need to grind in either FC or SC - the game rewards experience based on comparing your level with the enemy defeated, so underleveled characters play catch up fairly quickly.The areas are generally well-laid out, although there are a few dungeons late game you might find yourself getting lost in if you aren't paying attention.  Design is good, and there is attention to detail everywhere.  The graphics are somewhat dated but plenty serviceable and there are options for things like anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering and HD fonts and features that make the game more presentable on a modern system.  You'll notice that its technology is older, but unless you're really invested in that aspect, you won't care.""Regular"" battles can be somewhat tedious, though if you set yourself up right you can usually eliminate normal opponents pretty quickly.  The orbment system is interesting and versatile, and for those who played FC there are a number of further upgrades and changes that enhance battle and the number of arts(spells) you have available.  My understanding is that originally FC and SC were one game that had to be split into parts, and you can definitely see that here, as SC builds and expands upon what was already laid out in FC in a very natural way.Most of the music is good, some of it great (although I miss the battle music from FC).  I still hate the music that plays in the city of Bose.  I think if Bose had catchier music I would not have put down FC for so long, and it returns in SC.  Oh well, you can't have everything. There are a couple of gripes - in the back third of the game, you do some retreading over prior ground and have a section where it's ""go here, fight X enemy"" followed immediately by ""go here now, and fight Y enemy"" that is kind of a grind, but there's still more than enough story to carry you through.  The final area is lovely, well-designed and feels like the climactic finale that you probably were hoping to finally get after the pain of FC's cliffhanger.  As for how much you get to have a certain character in your party...you'll just have to play the game.So, in short, if you have FC then I recommend SC, even if you haven't finished FC yet, as you will inevitably have to know what happens next (and you will, even if you currently have FC on standby like I did).  And if you have neither, but the above sounds appealing and you can deal with the few flaws I mentioned, and are willing to invest the time in a story that starts slow only to keep building in power through the two games, why not buy both?

												Trails in the Sky SC not only equals the original game in terms of storyline, characters, music, battle system, humor, and many other aspects, but improves upon these elements as well. For those of you who have already played the first chapter and enjoyed the experience, you're in for a treat. Get the second chapter--no discussion. If you're a big fan of story-heavy JRPGS with the classic Japanese battle system playstyle but haven't played the first or the second chapter and want to enjoy one of the best if not THE best JRPG series of the decade, then look no further. The story is deep, rich, and full of surprising plot twists that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. The characters are unique and interesting, each with their own quirks and way of speaking. EVERY single individual in this game has a personality to them. Even the seemingly unimportant NPCs like farmers, shop keepers, inn managers, etc. Also, a lot of times the music of some games may seem underwhelming when placed in context of a great story. But this is not the case with Trails in the Sky. Falcom did a great job in composing and implementing masterful pieces of music into the game. Each scene, boss bottle, environment,  and conversation have different feelings. And of course, the battle system is what the player is responsible for in the game. Although the thought of another turn-based JRPG may turn you off, don't be fooled. It's not your typical JRPG. Crafts, arts, random buff generator on the side, teamwork, and strategic placement of your squad is essential to ensuring your success in the battles. Overall, the game is extremely well-done in terms of XSEED bringing Trails in the Sky to the international stage. Little to no bugs, English translations that are not only grammatically correct but have life to them. It's truly a masterpiece. The worst part of my experience playing this game was getting to the end and realizing that it will take another several years before the next game is localized for the English-speaking market. Hopefully this game does well on the international market so it encourages XSEED to think about localizing the 3rd game!!			"

												Remember, you need to play the prequel to this first before playing this! This is a amazing direct continuation of the prior game, together they make a pair.Others have already hit on what makes this game so great. If you're looking for a short version, I'm going to  write mine below:* Everything about the prequel is about twice as good here. Liked the first? You'll love the second. There's twice as much content here (literally, my play time is just about double) and I still missed quite a bit (~10 hours worth). The price tag is worth it -- between the two games you get about ~140 hours of game. This is fully scripted, text rich, game-play. How many games will give you an epic game of this length for $50 USD total? Even at full price, buy this. It's a no brainer.* The character development is absolutely outstanding and should not be underplayed. Since this is a LONG game, it's not unreasonable to say you become attached to the cast of characters and many of them are on their way back in this game. Of course, there a few noteworthy additions.* The amount of depth that goes into what you have done in Liberl and how it makes subtle changes is a joy. Sure, we have games like Skyrim where micro-changes in the world state causes all sorts of different behavior. However, Trails takes this one step further and gives each character unique reactions to situations and the ability to further expression their personality during events. For example, during key battle events each character may have their own commentary they provide based on their history or what had happened tens of hours ago.* This point is debatable -- the battle system is dated but I think it is still a joy to play, just not on normal for RPG veterans. Hard-mode is too top heavy, that is more difficult towards the beginning. For most players, I would suggest hard mode but you have to have patience to get past the first ten or so hours... and that is disappointing. Luckily, this is a sequel so you'd be consider buying this if you fell in love with the first.That being said, play Hard or Nightmare, Normal is too simple. However, that ALSO being said, this game can absolutely stand on its own without the battle system... so play on Normal if you just want the cinematic feel, I guess! "

												Amazing game. I thought I had outgrown JRPGs (I'm 37) because the last good one I played was probably FF9 or maybe FF10... Turns out I have not outgrown JRPGs. I just hadn't found a really good one in the last 10 years. A game with good story, charming characters and focus on good, sensible world building instead of flashy graphics (hi FF13...). The ""Trails..."" series is easily the best JRPGs I have played in the last decade, the best since classics like Xenogears and Working Designs charming translation of the Lunar series.			"

												XSEED, a localization company notorious for desecrating masterpieces with stale memes, misplaced references, and hideous fonts, actually managed to hold themselves back from completely destroying this one. Since the story is one of this game's most prominent features, it's really a good thing that they did. It didn't escape unscathed, though; the main font is pretty bad, and they UNIRONICALLY use Comic Sans multiple times in this game (though thankfully not in places you'll see all the time.)Unless you speak Japanese, it's this localization or nothing, so in all seriousness I am grateful to XSEED. I do wish they'd quit it with the awful Internet memes. It's like they don't know memes age like milk. I sure like playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana and seeing ""Forever Alone"" pop up on my screen. Men of class and taste can distinguish flash-in-the-pan memes from more long-lasting ones, but even then, you should either write real comedy or not attempt humor at all, because memes are garbage.Basically the point of this review is that XSEED should hire me.

												If you enjoyed the first chapter of Trails in the Sky, pick this one up without hesitation.  If you are new to the series, start with the first game, as this one takes place literally the day after the first game ends.  This isn't the sort of game where you can jump in with the sequel.How does the SC compare to FC?  I found the first chunk of the game to be much slower than the first, but I felt the finale was significantly better than the one in the first game.  The battle system is the same in both games, the only difference being the inclusion of some new quartz and arts.  SC is longer than FC, so be prepared for that.  Overall, I really love the series and am glad I got the chance to play through them both.Now to wait for the Third!			"

												I'm not even going to write a long review, simply because I'm still left empty after finishing this game. What I will say is this:It is arguably the best JRPG of the last decade when it comes to establishing world building, character development, pacing and execution of plot. It's the kind of game that will stick with you until you play a game with elements that will make an impact as strong as it does. While the gameplay remains relatively simple especially for JRPGs nowadays, its overall presentation and build-up spanning the length of 2 games is something that is rare in these times. If I would force anyone to play a game, this would definitely be it. "

												If you thought the first game was incredible, the second chapter will blow your cranium to oblivion. This game improves on the previous chapter in every way possible. The story goes on full cylinders from start to finish, with returning and new characters appearing with brick solid storylines that make you care immensely. The combat expands further with more Orbments to work with allowing for more awesome Arts to be utilized to really dazzle your screen. There is of course, the soundtrack, oh my gosh, the soundtrack, what a beast it is! The first soundtrack was fantastic, but this game's blows it away, especially the boss battle themes that get you pumped up for a satisfying fight! Not gonna lie, this game is huge. Took me slightly over 100 hours to finish it on Hard difficulty!I am updating this review now that I finally finished this masterpiece on Nightmare difficulty. It was one hell of a journey with a lot of experimentation to overcome its plethora of challenges. The game may seem unfair at times due to its spike in difficulty, especially during the Prologue, but once you get passed those obstacles, you will feel like a king, or queen if you are lady, for beating such odds. If you intend to take the challenge, be fully prepared for a long haul as you are going to need to do a A LOT of farming in order to actually stand a chance against the bosses. You have been warned! ;)If you are new here, leave this page now, go buy First Chapter, finish it, then come back and pick up this epic slice of heaven! You will not regret it! *Oh and be sure to finish the First Chapter with 100% completion, you will be rewarded at the start of this game for your efforts.			"

												Small note: I have finished the game offline, and am currently on my second playthrough, hence explaining my relatively low playing hours on Steam. Will get around to finishing it again once I'm done playing FC on the PSP.This is a review for both games in the franchise.Video games are a medium of entertainment like no other; they can tell engaging stories and present them like no other medium can, they can involve interactions with countless characters and can make us view characters in various ways depending on various routes, quests and interactions (novels are much more restricted in these aspects).And yet, video games often fail at reaching many people, and despite constantly evolving and presenting stories like no other medium can (examples being the likes of Shadow of the Colossus or The Last of Us), due to ignorance and a lack of understanding about the medium as a whole.An issue that plagues gamers in general nowadays is how to view graphics as well; on one hand, graphics are better than ever, and can enhance the overall experience (whether it's atmosphere, gameplay or simply the game as a whole looking nice). On the other hand, there are gamers craving the old-school appeal of the likes of Chrono Trigger or The World Ends with you, where the games are more focused on the dialogue, character interactions and world exploration.The game I'm mentioning in this review is an old-school game that emerged in an age where people are leaning to the former rather than the latter, though story-based games aren't without their fair share of fans.Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a game with a rather strange history. The game is easily among the biggest JRPG franchises in Japan, yet has cult classic status elsewhere; for those unaware, a cult classic is something that has a small following, yet the fans of whatever it is absolutely adore and may go so far as to hold it as one of the best in its genre for whatever reason. Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (from this point onward referred to as just Trails in the Sky) is one such game.The game was originally released in 2004, and was eventually translated in 2011. A sequel to the game, referred to as Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC (short for second chapter) was originally released in 2006, and translated in 2015.The game follows two characters, Estelle (a tomboy who has an obsession with sneakers) and her adopted brother Joshua (whose past is a complete mystery). They become bracers at the beginning of the story, and face various challenges along the way.While the premise will undeniably turn some people off, the storyline is a lot more than what it seems. The game deals with a wide variety of themes, whether its war and the effect it has on various people, the effect using a particular resource has on people, how much are people willing to sacrifice for peace and much, much more. The story is also epic in scale, and by the end of the first game the player will wonder if there is a resolution to the dozens of subplots going on (small spoiler: yes for the most part, though I still want the third chapter over).The characters are among the most lively I've ever seen in any work of fiction of general, with some of the funniest dialogue I've ever read (the game has practically no voice acting) as well as being extremely developed with a great deal of care and subtlety. A lot of effort was put to make the characters follow conventional tropes only on a superficial level and make them very multi-layered and complex, making them come off as (and this isn't easy to do) human. In fact, the game's greatest strength is how natural and human everything feels. The character interactions, story events and dialogue never feel forced or unnatural, making it easier for the player to be immersed in everything that happens.Another massive positive that connects with my opening point that games can tell stories no other medium can tell is how lively the world is. There are literally hundreds of NPCs, each with their own personality, motivations and backstories, and interacting with them from the first game to the second game can vary wildly (especially if you maintain save files from the first chapter to the second). This is extremely rare among video games, which almost never give any semblance of a personality to NPCs, much less continuous development or any interesting interactions.The gameplay is turn-based, mainly revolving around managing and upgrading orbments, and within battle paying attention to benefits as well as casting arts. The game is relatively easy, but has massive difficulty spikes while fighting bosses, making it challenging yet extremely strategic since there are also various benefits depending on the turn a character is fighting. These benefits can be received by foe and ally alike, and a large portion of the gameplay is dedicated to making sure your allies receive those benefits.The graphics are extremely dated by modern standards, but also rather fitting for the game, matching its retro feeling. The soundtrack is easily among the best in any video game period, and manages to never feel out of place or unfitting the scene or battles it plays in. Seriously, look up a few tracks on YouTube and try to tell me its bad music, I dare you.I cannot recommend this game highly enough, especially if you are fond of engaging storylines and want something more old-school.

												A flawed gem in the genere of JRPGs that if you can look past its flaws delivers a decent story with pretty good world building.  I found myself being engrossed in the problems the characters faced as I traveled around the kingdom of Liberl. If you are a fan of JRPGs consider going back and buying the first game( this one won't make sense unless you played the first), but if you are not a JRPG fan you might want to go elsewhere to get your feet wet first. Check out the several old Final Fantasy games first, or the recently Steam re-release of Disgaea( I want that at some point)   That being said both games have a slow first 1/3,  the 2nd 1/3 builds up, and both the first and second game's last 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat.  The first game involves a sister and (adapted...) brother, Estelle and Josha, traveling around the kingdom and doing odd jobs in the various regions, but as you progress it becomes clear a sinster conspiricy is afoot that threatens the kingdom of Librel( this becomes why the final 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat).  The second game picks up after the first and it becomes clearer why the Society mentioned in the game description did what they did in the first game. I can understand the slow first 1/3 to an extent since we get to invest in the characters and meet people around the kingdom giving us a sense of investment when the games' climaxes occur.In general making something longer doesn't make it better, and I feel like there just isn't enough art assets to cover both the 1st and 2nd game and keep it fresh throughout.  Even though the designers clearly tried to rearange the buildings in various towns and such I can't shake the nagging feeling that despite it LOOKING different, the envirnments just don't FEEL different.  Could just be me though.  Ah yeah,  dungeons don't give you an overhead map so it makes navigating them frustraiting if they are in a forest or underground cave due to their irregular layout so do not rotate the camera while in those dungeons.  It helps keep your bearings.Combat I feel misses a few marks. Granted at the same time of playing through Trails in the Sky SC I am also playing XCOM 2 so that may be coloring my expectaitions of a turn based combat system. It is a standard square based grid you move around. You can attack, special attack or do orbal arts( ie magic).  The game makes a big deal about building your magic circuit up with various kinds of gems in order to get the best stat upgrades and by experimenting withlinking the correct gems together to unlock new magic spell.  Unfortunitly the game also makes them somewhat expensive, so I feel like the game isn't giving me the room to experiment.  I found the characters special attacks and basic attacks more effective most of the time since magic requires a turn to charge up.  Granted I was playing the 2nd game on easy so that made the combat a bit dull, mainly becasue normal diffculty on the first game had a difficulty curve that was flat for the first 1/2 then spiked during boss fights, which was just frustraiting.  So in the end I felt combat could have used a once over in the development of the game, and a more consistently rising difficulty curve so I don't instictly pick easy.  One last thing, prioritize upgrading Estelle and Joshua since the other characters come in and out of use depending on the needs of the plot.Which leads me to the plot, while engaging, does interfere with the game progression on occasion. Why should I spend resources to upgrade these other characters if they won't be around to help in a fight?  Also the frequent traveling to and around the various hub towns is begging for some kind of fast travel option to warp back to the nearest town to complete a quest. This could probably have cut a lot of unecesary faffing about, and ultimatly removed less interesting game time with minimal cost to the overall experience.Last but not least the soundtrack of the first game is decent, and the second game is excellent.  Every track works well in the situations they are played and as I'm updating this review I am listening to the 2nd game's OST So in the end the 2 Trails in the Sky games are worth your time if you want a somewhat classic JRPG with a solid story  and characters.  The gameplay, while flawed,  never gets near ragequit territory.			"

												If you're here because you completed the FIRST part, then just buy the damn second chapter, its worth it. If you haven't played this game at all then go check out the FIRST one, this is the second part.But here's my review for the game as a whole:Let me start by asking this... Why haven't you bought this game already??Trails in the Sky is an AMAZING rpg with soooo many unique and fun bits to it. The 3 main things about this game are: Very long adventure, Awesome and emotional story, and unique (in my opinion) gameplay! If you're looking for a game with those 3 things then this game is perfect! You've got many diverse characters, lots of side-quests and secrets to find, fun & flexible fighting, AAAAAAAAND you can gamble all your money away in a casino in one of the towns! :39.8/10Overall - If you have 80-120 hours to spare, and want a fun game to get attatched to, THIS game is perfect! Also, the game includes a lot of dialog, so if you dont like that kind of stuff then leave now, but otherwise, PLAY IT. Oh, and save a lot.			"

												Solid, entertaining JRPG with a deep story and great dialogue. If you've already played FC, then you already know what you're getting into, but a lot more (it feels like FC is really just the prologue). In other words, if you played and finished FC, and you enjoyed it, then you should get this. I hope the game sells well to support the translators on this colossal task!			"

												If you played the first one and liked it, the second one is more of the same.  There is a greater focus on the individual characters here and most of the locations are reused from the first game, though there are some new ones.  The endgame is also much better than in the first and features some memorable boss fights.			"

												The Second Chapter expands on the first game in the series and add to its battle and magic system. The story continues to be really engaging and interesting. The characters continue to grow. It's about twice the length of the first one, with lots more to do, lots of optional side-quests and activities. Really excellent game!			"

												If you haven't played FC, don't play this game.- Fantastic world building.- Good pacing.- Memorable characters with great character development who even feel like friends. Even talking to NPCs are rewarding as learn what they go throughought their daily lives every time you progress the story.- Great storyline that's heartwarming.- Superb soundtrack (probably one of my favourites).- Battle system is fun and doesn't feel repetitive.- Never felt the need to grind and just flowed with the story.- Intersting sidequests but some of them can be easily missed, so 100% may require a guide.I truly wish more rpgs were like this. Personal 10/10. Well done Nihon Falcom.			"

												Pros:-Great story and dialogue-Estelle has some of the best one-liners-NPCs actually have their own story going on rather than simply being glorified newspapers like in other RPGs, making for better world building-More bosses with S-Crafts-All orbment slots can be used in the beginning, making it much easier to customize characters.Cons:-The sepith drops are pretty low and are actually capped at 70 of each element per battle.-As of posting this, some of the achievements are still broken-Most of the treasure chest double dipping messages are copy-pasted-I feel that movement should get a shorter delay, possibly scaled on the distance moved.-Enemy radar works in certain areas, but usually not in dungeons-I don't quite understand some of the villains' motivations (Direwolf and Bell)-The Sky Bandit Stronghold area lacks a proper means of healing. Damn Capuas are cutting corners!UPDATE: I was pleasantly surprised to see that more of the copy-pasted chest messages were replaced with unique ones in the recent version.			"

												Outdoes the first chapter in every way, which is to say, it steps well above most other JRPGs. The world knows you. Responds to some of your small, irrelevant actions. Responds to the world events you're apart of. There are so many unique lines that are often phoned in by other JRPGs. Every vendor, townsman, child, receptionist. The story spans the entire country, and while it starts out mirroring the first in a few ways (just with different motivations), that changes around mid-way, where it goes beyond regional events and you become involved in a much more involved story.Unfortunately, while the story concludes well enough, it still leaves a significant number of holes for the third chapter to occupy. For better or for worse.Combat system is still the same relatively simplistic one from the first chapter, though due to being able to reach 90 without much effort, and having much higher levels of orbments, your characters can do so much more.

												If you're here because you completed the FIRST part, then just buy the damn second chapter, its worth it. If you haven't played this game at all then go check out the FIRST one, this is the second part.But here's my review for the game as a whole:Let me start by asking this... Why haven't you bought this game already??Trails in the Sky is an AMAZING rpg with soooo many unique and fun bits to it. The 3 main things about this game are: Very long adventure, Awesome and emotional story, and unique (in my opinion) gameplay! If you're looking for a game with those 3 things then this game is perfect! You've got many diverse characters, lots of side-quests and secrets to find, fun & flexible fighting, AAAAAAAAND you can gamble all your money away in a casino in one of the towns! :39.8/10Overall - If you have 80-120 hours to spare, and want a fun game to get attatched to, THIS game is perfect! Also, the game includes a lot of dialog, so if you dont like that kind of stuff then leave now, but otherwise, PLAY IT. Oh, and save a lot.			"

The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC is, without a doubt, the most impressive JRPG I have ever played. Every aspect of this game is incredibly well-executed: the story is one of the most memorable I have come across, the battle system is fine-tuned and engaging, and the music is immaculate, correctly setting the appropriate tone for each situation in the game.However, most JRPGs (and games in general) have the qualities previously stated. What really makes this game stand out from the others is its attention to detail on the more minor aspects of the game. For one, most characters (including non-playable characters) have their own backstory. Even though these may be unrelated to the game’s main plot, it is always interesting, and sometimes shocking, to hear about these and what shaped these characters’ identities in the time setting of the game.As this game is a direct sequel from the its predecessor, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, many features and mechanics were carried over into this game with some small adjustments made here and there. Chain Crafts were introduced to provide a new option to players deciding on the best way to take on an engagement. Orbments and Arts have been slightly “rebalanced” in such a way that the player really has to think about whether they want better attributes or new Arts to use in battle. Additionally, there is a decent amount of choice between what equipment to choose for each character. In the first game, newly discovered equipment generally offered better overall attributes. However, this game allows you to choose between improved defense, attributes to make your character better at Arts, or attributes to make your character more agile. Though this detail is rather moderate, it goes a long way to provide the player with more character customization.All of this is what makes The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC such a wonderful game to play through as well as a better game than its predecessor. I thank you XSEED for taking their precious time localizing this and cannot wait to play the next localized installment in The Legend of Heroes series which, at the time of writing this review, would be The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel.

												In the festering world of RPGs or gaming in general in which graphics,speedruns that would make Sonic say too fast and unneeded fanservice that would make you grit your teeth in rage rather than entertain you take precedence over everything else, this is what the gaming world needs but not what it deserves. This is my attempt to do a good review and sound not stupid.Characters that are far from stereotypes,supposed accusations of mary-sue that are just actually character devlopment from simply learning from past mistakes(give or take a few tries...) and a world grounded in real world politics and situations while at the same time, a fantastic setting that can keep you entertained and move alongside you.It makes realistic situations part of the charm rather than ditching it like most others,after all there is a good reason why ""reality is stranger than fiction"" is a saying. If you have the patience to read and immerse yourself in an RPG world that defies the usual cliches that came with the genre, than this game is the one for you.P.S:If the wall of text boxes put you off and make you want to skip in a hurry because you want to save,whenever there is dialog stop thinking that you are playing a game but reading a novel. You will enjoy it much better.			"

												I immediately bought this game after replaying and finishing the first part of the Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the need to split this game in multiple parts. But then I quickly realized just how huge SC was. I mean, I spend even more hours with this than even the first part.Combat-wise, not much has changed. You can use more ""Arts"" due to the orbments having received an upgrade in universe, and you also get more ""S-Crafts"" as you level up, of course. The only new feature is the ""Chain"" attack, in which you can have multiple characters attack an enemy (or enemies) at once.Story-wise, I have to say that I loved learning more about The Society and, of course, Joshua's past. You also get to see the effects your actions in the first game had as you re-visit every city. Unfortunately, there aren't THAT many new locations. But I have to admit, the new places you do visit do look awesome. I especially liked the last area in the game.In any case, if you liked the first game you'll probably love this one too. And I for one hope that XSEED localizes The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd, which is an Epilogue of sorts where you play as Kevin, soon!			"

Combat system may or may not be the best, but nevertheless enjoyable.SC brings a very nice nostalgic touch to people who've finished FC, as well as noticeable improvements to lots of aspects to the game without destroying the original feel.Definitely not your average run-of-the-mill JRPG, personally I think the LoH series ranks alongside other fantastic JRPG series such as Final Fantasy and Suikoden. Worth every penny and every moment of your time.			"

												I just finished this game and am compelled to write a review of it. Being a fan of games like Chrono Trigger, Lunar, and Beyond the Beyond, etc., makes this type of game appealing to me, but ultimately Steam reviews persuaded me to purchase Trails in the Sky FC. After finishing FC a few weeks ago, I was in for a total surprise as I had no idea that it was released a while back and that people were waiting FOREVER for SC to be translated! I rejoiced to learn that this game had just been released within a month of me knowing that it even existed! FC was purchased by me several months ago but I hadn't had the time to ""get into it"" with work, etc. When I finally did begin to play it, it started slow, but the moment you get hooked, you get hooked! I have played the two titles a combined 200 hours or so, and am sad to not be able to purchase and play the 3rd today! This is a wonderful story, and you can't help but get pulled right into it. I will not give any details of the story itself. I can only say if you are a human being, you should do yourself a favor and purchase both of these games! You will be very glad you did. These games are so good, I wish I knew Japanese!!! because if I did, I would immediately acquire all of the other titles which are only in Japanese at the present time and get to work on all of them :) Highly recommended - Good music - Variety of Magic and Optional Side Quests - Fantastic Storyline - Characters for any style of play - Lots of Movie Scenes - What more could you ask for?!

												Just finished the game. Hands down one of the best JRPG's there are on the market. Heck. Trails in the Sky is one of the best JRPG's ever made.I am a ""veteran"" JRPG player, been playing since elementary school. I have played a quite big number of famous titles (Final Fantasy etc.) and also other less famous titles (Wild Arms etc.). Only a few of them had me hooked up, making me have all sorts of emotions while playing. This game being one of them.The story of Trails is one of the most deep and emotion twisting story of all the JRPG's i played. From the start it seems like a simple ""cliché"" story about a girl trying to climb to be the best [insert job here]. But, the lore of the game and everything happening around the protagonist(s) are overwhelming. I personally think you can write a whole novels series based on this one game alone.The plot of Trails is one of the best in its genre. The battle system is unique and fun. The soundtracks are somewhat nostalgic, I don't know why. The NPC's have their own relations to each and every other character in the game. Yes, EVERY NPC.Even after beating the game, I am still curious about the rest of the plot around the game, hoping XSEED will quickly release the translated Trails in the Sky TC.If you are an avid player of JRPG's, I definitely recommend Trails in the Sky FC and SC. It won't disappoint.10/10			"

												Must play for anyone who looks back on it's childhood having played all the jRPG greats. Final Fantasy IV, XI, Chrono Trigger, Lufia etc.Rich and detailed world. Characters with actual development. Very fun combat system. The magic system allows for a good layer of strategies. While it's plot won't break any new ground in term of jRPG, it harkens back to the classic and I dare say surpass most of them.If you keep seeing modern jRPG and thinking back how turn based Final Fantasies were so good, and old games were so much better look no further and you will find a story, and diverse caste of characters in my opinion better written than anything pretty much any classic tropy jRPG. Not every game needs to innovate with never before seen idea (most of the plot has been seen in animes and other jRPG but never pulled off with such elegance.)There's definitely a lot of text to read and both games (FC and SC) are totally ''slow burn'' type of game but the pay off is amazing in the end.I can't recommend it enough.

												That game is an absolute masterpiece. I was scared after First Chapter that SC would have trouble beeing better or even equal but waow. How far from the truth I was, the story is the best I have ever seen in a JRPG so far. It is deep, very deep, but it does not lose its way in its own complexity, everything has a meaning and a purpose. It is so well written and paced, I can't even imagine what TC will be like. The characters are a big part to the game's success, Estelle's journey from an annoying teenager to such a strong willed young woman was amazing to follow. Joshua, Oliver and all the supporting characters are all so fleshed out and not overlooked that it made this story feel like it was important to me. That is a game that will leave a mark like not many other have managed to do. FF VI did that to me when I was 12, I didn't think a game would manage to do it again 18 years later to the adult I am now. It is hard to find that kind of experiences, it is a very rare and precious thing. I could not recommend this game enough.			"

												It has been a loooong looong long while since I got addicted this badly to a game. And it's such a shame that the third chapter isn't translated (yet). I want to play it super badly and will insta buy it once it comes out. I'm a big fan of these series and will continue to buy other related games when they will be available on steam.Btw I'm super in love with Ouroboros. The 'bad' guys all are so greatly designed, for once bad guys don't♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Weissman, phantom thief and Renne are my favourite characters in these games (along with Agate). I feel like such a dweeb.			"

												10 out of 10, just amazingIf you are reading this and have played first chapter, do not even hesitate to buy it.  It does not matter if it is not on sale or not (because it doesnt go on sale that much anyway).  If you are reading this and did not play the first game, do not hesitate to buy both.In my opinion, this game did so many things right that the first did not, the biggest of all allowing you to change who is in your party at any given moment (except the obvious Estelle and maybe who absolutely needs to be in your party at the time.  This game is also twice as long as the first, which we all know that in JRPGs, longer is always better, especially for a game like this.  My only issue with this game (and it is not very big) is that you never have enough water sepith, water-type quartz being very useful, especially for your health.  It just seems that if you are going to make water quartz more abundant and necessary, you could have given us more opportunities to allow us to craft it.It doesn't need to take a JRPG fan to love this game, only one who likes to read A LOT of dialogue.

												A really fantastic and heartwarming game with an intricate skill system, interesting combat, and memorable music.  Everything from the way the npcs go about their daily lives to the way they went so far as to add amusing little quips to previously looted boxes as a helpful way of reminding you what you already looted just show a remarkable attention to detail.  I would say anyone who really enjoys reading, enjoys the role playing part of the RPG, or just in general loves a good story would find this game to be a well loved and treasured part of their collection.  I only hope falcom will continue to release this series here on steam.  ^^			"

												the story is right after first chapter and this one is way longer than the first chapter, with much more orbal combination and skillpros:one of the best JRPG out there, good story, skill (trust me you will spend at least an hour just to adjust the orbal combination and see the book a few times), alot of craft skill and S-Break for each character and good musiccons:some bug still there, sometimes the game even crash, some side quest got strange clue especially on blueblanc quest and you need to go around every single house and every corner of the city just to find a clue. and the worst part, almost every single boss and his minions on could resist almost all status effects (mute,petrify,slow,poison,etc) which means all kind of debuffs are useless because on normal battles you can just wipe out all monsters with AoE damage skill, getting worse when the OP joshua is coming back with his highest time orb skill (abyss fall,etc) can wipe stray monster with 1 hit skill AoE, so basically, the battle is mostly on attack art, healing, and buff (shield, speedup,etc)need the 3rd chapter~			"

Posted: January 31, 2016
												TL;DR: If you played the first game and liked it, this game is worth your time and money. Buy it when you have the finances for it. If you didn't like the first game for certain elements, you most likely won't like this one either since it retains basically all of them on top of all the new stuff.Here's my review of the first game:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198100856137/recommended/251150/[Story - good]: It picks up mere hours after the first game's ending. The heavy dialogue is still there, be prepared for a lot of reading. The atmosphere changes however. Instead of being about a fledgling bracer learning the ropes and introducing elements of the world, it shifts to a more mythical and politically charged setting with a lot more at stake. There is also no huge cliffhangar ending like the first game. You will be mostly satisfied with how it ends but it still manages to leave some loose ends open for The Third.[Characters - excellent]: Without trying to spoil much, I can say that if you didn't like Estelle's treatment in the first game, it's like night and day in the second. She does nothing but improve as a character. As for other characters that didn't get much development or explanations, that all changes too. Aside from a couple of new characters introduced to tie SC together into the Third, everyone gets some sort of character progression.[Graphics - depends]: I already mentioned that I love these graphics in the first game's review. SC also reuses a lot of the same areas from the first game but manages to make them feel different from when you visited them the first time through. It deserves to be noted that there's some very awesome in-game graphics cutscenes AND some epic feeling animated cinematics in SC.[Music - excellent]: Like the graphics, SC reuses some of the music of the first game. However there's still a lot more variety than what the first game had which I think was a good move on Falcom's part. Overall it feels a lot more epic to fit with the change of atmosphere of the story.[Combat - good]: There was a lack of variety with the first game's combat ultimately. SC does manage to add more though. Chain Crafts for combo attacks, new Quartz allows for more spell options, a slew of new equipment and accessories allows for more freedom with how you set your group up. You can also choose your party setup more frequently with more options on who can accompany you and with the rebalancing of character's Crafts, you should have a tougher time deciding who you want to take with you.[Length - good]: As it has been mentioned so many times already, let me reiterate, the first game can take 40-50 hours to beat the first time through... SC is at least 80 hours or more depending on how thourough you are, so at least twice as long as the first. No matter how much I like the story, I feel it's important to mention that the pacing can really slow down, to the point that you may feel like stopping. It is worth trudging through the slow points though because when it picks up, it really picks up![Replayability - average]: I haven't actually been able to play a new game+ yet but I'm willing to bet that some people may not want to play through a second time or more due to the pacing and length. However, the upside of playing the Trails games multiple times is that you may miss things (item, story or character-wise) the first time through because you're focused on reaching the end. One of the greatest stregths Falcom games have is the details they add to characters or the environment that makes them feel more worth exploring, this doesn't matter to everyone who plays RPGs but to some, it makes a difference.[Bugs - average]: I haven't kept up as much with SC on what's broken or fixed because I haven't had as much time to dedicate to it. But I'm confident XSEED is still hard at work trying to smash the problems littering SC. At the very least there was one potentially game-breaking bug late in the game but has an in-game workaround to avoid it entirely... plus the game has only been out for a few months and the team dedicated to Trails is rather small, patience is a virtue.My big negative from the first game still exists in SC, not being able to skip animations during combat. At least with more spell variations now, I can cast more than just White Gehenna spam though. :)			"

The writing is that good. The gameplay, while better than FC, is not special in any way.			"

The least I can do is thank Nihon Falcom for creating such an excellent engaging and engrossing experience, and thank XSEED for putting in some insane time and dedication to bring this title out. I have no words to express the amount of gratitude I feel for the fact that this title managed to get localized and released in English.From the bottom of my heart, thank you releasing FC and SC on Steam.

												Just a really short review: I liked the game even more than the first game and can pretty much say if you want to play a decent RPG game you should pick this up. The graphic and the fights aren't as good as in newer games but it fits right into the ""overall feeling"" of the game. I don't think of them as negative to be honest... just like a game with a different style. The story of the game is simply amacing and the main characters and of course many of the various NPC are pretty unique and they all pretty much grew dear to me... I haven't played a game in ages in which I really remembered so many different characters without even trying! It was like playing games like chrono trigger or other games which had a pretty good cast and weren't just some pixels on the TV screen. These two points are strong points of the game ... (You should play the first game before this one though or you won't enjoy the story... the first one has the same name here on steam, except the ""SC"" is not in the name)I think I can recomend this game to every fan of RPGs, Fantasy, JRPGs and everyone who wants to have a good story in the games they play... For people who just enjoy games like the old FF games, Chrono Trigger or similiar games it should even be a ""must to have game"" in my opinion. Ps.: sorry for my mediocre english, as it is not my native tongue ^^			"

												First, Let start with the Positive:Trails in the Sky SC bring the end to the Estelle stories which every player that played FC want to know about, The execution is done very well. The Structures, soundtracks, and characters, they all feel real. This series have always does great in world building stuff which SC dig deep into what they built in FC and expand it further. Even some side quests has a connection to each other and also from FC to SC. Moreover, some side quests even add more depth to not only main character but to normal npcs as well. However, there is also a negative side:Game structure overall is great, but some are repetitive. Lack of modern appeal may be an issues.Overall, it is a fantastic games that focus on world building and story more than any other JRPGs. Please give it a try. ALSO WARNING: Please finish FC first because it is a sequel.Moreover, Trail in the Sky the 3rd is coming too, as well as Trail of Cold Steel. So if you like the series please give theses game a try as well. Trail of Cold Steel is a new story that is part of the same world but take place in Erebonia, there may be some references here and there which is also part of what make this series a Great Series.

												Continuation of Trails in the Sky, this is the second chapter. The game plays basically the same, and the positives from the previous game are still seen here (good story, memorable characters, excellent writing and dialogues, and entertaining gameplay), so I will only touch on the difference here, and that is: female protagonist. This game is much more of a story of Estelle than the previous one was. And the game has a habbit of repeatedly making it known to you. In each chapter you'll hear the line, ""Estelle, you have grown"" or one of its variations (""Estelle, there is a new steel in you"", ""Estelle, you seem more mature"", etc.) thrown at you at least ten times. Problem is she has not really grown at all, so one is left wondering what the protagonist has done to deserve this constant praise. It also has a lot of illogical moments where said protagonist takes charge and commands action from those much senior to her. This considering the fact that Estelle is not meant to be smart in any way whatsoever as a character leaves us scratching our heads a little bit. I'm also not at all into sibling romance bullsh*t. Okay they aren't blood related, but they've been living in the same house for 5 years+ and are calling the same person their dad, and now suddenly get feelings for each other? Urgh. In that way this game is pretty restricting. You cannot make any important choices and are pretty much stuck watching a linear storyline unfold. These are just my opinions though, and if you like the character of Estelle, and have no problem with the whole Estelle x Joshua shipping, you'll enjoy this game just as much as the first.			"

												This might be my favorite game of all time.  To say such a thing betrays rather a lot about me, I know.  Obviously I love cheesy stuff.  JRPGs are kinda my bag.  Some romance involved can be okay.  I like heart, I like campiness.  It would be difficult to say what my favorite thing about this game is...the dialogue in particular made me laugh often, and the plot twists were actually pretty riveting.  At many points I thought of Shakespeare, due to the scope and style - the frequent lines drawn from plays like Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream helped push this comparison over the top.The 2.5D graphics are wonderful.  The music is breathtaking.  The characters never cease to make you feel.I beat this on Normal, which maybe I shouldn't have, because I'd overall call it pretty easy, battle-system-wise.  Nevertheless, battles were still engaging and fun.  (Those Abyss Worms near the end are infuriating though.)A++			"

												If you enjoyed the first game, why are you reading this?  It's more of that, except bigger and better.  And, y'know, cliffhanger resolution and all that.  You already know you want it.  Go buy it.  If you haven't played the first game, you also shouldn't be here.  It's a direct sequel, it starts pretty much immediately after the end of the first, go get the first game before starting this.   "

												One of the best written games I have ever played in this or any other genre. Worldbuilding is simply superb and puts almost every other game I have ever played to shame, the developers clearly put in significantly more work into their world than what is shown directly in this game, and that shines through in several points.

												FC was the best JRPG I've played in over a decade, with great depth and characters with a battle system that while not perfect, wasn't trying to do much with a billion gimmicks and was rock solid. And while I was eagerly awaiting SC, I had a feeling of dread in the back of my head that it would be a letdown. ""Yes, SC could be better but there's not a ton of room to improve. And will another 100 hours of the same still be fun at the end?""Well, expectations were blown away. Admittedly, I didn't really use the new chain craft system so there wasn't a ton of improvement in the battle system in my book. And unlike with Trails of Cold Steel 2 which felt the need to present ever-more-powerful arts and S breaks that eventually bordered on the absurd and resulted in a largely broken system where pretty much every boss but the final boss could be one or two-shotted, SC kept its balance which I appreciate - Even if it doesn't make much sense that Estelle has smacked a guy directly in the face 50 times with a metal staff and he's still standing. Hey, need to have some suspension of disbleief.Anyways, the story is where the game stepped up to the plate, and it hit it out of the park. Where it could have been sappy it was serious, while not taking away from the obvious emotional themes running through our protagonist's head. It did a lot to expand the world, and make you constantly want to know more about the world and other countries -which thankfully you get to explore more in Cold Steel, and if it's ever localized, the Crossbell arc.Overall, a truly masterful game that's stood the test of time that was expertly localized. Maybe about three typos in a ridiculous amount of text. Absolutely recommend this game for fans of JRPGs. Obviously play First Chapter first though.			"

												Finally, after all of the wait had come to fruition, the continuation of the story for Trails in the sky is here, packed with new great characters and the best music (in my opinion) from Trails in the sky (silver will is love, silver will is life). The story is one of the best I have had in recent years, and I am glad that I bought both the first chapter and this, the difficulty is no joke either as nightmare mode had wiped out my characters more often than not when I made mistakes. Overall I would recommend anyone who likes JRPGs to get this, as well as the first chapter. "

												If you've played the first game, this is a must play title.They just don't make games like this anymore these days, a truely well written RPG which will make you care about all the characters in a deeply explored world, it felt as if I was reading a good book and I just couldn't put it down.The biggest con is the slow pace can put off some players, especially if you're short on time. Both games combined will clock in at over 100-110 hours of play time to complete and it can certainly feel slow to get moving, but if you're looking for an interesting world with plot twists a plenty, you'll be more than happy with this one.

												Like others have been saying. This picks up after The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.Get Here . Please play it first. Another benefit of playing FC before SC is that your level carries over from a FC save data (that have made it through the end credits) to SC. If you start freash you will be Lv. 35 but for me I had a save data with Lv. 39 which helps out alot.I love the classic JRPG style game and wish to see more game like this. I as well await the for TC's release. Also i will be looking forward to the legend of heroes cold steel once it released. Thanks XSeed.			"

												The story is continued wonderfully and enganging from the very beginning, the dialogue is great and funny as always and Estelle is still the best girl.Also there are a few additions to the battle system that give you more options in fights than ever and make them slightly different than in the first game.On the technical side, I had a few hiccups here and there when I entered a new area but it was nothing major. In general, the game is as smooth as its predecessor.I can't recommend the Trails in the Sky series enough. It's one of the best, if not the best, JRPG you can get for your PC. And it's pretty cheap too. Both titles combined will give you at least 100 hours of JRPG-goodness with an engaging storyline, charming and believable characters, a very customisable skill system and challenging tactical battles.Forget about those crappy Final Fantasy remakes on Steam and buy Trails in the Sky 1+2 instead. You won't be disappointed.			"

												If you liked FC at all, I'd call this game near-essential. An improvement over FC in just about any way you care to name, and a hell of a lot of game for your money.I'd urge anyone interested in plot or character-focused games to give this series a look (though definitely starting with FC, as this game's a direct sequel), although bear in mind you're in for a lot of reading. If you think it looks interesting, give FC a go! The localisation of the rest of the series depends on the sales of these ones, so the more people interested, the better!			"

												There are very, very few JRPGs that are as good as Legend of Heroes series if you like your characters and dialogue.   Yes, far better than Final Fantasy, even better than Tales of [xxx] (which I also love).These games  have so much content that they don't even bother stocking random containers with random gold and items. There's so much content that you don't have to bother stealing other people's stuff.  Every single NPC has a consistent backstory and reason for existence - and their dialogue will change with every major event, even if you don't talk to them.There is literally no other game on the planet that has so much translated text as this one. And it's good stuff, lovingly translated, not filler. It's a real rarity in that the overarching plot is complex and impacts the local plot but isn't moronic like FF13.  Basically, it's a real, complex world with real people.They're kind of a slow burn... the combat is fairly fun, but nothing spectacular. The first game starts out pretty slow.  But at this point I absolutely have to find out what happens with Estelle and Joshua.			"

												Warning, this game will be long, it will be grindy, and it will be absolutely fantastic. I agree with the other reviews, this is likely one of the better JRPG's on Steam, if not the absolute best right now. Pros:The plot totally delivers. The soundtrack is reminiscent of the first game, but there's enough variety and nostalgia that you'll still feel right at home. The game picks up basically right where the first game left off. Cons:  Uhh...the third one's not out yet? Tips since I just finished the game (no spoilers, I promise)1. Play the first game first. (Come on, do I really have to say this?)2. Some characters are better at some 'roles' than others. Be sure to check the color of the lines on the orbal screen to get a better idea. 3.  Be thorough, talk to everyone -twice- if you're looking for a complete experience. XSEED did a heck of a job with all the dialogue, i'm baffled by the amount of text and time put in this game's development. 4. You will never ever ever have enough Sepith. 5. Beware of secret quests. Like the first game, these exist too. 6. Anything you have to spare, will be all you can spare if you're looking for a repeat experience. Depending on how it's done, at least. Best of luck out there, fellow bracers.			"

												If you liked the predecessor, you will like this game. It is story rich, has definite character development, and a good story. My only complaint is that there is too much dialogue for the NPC's. Not really a big deal, but if you accidentally start a conversation, as on my laptop happens too often, there are at least three popups of dialogue each time. It got really tedious, really fast. So much of the plot relies on talking to EVERYONE, too.  A little less of this would help the pace quite a bit, but it is not so much that it is a major deterent to buying the game. If you enjoy JRPG turn-based combat, you will love the game. It is definitely superior to the other games in this genre. Well worth the money.			"

												I reviewed this game for DieHard GameFAN. This is the short attention span summary of my review: It’s hard to believe, but The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC is finally out on PC and PSP. After a long and troubled localization period, XSEED hopes to satisfy fans of the original game who felt dissatisfied with the lack of conclusion, and they sure delivered. The writing is excellent, the gameplay is on point, and the second half pays off in spades. It’s just a shame that the first half drags its heels. And playing the original game is virtually a must before diving into this one. If you don’t mind spending another 50-70 hours in Liberl though, this is a must buy.			"

												Absolutely incredible game and follow up to FC.The biggest positives to the Trails games without a doubt has to be the wonderfully written characters. I know this is praise that you tend to hear a lot when talking about JRPG's, but the characters from this series are without a doubt some of the best, maybe even THE best written that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. The gameplay, while for the most part being the same as FC, has seen some refinement which improves upon the system further.It should be noted that the Trails games are very heavy on the dialogue and while that's definitely not a negative in my book I thought that I should make that clear. People who have played FC should know what to expect from a Kiseki game by now though.Highly recommended.			"

												An absolute classic gem of an JRPG, Trails SC picks up right where the original left off.Although the flow of the game seems to be slightly slower compared to FC, once the plot gets moving, boy does it get really moving.Once again, beautiful music, decent gameplay and a well-written storyline together with a world that feels so alive combines together to deliver one of the best JRPGs ever created.11/10, buy this if you have played FC, and tell all your friends to play this series and support xseed in their translation efforts.

												A fantastic rpg with an incredible depth, a direct sequal to the Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC.pros: -the world is rich in lore and each and every NPC got multiple lines of dialogue concerning current events in game. -sheer amount of text in this game, which, despite its enormity does not in any way get obstructive to game progression or somehow feels overwhelming for the player-gameplay and fights are rather fluid and well executed. There is no grind in this game to speak of, basically. Even though unused party members may fall behind in lvl, when needed they will catch up really quickly, thanks to exp mechanics.-all characters are multi-dimensional and well written, the plot is very intersting-very solid soundtrack, battle experience is heavily enhanced by epic music-a good amount of humour, which somehow does not interfere with the seriousness of situation the heroes find themselves incons:-while graphics overall are pleasant enough, in-game character models are laxing in my opinion-main protagonist sometimes can be quite obnoxious, though this is mostly offset but the rest of characters-only several characters actually died throughout 2 games, which stretches my suspense of desbelief rather heavily, considering the amount of firepower that gets used in both actual fights and cutscenes.-Hard difficulty in this game is MUCH harder than Hard difficulty in the first game, not actually a con, but something to be considered.-last dungeon requires you to beat !10 Hard bosses! in more or less, a row. Considering the flow of the rest of the game, last chapter can feel too intense.Overall, a majestic game that I do not regret in the slightest of buying. I truly hope that the developers (who are mostly Japanese-based console developers) will port and translate further games in the series to steam.			"

Trails in the Sky SC continues the story of Trails in the Sky directly after, so in case you haven't finished the first game yet, you should definitely go and play it before this one.Well first I wanna say big thanks to people who brought Trails series to Steam, you are doing gods work and I hope you will continue to do this in the future as well.My first playthrough was 60+ hours, so we are talking about pretty massive amount of content here. Do keep in mind how price tag in steam is under 30$. There is more than enough entertainment here than in most of the big companies cashgrab games today. Yes, im talking about you EA and Ubisoft.Pros+Amazing story I thought first game was awesome but devs showed that there is more to come+Soundtrack Beautiful piano composed themes as well as fast paced combat music, some of the best musical pieces I've ever heard.+CharactersUnique and different in every way, made the game really stand out.+SecretsI still couldn't bring myself to collect all the hidden things in this game.+Gameplay & Fighting mechanics Nothing more satisfying that wiping floor with effective combos and arts.Cons-Small plot holesWhile the story was awesome there were still few little details and questionsleft hanging after the end of the game. I wonder will these questions be answered in the sequels?-Time consumingYou might have a hard time getting into the game if you are busy in real life. So, quit your day job. "

												Whew.....where do i even start? At the time of this review I just got finished playing this game and this was one hell of a ride. I played the first game which was spectactular and eagerly awaited the second game, and it did not dissapoint....mostly. But I want to get this out while It's still fresh in my head, and to keep myself from rambleing I will have it divided into sections(Gameplay, Story, Characters,Setting and Music)Gameplay:The gameplay imo is the weakest aspect of the game, but only for the fact that a lot of the battles have a tendency to be dragged out and nothing else, aside from that the combat in this game was VERY engaging and this is coming from someone who perfers Action-Based RPG's over turnbased ones. Make no mistake this game is tough and it will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you aren't prepared, even against normal encounters, but boss battles Oooooh man.....(First one that comes to mind is a certain boss at the end of chapter 7) it might not be hard for some people but you will get a decent amount of game overs regardless. Overall while not my perfered combat style for games, it's engaging enough to keep from being boring.Story: The story picks up directly from the last game, and starts of with main character Estelle going off to train in order to find joshua who went awol at the end of the last game after reclaiming his memories, a lot of which has to do with joshuas prior relationship with the society of oroboros. The story itself is very simple, but has multiple twists and turns and is very well written. You always want to know what happens next, it never leaves you wanting and has plenty of humor to offset some of the more....dark elements that show up in the game(and I mean DARK seriously some of the stuff you find out goes on behind the scenes in this seemingly innocent world is baffleing and almost ALWAYS involves erebonia in some way, I can say with a straight face that by the end of the game I was very satisfied.Characters: Oh the characters are all Gems(Except Gilbert, ♥♥♥♥ Gilbert) Oh everyone of the main cast is likeable. From Girly Tomboy Estelle, Prim and Proper Kloe, Hot Headed Agate, Bizzare Oliver, Sultry Schera and of course the Mysterious Joshua. And the antagonists, while yes evil are never obnoxious or spurnful except for the final boss....that guys an jerk. Oh the list just goes on and on, and I could go on for days. But to make a long story short, the cast is incredibly memorable and adds a lot of flavor to the story, and every single one of them develops massively as the game goes on.Setting: What they did for this game was exceptionally clever. The game takes place in the kingdom of Liberl, a small independent nation with highly advanced technology on the western side of the continent Zumeria.However that is not the important part, what is note worthy is that it is but one of 4 we know so far on the Zumerian continent. There is the Aforementioned Kingdom of Liberl, The Erbonian Empire, The Republic of Calvard and the autonomous state of Crossbell. What they have done is left a world so open that it could be used to make multiple story arks within the same setting which is to say the least impressive, leading to a potentially massive expanding world, that i cant WAIT to explore more of. Hinted by Trails of Zero, Trails of Azure and the Trails of Cold steel Trilogy.Music: Music's Good Nuff said. But seriously This games music has many well orchestrated tracks. While some tracks would be considered memorable, most are just used to set the tone and mood, and they do so very well. From happy and chipper to crazy serious, there are few tracks you would put on your MP3 Player, but every track in this game provides excellent ambiance and for a game like this, that's all you really need.Final Notes:I'm really glad they decided to port this game over and seem to be planning to bring more of this series over, it's one that has been LONG over due and any lover of well crafted story telling owes it to themselves to play this game. No it's not perfect, nothing is. But it IS a turn-based, tactics style JRPG with a HEAVY Emphasis on Story telling, and it performs it beautifully. Honestly the only complaints I could possibly have is the somewhat repetitve gameplay, The fact that the game likes to spike up the difficulty to ridiculous levels (Especially if you plan to do the monster hunting quests) and that theres no word on when they will translate Final chapter while they are working on trails of cold steel. But since Final Chapter is more like an Epilouge/Afterstory anyway, there really is no rush.There is one character in particular I REALLY want to learn more about since she arguably has a more ♥♥♥♥ed up past than even Joshua, though considering that translating this game alone was basically the equivilent of all 7 harry potter books and the lord of the rings trilogy COMBINED, I'm willing to wait and let them have their rest.And XSEED while you may never read this, I still wish to say. On behalf of all JRPG lovers everywhere, I thank you for translating this Masterpiece of a game, and hope that you will translate more of this series as quickly as you are able, and for everyone else if you haven't played this game yet, do so as soon as you are able. It is well worth the 30$ Price Tag.			"

												A triumph of world-building and RPG design. Must-buy.The characterizations, mulitple sub-plots, the theming, and subtlety of the dialogue reach even higher peaks than FC even did. The story of Estelle and Joshua's path, the lives of their party-mates, and even some of the non-unique model NPCs' journeys thru life are written with such craft and thoughtfullness. Motives and personalities are almost never shelved when the writers wrote themselves into the corner or stretching to hit some expected storybeat...,..except when they did in a few times in Ch.9. Plus much of Ch. 7 could have been exised and the remaining strong story scenes moved to other chapters.But these are rather minor; you can tell a well-written game by the times you go ""this sounds like every other game for this 5 minute stretch"" and that's a good sign it aint every other game but I still found FC (and this is purely personal) more consistant in the tone it was going for overall slightly.Music? Typically BEAST MODE Nihon Falcom soundteam_JDK goodness with some of the grandest, most well-written, and passionate tracks ever writ for a video game.

Also Trails in the Sky: First Chapter is a mandatory prequisite. This like its predecessor in that you must not go in expecting bang-bang gogogogo from loading, nor is all the ""slow"" parts a grind till you get to ""the good parts"". Everything must be met halfway as everything is used for versimilitude and holistic world-buidling.			"

												First off, I love this game.  This game, and the first chapter, are among the best story-driven RPGs I've played.  The ONLY problem i had, was that some of the later bosses resisted lowered stats, making a head-to-head fight the only option.  If they had an ability that cleared lowered stats, that would be fine, but those fights felt more railroaded than neccesary.			"

												Given the ""WHOA DUDE"" award in 2016Simply put; This is one of the best JRPGs I've ever played. Now for everyone who doesn't know me, you're probably not aware of the gravity that statement has... Let's just say that I've played a LOT of great JRPGs in my time, from the popular Final Fantasy series, to the hidden gems like Anachronox, Piers Solar and Septium Core.I would easily rank The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC in my top five JRPGs of all time.Let me make a quick summarised review on whether this is your type of game or not;Turn based battlesStory intensiveDifficulty ranging from low, to intenseOver 75 hours of gameplayIf you don't have the patience to read the text in this game, then you will be missing out on the thing that really sets it apart from the competition. The story itself could be called JRPG standard fare I suppose, but what really sets this game (and the prequel) apart from the competition is amount of world building that is done. Every NPC has a name, and every NPC has a story. There are weapon shop owners who I actually went to speak to after every single event. I spent time getting to know the people of Liberl and I had a fantastic time doing it. The playable characters all have their goals and motivations, and aren't just there for the ride. They feel almost real, you grow to actually care about them as you play through the game. As a long time JRPG player, this blew my mind quite frankly.The battle system is completely turn based and pretty tactical. Some of the bosses in the game can be tough, especially if you're playing on the harder difficulties, making it feel all the more satisfying when you pull off a clutch victory or manage to outwit an opponent. The development system is pretty unique too, borrowing elements similar to Materia and rewarding clever placement of Quartz. The equipment system gives you five slots to work with, meaning you can make all rounded characters or specialised roles depending on your personal preference.The visuals are colourful and vibrant, and I enjoyed the isometric view. The big attacks and magicks feel cool to use, and you definitely get a sense of awe with the larger ones, this always gives you a feeling of being powerful when you're fighting enemies. The music is absolutely fantastic, and does a really great job of remixing in the main theme, which gives every song a sense of nostalgia in a way. The sound design in general is really good, and having enemies pop when  they die sounds incredibly satisfying.One of the few negative things I can say about this game is the performance wasn't too great for me. I have a machine that should be able to knock this out easily, but I still got occasional stuttering which was a bit disappointing. In battle it ran fine though, even in the most intense scenes, so it could be a driver issue or something on my side. The controls are fine, with complete control over remaps. Using a controller or M&KB really is down to personal preference, and you won't find yourself hampered using either.Another negative point that is more down to personal preference rather than something objectively bad is the fact that if you want to get all the books (some of which allow you to get the ultimate weapons) you need to be very careful of going past points of no return. I'd suggest following a book guide and a BP guide, if you're bothered by missables at all. ( Here )I don't know what else I can say to make you consider this game. It's fantastic and you should definitely play it if you love JRPGs or just like great stories. Please be sure to play the first game though, seeing as this one is a direct sequel, and actually gives you bonuses for carrying over save data.Right, that's too much writing, I must now collapse.Blorf "

												Don't be fooled - I wish I could rate this game as neutral overall, because it's undeniable that I enjoyed the heaps of time with it and I believe the two current Trails in the Sky games make up one of the best RPG series the genre can offer. I'm unquestionably a fan.But there are things that make me terribly conflicted about how this sequel goes forward from its predecessor; something I'll save towards the conclusion so I can give what's praiseworthy its due time, because there is PLENTY to remark on that shouldn't turn you away from this experiencing this gem, regardless of my thoughts.SC brings much deeper combat and more of a challenge. Even normal enemies aren't pushovers anymore and the boss battles are large-scale and take retries. What I appreciated the most was how much the magic system opens up to let you reach those fancy arts hinted in the back of the in-game guide, which I didn't know how to reach in the past game. Once all the tools are in the box, the customability that results is super fun. Party members who switched in and out during the length of FC are now usable for much longer, something that made me glad to rely on my favorites and feel a little guilty for letting some fall to the wayside (Sorry, Tita).The presentation is immensely stepped up, with a handful of lovely cutscenes paired up with what is still one of the best soundtracks I've heard in gaming (Do yourself a favor and search the OST for 'The Whereabouts of Hope').I praised the level of detail present in the first game and definitely found it again here, with NPCs continuing their personal stories. There's still enough depth to cause me to miss some quests and collectables since the world is just as vast and complex, even though it is being explored a second time - and perhaps therein lies the root of the problem.SC does the right thing and changes up the formula a bit, choosing to detach itself from the previous story built by the two main characters and spends much of the time traversing the world over again. The other party members flesh out their backstories in the meantime, which is a fine trade-off to me. But over time it starts to feel like padding, almost. How can this happen if SC's playtime is even longer than the first?SC becomes less and less spectacular as it shifts its focus on ""the next big battle ahead"" rather than ""the next big adventure to be had"", if that makes sense. You're released onto the world with more freedom but much of it has already been seen, learned about, and drank in for all its initial worth. Towards the concluding chapters, to put it rather bluntly and spoiler-free, it entrenches itself in a typical RPG gauntlet of fight after fight. Some storytelling in between connects the dots and wraps up narratives and it manages to deliver a sweet ending, yet it ends so abruptly - without much fanfare - still memorable, but still proving that it could forget so much of the world I initially fell in love with. It basically left me feeling like I hadn't actually saved it because I was off somewhere else. The characters had practically outgrown the setting and turned their attentions elsewhere. It's a minor qualm, honestly, but it's a strange symptom of wonderfully-written characters shedding their skins to stop being people and more like gods. It's a problem that any other typical JRPG might stumble into whereas I feel Trails in the Sky should be setting itself apart.This sophomore slump won't shake my faith in playing the third portion of the trilogy when it releases this May. In fact, I can't wait to see if it carries on with renewed energy now that the supervillians I spent chasing for nearly the entirety of this edition are (perhaps?) no more. I want to keep seeing new places and meeting new people, basically getting back to the journey and seeing the focus on character growth take place. It was the number-one positive to me in the first game, and having that feeling of mine take a backseat for the majority of SC is just simply not the same.			"

												This is a wonderful continuation from the first game,as of march there is hope for the third installment. Of course, we will all still be waiting to see if they ever convert the cold steel series to pc, which is still doubtful. It's vastly more positive than their previous statements that relayed there wouldn't be a conversion of the rest of the series. Hopefully it will actually be out by spring of 2017, the last one took them several years. . .Still, the game play is entertaining, easy, and has a great story line. I wont post any spoilers, you will have to play through it yourself. If you liked the old final fantast and ultima games then you will love this one. Play the first one first though!			"

												I can't out-right say the game is good or bad. The story is compelling. The actual game play is a  ""slow burn"" at best, a downright chore at it's worst. Unfortunately, after playing for 40+ hours, that slow burn burns out, leaving you with a really tedious slog toward the end of the game. I think I'd rather watch a compelling YouTuber make their way through the next game rather than endure it myself.The series in general could be vastly improved with a few modern touches, such as some fast travel options, enemies that can't summon reinforcements ad infinitum, and characters being a damn sight more powerful/fewer enemies that can suck up so many hits.

												Time compels me to re-write my review, with more hindsight. I can no longer recommend this game. The more I think about it, the more frustrated it makes me. It's the biggest let-down I have experienced in gaming, because the first game was SO awesome, such an amazing JRPG that anyone even remotely into the genre should play. This game, despite being a direct sequel, despite working off of the same system, is not. I will give 2 basic reasons.1) The game is frustrating. They wanted to continue this game off of the old one, they didn't want to invent an all new system or start you off at level 1 from scratch. Okay. But their attempt to ""extend"" everything, the leveling, the magic, your equipment, resulted in imbalance. It's too easy now to have an entire party dropping nukes on the battlefield. So their solution to this problem was frustration; simply make it hard to obtain money, magic ""orbments"", equipment, and constantly force-change your party with new characters who have different elemental restrictions, forcing different play styles (and sometimes, everything that was on the character you lost goes with them, if you didn't know to unequip them ahead of time). This game really requires multiple saves, in case they stick you with someone you have few options for and can hardly use. Fights themselves are now against bullet sponges who spam status effects, have random immunities, and heal themselves. Sometimes it's fun, but more often it just feels annoying, especially if, again, you ""messed up"" by not already having alot of a certain element so you could exploit weaknesses, even though you had no way of knowing that's what you needed. And good luck getting more, it takes HOURS. 2) While I still like the characters, the banter, the moral dilemmas, the actual story is TERRIBLE. It's like The Empire Strikes Back, but if you had to watch Luke Skywalker getting completely owned by Vader over and over at the end of every act. Your enemy is, I don't know, Cobra, or Hydra, but not incompetent. Global reach, endless mooks, the most advanced technology, infinite money, full-scale mass production capabilities, unparalleled scientific and historical knowledge, all led by demi-gods, every one of which is able to backhand you into a coma without a thought. Why? I have no idea. Why does the second-in-command of this group have mind-control powers? I don't know. No one even asks. It's just accepted as perfectly fine to introduce a character with comic book powers with no origin story, no known limitations, he just can. It's laughable. There's no tension here; you CAN'T win. Just, lose, lose, lose. Every act is the same; something happens, you track down one of these humans of mythical power, you barely survive a fight and then they leave you alive out of pity. You stop nothing, you accomplish nothing, they could have simply removed most of the boss fights because they are a waste of time. A JRPG is really a combination of a few factors, mostly story and combat, and both fail. While I like many secondary aspects, like the world and characters (although alot of that we already know and is not as engaging the second time around), the important parts are just bad. The game is frustrating, it screws you over, it makes even scrub fights longer and more expensive than they have any need to be, and there is never any pay off for any of it, you're always losing. the equipment system, which was fun and mostly balanced before, is now horribly skewed in one direction and it really feels like tying a weight to your leg when the game gives you one of the other characters who can't exploit that imbalance. Finally, I didn't finish the game; the main story right before you reach the point of no return requires you to deliberately gimp yourself. I did so, only afterwards realizing that this was also the last chance to do about 50 sidequests, which I physically could not do now that I had weakened myself. I had no way of knowing this, and now I had no way of doing any of this optional content. I rage-quit. Maybe the last 3 hours of the story are awesome, but I really, really doubt it. Only fans of the previous game should even consider this entry, and even then, it's really, really a let down.			"

												“It’s done.” “Yes Mr Frodo, it’s over now.” - Frodo and Sam. I feel like I just ran a marathon.I had a lot of acclaim for the first game in this series. Overall it was a pretty good game, a few flaws but overall pretty good.It’s hard to say the second installment is good, which is a pain because parts of this game are really good.+ The characters are still gernerally pretty great. You find yourself really wanting to root for the characters.+ Some of the villans are pretty cool.+ Oliver. Never change Oliver. For peace and love baby. You da real MVP.+ Parts of the story are amazing and reminds me why I like the first game. There are a few twists and turns and love triangles too.+ The ending is a bit of a tear jerker and sets up a sequel perfectly.+ Combat is more or less the same, so parts of it are good but...+ There is some good new content you did not see in the game before.+ Some cool cinematics that give the game some much needed depth.+ Some really interesting side quests, like the quest that reveals the backstory of Lila, Mayor Maybelle’s maid.However when you look at the game as a whole, you can only think, what the heck where the devs thinking?- The pacing is aweful. There feels like a neverending bunch of crap between major story points.- The asset reuse for a new 60+ hour game is a bit much. I pretty much felt like I played litterly the entire first game before really getting to new content. It’s very stale to have to basically go everywhere you did in the first game and tirelessly run around the world. For a game that takes place a few years in to the future nothing has changed.- Combat is just bad overall.  The combat system is just really imballanced, and the only way they seem to be able to cause a real challenge is by making your skills and abilities not work, or simply turn fights in to a grind fest. You can almost be assured that when you are in any kind of harder monster or boss fight none of you crowd control and generally things like speed down do not work. Also some bosses have bull skills like being able to kill your or phase you out of existance even if you have full guard. Also just like the first game if you accidently activate an S-Skill there doesn’t seem to be a way to deactive it, you have to use it.-There are times where things go way too long between being able to save.- If you thought the ending of the first game was tough, you ain’t seen nothing. I’m not sure who thought several hours of grinding boss fights at the end was going to be fun. If I hadn’t put like 120 hours in to the two games combined I would have bailed a long time ago, and almost did.- The game is just anti fun. Rather than provide a good vehicle to tell a story instead you are stuck in a time sucking grindfest. If they had cut out like half the game, it could have been amazing.TLDR;I love parts of this game just like the first. It has a lot of the same flare, humor, good writing and great characters. Too much asset reuse, boring bad quests, bad pacing, and crazy design dessisons just make the game anti-fun. If you value you sanity, do not play. The payoff is not worth it.			"

												Das Spiel ist ein riesiges Recycling von Karten, Monstern, Skills und allem was sonst noch anfällt.Das einzige was wirklich neu ist, sind die Dialoge.Die sind soweit gut, wenn auch teils ewig geschwätzig ohne großen Inhalt. Klassisches JRPG-Problem. Ein Charakter sagt/tut was, dann muss auch jeder begleitende Charakter einen Satz dazu sagen, auch wenn es noch so wenig aussagt.Die Story entwickelt sich gut weiter, aber seeehr langsam.Das liegt vor allem daran das das Spiel extrem repetiv und grindlastig ist. Man muss jedes Gebiet im Spiel mehrfach durchreisen, ohne das sich irgendwas geändert hätte. (außer natürlich Dialog und stärkere Monster)Dazu kommen die klassichen töte dies oder das Quests, die soweit in Ordnung sind, wenn wenigstens die Gebiete neu wären. So reist man nun von Region zu Region und tötet die immer gleichen Monster in den immer gleichen Gegenden mit den immer gleichen Techniken. Das das Kampfsystem extrem langsam ist verschlimmert die ganze Angelegenheit noch. Dadurch das die Kamera immer von Charakter zu Charakter springt und dann zu Monster wenn dieses geschlagen wird usw. und natürlich mit Pausen dazwischen, dauert selbst ein Kampf mit einem Monster, was nicht mal zum Schlagen kommt schon fast 1 Minute. Das klingt nicht viel, aber da man aufgrund der Grindlastigkeit wohl um die 2000 Kämpfe bestreiten muss und da auch mal schwerere dabei sind, kann man schnell rechnen das man in dem die meiste Zeit relativ langweiligem Kampfsystem bei einer durchschnittlichen Kampfdauer von 2 Minuten etwa 67 Stunden beschäftigt ist.Also was bleibt:- ca. 67 Stunden Kampf gegen immergleiche Monster- ca. 10 Stunden herumgelaufe in immer gleichen Gegenden- ca. 20 Stunden Gespräche wo man gut die hälfte entfernen könnte und nichts verpassen würdeWem also die 10 Stunden tatsächlichen interessanten Story-Content interessieren und der sich dabei nicht an 80 weiteren Stunden Beschäftigungstherapie stört, kann bedenkenlos zuschlagen.

The Good:The story is as good if not better than the first game. It's basically a continuation but you see more of what's going on and you meet some new and interesting characters, Then beat the hell out of them.The environment is the same. Some might find this predictable but it makes sense.The mechanics are much the same with a few additions. Again, slightly predictable but this matters if you play it on harder difficultiies. Knowing what's what will help. Having said that it's not all good.The Bad:It's so hard it's not funny. Later on in particular you need to arrive at the boss fights in good shape or you may as well not bother. This can be harder than it sounds.There's a fair number of maze/wayfinding puzzle type missions. I'm not a fan. You might be. There's enough of them that I found it unimaginative/lazy. One in particular made no sense at all. The gear and purchase options are just more of the same. Nothing really stands out or gives you a noticeable edge. The addition of food as a combat item is so you can survive rather than prosper. This is fine if you've got what you need. If you can't find or buy ingredient x it's just another frustration as you've then got to ID the monster and head back to wherever it is. Again, if you're not in good shape for whatever reason this can be a chore.Overall I can't recommend this game. The effort vs. reward just doesn't stack up. Sure it's a decent story but you just don't feel any sense of progression as you work through it. The next wandering monster can maul you just as much if not more than the first. You know for certain that the next boss will have the upper hand and there's nothing you can do to counter it that makes much if any difference. In short, It's a slog and I want more than that from a game.    "

												TLDR: I highly recommend the first game, Trails in the Sky FC - and take some time off before starting SC. Trails in the Sky SC has brilliant storyline but in terms of gameplay, it's not different from FC at all. If you play SC straight after finishing FC, it will just feel like you are playing a very long ONE game. I highly recommend using Speed Hack of some sort to adjust your game speed. I loved the story, I hated playing the same game as FC with 0 additions to the gameplay.I clicked 'no, I don't recommend this game' but there are some things I need to mention. It's a game that you should finish if you have cleared and enjoyed FC. I purely clicked 'Don't recommend' because SC doesn't provide anything new apart from the storyline.Since the storyline continues, you must have played and finished the Trails in the Sky FC before playing this game in order to understand what is going on.  If you have liked the FC, you will likely to want to play SC. The storyline from FC is great so you will likely to want to know what happens afterwards. SC storyline is just absorbing as FC (maybe little bit less). The storyline in FC focuses on character development so you begin developing a form of 'relationship' with your characters. And, in SC - you spend time to understand them as their personal history gets unveiled. There were some fuzzy hearty moments, good twists and what not..  The problem begins here, I loved the storyline but I got sick of the gameplay.The gameplay is exactly the same - it's not different from FC at ALL, apart from more Arts you can use. The save file carries on from FC so you still get to have all your abilities (which is pretty cool). But, you don't get new Crafts (character's dinstict skills) in SC - your old crafts just get upgraded to 'true' form which would have been totally fine if they had a different animation. Sure, you get Chain Crafts.. but you still don't get new animations. ""TRUE"" form that looks exactly like the ""Old"" form, seems like they focused on the storyline too much.In SC, you have to rely on your Arts quite a bit as physical attacks become less effective and monsters are stronger. Considering how I have avoided using Arts in FC, purely because physical attack animations are much shorter - this was a big pain. Aerial is one of the most used Arts in the game, you get to choose a large area where you are going to summon tornade.. and the animation goes for like 10 seconds.. I started playing SC straight after FC so all the battles just felt very 'boring' after already spending 35 hours in the FC. Surely, it wouldn't have been hard at all to put an option to adjust your animation speed. I have played The Legend of Heroes 4, same developers - and that game was from 90s and was a DOS game - even that had animation speed options!The game takes a lot longer to finish than FC so you definitely still get your money/time worth. It's still very text heavy which I don't mind at all - but I had to download Speed Gear to adjust my game speed. And, I seriously recommend EVERYONE doing that - even adjusting it to 1.5x made the game experience very pleasurable. Though at the end, I set the speed on 2x.They have added some cool anime cut scenes which is good. Some of the sound tracks have been rearranged which is also positive, considering how good the soundtrack is from FC - I didn't mind that they have recycled the same music from FC.So there it is - I have finished both FC and SC - and I am exhausted. I have stated in FC review that it felt like reading a novel and SC still provides that experience except that you can't enjoy the storyline at your own enjoyable pace that you'd like because battles take up quite a bit of your gametime unlike FC. I will add TLDR at the top..			"

												+ Has a long story, with a lot of details everywhere you look.+ Interesting combat system with a bit of depth,  similar to materia system of final fantasy 7 (your magic skills are based on what quartz you equip). I spent loads of hours playing around trying to perfect my team.- Poor story, from the beginning until just before the final few bosses, everything you do is going according to your enemy's plans, your impact on the story is next to negligable, only a couple (literally, like 2) of your actions in the entire game have any impact.- Every friggin boss just says theyre gonna fool around with u for fun, and consistently leave when they please, time and time again. And it is not your hard work that saves the day, it is always the bad guy going ""meh whatever, can't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥right now"" that saves the day.- Broken difficulty mechanics! Throughout ALL the game on hard difficulty, physical attacks deal extremely low (very often: 0) damage to enemies, especially bosses. Some enemies are immune to arts forcing you to have to use physical attacks even though there is next to no point to level up a physical attacker.- Bosses are long and tedious, once you survive the first 10-20 actions, you've pretty much won, but you have to spend a 100 more turns repeating the same moves over and over and over again.- When starting the game, loading my save file from first chapter REDUCED my level just because I did not overlevel my characters in the first chapter.- On high difficulties, boss battles were you have to protect npcs are ridiculous. In the final chapter, there is a boss fight where you have 5 enemies attack before you can cast a heal or a shield. If even 1 of the 5 enemies decides to attack the npc, it is game over before you even do anything. So you have to keep pressing retry over and over until all 5 enemies decide not to touch the npc. Random chance is more important than skill.			"

												I would love to be able to recommend this game, as I love it and love the franchise in general. But after about 50 hours into the game, it disappeared from my Steam account, and the store requires me to buy it again in order to continue playing. Steam support has done nothing to help, marking my issue as ""closed"" despite me still not having the game on my account. So at the very least I need to wait until a sale or something and buy this game a second time. At that time I'll gladly change my review to a positive one, but currently Steam is preventing me from enjoying it at all.			"

												Hi, I'm the token negative review, and I'm here to give you reasons why you SHOULDN'T get Trails SC.Disclaimer: I'm a Trails fanboy and Trails FC is probably my favourite JRPG of all time; it might even be my favourite game, period...until I finish SC, anyways...First things first: this game should be treated as an EXPANSION.  Yes, you can technically buy it on its own, but the game picks up right where Trails FC left off and you're gunna be pretty damn lost if you jump into this right away.This game is VERY TEXT HEAVY.  VERY.  Try to find the picture of the scripts for the Trails in the Sky trilogy sometime; Trails SC is longer than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (so says Kotaku) in terms of raw text.  This means lots of cutscenes, lots of sidequests with lengthy chats, and NPCs with walls of text unto themselves.  Technically this is a selling point, but for some it's a killer.2006.  The original release date for this game was in flipping 2006.  At a time when Japan barely cared about PC gaming.  If you can't stand old games, or indies that style themselves after old games, you're gunna have a bad time.  Also, Anime asethetic, but the promo art should've made that clear already.The interface is kinda clunky.  It's either arrow keys + ZXCV + Enter, or you can do it entirely with your mouse; you can also use a gamepad, but that produces the same result as arrows + ZXCV (I've played the PSP version on a Vita).  You should probably remember to use ESC for any KBM control set, too.The problem with arrows + hotkeys is that, even with the PSP version, navigating the menus you inevitably have to handle requires a ton of keystrokes for simple things, especially equipment and consumable usage (so many flipping consumables).  In larger fights this can sometimes mean cycling through every unit to pick the right target.  If you're a programmer, leme put it this way: your single-action algorithm is O(n^2).The problem with using mouse controls is that a lot of things like to move around.  Your cursor frequently warps when you open menus, and the combat camera repeatedly zooms in and out, constantly altering your cursor position and making it hard to play with speed and precision.  The cursor warping can be convenient for some things, like quickly moving through the Save/Load menus, but at other times it'll arbitrarily close menus because you didn't move your mouse at a perfect horizontal.Combat is actually a pretty significant debate among Trails fans, with most opinions ranging from ""rather bad"" to ""pretty decent.""  I haven't personally found anyone who thinks the combat is ""actually good/great,"" and if they exist they're fairly few in number.  All I'm going to say here is this: turn-based, initiative system, tile movement, plain flat boxes for combat arenas.TL:DROld game with clunky controls and walls of text.  If you're looking for the reasons why you SHOULD buy this game, there are a billion other reviews for that.  I'm just here to provide the counterpoints.EDIT:Yes, this is a heavily unbalanced review.  Thing is, going through the ""most useful"" reviews, they're ALL heavily unbalanced in FAVOUR of the game, with no consideration given to people who aren't in the target audience for Trails.Trails is not a perfect game.  Don't try to pretend it is.  I'll suck this game's shlong any day of the week if you want me to, but people need to be informed about the things that they won't enjoy, and the current ""front page"" as it were completely fails at that.

												I really wanted to like this game, I DO like this game. But it's so horribly broken. The game crashes constantly, certain quests from the guild board will auto crash the game making it impossible to accept them. Some items that are critical for side quests are impossible to use because the game crashes every time you try to use them. And now to add insult to injury I ran into a quest that causes the game to crash EVERY time you try to turn it in. So my save game (which is after the quest was completed but not turned in) is now dead.			"

												While I feel the first chapter of this game was slightly better, this is still a very very good game.There was not much change from the first game; combat, gameplay, and story were similar.  Once again the characters steal the show, as they expand on everyone's characteristics, background, everything really.  The amount of detail put into characters like Agate, Kloe, Tita, Olivier, Schera, Zane, etc is something I wish more games did because it helps get you invested into the game and the story.  They are very easy to relate to since everybody has their strengths and their flaws, like we all do irl.  Of course the game revolves around Estelle and Joshua, both of which really get expanded roles since they are away from each other for an extended time, and helps the player really get to know who they are, almost like you're walking alongside them.  And that reunion, my God, that reunion I had such high hopes for and it did not disappoint at all.  Very powerful moment.  That whole Estelle-Joshua relationship really felt special to me.  With characters like these, it makes the game so rewarding to play, because you want to learn more and you want to experience more, just for the sake of the characters alone.  But the reason I praise the characters so highly, is because the game fell short in a couple of ways.  First the story, while good, felt forced near the end, sometimes lost focus, and was at times not paced very well.  At the end I basically willed my way through the final dungeon without paying much attention.  When I played the first game, I tried to complete as much as possible, and it took me 50 hours, but the story gripped me.  This time, same approach, and the hours jumped to 73 hours, and I felt the game could have kept the story untouched but still shaved 15-20 hours of extra stuff that didnt need to be there.  I didnt change anything  I did from the first game; I didnt really grind, I did as many sidequests as I found.  I also thought that the final boss was a little generic for this game's standards.Finally, I have to give a tip of the cap for the treasure chests.  Its not only clever, I was rolling on a few of them.  The Monty Python references made me die laughing.  Just watch the sketch that got referenced by the one German speaking chest.  Its a little touch, but it shows me that they take the time to really care about making sure every part of the game was up to par.  And as a gamer, I appreciate that effort.If you're prepared to put time in, play this game.  The character work alone makes it rewarding.			"

I can't begin to fully describe this masterpiece of a game.It toys with my heart, makes me laugh, makes me smile, makes me cry, and makes me frown.Anyone, ANYONE, can appreciate certain elements of this game. From one, to one thousand elements. "

												Even after only a few hours in this game is undeniably the one long time RPG fans have been waiting for.  With an absolute stellar cast of characters and a soundtrack that some only describe as ""extraordinary"" this game should be found in any RPG fans collection.  Be careful though and make sure you play all the way through FC before starting this one.			"

												The long awaited sequel to Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC, SC succeeds in upping the ante in almost all forms over its predecessor. More party members, new battle actions, spells and S-Crafts (limit breaks), new quests that utilize new item systems, and of course a continuation from the jaw dropping finale of the first game. Containing new content brought over from the PSP version, as well as HD portraits and assets from the Japanese Playstation 3 version, this is arguably the most definitive version of the game next to the PS3 version which never made it out of Japan (PS3 portaits look ugly anyway, but they do get full voice acting whereas this version only has battle voices). For those just learning about this series, Trails in the Sky is a Japanese Role Playing game series with a heavy focus on Story, characters and exploration. For this reason, it is HIGHLY advised that FC (short for First Chapter) is played before this one. Sc does not feature a catch up feature that reminds you of the events of the first game, so new players will be fairly lost, in addition to having key parts of the final act of FC spoiled for them.If you are looking for a JRPG series with a lot of heart, a LOT of dailogue, great characters and great story, Trails in the Sky is where its at. Also, the battle systems are turn based for those who either like/can't stand that sort of thing.			"

												Super arrange version of Gin no Ishi (Silver WIll) worth the price of admission alone.Second chapter (SC) is a great continuation from the first one, starts hours after the events of the first game and goes with it. I cried twice during the opening. Playing through this made me realize just how strong the world building of this game was I cried, smiled, laughed at several moments through out the game include lots of the little npcs that they take extra care to write.Much like the first game the early chapters are the building blocks and some would call them slow. They are partially right but one of the things that immersed me is that at no point are your characters the choosen ones, it all remains incredibly grounded. Also like the first game how ever by the ending you are swept up and taken for a ride.How this escaped getting any attention on the PSP which was very rpg freindly remains a mystery. These two games belong among the great rpg titles. I only discovered this series and the first chapter with the steam release so wasn't waiting near as long as some for the second chapter. I would still like to give a big shout out and thanks to all involved in making it happen. Thanks to Carpe Fulgar for getting the ball rolling even it it didn't work out. Special thanks to Chavez for taking the project and finishing it.			"

												I'll recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs made in the old style, names like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6. To be perfectly clear, the graphics are nothing to write home about and the combat system is functional and does it's job, while providing a fair degree of customization regarding how you build your characters via the quartz system and its associated buffs/debuffs. It is the story where the game really shines. There are a lot of NPCs in this game. A mindboggling amount. And most of them have their little stories to follow and something useful to say. The main cast is excellent, with Estelle being an interesting change from the usual 'woe is me' burdened protagonist we've often seen. There isn't much I can say apart from recommending you to at least try it, or the first game. If the characters grow on you, it'll be a game very much worth the 80+ hours you might spend on it.			"

If you haven't played FC, give that a go first. It'll provide a richer experience and backstory before playing SC. It is also cheaper during a sale just in case you don't enjoy it.For best results, don't anticipate and let it flow.			"

												After the long wait the promised game has finally came, and boy does it hits right through the heart. In this sequel you play mainly as Estelle Bright and her league of wacky companions on the quest to stop the evil organization trying to bring world to ruin. Following directly after the first game, it feels more like an extension to the story, rather than a sequel for it takes in place in the pretty much the same location - the country of Liberl.Now, together with that come two things: all the npcs from previous title are still around, with their stories keep spinning forward, so if you have enjoyed roaming around talking to people in the first chapter, this one rewards it even more; but on the flip side of the coin you explore the same world with same locations and rarely visit new places which hurts that nice joy from exploration quite a bit.The story itself retains the feeling of casualness about it, so if you lot wanted to things to get more serious and gritty it doesn't really happen until final chapters of the game.Battle mechanics and whatnot were left without much of a change, adding only one additional ability to ""chain attacks"" where 2 to 4 of your party members unite together in glorious tornado of asskicking and adding a few powerful spells into your spellbook.Overall it's a solid pick and you should really treat it like an extension of the previous title since it retains it pace and setting 1:1, so give yourself a treat and find out how the story of Estelle and Joshua actually ends.

												The good: the characters are all likeable, though sometimes they'll need their moment in the spotlight before you can get to like them. -The story is exemplary, as well as the storytelling skills. -The music is fitting for the mood of each scene and area.The bad: -The offensive arts don't have too much variance in attack strength, so you can generally get by with lower level spells for raw damage.-A lot of songs borrow at least part of the same tune. 19/97 songs, not counting the source. I counted. -If you're looking for a graphically gorgeous game, this ain't it. It's good, maybe even great, but not gorgeous.-For what it's worth, the game doesn't break the JRPG mold very much at all.

												Trails in the Sky (and I am including FC and SC together, since they make one continuous story) is probably up there as one of my favorite jrpgs.  The main reason is because the story is very good with some great twists, and the games do a very good job of world building and fleshing out and developing the (largely likeable) cast of characters.However, as a result of the world building focus, the game tends to be very slow paced, and both games are fairly long.  It took me around 150 hours between the two games to complete the story, and surely not everyone would want to put that time in.  It can be considered either a bug or a feature, depending on what you are looking for.  I personally think that the generally slow paced and more laid back nature of the game makes a good contrast for when the story kicks things up several notches, as compared to other games which may try to be over-the-top at all times.  There is also a LOT of hidden side stuff and missions that you can choose whether or not to try to find.The battle system is similar to Grandia with a lot of interrupts and cancels, and can be fairly deep and enjoyable.  Also, the soundtracks for both games are fantastic and great at setting the tone for what is going on.If you are interested in an rpg that does a lot of character and world building, and are okay with a generally slower pace to the story, I can highly recommend Trails in the Sky.  Just be sure to play the first chapter (FC) first.  The second game (SC) won't make as much sense without it.			"

												If you have not played Trails in the Sky FC (listed on Steam simply as Trails in the Sky), ignore the rest of this review and look into it first. This is a direct sequel to that game (direct should be taken as literally as possible) and understanding the plot is extremely difficult without the background knowledge from that game.Otherwise, SC is simply the continuation and end to the primary storyline that surfaced at the end of FC. If you liked FC, there is almost zero chance you won't enjoy SC as well - it's more of everything FC had. A little older, a little wiser, a little sadder, and a great deal more grand in scope.Conversely, if you didn't like FC, know that SC is the real gateway to the larger world of The Legend of Heroes - but the core of the game is identical, so if nothing grabbed you from before, it probably won't here either.The execution and attention to detail from FC continues, and despite my various criticisms of the characters and plot threads, I want to emphasize again what incredible work Falcom and XSEED have done here.

												The Legend of Heroes is now my favourite series above Mario. I played most of the game in offline mode so my playtime is lower than it should be. The story is great, it's really long and they sure put a lot of effort into it. All the characters seemed to be quintessence of a JRPG character stereotype but I didn't mind that cause they interacted so well together due to the dialogue so watching each characters interact with eachother which is dependent on who you bring into your party was very enjoyable. I'm going to do another playthrough just to see what the other characters say who I didn't bring into my party.There are a lot of side quests in which they kind of force you to explore and know the areas if you want to complete them, the side quests are optional but thanks to them I now know how to get to each place without reading the signs or opening the big map of the area which is kind of sad to be honest. Each town is also heaps different from eachother so finishing up one place is fun cause the next place is a new experience I guess. I did the game on easy cause I don't like grinding my players up.The game is great though and I hope they release the third one.			"

Players will definitely immerse themselves in the geopolitcal, characters and the lore in this massive world that Falcom has carefully crafted. Combat and tactics are surprisingly well design. Orbments arrangement has given players the flexibity to engage the enemies with a variety of options. Soundtrack wise, Falcom Sound team and JDK Band has never disappoint their fans. Someone has uploaded a massive amount of their soundtracks on youtube (Falcom Music Channel), just head there and have a listen. I have no words to really describe how good they are.			"

												An absolutely amazing JRPG experience that should not be missed out on. It is quite lengthy, between this game and its prequel, I spent about 110 hours completing the main story (fyi if you're reading this and haven't played the first game somehow, you absolutely MUST play the first before SC, as SC literally picks up immediately after the events of the original) and it was worth every second.  While the main overarching story isn't particularly amazing, it's really the characters and interactions with the world that make the game so special.  All the character personalities bounce off each other naturally in every piece of dialogue and make it a joy to read through, even when there's a lot (and believe me there is a LOT) of exposition going on.  While SC does reuse a lot of the first game's assets for obvious reasons, it never really felt like a boring retread, there's plenty of new story events going on and new dungeons within previously explored areas that I never really found myself faulting the game for this design decision.  The detail crammed into the world is immense, down to even some NPCs having their own side stories you can follow if you decide to talk to them as you progress through the game and run into them.  XSeed also went one extra step with the localization by adding humourous messages when you try to inspect a previously opened chest, and SC has a much larger variety of them too, it took me until probably the last 15 hours or so in the game before I started noticing repeated messages; its a fun touch that also shows the care the localization team took.  Basically, this game and its prequel are now definitely up there among my top JRPGs of all time, and are well worth your money, even at full price.  Check them out if you got the time for them!			"

Greater than the sum of its parts.  Buy it. (Disclaimers: Play the first game first! And start this one on Normal difficulty unless you're a masochist!)Slightly longer version: I can't recommend the Trails series enough for anyone who likes RPGs, especially JRPGs.  The amount of detail in these games is astounding -- dozens of NPCs have their own little stories running throughout BOTH Trails in the Sky games, if you take the time to talk to them. For instance, (non-main plot related) there are a couple of NPCs in the first game's first town who are in the process of getting together, and as you keep talking to them you see their relationship develop.  In the second game, you find they're engaged, there is a sidequest to retrieve their lost wedding ring, and if you walk into the church past a certain story point, you'll even see their wedding, and your party's reactions!

												The only J/RPG that I really enjoy. It is AMAZING.The sweetest stories and can be bitter. Tactical and (can be) challenging.Everything about it is so interesting. All characters play a part in terms of dialouge and responses accordingly which is fairly interesting imo.The story manages to put so much feeling into me, heartbroken and other times joy.Oh, and their soundtracks is also amazing and it's played differently according to locations/situations. So there won't be a silent gameplay or just annoying, scary wind breeze effect thing.This will forever and have always been my favourite game. I would no doubt, 100000% recommend this game. I've played the first one on PSP. ^^			"

												A decent enough follow-up to the first game, with the exception that it's a re-play of the first game in many ways. Being an extremely long play-through (which may come at the delight of some) Trails SC often feels like a boring rehash of the first game, using much of the same music, scenery and orbmental tactics with relatively few innovations.That said, there are many emotionally-involved moments, and ending scenes are epic, touching and rewarding, with a number of challenging battles that require re-thinking equipment and orbments to overcome.In the final scenes, however, I felt too little attention was paid to the 2 main characters: Their epilogue was ultimately rushed with little care to the emotional attachments of players after everything they've through been with them. To be clear, the final scenes were highly disappointing.But for the die-hard JRPG fan who (like me) craves recapturing a piece of SNES-style nostalgia, Trails in the Sky SC still proves to be a charming adventure with alluring characters and a twisting plot that leaves you wanting more. If there is a Third Chapter, I hope it makes it's way to the PC with far more urgency from Xseed, because despite the relatively cosmetic downfalls, it's a fantastic character set and storyline that I can't help wanting to play more of!

												Excellent second chapter to this series. The characters are fantastic, the world immensely detailed and full of life, the story is gripping, and the battles actually do not get too tedious (and when they do, equip one of the various quartz that makes it easy to avoid battles!)

No one's looking. Cry as long as you want.And I'll... just hold you like this.Fans of the original Trails in the Sky have long awaited this almost ill-fated sequel, not only is the painfully long wait over, but it is exactly what we all wanted to see and more. Trails SC continues the story of the first game and far exceeds expectations in terms of story.The gameplay is essentially identical to the first game with the addition of Chain Crafts, which allow multiple characters to attack in the same turn at the expense of some of their CP, and a new Orbment system which balances the magic system a bit and allows for more and better magic. The new Orbment system requires slots to be upgraded after unlocked in order to use more powerful Quartz, some of this better Quartz is either improvements of older ones, combination of two effects or brand new ones. The Orbment menu is now thankfully color-coded to know which line you're putting Quartz in and aids to better visualize the Sephith sums of each line. Other than that the game also adds a fishing minigame and some gambling minigames at the casino in Ruan for your leisure. The Bracer Guild quests are back and the game still follows the same chapter structure but allows you to edit your party as long as the plot dictates that they can be in your party. The battles have improved slightly with shorter attack animations, improved Crafts, new S-Crafts and encounters that force you to devise new strategies.Graphically the game is exactly the same as its predecessor. HD assets and almost every PSP exclusive feature are available from the beginning. In the sound department we have new songs in combination with older ones that add up to a really expansive soundtrack. The new music exclusive to SC is fantastic and probably far better than its predecessor, with more rocking tunes and even the relaxing new ones have a better feel more suited to the current plotline and a final boss theme that might as well be one of the best in the series.Unfortunately, updating a 2006 game to new standards has also included a slew of bugs. While there are workarounds for every bug I’ve managed to get stuck in some places and in the worst case I accidentally did a sequence break and skipped a major boss fight altogether. The translation also feels spotty at times but with the huge amount of text there is I’m willing to let it pass. Treasure chest jokes are unfortunately missing for the most part.Just like its predecessor, the plot takes the spotlight in this game and I’d even say outright steals the entire show. Right from the beginning stakes are higher as the story continues right after where FC left off, we join Estelle as she looks for Joshua and tries to become a stronger and better Bracer while getting an insight on the mysterious group “Ouroboros”. Even though the pace remains rather slow, in every chapter our heroes face bigger threats compared to those of the first game and a lot of conflicts that were subtly hinted in the first game unfold. Even the sidequests are a step-up since they no longer involve such menial tasks since now the world is in danger and quite a few involve subplots essential to the world-building of the game. Trails SC is a lengthier affair than the first game, clocking at around 40-60 hours in an average play, with a New Game+ available and various difficulty modes if you ever want to replay it.There isn’t a lot to say about Trails SC that hasn’t been said in reviews of the previous game other than “it’s bigger and better”. If you enjoyed the first game then SC is a must play, if you didn’t then you probably are missing out on a truly exceptional traditional RPG, one that took a long time to arrive and is worth every second and penny invested into it.

Everysingle character has their own personality, even if it's not one of the playable characters. You also actually get so connected with the characters that when something happens, it can actually affect your emotions.

												The Legend of Heroes SC is developmental proof that an RPG's technologies take back seats to intricately developed characters and well written story. Nearly every art asset, except the final few hours, and combat system of this game are recycled from FC, but one can't but help fall in love and be consumed with the world that Nihon Falcom has created and evolved through the length of this amazing adventure. A gem of a JRPG and a genre class that may never be seen again. Fans of classic JRPGs owe it to themselves to purchase and play this game. 10/10!			"

The pacing of the story is pretty strong. They improved the turn-based-battle-system compared to the first chapter. More Arts, chain attacks, 4 difficultys. For the first playthrough i prefer the normal game mode. This game is a must have for traditionell JRPG Fans. Thank you XSEED for translating and releasing the game on steam. I hope the game sells well and I'm looking forward for the Third Chapter. Hopefully soon :)			"

												This game rewards the players with its clever writing and massive storytelling. With the latest entry:  Trails of Cold Steel that was originally release in Japan last year, it is no exeggration that the game's lore has been  more than 10 years in the making. Players will definitely immerse themselves in the geopolitcal, characters and the lore in this massive world that Falcom has carefully crafted. Combat and tactics are surprisingly well design. Orbments arrangement has given players the flexibity to engage the enemies with a variety of options. Soundtrack wise, Falcom Sound team and JDK Band has never disappoint their fans. Someone has uploaded a massive amount of their soundtracks on youtube (Falcom Music Channel), just head there and have a listen. I have no words to really describe how good they are.			"

												Trails in the Sky SC is a strong follow up to the first Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.  The story picks up just hours after the cliff-hanger conclusion of the first game, creating a seamless adventure that sometimes feels as much like a wonderful novel as a video game.  The plot is well placed, if a bit meandering at the start.  What really pulls the whole game together is the interactions of the charming and varied cast, as well as the phenomenal localization.  The dialouge never feels stilted or clunky, which is important because this game is verbose. The earlier book comparison is accurate: expect to do a lot of reading.From a gameplay standpoint, the combat is incredibly similar to the first which is both a strong reason to play this game as well as a bit of a knock against it. There was very little innovation in the implementation of battles. Fortunately, the base was already very solid and it is hard to find fault with the system.All in all, I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone in search of an emotional, character-driven, intrigue-filled adventure; however, lacking an understanding of the story from the first game will really inhibt one's ability to follow what is happening in the early portions of this game. It might almost be wiser to consider the two together one long game rather than a prequal and a sequal.TLDR; An absolute MUST play, provided you've payed the first one.			"

												Great follow up to the first game. Playing the first one is a must since this is a direct sequel. Pretty much continues everything good from the first game with a few improvements.The music is definitely a step up from the previous game, while there are also now even more orbment combinations for those people who love tinkering with their arts/stats setups for each of their characters.Story is still great, however the predictable structure of the first couple chapters got very boring once you realised what was happening each time. There are a tiny amount of annoying cliches in there as well, and some backstories to a few characters could have been done better. There is also a feel of backtracking a lot of the time since it's set in exactly the same place as the first game, but that can't really be avoided.Despite it's cons, I still highly recommend this game since to me the characters/story, music and combat system are what make it so fantastic.TL;DRPros:- Awesome characters- Even better music this time around- More arts/orbment options- Last chapters have awesome buildup- Improved turn related changes in combat (i.e. showing specific effects of AT Delays etc.)Cons:- First 4 chapters have very formulaic structure that gets annoying- Not too much of a pain for me, but there are definitely a few points where backtracking might annoy a lot of people- Some character backstories/motives are pretty sillyOverall Verdict: Great game, highly recommend.

												Since most reviews here focused generally on the rich story, mine will instead praise the antagonists that made said rich story actually work. In addition to the breathtaking soundtrack during dialogues and battles with them, each and every one of the antagonists has a fleshed out backstory that enraptures you and leaves you with a desire to truly discover their intent on villainy. Similar to other great games, SC also uses grey areas of villainy to add more depth for Estelle (and you) to rationalize and empathize with. Is he or she truly evil? Despite your answer, it it undeniable that they are all designed to surpass banal portrayals of antagonists. Last but not least, they also look really cool aesthetically and their battles are engrossing. tl:dr - If you like story-rich games with awesome antagonists, you should definitely give this a go.

												A must play if you liked the first game, however it might be best to take a decent break in between playing both titles.Gameplay, presentation and music are all ... pretty much the exact same as in trails in the sky FC, as it is just the second part of that game. I did however replace the standard battle theme after about 5 minutes of playing, which was the only theme I absolutely didn't like.While the story does continue straight after the end of FC, the pace does not. It drops back down, hard, if I had anything to complain about it would be that.The first few chapters of SC largely just feel like a repeat of FC, you go to the same locations, you get drip-fed some new story bits each time, and then you move on to the next town.That said the latter half of the game picks up the slack and then some. The two trails in the sky games have ensured that I'll be a ""Trails"" fan for a long while to come, definitely recommended, but you have to be in the right mindset going into it, and don't expect the page-turner feeling that the end of FC left you with right out of the gate.

												A good game and one of the few JRPGs available on PC. I really look forward to seeing Falcom and Xseed and what not put more and more JRPGs on PC regardless of age or original platform, although new ones would be great also since we don't see a lot in the US at all especially on PC.I do recommend this game, however it is a direct as in RIGHT AFTER sequel to Trails in the Sky, so do not play this one until you've played the previous one it's less of a sequel and more of a second half.While I will say I think I'd highly rate the former game a tad higher because the content was completely fresh, while this one is fresh on story, much of the world is directly recycled from the former game (same game engine and all) also almost all the same characters are playable except a little more choice than before.Regardless of the repeated content it's also sometimes interesting to go revisit places you've saved or whatnot before and see what's going on there, as well as having a familiarity with the existing world already so when people talk about something half way across the map you get the gist of what that is. Also, the map is a little more free roaming than before, in the first title you end up linearly stuck in areas a lot more often than you see in this part of the story.If you already played the previous one, expect more of the great well written dialog though that really builds characters well. Expect a few more faces in your party, Expect a lot more moving around the world, but mostly to places you've been to before. Expect revisiting old characters you've met in the past and seeing what they're up to now which is great. Expect the same battle system but with a few more characters involved and a lot more powerful magic. Oh yeah, and the orbament configuration system is totally different. Also, while I enjoyed the game I think the battles were a bit less difficult actually especially the final boss in comparison, but no matter it's a great game either way, if you enjoy JRPGs this is a great buy but play the previous one first or you probably won't enjoy the story at all because you won't know what's going on!

												The Trails series is the gold standard for turn-based JRPGs, and has been for some time.  It's good to see them finally being translated and released in English.  SC follows directly after the events of Trails in the Sky, and resolves most of the stories of its characters while leaving lots of room to expand upon the story of Liberl and the Zemurian continent as a whole.

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC fills in a lot of the questions and plot holes from the first game while retaining a great OST and same battle system.

However, there is a Third chapter that will be probably releasing sometime around 2017 so if you've fully enjoyed the first and second chapter, the third game is not necessarily needed to play since SC offered a nice conclusion, but from the ending of SC there are still some things not fully revealed if you're still interested.

												Superb game, better than Trails in the Sky FC in more or less every way. Better plot, more character development, better twists, updated combat, vastly superior music.Once again, I found myself much invested in the travails of our heroes, as they try to stop a countrywide scheme with much more at stake than the previous game. The main and supporting characters get noticeably more mature in their mannerisms and actions as they develop organically through the plot. Certainly there are anime cliches here and there (but to be honest, I don't watch much anime aside from say DBZ so I can't really comment on this), but the characters are so well fleshed out and human that you can easily overlook them.NOTE: I forgot to mention in the previous review that in order to enjoy the game you have to be comfortable reading text. There is no voice-over, so expect a good amount of reading (not remotely close to crpg levels of reading, but definitely not for call of duty players). But then again, most of the conversations are thoroughly entertaining and do make sense.I am keenly looking forward to Trails in the Sky TC english version coming to steam early next year. Regrettably, Estelle and Joshua's plotline ends here, so TC will be mainly about another character introduced in SC.I would give this game 9/10.			"

												Around October last year, my best friend convinced me to buy a couple of games in the Steam autumn sale, called The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, and its sequel, Trails in the Sky SC, which was just localized. It took me a few months to get to actually playing and completing them due to various reasons, but now that I did (and stayed up till 6 in the morning to finish SC), I have one thing to say. It was all so, SO worth it. Where do I even start? The story is an amazing example of tricking you into thinking it's a run of the mill JRPG, when it's anything but. It's an intricate, deep, well-thought out and wonderful story, with some of the best world building I've ever seen. (NPC's with their own stories isn't something you come across every day.) The characters are so charming, lovable, well-written, and so well-developed, including even the villains, which honestly feel more like well-intentioned extremists at times rather than outright villainous. The OST is simply marvelous, whether it be boss battle themes (like the one down here) or emotional tracks, it all fits so well and sounds amazing. Sure, the game looks outdated at first glance, but it sure as heck doesn't feel that way, and the battle system is quite easy to grasp, especially if you're not used to turn-based games. Overall, Trails in the Sky was one of the best video games I've experienced in quite a while, and it was worth every minute and so worth buying. It was awesome and amazing, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

												The Legend of Heroes SC is developmental proof that an RPG's technologies take back seats to intricately developed characters and well written story. Nearly every art asset, except the final few hours, and combat system of this game are recycled from FC, but one can't but help fall in love and be consumed with the world that Nihon Falcom has created and evolved through the length of this amazing adventure. A gem of a JRPG and a genre class that may never be seen again. Fans of classic JRPGs owe it to themselves to purchase and play this game. 10/10!			"

												Who Should Buy this Game?If like me you thoroughly enjoyed playing turn based JRPG’s before 3d gaming took off, then you will enjoy this title, you will get addicted. All of the characters are interesting, the plot is deep and interesting. While there is lot of dialog, very little of it is filler. Pros•	It will take a long time to complete both chapters, •	I was at a loss when I finished my 143 hour playthrough of first chapter and second  chapter, there’s not many companies producing games like this one•	Sadly, games are not made like this anymore. I wish more games had strong and likable cast of characters, good music and a fun and interesting plot with decent gameplay mechanics.•	You can retry battles, when you lose (Fights also get easier after each retry so you are              never stuck).•	Decent turn based strategy, with a variety of customizable skillsCons•	There is a ton of dialog, which can slow the pace of the game.•	There is no way of skipping or speeding-up battle animations.•	It’s easy to miss some quests. I missed some for the first guild before I got the hang of it.•	Agate (Though you will like him towards the end of SC)ConclusionTrails in the Sky has its problems, however they don’t ruin the experience. It is everything a decent JRPG should be. Many of these flaws can be overlooked depending on preference. Unlike the games mentioned above, Trails in the sky has an awesome story, that keeps getting better the deeper you get into the game.			"

												Disclaimer: I really do love this series. So I may be a bit biased. This is an updated review of my previous one. Another thing I want to highlight is just how much work went into the localization of this game. I recommend you read this article http://kotaku.com/the-curse-of-kiseki-how-one-of-japans-biggest-rpgs-bar-1740055631 to appreciate why publishers like xseed really deserve your support. TLDR: If something like Final Fantasy XIII is like a slab of factory manufactured galaxy chocolate, then Trails in the Sky SC is like a homemade chocolate cookie. Only a awesome, homely and delicious cookie. Maybe not the best cookie ever made, but good enough that you made another 10 and ate them all in the weekend whilst the galaxy bar is still in your chocolate stash.Main Review:If you loved first chapter, then you will probably love this game. Playing FC is recommended, especially if your a completionist however I played FC years ago on a psp and so I went into this without a max BP cleared FC save and the bonuses you miss are really non-consequential (you miss a item drop increase quartz, a heal/haze combine quartz and a rare accessory) and you miss the continuation of certain miniquests). Pros: The new combined attacks and the upgraded quartz system really make both preparing for battles and playing battles more interesting. I always felt that FC felt skimp on the number of artes and abilities. SC doesn't have this problem, as with plenty of new characters and the upgraded quartz slots give you a huge amount of customization. I have always loved the music from this series. It is nostalgic but has a touch of sutble change, as it is a new OST compared to FC. Obviously you will recognise versions of silver will etc... but there are also some fantastic new themes as well. Go check out the Super Arranges of many of the theme tunes on youtube, they are superb. This game is absolutely charming. I've played 4 final fantasies, 2 tales of, radiant historia and more (you get the gist), but the game that sticks close to my heart is this series. Why? The script is just overflowing with personality. All the characters in the game mature and develop, even if it takes its bloody time. Even though I hate cliches, somehow I never get annoyed or bored of the cliches or the characters that occur in this game. It has some great and memorable scenes, and doesn't pull plot devices out of its ♥♥♥. You can only have a party of 4, yet every single character has unique dialogue for every single event. It is quite an achievement. Additionally you can really feel the world the developers were trying to create. As events occur, the NPCs in the game react LIKE REAL PEOPLE. Earthquake? All the towns people are concerned about it. Mayor elections? All the NPCs are talking about it, telling you who they support. There are even NPCs advertising the candidates. After almost every single major plot progression you can walk through the whole town and find that the scripts for NPCs has changed in practically all the towns to reflect the change in events. All the NPCs remember your aultristic acts and respond in kind. It is apparent that this game was made with love and a crazy amount of attention to detail. Mixed (i.e. can be a pro or a con depending on what you are like):This game is a completionist nightmare (or haven). Tons of optional sidequests with pretty narrow completion time limits. Tons of choices that if you chose wrong you will not get the full BP. Lots of treasure and secret rewards. Personally I loved it. Might be too much story. Its like reading a visual novel, which is a plus to some and a negative to others. To put it into perspective the lord of the rings trilogy has 455,125 words. This one game has 716,401 words. That's over 3 million characters. This is a long game. Additional difficulties and new game+ add an element of replay value, but once you complete it you probably aren't going to play it again (unless you have another 80 hours to spare...)Cons: It is a dated game, which is evident by its graphics. Personally I think the graphics are charming though. Battle system can get a bit dry sometimes. This is a problem with all rpgs though, not just specific to SC. Game needs a scene skip function, particularly for the early game. The start of the game when you REALLY want to know what happened to Joshua etc is really slow... it actually takes a huge amount of time to get the plot properly rolling and you will go through a huge amount of sideplot.A decent amount of backtracking occurs in this game as the events take place in the same areas as FC. So if you have played FC then you might find that annoying.Tips: talk to everyone, sometimes more than once, unequip your side characters before main events (often you are forced to used other characters and then realize all of you good equipment was equiped on a character that has disappeared. For example, before the chapter 3 boss fight because I forgot to unequip all my characters, I went through 3 boss battles with suboptimal gear and quartz. It really made a difference, and I was forced to use a ton of items. Overall review: if you are a hot headed gamer who just likes to blow things up... this might not be the game for you. If you are patient, do not need instant gratification, appreciate character development, a good plot and needing to think for your fights then this game is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play. For me it is a 9/10.			"

												If you enjoy a long and story rich adventure Trails in the Sky is definitely for you.What this game lacks in graphics makes up with it's rich story and length (When I said long, it's really long, took me 100hrs in to finish the game). And you get Olivier -- The Hunter of Love, I mean what else could you ask for?Story Length:About 50 hours of mainstory, Another 50 hours for side questsIf this is the first trails game you have played, I highly recommend you to start in the first chapter first. Because the story of second chapter starts you right off the bat at where the first left off, if you haven't played it, you will have no idea what happened.If you are a huge fan of JRPGs, or RPGs in general, this game do not disappoint.

												The long awaited sequel to Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC, SC succeeds in upping the ante in almost all forms over its predecessor. More party members, new battle actions, spells and S-Crafts (limit breaks), new quests that utilize new item systems, and of course a continuation from the jaw dropping finale of the first game. Containing new content brought over from the PSP version, as well as HD portraits and assets from the Japanese Playstation 3 version, this is arguably the most definitive version of the game next to the PS3 version which never made it out of Japan (PS3 portaits look ugly anyway, but they do get full voice acting whereas this version only has battle voices). For those just learning about this series, Trails in the Sky is a Japanese Role Playing game series with a heavy focus on Story, characters and exploration. For this reason, it is HIGHLY advised that FC (short for First Chapter) is played before this one. Sc does not feature a catch up feature that reminds you of the events of the first game, so new players will be fairly lost, in addition to having key parts of the final act of FC spoiled for them.If you are looking for a JRPG series with a lot of heart, a LOT of dailogue, great characters and great story, Trails in the Sky is where its at. Also, the battle systems are turn based for those who either like/can't stand that sort of thing.			"

												Legend of Heroes SC is the 7th game in the Legend of Heroes series and the 2nd in the Kiseki titles of the same series.  Here you take control of Estelle Bright (that is a female protagonist not shoehorned in by feminists or developers trying to appeal to progressive authoritarians) and her cohorts in an attempt to uncover a conspiracy in her country. It is a very bar bones JPRG but mixes up the formula by giving you viewable enemies on the field, a customizable magic system, a battle system with turns, and a grid to move around on when in the same battles.  You'll be spending some time in this fairly long story and have some really chill tunes to keep you relaxed for all these hours.  I can't find anything negative about the game or the translation so make sure to pick it up if you like animeish Japanese roll playing games.			"

												This game is a masterpiece, deserving to sit alongside games like Suikoden 2, Digital Devil Saga, FF7 and the others that made me fall in love with JRPGs.  In fact this is the only game I've played that I feel is equal to or possibly better than those classics.  In my many years of playing the genre I've only found a small number that I feel come close to my old favorites.  To find a game in 2016 that is this good, that I would actually place above Suikoden 2, a game that has been solidly my favorite since I first played it in 1998, just blows me away.  The story, while good, is probably not the rival of S2.  Its the characters and their heartfelt, sincere interactions that push this game beyond anything I've played before.  Characters grow and change over the course of the story, amazingly so if you consider where they started in the first chapter.   And the love and craft Nihon Falcom put into this game shines at every turn.   Especially in SC, some of the set piece fights are bar none the best choreographed sprite based animations I've ever seen.   Every powerful scene in the game is beautifully realized in the animations.  This game is art, full of feels, and worth playing.  Please support these guys, and XSEED for bringing it over here!			"

												A month ago I wasn't expecting to be playing this game, even less so to write a review about it. Where to begin? If you haven't bought and played Trails in the Sky (the first game) what are you doing in this page? Go and do so!  I say this because playing it is absolutely vital to keep up with the story, plus you get a few perks when starting a new game and loading up your save file from that one here.With that out of the way. This game is everything you liked from the first game, but expanded. More sidequests, more quartz, more spells, and the most important thing: it finishes the plot that started in First Chapter. Also, the pacing in the game is pretty good. Of course, the game is not without its faults: The start of the game is very slow, like the first game, managing quartz is a nightmare if you don't have enough sepith and some sidequests are easily missed... or more like you'll need a guide if you want all the Bracer Points in the game. Even with these negative points, the game remains a very charming, very fun and very engaging jRPG. I recommend for all the people who don't mind a slow beginning and managing of resources but love a great cast of characters and an interesting story (nothing groundbreaking but very well exectued)			"

												An absolutely amazing JRPG experience that should not be missed out on. It is quite lengthy, between this game and its prequel, I spent about 110 hours completing the main story (fyi if you're reading this and haven't played the first game somehow, you absolutely MUST play the first before SC, as SC literally picks up immediately after the events of the original) and it was worth every second.  While the main overarching story isn't particularly amazing, it's really the characters and interactions with the world that make the game so special.  All the character personalities bounce off each other naturally in every piece of dialogue and make it a joy to read through, even when there's a lot (and believe me there is a LOT) of exposition going on.  While SC does reuse a lot of the first game's assets for obvious reasons, it never really felt like a boring retread, there's plenty of new story events going on and new dungeons within previously explored areas that I never really found myself faulting the game for this design decision.  The detail crammed into the world is immense, down to even some NPCs having their own side stories you can follow if you decide to talk to them as you progress through the game and run into them.  XSeed also went one extra step with the localization by adding humourous messages when you try to inspect a previously opened chest, and SC has a much larger variety of them too, it took me until probably the last 15 hours or so in the game before I started noticing repeated messages; its a fun touch that also shows the care the localization team took.  Basically, this game and its prequel are now definitely up there among my top JRPGs of all time, and are well worth your money, even at full price.  Check them out if you got the time for them!			"

												The good:+ Game play is fluid and very nice+ Very well done position based combat+ Interesting characters. All of them. Including NPCs. And even the cat that only says ""meow"" + Story is a bit cheesy and predictable, however it is still very charming + Great music!I've had so much fun playing this game that I had to limit myself to prevent myself from finishing too early. I've spent hours fine tuning which characters joined my party, their roles within the party and what orbments they recieve. The turn based gameplay itself is very well done, arts ('spells') are not cast on the same turn you select them which adds a very interesting dynamic to the battles, where you have to plan ahead if you use arts based characters. In this game, positioning really matters and that ups a level of the game. I can't explain how fluid everything feels, it's something you just have to experience.Now the crux of why I think this game is amazing: It's characters all have some sort of depth. When you play this game, the world you play in breathes and lives. Every character has their own lives independent of the main character and they don't all completely rely on the protagonist like most games do. They solve their own problems, have their own personalities and you can see storylines completely separate from the main story unfold just by talking to various NPC's and piecing together what they say to you. At least half the game was me running around talking to every single character in game because I actually care about their struggles, even if I can't help them because I want to know what's going on in their lives. S+ for characterisation.The music has also improved from FC. New soundtracks sound amazing, and the remixes of the main theme are awesome. The music really does set the mood for the scene.What also stood out to me were the themes of female independence, of course there are bits where they reinforce old stereotypes of women but it's to be expected for the age it's set in. It doesn't go over the top with GIRL POWA but as the main protagonist is a girl, they do a very good job with her character. Her strength doesn't come just with her fighting power. Would make little girls play/10Now as for the actual plot, it follow a very typical RPG plot of saving the world but it's still incredibly charming in it's own way. It's incredibly linear, but the characters flesh it out into something interesting. PLAY ITThe bad:+ Trope heavy. Characters can fall for commonly used tropes+ Cheesey writing + Not much to look at If you can look past that, and enjoy turn based rpgs and a decent story line with bomb characters I would recommend it!

												If u like JRPGS and you're a looter.Well then this game is for youDis game has the best treasure looting messages found all throughout the game and I personally find joy in reading every single one of those witty and funny messages found in the chestsThat's the best part of the game but what kind of review would this be if I didn't talk about what the rest of the game has to offerStarting off with the goods and somewhat neutral-Soundtrack still has nice beats that really pumps you up when fighting with monsters aswell as make you FEEL when it's needed-has good art style (I like it personally).But it actually is good tho-Enemies with good personalities which really makes you actually like them even tho they are bad guys.It really makes you feel attached to them cuz they don't really feel menacing or a threat-Funny and witty treasure messages-Story starts of with a recap of the first chapter so first time players of this chapter would know what's going on(though playing the first game is still definitely recommended)-It has funny little twist for one of the characters.Let's hide him by the name Olivier(SPOILERSSS) :D-It finally has animation cut scenes during the last half of the gameThe bads?-Well like any other RPGs... Alot of repetitive tedious fighting just to level up tho that's not too bad-I said it recaps past events but you could still get confused if you haven't played the first chapter-For those who played the first game guess what?We're still playing in Liberl-I'm not much of a reviewer and I'm not good at noticing flaws in anything so from the goods of the game I'd say its an awesome game personally and for me it's my favourite game seriesBut many people won't agree with me.Yes it's not the best game in the RPG/JRPG genre but it's defenitely worth your time for a story rich game filled with anime -ish graphics It's really good			"

Couldn't wait for the third chapter to be released. Love the twists here and there and and well crafted characters. This isn't one JRPG with flat characters. You just have to love the relationships and bonds formed as though you are in it yourself. Worthwhile of my time. 10/10.			"

												Aaaaaaaah, the bliss! That is all I can say after finishing this :) Now, first let me adress the one thing that I found a little bit annoying in this, and than I will get to the plethora of great things! Soooo, why does every villain need to have a sob story to make him more likeable? Why do they get to redeem themselfs and why do they get to live at the end when so many whom they killed don't. Prime jerks like Walter, Bleublanc and even Renne (as adorable as she is), while I do understand the points about Renne, Walter is simply a moron and a jerk on top, I would have loved to see him actually pay. It is beyond the point of cliché here, everyone has a sad story which made them turn evil and everyone has a connection of some sort to someone in the party, what are the odds and why does it have to be so awkward :D But whatever, that doesnt really matter when you look at the near masterpiece that is Trails in the sky SC. I simply adore the world, the characters, the interactions, lore, explorations and even the combat. I was so praying for a happy ending for Joshua and Estelle, their relationship is so real and understandable that it made me smile so widely when they met up again. For the first time ever, I think, I did not dislike the brooding main hero who left the girl to ""protect her"", because Joshua actually had a reason, and Estelle, being the exact opposite of a damsel in distress, kicked his♥♥♥♥♥till he straightened up and brout everything to a happy ending. They honestly are among my most favorite gaming couple's of all times, if not at the top of the list.I honestly lack the words to describe the great ride you will have with this game if you enjoy story heavy rpg's. All the small details and funny conversations simply put this above a generic rpg's of this age, it is original and inventive and all the expected cliché's aside the character's motivations and actins are relatable and understandable. It is excellently written and just sucks you in for the whole ride and it's one hell of a ride, long, arduous, but ultimately immensely satisfying. Anyone and everyone who likes rpg's and doesnt have this and the first chapter, get it now!Now to only find out what happens next when the gears of fate finally start turning again... I am sure we will see Joshua and Estelle again in another great story!			"

												Who Should Buy this Game?If like me you thoroughly enjoyed playing turn based JRPG’s before 3d gaming took off, then you will enjoy this title, you will get addicted. All of the characters are interesting, the plot is deep and interesting. While there is lot of dialog, very little of it is filler. Pros•	It will take a long time to complete both chapters, •	I was at a loss when I finished my 143 hour playthrough of first chapter and second  chapter, there’s not many companies producing games like this one•	Sadly, games are not made like this anymore. I wish more games had strong and likable cast of characters, good music and a fun and interesting plot with decent gameplay mechanics.•	You can retry battles, when you lose (Fights also get easier after each retry so you are              never stuck).•	Decent turn based strategy, with a variety of customizable skillsCons•	There is a ton of dialog, which can slow the pace of the game.•	There is no way of skipping or speeding-up battle animations.•	It’s easy to miss some quests. I missed some for the first guild before I got the hang of it.•	Agate (Though you will like him towards the end of SC)ConclusionTrails in the Sky has its problems, however they don’t ruin the experience. It is everything a decent JRPG should be. Many of these flaws can be overlooked depending on preference. Unlike the games mentioned above, Trails in the sky has an awesome story, that keeps getting better the deeper you get into the game.			"
