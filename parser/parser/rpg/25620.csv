 ""The toughest enemy in this game? Well, try to break a door secured with a masterful adamantium lock.” Eschalon: Book 2 is a well-made turn-based rpg experience with great love for detail. Compared with its predecessor the combat mechanics were improved by adding a couple tactical options and increasing the general game speed.In addition, the game difficulty can be adjusted to satisfy the needs of the hardcore gamers among us. Trivia: Like the first game, the game's development was largely kept secret; the developers of the Eschalon series believe that most game developers release too much information about their products, spoiling the game when you eventually play it. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements. Chronology: Eschalon: Book 3 (PC)Classic turn-based role-playing game(Fantasy) – 2014 Link to Steam review for Eschalon: Book 3.

												8-9 / 10This is a great rpg and great series, if you enjoy turn based RPG give this a try its alot of funCONS:  Game mechanics promote not using your levelup points until after you've bought skills, not a fan of power game favoritism, if you don't mind this aspect its easily a 9 ratingMy reviews are always based on the following-I only play hard or impossible-I don't save/load scum, live with mistakes -I don't use 3rd party cheat tools-I don't play multiplayer and am reviewing singleplayer aspects unless otherwise noted			"

												Eschalon: Book 2 is a sequel to Book 1 and therefore similar in everything it does. There are minor improvements, like faster walking, higher resolution, more skills... but nothing of great importance. Eschalon is a turn-based role-playing game series with astounding graphics and sound. Unfortunately gameplay is a bit slow, even for an ultima-like game. Doing almost anything in this game is fun but one thing: Walking. And there's a lot of walking. Walking through forests, walking through beaches, walking through deserts... and even more walking. The game has interesting dungeons and towns, filled with many secrets and details, unfortunately other locations are there just to be walked through. That is why I would rate this game as decent: It's a very enjoyable RPG, except for tedious walking through wilderness.			"

												I got this on sale for $5, and after playing it for over a dozen hours, I'm already thinking it's one of the best ""indie"" computer RPG's. It's like the older Elder Scrolls games, but with Ultima-style graphics and interface. It has a freely explorable world that is viewed in a 3rd person, top-down perspective. Resolution is limited to 1024x768. But I actually dig the graphics and interface. What I dig even more is how *challenging* this RPG is, and how you can build and play your character in very different ways to deal with those challenges. It's not an action RPG, like Diablo; it's more of a thinking man's RPG, like Elder Scrolls. (Eventhough a big part of that challenge can be a pain, dealing with darkness and thirst/hunger and equipment wear/breakage.) Combat is a tactical blend of turn-based and real-time. Keeping your character alive can be hard, especially if you're not paying attention and if you're not putting enough thought into how you build and play your character.			"

												I've tried to enjoy Eschalon: Book II, and it really is a game fully inside my usual wheelhouse.  RPG... check.  Mouse-driven combat... check.  Unforgiving difficulty... check.  Sidequests... check.  Lots of interesting text to read... CHECK!So why can't I recommend this?  It's the controls.  There is a simple flaw in this game's design that makes for a really poor experience when I play:You have to hold down the mouse button to walk.This might not seem like a big deal, but when I'm going to be playing a game for hours, this becomes painful quite quickly.  It isn't a click-fest like Diablo; it's both lots of clicking and LOTS of holding down the mouse button for long periods of time.Otherwise, Eschalon: Book II is a quite excellently made game.  If I were to recommend an alternative, I would point to the recent Spiderweb Software games, which are probably superior to the Eschalon series anyway.			"

												[EDIT] After this developer chose to sit on the 1.02 patch for Eschalon 3 for SEVEN MONTHS after it was finished before pushing it to Steam users, despite that patch fixing numerous bugs, I can no longer recommend any titles from him. As if that delay wasn't enough, he then decided to mock his customers by joking ""Better late than never, heh?"". Screw this guy. ---------------------An intense classic-style RPG that continues the epic saga of Eschalon. Eschalon doesn't make any attempt to hide it's methodical turn based combat, unforgiving level progression mechanics, or epic story arc. If those qualities interest you, you'll have a good chance of enjoying Eschalon. If not, best move along. Book II introduces some new skills and balance changes to the already deep skill system of its predecessor. I strongly recommend anyone looking to start a game spend some time researching skills, stats, and builds. I thoroughly enjoyed Book II, and while I did wind up putting it down at one point for a break (it is a long game), it's one of the few games I've been able to pick right back up and finish.			"

												Book 2 чувствуется уже не столько данью почтения канувшим в лету CRPG, сколько самостоятельная игра, вполне способная жить и существовать отдельно от воспоминаний породивших ее. Как и первая часть, игра определенно не для всех, но это умное, гармонично сложенное приключение, которое с удовольствием выведет вас за рамки комфорта, тем самым подарив уникальный игровой опыт.

												If you like good old Ultima-style (or a bit more advanced Diablo-looking) RPG's, with a darn good setting, Eschalon Book's your call. It's got a sensible story, loads to explore, blockades to explode and traps to exploit against your many newfound enemies.			"

												If you are a old school rpg fan that like turned based combat with survival aspects and many gameplay mechanics I recommend this. Its a fun game,lots of ways to personally build your characters and different ways to play.Think  you can just run around looting chests and such? Not in this game if a npc sees you rob them they will come after you to attack you. You can even kill the npcs if you want to.Eschalon Book 3 is coming out Summer 2013 so if you do not want this one,I would say wait for that one.It is going to have many improvements from the 2nd and I imagine lots more content.

												I play games that have character generators because I don't like being shoehorned into any particular shoes. But despite having a character generator Eschalon does a lot of shoehorning anyway. The world is very contrived, and very shallow. It's like a themepark. I tried to play as a travelling alchemy merchant and reluctant adventurer. Emphasis on reluctant. But was shoehorned into ""adventurer"" boots at every turn. This feeling I get from the game is no better summed up than when I encountered one NPC offering a very small job. It was one simple task; I was to take a recipe across the road. In any other game this would be conveyed as an NPC simply asking for you to do them a favour, (for example Ysolda in Skyrim asking you if you could keep an eye out for a Mammoth's tusk for them). In other games it's usually left up to you how you interpret your own actions, whether you're a vagrant looking for work, a sympathetic travelling merchant, a bard, knight, whatever - good RPGs don't get in the way of your role-playing. In Eschalon, even for a job as minor as this (taking a recipe across the road) the game couldn't help but make a show of it being a quest. Paraphrasing the game: ""Oh whee, look at this shortest quest ever am-i-rite"" *elbow nudge*. Yeh, Eschalon, you're like the infantile interpretation of a role-playing world; a cartoon of a role playing game rather than a role playing game. I really started to despise that so may of the interactions would result in either a generic ""adventurer"" quest or shoehorn you back into your ""adventurer"" boots via NPC dialogue. Thanks to Eschalon I now cringe the second I see the word 'quest'.My attempt to roleplay as a travelling merchant/alchemist (in a game that has both mercantile and alchemy skills no less) was annoyingly awkward in other ways too. I discovered that if you are a divine magic user, empty potion bottles are like gold dust. This is all thanks to the dev's decision to make whether or not empty bottles are even stocked subject to the whimsies of Random Number Generation. In the 30 hours I've spent in this particular playthrough I've bought every empty bottle any Magic vendor has ever stocked, and been hoarding empty bottles from those that I've used (as I said, i have Divine magic so I don't use up many potions for healing) and bearing in mind I have not sold any potions yet at all I've been totally hoarding all empties I have 10 filled potions and a piddling 14 empty potion bottles! Such a great Alchemy merchant I can be, selling potions all across the land, erm 14 times yeh. And yes, while I can technically buy potions, use them and get the empties, It kind of defeats the point of being able to make potions if I have to buy potions! While I'm determined to finish Book II, I will of course be done with the Eschalon series after this. Like I said, it's like a themepark; you can experience all the rides and have fun, and maybe that's enough for some, but for me its not. When playing RPGs I like to feel as if the world has an existence separate from my character. I like to feel as if it would still exist were I not there. In Eschalon everything is set up specifically around the player so that the world feels very cardboard. You can never escape the world trying to shoehorn you into your generic adventurer boots. In addition to this there are awkward quest designs that draw attention to the limitations of the game design therefore breaking immersion. In one instance I needed salt to complete one of the main quests. Whether or not salt spawns in a chest or shop is subject to the RNG. I decided buying it in a shop was the optimal way of a acquiring salt, since I had seen it stocked in inns before I knew I needed it. Shops restock every seven days. Bear in mind that a society which has no mechanical refrigeration will be heavily dependent on salt to preserve meat so salt should be a commonplace commodity easy to acquire and as essential to society as water. And before I knew I needed it I saw it everywhere (but as soon as I knew I needed it it magically disappeared thanks to the fickle RNG gods). It took me almost two dozen weeks in game time of weekly visits to every shop in Eschalon to finally finally find a vendor that had salt in stock. After the salt incident, I found myself spotting the a myriad of peculiarities that draw attention to the world of Eschalon being incredibly inconsistent with itself more than actually being able to enjoy the narrative of my own journey. And so Eschalon all unravels once one thread frays. Spoiler warningIn another example of the Eschalon world being self-inconsistent, I walked into a Dwarven mine described as impenetrable by any and all NPCs who had mentioned it, and not only did I penetrate it, but indeed did so by simply walking right past its occupants! Oh sure they would give chase the second they saw me, but they would follow me for about 10 steps and then give up, bless them. This suited me fine on the way down as I didn't want to harm the Dwarves since they had done me no wrong and were mixed up in this chain of events through no fault of their own. Once I reached the bottom of their mine I helped myself to a selection of their prized possessions and then turned around to make my way back to the nearest exit (conveniently located nearby I might add). Having been spotted by about three dozen Dwarves on the way down, I could have been forgiven for expecting that there would be an army of Dwarves rallied to stop this dirty human thief from making off with their treasures. Anti-climatically the Dwarves rallied a grand total of five Dwarves to stand between me and the exit of the lower part of the mine. And then having exited the lower part of the mine I walked right past a dozen more of the Dwarves I had walked past on the way down, waltzing out of the impenetrable Dwarvern mine without having to break stride once. Some scripted events such as finding on the way back out that Dwarves had overturned some tables and made some makeshift barricades to prevent my escape on the way back out would have been all that was necessary to give the illusion that the world was in some way more than cardboard. But no. It fascinates me that in a game that plays up the fact that you can take a non-combat approach if you want to, no contingency is ever put in place for that actually occurring. Events on the way out always seem to unfold as they would have if you had murdered everyone on the way in.It's not a bad game, by any means, there's a lot that's good about it, but believable world building and self consistency is so central to an RPG that Eschalon's lapses in this area really harm it. So much of my character's story involved doing out of character things to make up for the flaws in the world design or finding huge discordance between the narrative of the NPCs and the actual state of affairs in the game world. As games go Eschalon had all the potential in the world to be something great, unfortunately it turned out to be miles wide but an inch deep.			"

												Eschalon: Book II is a game you have to have  history to appreciate. If you grew up on classic crpgs, then you may know the score. You just have to find that perfect afternoon to play it. Preferably one where you are thinking back to the first computer rpg games you fell in love with. It is a tough game, but it is rewarding and fun. You can watch a few ""Let's Plays"" and get an idea, but until you pick it up you will not understand what makes it great. My simple yes or no scale: Yes, buy it. Many of us pine for those halcyon days of PCRPGS. This is your time machine back.			"

												Much like the game that came before it, the only thing that has improved is the graphical quality.  Trudge slowly through open fields to use the same two skills against the same enemies through similar locations for dozens of hours you will never get to live again!  It tries to slam Diablo in its description, but it's essentially the same as a dumbed-down version of Diablo that's turn-based in spite of not having the depth to justify such a choice.  I bought this on sale for about a dollar, and still regretted it.			"
