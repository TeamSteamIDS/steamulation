You can't take the sky from me...Take Starpoint Gemini 2, Freelancer, Elite Dangerous and the worldbuilding of Starcraft 2, throw into a foodblender. Put on high for two minutes.*WHIRRR*This is the result. A gorgeous, whisky-soaked blend of a game where pilots drink greel distilled alcohol, where antimatter specks are used for deviant practices, and where combat takes place on a horizontal plane straight out of Assassins' Creed : Black Flag, on crack. All handled with the colour and panache of the original Torchlight, which exploded out of nowhere and revitalised the Dungeon Crawler genre. This promises, and mostly succeeds in doing the same for space exploration.I'm a leaf on the wind, I'm a leaf on the wind!In the time honoured tradition of all space exploration games everywhere, you are thrown into a starter ship, in this case, a dinky little corvette with a few broadside cannons, a few turrets, and a hull made of papier mache and shields made of soap suds. It is your job to find your Aunt Juno, who so very kindly left you this ship, and find out why you've been dragged out to the tail end of space, which is full of the scum of the universe, and work your way up the foodchain, blowing up said scum and villainy, and eventually become owner of a pimped up ship of doom and destruction. Depending on your playstyle this may be a top notch destroyer, with speed and agility and tons of guns, or a dreadnaught with a horrifying number of broadsides, or a heavy hauler with enough armour to qualify as having it's own gravitational pull.Or, y'know, you could buy a strike craft and try to outrun bullets, but that's for the clinically insane. Even top level shields and good guns won't allow you to toe it with the enemy dreadnaughts for -long-, but hey, whatever flicks your switch!Miner, trader, soldier, sailor...Rebel galaxy gives you a very, very diverse set of tools to work with, you can tool up for mining with lasers and fault scanners, or you can go full out commodity trader, and the economy is set up enough to actually handle that, with system averages and station histories that actually work properly and can be scanned from out of station across the system, allowing you to set up profitable trade routes back and forth. This can pay off very nicely once you have a high capacity hauler, particularly if that hauler has one of the contraband cargo expansions which means you can facilitate life as a smuggler on the side.Or you can just blow things up, because explosions are pretty. Blowing things up always work, and there's a terrifying variety of weapons, not just purchasable, but also lootable unique variants which can be discovered in the world, in loot crates or from the hulls of pirate lords, if you feel like converting them to scrap metal.The pool is wide, but not QUITE as deep as space promises...Rebel Galaxy offers a -lot- of activities, and offers enough in each activity to have you happily whiling away your time, moreso than Elite Dangerous did (and yes, I know many E;D fans who are going to burn me for that, but it's true), the mining is more sensibly handled due to the tractor beams, the combat is more visceral and less grindy, the trading makes more sense and doesn't require an excel spreadsheet to get the best out of. There's a real economy, and you don't need to be online to get the most out of the game.There are -two- buts to this rather delicious soup.One : The factions - They are present, but they're rather bland. More time and depth could have been put into them, faction exclusive ships for each faction would have been glorious, along with modules, as well as faction exclusive bases that you could dock at, along with missions and different reactions based on standing, as well as more complex interrelations between said factions. Right now you basically have only two paths you can follow. If there's anything that could exponentially increase the lifespan of this game - Faction DLC would do it. This would convert a 20-40 hour game to a 200-400 hour game. No joke.Two : Whilst the activities are good, they all tend to peter out once you get out past the destroyer mark, and the fact you can only hire gunship level mercenaries puts a hard cap on the kind of fights they can throw at you. Hiring capital level mercenaries would have solved this. Again, faction DLC for the win here.Final thoughts...Do these two issues stop this game from being anything other than excellent? No. It's still a bloody great game, and for the price point they're charging it's an absolute steal. It does however prevent me from slamming the ""Essential"" badge on, because I know that the devs could quite possibly get the Factions some love, and make this ""the"" game to beat. Hint hint. It does, however, easily merit being a game that people should look into, especially if you're someone who loved Freelancer, or similar games.Verdict : Highly RecommendedWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

												Rebel Galaxy... Bought it because of the soundtrack in the trailers... Took a gamble and hoped it would give me some entertainment... Man was I surprised... Sooo.... Breaking it down:1. You will feel like a frikking space cowboy.2. Music so damn good that you want the soundtrack in every possible format.3. The sheer size of this game is just shocking! Did NOT expect that when I started it.4. Broadside battles between two large spaceships might be the coolest thing ever.5. BROADSIDES!!!! (It´s so damn cool I had to mention it twice!).6. Voice actors are actually kind of good for a game thats not a AAA.7. Did I mention broadsides? 8. Simple, but complex. 9. One bug, ONE(1!), found during my entire playthrough. EA, Bethesda, Bohemian and just about everyone else, LOOK AT THESE GUYS AND LEARN!!! It was not even a gamebreaking bug! All it did was made me crash into a station after warp and my ship autodocked, which I had planned to do anyway so the bug actually made me save some time since I didn´t have to ""slowboat"" all the way after warp. Downsides then? Yeah a few actually, but many of them is just me being picky.1. Game gets repetetive after a while and considering how many ships there is you may just finish the story halfway through the ship line. 2. Main story line is waaay to easy. 3. Considering it´s a space game, you may actually believe there would be free flight in all directions... like up and down... but nope! ship stays leveled and all you need to think about is right, left, back and forward... However this is forgiven thanks to the awesomeness of broadside battles. 4. Soundtrack makes this game, without it (sometimes the music stops) it just feels empty. 5. Characters kind of lacked depth and you probably won´t get too attached to them. Despite the downsides I still give this game a solid 7/10. It has the right ""feel"" to it and It´s absolutely one of those ""If this gets a sequel, the devs will get it all right"" kind of game.			"

												A fantastic indie space action game that has a heavy firefly vibe.Pros- Broadside combat- Lots of ships and equipment to progress into- Good story and large universe- Randomly generated universe- Non linear progression- Very enjoyable Combat- Soundtrack is greatCons- Some aspects are shallow such as diplomacy- Side missions are used over and over just with different locations and enemies.- Long travel times- Debris can stop warp

												This was one of the most fun space-based games I played in recent history... and I own/have played a LOT of space games.This is not exactly ""space"" sim as much as naval ship arcade-based action RPG, but it has the atmosphere, characters, and ship variety to keep things fresh.I clocked my 52.5 hours in a single play-through from start to finish, and yes, I did play this game for fun, so I did not rush past areas or just hop from mission to mission. I hunted for bounties, stopped raids, broke blockades, and... well... PLAY the damn game instead of just trying to get it over with.The game's unique take on broad-side combat, old-school battleship-style A la WWII, makes for a refreshing space experience that made me wonder why other space combat games did not adopt a similar format long ago.This is NOT an X3-equivalent space empire building sim, nor is it a hardcore rogue-like. It's simple a great single-player adventure with great combat mechanics and above-average story progression with TONS of polish and character. This is better than most AAA titles today.For the money, it's a steal at full price. On sale it's a MUST GET.			"

												This is an extraordinarily playable spaceship-piloting game. Very simple and easy to get into, whilst yet providing enough customisability and choice to justify the ""open world"" tag, it drew me in from the first five minutes and kept me completely immersed until the endgame. It has an easy learning curve, but it doesn't sacrifice complexity overmuch.Very pretty graphics and gratifying sound - the soundtrack, by the way, is PERFECT. And even if you don't like it, it has an amazing feature of being able to choose your own music, and assign it to different in-game scenarios. Reeeeeally nice touch.The story is quite an interesting one for sci-fi fans, and there is a surprising amount of speech/animation for a game at this price point - enough to make it a genuinely fun campaign. There is even replay value in the amount of choice in factions and weaponry.The only issue I have is that it's too short, in that the game initially hints at a large amount of content - ships; weapons; star systems, etc. and then simply makes these things very time-consuming to attain, and the end of the line- best ship; best weapons; final star system, happens a bit too soon, with the endgame lying on predictable lines from the progression set out on at the start. To sum up - extreme value for money here - just don't forget you're not playing an AAA title, like I did, and be disappointed that it ends too soon.			"

												To some this game will be a disaster that you hate, especially if you want a realistic space sim.Others will find it an exhilarating experience, ""dumbed down"" enough and arcadey enough that it's playable for the masses especially since you're locked in 2 dimensions.PLEASE RE-READ THAT AGAIN.Your ship can not move up or down, only left or right, in space. To many this will be a deal breaker.But wait!I tell you this game is a blast if you give it a chance. It will have you on the edge of your seat having a good old time as you learn the finer points of capital ship combat, and die in the process. The save system is very forgiving and you can have multiple playthroughs going at once (rename your ship to keep the saves separate is a good tip).There are mission boards with side missions and a main story line, commodities trading, tons of action and nothing a well timed deflector shield button press can't solve!  Lots of upgrades, weapons, shields, deflectors, various parts of the ship can be upgraded as well. Just enough depth in missions and main story to keep you going and the action can be intense. Also, each time you start the world you start in front seems to be based on some RNG combo as it's been different the 3 times my son and I started new games. Haven't done any comparisons for the rest of the ""universe""Just make sure you are going in with the right expectations and I would expect you to find this game addicting and rewarding. Get it on sale and you won't be sorry!  Also, the music is awesome, just let the game load and the title screen run and it can be amazing on it's own!Here's a good example of an early experience: Flying an early ship with shields and deflector, trying to get a few side missions and upgrade my weapons. I pick up a dead drop and 4 fighter craft, all pirates, drop in on me and my hired Mercenary. we kick in our engines and split up, both targeting the same ship from different sides, blowing it out of.....space? Not air certainly! Anyway, it's a quick fight and we dispatch them easy, going to hyperspace and heading to take the dead drop back.Suddenly we get interdicted out of hypersace and it's pirates agian, but much worse as it's two medium sized cruisers with fighter escort.  Trying to isolate one target at a time we fight a retreating battle, luring the fighters away from the cruisers and trying to divide and conquer.The cruisers are having none of it and their thrusters flare as they quickly close the distance and open fire. Our shields are taking heavy damage and missiles are coming in (thank goodness for flak guns and deflector shields) when a militia destroyer warps in with fighter escort and opens fire on the pirate cruisers. Our 2 ships and the local constables, basically, wipe out the pirates in a fierce but ultimately one sided battle. The militia ship scans us after, tells us to move along and we head on our way to finish the mission.Phew!  Good times!Please remember this is 2 dimensional, left right only movement of your ship, but trust me it works and the game is actually quite a lot of fun!			"

												This is the most fun that I've had with a spaceship-based combat game since Freelancer and, before that, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter.  I have not beaten it yet, but these are my impressions so far.The Good:  The PRICE. This game plays like a $60 AAA title.  Fast-paced combat in capital ships that actually includes you piloting instead of just giving commands.  Main storyline makes you want to learn more.  QWERTY controls are downright elegant - I own a controller but have no desire to use it.  No Z-Axis - I understand some people refuse to buy the game for this reason but, not only is it unnecessary, it would also make the game extremely awkward considering the types of ships you're flying. You won't miss it, trust me.  Young game, but so far, almost entirely bug free.  Epic blues soundtrack that changes songs depending on what you're doing in game. Fast music for fights, cruising music for, well, cruising.  The game world feels like Firefly would if it would have had a lot more in-space pewpew and also aliens. Lots of aliens.  Enough ship customization, but not so much that you feel like you need an encyclopedia. (looking at you, EVE)  Bits and pieces of humor throughout.  Graphics are pretty, if not necessarily stunning.   The galaxy is persistent, living, and breathing, and things are happening that have nothing whatsoever to do with you, which can cause interesting results.The Not-As-Good:  They're not planning on expansions or DLC or anything, last I heard, and there have been zero updates to the game since launch, though that was only 15 days ago. I'd like to think there's a big content patch in the works or something, but I have no evidence for that. The game is, however, absolutely stable, as far as I can tell, so maybe they're just considering it finished. (edit - as of 11/17/15, they have released a small patch)  Running missions to keep your ship powerful enough to take on the next story element might be too reptitive for some, though I'm enjoying it.  Escort missions are still kind of broken. I just did one where my client's destination was to a base that was aggressive to him, presumably because the base was aggressive to me. I don't know any reason a merchant would purposely go to a station whose defenses were going to shred him. On the first attempt, there was also a BIG fleet, and I didn't get credit for the mission because he got blown up. On the second attempt, no fleet, so although the station's defenses opened fire on us both, I got credit for the mission just before the merchant ship exploded. So I looted him and flew off, getting both the merchant's cargo and the pay for the escort. Amusing, but obviously not what the developers intended.Is this worth your $20? Absolutely. Zero question. Even if you don't particularly like these types of games, the lack of Z-axis might actually do it for you. It makes the game feel a lot less nauseating to those who typically can't handle the extra plane, and eliminates the circling buzzard effect that tends to plague starfighter-based games (Elite: Dangerous, looking at you).  There's something about running straight at a ship three times your size, turning and opening up your cannons and just shredding them that is immensely and uniquely gratifying while some fast-paced, hard-core electric guitar plays on queue, and the pirate-lord screams ""No...no-no-no-NO!"" then blows up, leaving behind a rare piece of ship equipment.

												This is easily one of the year's best games, combining the atmosphere and open ""do what you like"" dynamics of Freelancer, with combat similar to Starfleet Command / Black Flag (like those games your ship is restricted to the same plane, so this isn't a hardcore space sim, but it serves the gameplay well). The vibe is very much like Firefly, mostly due to the excellent grungy soundtrack, but also the look and feel of the ships, stations, and frontier-mentality characters that you meet. It works so well because the core gameplay is hugely enjoyable. Combat is dynamic and in-your-face, ships and missiles explode and shake the screen, lasers sear the side of your ship, damage is nicely modelled so that surviving a brutal encounter feels like you escaped by the skin of your teeth, your hull blackened, components shorting out, systems breaking down as you hurry to find repairs. I've spent most of my time doing missions from the bulletin boards rather than following the story, that's how much fun it all is.The universe is procedurally generated every time you start a new game, which certainly gives it legs, although to be honest the game is pretty large in scope; you'll spend at least 10 hours in the starting system, and there are many more after that. The difficulty at first is quite high, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of how combat works, and a few early upgrades will help you feel badass. Merceneries can be hired if you're still having trouble.There's more to the game than combat though, mining is actually a lot of fun (unlike Elite: Dangerous where it's sadly rather tedious), trading (legal or otherwise) is viable once you upgrade your cargo hold and find the best prices in the dynamic system, and there are plenty of things to run into out in the depths of space. Speaking of which, there's a real sense of ""space"" as you travel around, not enough to be tedious as you travel between planets, but enough to make it feel like a journey, watching nebulae whip by, unknown flotillas caught on the edge of your scanner, and the occasional tempting beacon to check out. The story is also a cut above the usual generic stuff, decent writing helped by the setting, and some nice voice work, plus the story missions are some of the best time to be had.I can possibly seeing it getting a bit repetitive after a while, but tell me a game that isn't. For 20 bucks you should get several days of enjoyment from this. It really depends on how much you enjoy the core gameplay loop, but for me this is the best space game released in 2015 by miles, because the developers clearly want you to have a blast. Constant updates and bug fixes show that they're committed to their customers, a great example of a two-man team showing the big boys how it's done.			"

												No time to read: Very pretty, but very shallow.Rebel Galaxy gives a great first impression. Great graphics, great soundtrack, great atmosphere. Different weapon types and visceral combat. No-one would blame you if you thought that this was the next Privateer or Freelancer.But delve into it a bit deeper and you begin to see the hollowness under its pretty exterior. Combat that was fun at the start becomes very repetitive the 20th time you beat the exact same group of pirates using the exact same tactics. There's not much to do in combat either, all of your weapons work on some form of autoaim so you don't even have the challenge of leading your target properly in order to hit them. The worst part of the combat is how its more attritional than based on maneuver. You'd think that because a lot of the ships' firepower is in their broadsides you can maneuver to 'cross their T' so you can take down targets much larger than you are, but all ships have omnidirectional turrets that make this very hard to do. Instead of fighters trying to get on each other's tail or ships trying to cross each others' T, Rebel Galaxy's ships are more like 2 RTS units shooting at each other: DPS and shielding are king and the effect of maneuver is minimal.This is made even worse by the way the game tiers its weapons and defenses. The tiers are set up in this game in such a way that its possible to get into a situation where you fight a ship you can never beat (i.e. their shields regenerate faster than you can ever damage them), and your only recourse is to grind money so you can buy the next higher tier of weaponry. It makes the game into one big grind. And the grind takes a LONG time. In the later stages of the game it would take upwards of 20 missions to fully upgrade your ship's weapons, shields and components to the next tier.The grind also puts the blandness of the procedurally generated universe into stark relief. Once you've seen all the types of stations in the first system, you've seen all the stations in the rest of the game. The only thing that differentiates one station from another is what tier of weapons they sell. There are no special 'capital planets' or 'story planets' like there were in Privateer or Freelancer. There's no sense of exploration as a station of one type in a system is virtually identical to a station of the same type in another system. You won't get the sense of discovery that you get when you first land in the Oxford system in the original Privateer, or when you land on a capital planet in Freelancer.The main storyline also falters at the very end. Barring the grind, the main quests are interesting enough to get you to the finale. The ending though, is bullpoo. Let's just say that someone leaves for no damn good reason, and you're dumped into the sandbox with very little fanfare. And by the time you finish it, you'd be so tired of the grind that the sandbox would no longer have any appeal.If you're looking for a Privateer or Freelancer-type game try Starpoint Gemini 2 instead. It's a lot less polished but it has a big enough universe to make discovery interesting, has a tolerable grind and more interesting combat. Or dust off the old joystick and play Independence War 2.

												I'm old enough to have fond memories of playing Privateer and Freelancer.  I picked up Rebel Galaxy hoping to renew my love for those games.  While I didn't quite find what I was looking for, I found a solid game worth playing.For people who loved the aforementioned games for the open-ended exploration, the ability to build your bankroll by buying low on some planets and selling high on others, upgrading ships and weapons as you progressed, and the intriguing storyline, this game is definitely worth playing because it does all of those things well.  For those who loved those games because of the thrill of small craft in-cockpit open space dogfighting, you should probably look elsewhere. Rebel Galaxy managed to take the inherent 3D nature of space and reduce it to 2D, implementing a colonial era ship ""broadside"" style combat as if on the surface of invisible water.  It isn't necessarily bad, but not my cup of tea.  Essentially, you can really only do one thing, turn and fire over and over.  It gets repetitive after a while and eventually I found myself wishing I could auto-resolve battles to move on through the story.  That being said, the combat was not so off-putting as to keep me from playing until the end of the main story.  Bottom line, this game is worth what you pay for it but don't expect a masterpiece.

												Disclosure: I received an early Beta CopySimply put, I love the game. In essence for me it's Freelancer reborn, except with capital ships.The gameplay is fantastic, although I would strongly recommend a controller. Both the 360 one, and the Steam Controller work brilliantly with the game.One thing that separates the game from freelancer is the capital ships, and that you use Broadsides for your primary weapons. As such you need to get your sides facing the enemies.Fear not though, it's still super intense, and you have plenty of other weaponry. Ranging from Secondary fire ones such as EMP Waves, Flak cannons and plenty of turrets. Turrets are mostly A.I controlled, although you can set priorities for each and every one of them. Such as Fire at Any Craft, Target, Locked Targets only, or even Fighters only.This means that you can focus all fire on a single enemy, or you can handle the capital ships while your turrets deal with the swarms of enemy fighter and gunships.It's rather odd at first, but after a while it becomes extremely satisfying. To the point of almost feeling like you're in Battlestar Galactica fending off literal swarms of enemies.Sadly, you're unable to be a carrier and have your own fighters, although it's not too much of an issue.The story is very interesting, and it certainly is engaging. Although some story missions have very high requirements and as such you Have to go do other missions to get a better ship and equipment.This is no issue at all, and extremely fun. You can do a variety of missions, or you can just do pirate bounty hunting. Doing missions however increases or decreases your reputation with various factions. This in turn unlocking newer ship hulls, and equipment. You're also able to join some guilds, such as the Mercenaries or Merchants which give extra missions and other unique ship hulls.I would strongly encourage you to find one you like. Trading is not the most complex of systems, but very manageable, and slightly fun. I've never been much of a trader but each system and station has various prices and requirements. An impoverished station will pay a lot more for food and water than a well set up military one. While some might accept some contraband pirate items; ranging from Narco Cola, to Living Organs.Ships can also be scanned so be careful carrying contraband, the Militia will scan you and will hail you to explain yourself. If you simply ignore their Hails they will go hostile and attack you. If you want to play with those items, make sure to get a Smuggler's Cargohold; They can't be scanned ;)Graphics and performance wise the game does extremely well. It's no Star Citizen, but it looks great and runs even better. Now I might have an overkill machine with Two GTX 980Ti's, but playing at 4K with DSR I was topping out at 144FPS which is my monitor's cap, and at worst getting 80fps. The only slight complaint I have is little lag spikes when phasing in and out of a station. Although this is most likely an engine issue that'll soon be fixed for textures loading in and out.As for graphical options the game as plenty and they're all adjusted with through the game launcher. It also has 3 graphics APIs to choose from. DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and even OpenGL if you fancy using that.I unfortunately only have experience running the game in DX11, but it's done exceptionally well.The last thing I want to mention is the brilliant soundtrack. It's very similar to Borderlands, and I feel it suits the game very well. Personally it gives me a Borderlands and Cowboy Bebop feel to the game and I really enjoy having it on.In the game launcher however you can also create some custom music options so you can expand it all  if you so desire.All in all, I simply love the game. I've 40 hours into it, and I've still not finished the main story because I've been having so much fun with everything else. If you enjoyed Freelancer, I would really recommend the game; and for others it's simply a great mini sandbox open Space Action Sim with capital ships.PC Gameplay 60 FPS

												I'm not really sure when space westerns became a thing. My secret inner weeb wants to point to Cowboy Bebop or Trigun, but it just as easily could have been Firefly or Starcraft or something else entirely. They're the logical conclusion of humanity expanding into space, really, embracing the freedom of an open universe without the unity or enlightenment of something like Star Trek. This is precisely where Rebel Galaxy lives, in a simple wild west approach to space battles and exploration.You begin the game by inheriting an old junk freighter from your aunt and running errands in it for an old alien acquaintance of hers. Following the main story missions unravels a lengthy, familiar tale of deep space intrigue and ancient artifacts. This is of course only one option of many in the vein of something like Sid Meier's Pirates! because you can just as easily haul cargo, claim bounties, or pirate convoys for as long as the game holds your attention. A fair spread of ships, weapons, and upgrades are available across several factions for you to spend your hard-earned credits on and advance in power.The moment-to-moment gameplay of Rebel Galaxy is like an arcadey version of naval combat. Capital ships in this sci-fi reality still rely on broadsides for most of their firepower, so you'll be sidling up to just about everything you want to blow away. You also get auto-targeting turrets and a secondary weapon that can fire missiles or flak, as well as shield and speed boosters to expand your tactical options. I wouldn't say there's a lot of depth to the combat but positioning and prioritizing targets can mean the difference between victory and the cold embrace of hard vacuum.Unless you get really into the mostly generic story you're going to want to spend most of your time amassing wealth for bigger ships and guns. There's a basic commodity system you can play space trader with that requires some attention to trade routes and emergent events, but most of your time will probably be spent on missions. Each station has a mission board offering bounty collections, blockades, pirate hunting, cargo hauling, and more. These missions are assigned a difficulty based on your ship's current loadout, which is terribly helpful because anything above Average carries a very real chance of annihilating you in an instant.Rebel Galaxy offers a very promising setup and world to prosper in but suffers from a few issues, the difficulty curve being chief among them. At some point you're going to hit a wall where your next story mission or the only profitable missions are High or Very High risk, and if the enemy composition is not favorable to your particular ship you're going to die very, very fast. Upgrading to a larger ship is the easiest way to climb the difficulty curve but can require a LOT of side missions and busywork if the next hull in line isn't very cheap. People who are easily distracted and habitually clear side missions will fare a lot better than most here.The further you get the more technical issues you'll see crop up as well. Late in the game I started having mission-critical items disappear and enemy ships not properly register as objectives, which led to some aggravating wastes of time. There's also a lot going on in every star system, with pirates and militia lurking everywhere. This sounds cool at first but missions don't account for or clear existing entities in the mission space, so a Low risk battle against some frigates can turn out to be instantly fatal if the game decides to spawn pirate dreadnoughts in that particular sector.I've had my fair share of frustration with this title, but most of my time in it has been a relaxing and rewarding romp around the galaxy. The systems you explore are expansive, colorful, and full of debris fields and nebulae to explore for secrets and bounties. Warping around has a great feel to it, with rich engine sounds and visual distortions through space. The twangy western feel is out in full force as well, with plenty of rough-spoken captains to deal with, junky ships to pilot and pilfer, and plenty of wailing country rock to fill the silent void.At times it feels very much like a friendlier, simpler, offline EVE Online, though it never really matches the same sense of scale or vastness. I mean that in the best and worst ways, too, because it never really aspires to be more than a basic space hauling shooting gallery. And yet, there's an undeniable draw to scraping together the credits to land a new class of vessel and taking it out for a spin in the places you feared to tread before. That's where Rebel Galaxy really succeeds, in giving you a universe to explore and plenty of reasons to see it all.			"

												If they tried, really tried, to make a Firefly game that nailed it...it would be this game.  It's more like Sid Meier's Pirates in space, or crossed with Freelancer/Privateer, than a traditional space sim.  This is fine because those games were all amazing.  You're piloting a capital ship, not a little fighter, which gives it a different feel.  The combat is extremely satisfying, there are a lot of choices in how you equip your ship, and the universe feels like there are really things going on in it besides what you're doing.If you liked Pirates: instabuy, the game systems are similar.  If you like the idea of capital ship scale combat and an open world, also buy.  Firefly fan and like games at all?  Buy.  This is the first space game since Freelancer that I really enjoyed straight out of the box, and it's a steal at its price.			"

												Just beat the game and thought I would write a review.  This game is really good and deserves a sequel.  Definitely has a Firefly universe feel to it which says a lot really.  Definitely worth 20 bucks.Pros - Well designed, awesome soundtrack, great voiceovers.  Cons - A liitle too easy.  I used a merc frigate throughout the whole game, took on whole fleets including super dreadnoughts and the enemy rarely got through my shields.  Using basic common sense is more powerful than a dreadnought it seems.  The ending of the game, while realistic, felt a bit underwhelming to be honest.  The game goes to sandbox only then, but whats the point really..Conclusion: A really wonderful gem here on Steam.  Without a doubt one of the best space games ever made.  These guys made a solid game and it was worth my 20 bucks easy.  Just hate its over.  Now I hope they make a sequel or another game of this quality.  Thanks.			"

If you loved Freelancer, Rebel Galaxy is the game you've been waiting for After playing 40+ hours and not even completing the main story (by choice), this game has content literally for daysthe procedural generation manages to be varied enough that you don't feel that you're repeating the same mission over and over.Heavy customization of ships, 21 playable ships and I've maybe flown half of them, and the ability to customize nearly every aspect of your ship.Solid trading / economy engine, merchants guild faction that specializes in trade, Space truck to your hearts content.Did I mention broadside combatPull up alongside a menacing dreadnaught and unleash hell with up to 20 broadsides, and watch their hull melt before the glow of your might cannons.Solid dialog engine, reminiscent of Freelancer, new in this system the barkeep my have some tips for you, looking for your next score slip the bartender some credits and he may let you in on some secrets. need some help elbow up to the local mercenary, talk shop or hire them to be your wingman.I can't speak highly enough of this game. look forward to seeing this franchise continue into the future.

Posted: October 26, 2015
												So here it is-my Rebel Galaxy review. Full disclosure-I'm friends with the devs and got an advanced copy of the game. That said I've done my best to be impartial.My Tl'dr opinion? I  love it and was well over 100 hours in before I took a break from it. This is so many things about space games I love rolled into one.The Setting.The game goes for a Firefly/Wing Commander:Privateer/Freelancer vibe. The solar systems in this game are on the wrong side of the galactic tracks and haven't had a bath in aeons. They're rude, crude and filled with rocks and junk. Rebel Galaxy features an interesting cast of characters. It's one of the games unfortunate downsides that you never really get to know any of them very well. It's loaded with the kind of wink/nudge humor you'd find in TV series like Farscape or Firefly-for example one of the commodities you can trade is called 'Narco-cola' and it is just that. Powerful narcotics in the form of carbonated beverage. If you're a fan of stuff like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy you'll appreciate the humor. The Story:Length 30-40 hours (20 if you're an old hand at these kind of games).It ain't deep but it gets the job done. Like I wrote above the characters all have interesting personalities but those personalities are shallow and you won't interact with any of them very much. It's a shame because they are just interesting enough where I wanted to get to know them more. By the time I got past the 'Hello, nice to meet you, may I help you kill this troup of troublemakers?' bits their role in the story was done. This becomes even more disappointing by the end of the story. It's a great lead up but the end is a bit of a letdown. I'll give DDGames credit-despite my not liking how it ended I've played through it numerous times now. The Sound:If you're into down and dirty southern-fried blues rock this will be right up your alley. It helps add a lot to the atmosphere and makes you feel like every space station bar serves oil pan shots and barbed wire biscuits. The sound effects are another matter entirely-voiceovers can get a bit repetitive to the point of tediousness at times. Some of the audio isn't mixed well-radio chatter clips/distorts a lot and I don't recommend you use expensive speakers or a subwoofer if you plan on blasting this. Voice acting isn't bad for an indie game. This is one of the things that lends a lot of personality to the characters. It was done by the devs themselves (with the help of the always amazing Lani Minella). I dare say it's better than in most Bethesda games I've played. Even though Travis does numerous voices they sound different enough where it's not that much of a drawback. Ships:There are 21 playable ships you're able to buy throughout the game. Some of these require money and some require you to build a positive reputation with various factions (pirates, merchants guild etc). Each ship is upgradable with a wide variety of weapons and components. Lasers, missiles, shields, hulls-you can customize your ship to beef them up and match them to your playing style. This wide variety and manner of acquiring and upgrading ships means there's a lot of replay to be squeezed out of the game.I did find it unfortunate that you're not able to access all ships. Certain ships belonging to certain races seem to be inaccessible which is a real downer in a game that revolves around the very notion of collecting every ship you happen to come across. Combat:Combat takes place on a 2-D plane. That means it's more like naval combat in games like Assassin's Creed:Black Flag or Sid Meiers Pirates (the 2004 edition) or the auto combat in Mad Max. Thanks to the variety of components and weapons in game no matter what your playstyle is you can adapt your craft to it. Upgrading certain components helps with your survivability. You can also hire a merc to accompany you which is always a smart move as some of them are extremely lethal. The one down side of using a merc is that you can't upgrade their weapons or ships.It would have been cool to see something closer to the pets in Torchlight or Companions in Diablo III-especially considering all the weaponry that drops from capital ships. Being able to give my mercs better gear early on would have helped a lot as the best mercs aren't available until late in the game.The main downside to combat is that difficulty seems to be very imbalanced at the moment. It's a lot of fun don't get me wrong but some missions say they're difficult when they're not and vice versa. It's also pretty spinny. Enemies run but they never run -that- fast or far which  means there will be times when you spend  battles going in circles. That said the effects are glorious and when combat is good it's really, really good. The other stuff:Mining-It's a pretty zen-like experience. Cruise up to some rocks, scan them then go up to the ones full of ore. You can buy a fault tracker early on that paints red circles on asteroids that have more than one piece of ore in them. Blow it up that way and you get multiple ores. It's a pretty relaxing experience unfortunately unless you're very good at the market stuff, explore a LOT and very patient you won't be making a ton of credits mining. Commodities: Stations sell commodities. Buy low/sell high type stuff. Different stations have different events that effect the rest of that systems economies. You can also read the in station news boards or ask the bartenders/merchants for info. Hackable transponders that give tasty info, random cargo containers that contain nice loot (sort of like the outer space version of barrells in an rpg) and rescue missions aplenty are some of the other bits of content you'll find in this game. SUMMARY:Rebel Galaxy is a fun, arcadey naval-game-in-space that provides some of the trappings of a space-sim while ditching most of the complexity and time-investment required of more traditional space sims like EVE Online or Elite:Dangerous. It's great for drop in and play for a half hour or so sessions. If you're the kind of person who spends hours playing space games just for the sake of the atmosphere and love blowing stuff up with enough lights to build a discotechque this will scratch that itch for at least a little while. Personally I'm 100 hours in and haven't gotten bored yet.Those looking for a deeply engaging story you're not going to find one but the characters have tons of personality and give the setting a very lived in feel-just be ready for the ending to be a bit of a let down. Those into trading should be happy though the game feels like it needs a bit of tweaking since not all professions feel viable. The accent is on combat so expect to blow up a lot of ships if you're looking to be one of the galaxy's richest space truckers. Despite its flaws this is an impressive first game from Double Damage Games. The developers put a lot of heart into this and it shows. This would have been a solid deal even at $30 but at $20 it's way more than worth it.			"

												If you're looking for a space pew pew lazorz game, just buy it. Right now. What are you waiting for? Stop reading these words and go buy it.You're still reading? Fine I'll put more words here that might mean things about stuff. Seriously, though, this game overdelivers its $20 at release date price (or whatever you can get it for on sale). There are plenty of other reviews speaking to what's great about this game, so I won't beat a dead horse. However, I would like to speak to some of the negative comments that I've seen.""Missions are repetitive."" - this is true, but that hasn't reduced my enjoyment of gameplay. Sure the missions are repetitive, but each encounter does have variations within it. There are at least 3 major variations with each mission: mission type, types of friendlies, types of enemies. There are escort missions (follow a friendly around at warp speed and defend them from attacking hostiles that pull you out of warm), defend missions (move into an engagement and prevent friendlies from being destroyed), destroy missions (fly in guns blazing until everything is on fire, including you), snatch and run / fight missions (fly into an area teeming with hostiles, grab some cargo, and gtfo), delivery missions (get some cargo and deliver it to another station, while being pulled out of warp multiple times from hostiles trying to take your cargo). There are also other types that I haven't done yet (pirate missions).The other aspect that changes missions are types of friendlies/enemies. Sometimes you're fighting multiple cruisers with minor fighter support, sometimes you're fighting a dreadnaught with tons of fighter support, sometimes you're fighting waves upon waves of fighters - and yes these do require different engagement tactics. Good luck charging into waves of mine layer / bomber fighters with a cruiser and winning. I also feel like I need to point out that repetitive side missions aren't a new thing. How many times have you collected herbs as a side quest in some other RPG?""2D space combat"" - When I read this before buying it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. After playing the game - I just don't care that it's not 3D. I don't feel like it being 3D would make it any more fun, especially with the ""broadside"" style gameplay (which I do enjoy). The 2D movement environment plus broadside style combat provides enough complexity without making it over-complex. You can still use tactics to use a smaller vessel to take down a larger one. I've used my quick cruiser to take down multiple dreadnaughts by getting behind them so that the only damage I'm taking is from their rear turrets and the occasional heat seeking missile, and they can't turn fast enough to broadside me. Plus with a fast vessel you have enough maneuverability to be able to zig-zag between your broadsides (shields don't depreciate as a whole - but each side is separate, for a total of 4 shields) to be able to keep your shields up, all while staying out of the main line of fire. Or you could just buy a huge ship, get ramming deflectors, AND RAMMING SPEED EVERYTHING TO DEATH. Twice.""Main Storyline is [insert words]"" I'm not sure why people are complaining about the main storyline. At the time of writing this I've had 26 hours in the game and still haven't finished it. Sure it's nothing especially fancy... but it is engaging, and seriously it's a $20 game. I'm not sure what you expect. I've played plenty of single player RPG-style games (ones that ONLY have a main storyline) that I've cleared in under 30 hours, and those were $50-60 at release.""Soundtrack something or other"" I also really enjoyed the soundtrack with it's Firefly vibe, however I would have to agree that it starts getting repetitive. I also have an easy solution. Turn off the music. Play your own if you really want music. Again, for a $20 game the soundtrack exceeds what I would expect.Final thoughts - the depth and enjoyability of the game overdelivers as a $20 price tag, making it a worthwhile purchase.  I would also like to see (and gladly pay for) some DLC/expansions to further increase the depth of the game (greater variety of missions, more ships, more weapons, more factions, expand main storyline, more musc, online co-op play)End transmission?

												Rebel Galaxy is one of those games I would call ""delightfully average"". Pros exceed the cons of the game, and replay-value exists. Well, at least after a while of not playing the game. I grabbed the game on a small sale, and played about 80-90 hours so it worked for me. However, there's of course the bad sides, like in almost any game. Only two dimensions available for maneuvering, mundane npc-encounters, a bit grindy and relatively short + clichéd storyline.If you love hearty rock, space fluff and naval style warfare ---> Grab a copy, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, keep that wallet in line.			"

												26 hours in and I'm basically in world 2.  When I play this game, I keep thinking that this is what Freelancer should have been.  When I played Freelancer, I had a ""was that it?"" feeling.  Contrarily, Rebel Galaxy gives off a ""not JUST a space flight adventure simulator"" sort of vibe.Yay:- Ignore the story, earn money, buy really big ships.- Ability to join multiple guilds without needing to quit your current one- Broadside combat in a space sim is surprisingly fun.- Very responsive devs, check the bug reports part of the forum- Prices of commodities go up and down in response to world events and planetary type- Wide variety of missions.  Escort, Pickup, Delivery, Blockade Running, Head hunting...- No speed lanes, you want to get somewhere fast just point your nose and punch the warp.- Dynamic system.  In Wing Commander: Privateer, you could watch the news and respond accordingly to major events.  Is there a famine?  Bring food.  War?  Bring weapons.  Market glut, buy low.  This system is rarely found in these space trading games.  I don't think Freelancer had it.- Good voice acting- Intuitive game design- Aliens!- Varied Nebulas.  Including the classic ones like lightning nebulas that can shatter your shields in a single flash and dark nebulas where danger and mystery lurk within.- Scanner.  A nifty halo emits from your ship and lets you know of nearby enemies, allies, and items.Nay:- Broadside combat is rather easy.  Just manuever until your side is exposed, use precise targetting, and press a button.  The lead is automatically calculated for you.  The only thing you need to decide is how much time to charge the shot.- Fighters are so annoying since they can go to the 3rd dimension.  Plus the strike craft defense options are a bit lacking due to their extremely limited range.  You're left with relying on general-purpose turrets to pick off the pesky gnats one at a time.- No speed lanes.  Most of the time, I neglect to plot a proper course before warping so I end up going through like 3 asteroid fields, 2 debris fields, and 1 planet.  That's like hitting 6 red lights when you're trying to get somewhere.Meh:- No idle radio chatter- From what I've played so far, you pass lots of planets but there is no planetary landing.  You always stop at a station in orbit.  I'm guessing the idea is that space ships should stay in space where they're designed to work. "

												Rebel Galaxy is a cautios recommendation. For 20€ it's a good game. It has some major flaws, but I would still call it a good game at the end of the day. I'll try this review in a different format, because this is a game that could have been a hidden gem of the year if developers had a little different focus. So:What this game should have had First and absolutely foremost: Context. That was SUCH a huge miss. The game provides no context for anything outside of the main quest.Missions and systems have zero context. They are condensed to a marker on the map. No characters to talk to, no multiple ways to complete missions, no multi-staged missions, no consequences. Even faction missions have absolutely no context. Every trader is one of two possible models, they all have exactly the same lines, regardless of where and how you meet them.All mercenaries are 5 characters that inexplicably appear in every system on random stations and can't be interacted with beyond ""Hey, what ship you fly?"", ""What's your skills?"" and ""You are hired"". Really really huge miss, because the mechanics of this game are very simplistic and can not justify the complete absence of context. Fast travel. 90% of the gameplay time is wasted on the annoying warp mechanic. There's no fast travel and you have to go between stations very often. During warp you have to manually aim your ship and it won't exit out of warp unless you aim it dead on point, so you can't just alt-tab and check email. You have to stare at the screen.You get pulled out of warp on every tiny object to the side of your path. And there are a LOT of meaningless tiny objects in this game. You can not engage warp again until after you are cleared from any mass, and it takes a while to accelerate enough to start warping again so travelling turns into an incredibly boring and frustrating experience that you have to endure a lot.What this game should have ditched to get the aboveScale. The game is absolutely unnecessarily large. You have something like 12 systems (don't remember exact number), each has about as many space stations. To travel through the whole map and visit every station once would require a full day of gameplay. And EACH station has like 6 contract missions, all of which are done with one of 3 main templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort), and might as well be MMORPG repeating quests. All of the stations are exactly the same. They vary only in what merc sits inside and the prices they offer on goods. The bartenders have the same dialogue, there are no interesting quests to pick up, no characters to talk to. Hell - even weapons and ships they offer are the same. Only faction stations offer different equipment. All in all it's a typical quantity over quality issue. The game could have been 10 times smaller (not exaggerating, I actually think that would be the proper reduction), but if it had actually interesting quests with dialogue, context and variety to offer it would have been much better for it.Economy. It's just uninteresting and not worth your time.The entire economy in the game could be thrown out and it wouldn't be missed. It's your basic buy low sell high economy, except fetching goods in this game, as I've explained, is tiresome and frustrating, and there's no market manipulation you can perform. The money you get out of it is rather small, overall I just don't think there's any reason to try and make money with it. It's not an MMO. There's no infinite high end equipment and clans and raids you can spend that dosh on. You can buy one of the overpriced heavy dreadnaughts, but... why? They aren't fun to use and what would you use it for anyway? Fetching more goods? It's just pointless and wasted resources IMO.Equipment could have been made into upgradable loot drops - you can't buy gear, but you can upgrade it with dosh and missions. That would have made the game far more engaging too, bring some variety in. As it stands, once I bought a full combo of guns, I just used the same set of equipment throughout the entire game, upgrading it.So as you can see there are some big issues. So what's good?What's good?Combat. It's very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag naval combat, just in Space. It's very cinematic, albiet not exactly difficult. It's by no means a sim, it's absolutely unrealistic and very arcady, but that doesn't really matter. It's fun. That's the main thing. Combat's difficulty comes from how the game is balanced - it is very binary. You are either not having any problems whatsoever, or you are dead. Ship's HP is very small. Your shields and armour are what protect you.  The main skill in this game is to turn your ship all the time to let the shields on another side regenerate. You must never let enemies surround you and you must maneuvre such that you take as little continuous fire as possible, while spreading the damage over all your shields. This is also a reason why you never want to fly a dreadnaught. Small ship that you can turn to spread damage across all your 4 shields and platings is more survivable than large ship which is gonna take all the damage to one side. Sountrack - amazing rock and country music, with cinematic arcade combat in a spectacle of lazers and explosions. What more could you ask for? Graphics - the game looks good obviously. Polish - the game runs well and never crashed or bugged out on me. Aliens - they look and sound cool. I think the alien languages aren't necessary, but the looks and voice modifiers are cool. Progression - there's a variety of cool ships on display and all except dreadnaughts are quite fun to use. Also there is a large variety of guns you can install, each with a specific strength and weakness. You can take control of any gun directly, through in my experience turrets are always better controlled by the AI. Usually you are better off controlling broadsides and maneuvering the ship for the most advantageous angle. Atmosphere. The game's light-hearted atmosphere with a few funny lines of text here and there blend well with combat and music.So in the end I think the game is quite good for what it is. I just think it would have been a hell of a lot better had the developers more clearly understood it's strengths and weaknesses. A cautious recommendation, but a recommendation nonetheless.			"

												After years and years of personally wishing for new space sims, Starpoint Gemini 2, Elite Dangerous and this game all came out within a year's time. Of the three games, this one has the glossiest presentation and best-presented story line. This is like Starpoint Gemini 2 in that the perspective is third person because you are controlling capital-ship sized vessels. There are many jobs and sidequests in addition to the story line and different factions that you can side with or against. Is this a hardcore sim? Absolutely not, but it is fun and combat heavy. Apparently in this galaxy there are hordes of pirates and alien raiders to do battle with...Recommended if you like flying around the galaxy and lots of explosions.			"

												Pros: - Space dogfighting. The broadside cannon system is interesting, and keeping the fighting mostly in 2D solves a lot of the problems associated with this idea. It's enjoyable for a while. - Good story. Interesting enough for the length of the game. - Great soundtrack - look for the playlist on Spotify. I love how when combat happens the music gets more aggressive. Cons:- So damn grindy. In between story missions you'll need to buy improvements on your ship. Have fun doing tons of redundant quests or flying everywhere trying to trade for money. - Speaking of trade, it's largely a waste of time. While you can certainly make money flying around and taking advantage of market conditions, there's never enough stock of anything to make large amounts of money without making the rounds of every solar system. Towards  the end of the game trade is outright worthless as any cargo drop from a ship is worth more than an entire shipload of cargo that you purchased. - Mining is worthless unless you get lucky, don't bother. I would have loved this game if there was more trade\mining options to improve your ship so that I could try different weapons configurations, but I never had enough cash, and the grind became too much for me so I just ended the game. I'm happy I played it if for no other reason than the soundtrack is so outstanding and I was introduced to a whole genre of music I've never listened to. But the game play is just meh.			"

												Did you ever watch Firefly and think ""Hey, it would be really cool with a game where I can be a space cowboy""?If no, that means you're either in the wrong place or you haven't watched Firefly. Go do that now.If yes, then look no further!Rebel Galaxy is a singleplayer open-world spaceship RPG set in distant future.As the player, you receive a message from your old aunt Juno asking you to travel to the frontier. Riddled with piracy, military conflicts, intrigues and other mysteries your arrival marks the beginning of a long journey.Aside from the story you can choose to undertake thousands (if not more) of different sidejobs, it can be anything from an escort mission to the elimination of a key pirate leader hiding in a asteroid field.Freedom is key and the player has many choices available to them, each granting you different perks but also changing the way the rest of the galaxy sees you.A player who help traders and merchants during distress calls or who actively pursue pirate fleets will be seen as friendly by the Confederate militia while a player who smuggles contraband, ambush militia patrols and disrupt authorities will be seen as a friend by the pirates.In Rebel Galaxy the systems you fly in feel very much alive, stopping at a station just to view the newsboard inside the bar is a good idea as it will provide you with all kinds of information regarding politics, bounties or good trading opportunities.Planets can go to war with eachother, raising the demand for military equipment which in turn allows you to profit from it. If you want the conflict to escalate you can destroy any treaty vessels which attempt to broke peace.Newsboard[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]Or maybe you're more of a honest businessman? If so tech booms and market gluts will be your best friends, lowering the value of goods at certain stations so you can buy them en masse only to sell them off at a fringe world for a hefty sum of credits.Market[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]If that doesn't sound like your type of gig you can always become a freelancing bountyhunter or mercenary, tracking down pirate lords or escorting merchants through rough space.The choice is yours.GameplayGameplay-wise Rebel Galaxy is pretty straightforward, with easy-to-understand mechanics, helpful tutorial prompts and simple controls.CombatIn Rebel Galaxy the combat relies on three things: turrets, broadside ports and secondary ports.When not controlled by the player, turrets will act independently and target any hostile craft within the range or specific craft (you can choose). Broadsides are your main weapons and are used to obliterate enemy capital ships, broadsides can be anything from lasers to cannons.Finally, secondary ports are used for equipping fixed weapons and launchers such as flak guns, dumbfire missile launchers or mine catapults.Overall it's a very straightforward system even though it does get a bit repetitive after a certain point.Controls & UIThe controls for Rebel Galaxy are simple and easy to understand, the player has access to full control mapping.As for the UI, it's very clean and elegant. It shows exactly what you need without cluttering up the screen.UI[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]All in all Rebel Galaxy is a fun game. While it might suffer from being repetitive at a certain point it's stilla solid game which I highly recommend.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. Look it up.Fly safe.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 38 hours. Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? Yes but... but if you are looking for a combat/ship/free space game  this is NOT it. A few words about this game? Firefly+Freelancer+Blues= Rebel Galaxy Are you comparing this one with Elite Dangerous? I did too and I chose this one. In fact, they are not the same kind of game, except both are in space. You don't know what's Firefly? Really?!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series) What's Freelancer? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game) Now i feel old... thanks.

Graphics:  I have been playing with downsampling at 4K -30Fps with my mid computer.  You can look at the screenshots included to see the graphics. The ships are well constructed: engines,  turrets, lateral cannons. The planets are good enough, you can't land anyway so...  The hyperspace effect is nicely done, and all the combat weapons, missiles, defense, shield effect are perfect. Now... the npcs are almost clones, you will find the same face over and over although you travel to the far corner of the galaxy. This is really a mess because you speak with a lot of merchants to trade/ rob them, with pirates, guards etc etc. If you are civilizan neutral (at least) you can acces to the cantina, and the bartender has his (i sadly didn't find even one woman bartender...) clone face, you say ok... I won't look at you more than 20 seconds. BUT when you are pirate neutral and go inside the cantina, you expect to find a different cantina with a different cloned bartender but in pirate rol... big mistake. It's the same civilian cantina, with the same bartender (really?)So, graphics approved but very repetitive. Edit: I found at last on my second run a Bartender ""woman""!!! In one of the last starbases of the farthest system... but there she is! (at least for my random generated game). Music: The game ost is really good. The compositor is Christopher Robert Adams and besides the good of his work, the game allows you to customize the directory of each kind of music (exploration,combat...) and you can put there your own ost. I, for exemple, have been listening  Cowboy Beebop.if you want to listen the ost take a look at this link https://www.reddit.com/r/RebelGalaxy/comments/3pe3xg/rebel_galaxy_soundtrack_double_damage_games_a/

Story: It's... simple but enought to do your way through the system, exploring, fighting, trading, and improving over and over your ship. From a little old carrier to the most powerfull destructor... don't expect much more.Take a look at the ships  http://rebelgalaxy.gamepedia.com/ShipsGameplay:I recommend to use a gamepad. And here comes the controversial point... Rebel Galaxy is a 2D space game. Besides, is single player and always in 3rd person (ship) view.   I could compare it to a naval ship combat, with cannons and lateral combat, where you have to change your flank because your enemy will sunk you if you continue on that side. It could be nasty, even an insult for those who think on space games like Elite or Star Citizen but damn... it's fun! I really enjoyed it, it has it's strategic point and you can be quickly destroyed if you rush into an enemy formation that you think that are weak. So, if you can look forward beyond games like ED or SC, you will enjoy it. One interesting thing. The entire game is redone each time you play, the connections of each system with another, the planets each system has, the type of planet, well, everything. You will play into a new universe each time you start a game. Space: The way you travel through system is using jumpgates, and it's instant travel. You can only navigate and explore each system, and to balance that, each system is really alive. Each time you travel from A point to B point, you will find something, let's say: traders convoys, pirates, milita ships, emergency beacons, space trash, nebulas, asteroid field, ice field, debris from older battles, a lot of stations from the different factions and planets, satellites which you can hack to get information... and more. In this game, space is old. Humanity has spread all over the place and thousands of years of races activity, has changed it and let their legacy. while you navigate you will see little pieces of  trash around your ship and if you destroy a big ship and you come back days later, you will find the debris.  Mods http://steamcommunity.com/app/290300/discussions/2/405691491120297253/ This mod will change some important things, add new ships to be able to use and rebalance others. Please read the description to be sure if you want to use it. Thanks to Timberrino for the link to this mod. Negative point: The cloned faces There are few mods. The repetitive missions.   "

												Rebel Galaxy is a bit of a strange bird. It is a spaceship game with a serviceable story told within a pseudo-sandbox game world. The game itself seems polished on initial inspection, but after hours of play certain odd design choices and rough edges start to show themselves.But is it fun?After accumulating 24 hours in the game and just now finishing up the main quest line, I have to say that it IS definitely fun. While the game has a tendency to force you to grind procedurally generated missions, a common issue in open world sandbox games, I have to say that this is one of the few games where the grind did not bother me! Rather fun combat, decent mission variety, and a plethora of (somewhat) profitable side activities keep the game fresh and the amazing looks that the ships have make you want to keep going until you've got that one last shiny battleship. Another thing to note is that this game absolutely BLEEDS Firefly (a fairly popular short TV series) and really captures the feeling of flying around the galaxy in a trusty ship while smuggling goods and blasting other pilots to space bits in a way I, personally, haven't experienced before.Before I get into the nitty gritty details of the game, here's a TL;DR score: 7/10 (I'd say drop it down to a 6/10 if you don't really love spaceships or Firefly).Sound:If you overlook the fact that there really shouldn't be any sound in space, the sound is, in general, pretty good! Lasers sound like lasers, cannons go boom, and explosions seems appropriate! They can get a bit repetitive after a while, but that's to be expected in a longer game like this.Music:The music is awesome! If you've seen Firefly the music will really give you some flashbacks to the show. However, the selection in the game seems rather similar and you start to hear the same thing over and over again. Got to the point where I had to mute the music at times.Voice:The voice work in this is passable, but nothing special. While there weren't really any cringe-worthy moments, I never felt like the actors' performance or the script really pulled me in. The aliens and robots sound pretty neat though!Graphics:The game is pretty freaking gorgeous in my opinion. While not the most graphically impressive game out there, the galaxy looks pretty vibrant and the graphical effects that surround your ship when you are warping around the map is pretty great. The ships themselves look awesome and there are a couple of different ship lines in the game that offer varied ship aesthetics! The UI looks decent but is nothing special.Gameplay:The gameplay in this title is a bit of a mixed bag. The combat is a blast, however little things about it can start to bother you. For instance, the game is played on a flat plane, however at times when ships get close to you they tend to leave that plane to fly around you and at times this makes hitting them with your broadsides feel like a total crapshoot. Unfortunately, if you don't like the combat in this game, you might want to look elsewhere as the other activities in the game such as mining and trading are somewhat underdeveloped and are in general nowhere near as profitable as combat missions which will result in the currency grind becoming much more difficult than I believe it should be. One other huge issue I had with the game was that the UI is very unfriendly for mouse and keyboard users. Everything else in the game works fine with a mouse and keyboard, but the UI is clunky and is not mouse friendly at all, in many cases requiring you to use WASD to navigate. Lastly, certain weapon types in the game seem rather underpowered, in some cases to the point of being completely useless, and there is very little meaningful change-ups in terms of the gameplay as the game progresses.Final Verdict:I think this game is a lot of fun. While it is definitely rough around the edges and features a noticeable grind, it kept me playing for a full 24 hours and I am not the kind of person who typically enjoys grinds in games. Would I buy it at full price? Probably not. However, I think the game is worth a play despite all of its flaws and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to pick it up during a sale or in a bundle. Rebel Galaxy gets a thumbs up from me!			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun, arcadey space game that feels like a mix between Sid Meier's Pirates, Freelancer/WC:Privateer, and Assassin Creed: Black Flag naval boardsides combat combined with a cheesy/awesome Western-Rock soundtrack.There is a main storyline but you don't really have to follow it that much, you can just go around trading/mining/fighting/exploring, but the meat of the game is in the fighting. Thankfully the fighting is pretty fun. Instead of playing as a fighter or small freighter/gunship like many of these types of open-ended/sandbox space games, you start out in a Corvette and eventually work your way up to larger ships, I believe there is roughly 20 playable ships in all. As has been mentioned, the combat plays something like Assassin's Creed Black Flag ship battles, maneuvering on a 2D plane, with a heavy emphasis on broadsides and positioning. Your ship is outfitted with a main battery of broadside cannons as well as some turrets and secondary weapons (like missile launchers). You can customize the weapons of your ship with stuff like long/short range guns, beam lasers, missile turrets, anti-fighter/missile flak guns, etc etc.The game is surprisingly colorful and ships explode into big bright fireballs when they die. Its fun. The music, as I've mentioned is cheesey western butt-rock and, IMO, quite nice. However if its not your thing, or if you just get bored of it, the game has an option to put your own music into the game (alongside or replacing the soundtrack). I haven't progressed too far into the main plot, but this doesn't seem like the kind of game most would play for a gripping plot, as its pretty basic so far. Basically your aunt, an (in)famous smuggler and overall space Rogue, sends you a package containing a weird alien artifact and the access codes to one of her old ships and tells you to meet up with her and you go off to get into cool space battles and track her down.The game is only $20 and so far it seems like a lot of fun for that price.

												PROS:-Combat is amazing fun and engaging, combat is fast and the explosions are satifying-your ship feels like a formula 1 racer in the emptiness of space-space isn't that empty in this game-ships feel huge unlike a lot of titles the capital ships feel like a force of power-free to do as you please-better story than mostCONS:-trading is not that great a career as a trader is silly due to being a little profit career-characters are not memorable, even if the voice acting is miles above other space titles-missions are kind of repeating killing and shipping things-the starter ship really doesnt show the games golden eggsOVERALL:great title totally worth 20 bucks I'd say 8/10, hoping for DLC or Rebel Universe (Rebel Galaxy 2) :D			"

												Simply put. this game knows what fun is. Combat is engaging and fun. Soundtrack is amazing. Completely open world. Real-time economy system. Different factions to work for and become allies or enemies. There is a story, but you can completely ignore it if you so choose so. Too much to talk about in this game. The game is just good. Try it.Full review:

												I had a hard time getting into this at first, because it doesn't hold your hand, and I'm a carebear. Then I watched a tutorial on suggestions to get started, what to spend your money on, and that I should rent a mercenary. Then I absolutely started trashing other ships and it was hella fun. The soundtrack is fantastic, the combat is really satisfying, and I love that you can customize your weapon loadouts and ships, depending on what you want to do. I thought the galaxy was ENORMOUS- zooming out to the map and back into your ship a-la Eve Online gives you a really good perspective of how tiny you are compared to everything else. Then I realized there are like 15 other galaxies and I haven't even gone to the second one yet. I like the characters so far, particularly aunt Juno. I like that you can work for other factions, and end up being an as$hole pirate, an as$hole military agent, an as$hole smuggler, or an as$hole nice guy. It's very quest based, so if that's not for you, then you may not like it, but I dig doing quests/bounties and getting money and upgrading my weapons and ship, I find it satisfying. Really enjoying this game, I feel like the marketing fell through and it hasn't gotten as much attention as it should have.			"

												Wow. I'll admit, I went into this game without much knowledge of it at all... and after the time I've spent with it, I can only say... Rebel Galaxy is totally badass!However, allow me to explain the basics of the game. Simply, you're a Space Cowboy, living on the edge of the law and banditry. You explore the vastness of space, blasting away pirates or helping them incinerate innocent traders while completing missions and getting rich. You get your own equipment customizable spaceship where you can fire broadsides, flak, missiles and all sorts of vaporizing goodness. There are even quite a few ships that you can purchase should you gain enough money. The concept is simple, the gameplay is addicting.Gameplay Footage:

			This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! I've always wanted to be a Space Cowboy!		

The game also has an epic sound track of catchy guitar twangs as you blow Space Pirates into nonexistence. The voice acting is also very solid. As if that wasn't good enough, the gameplay is fluid and the controls make sense. While the control isn't as indepth as Space flight sims like Elite: Dangerous, it's more than enough to keep players interested while also keeping the gameplay fast-paced.All in all, I definitely recommended this game!

												Rebel Galaxy is an indie space game with a variety of star systems to explore and endless number of procedurally generated missions to complete. It shares some similarities with Freelancer, but the core gameplay is rather different.While the game does feature trading and mining, the main draw is clearly the space battles. Unfortunately the combat itself is a rather shallow experience. All ships apart from enemy/allied fighters are restricted to a 2D plane and all your main weapons are fired as a single broadside, so in practice the game often feels more like a naval game than a proper space game. It's fun in small sessions, but gets repetitive really quickly.This isn't helped by an extremely poor item system and ridiculous economy. Both seem to be lifted straight from a bad MMO, which doesn't make any sense in a single player game. Overall you spend way too much time traveling through empty space and grinding pointless side missions to earn enough cash for the next tier of upgrades so you can actually continue with the main game.The setting is quite generic but has enough of a Firefly vibe to keep things somewhat interesting. Unfortunately the main story is not that memorable either and there's not enough variety with the side missions. There's also a faction system, but this didn't seem to add much to the overall game.While I found Rebel Galaxy enjoyable in short sessions, overall I'd consider it too flawed to recommend. Between the shallow combat and the repetitive missions the game got boring well before I finished it.The good:- Combat can be fun in small dozes- Bigger space battles can be impressive and quite hectic- Nice soundtrackThe bad:- Shallow combat mainly restricted to a 2D plane- Repetitive missions and random encounters- Grindy with extremely lazy item design- Story is forgottable and the ending is extremely lackluster- Trading and mining felt somewhat pointlessThe ugly:- Some graphics issues in DX9 mode, switching to DX11 fixed these- Overuse of shader effects and some of the weapons look downright terrible- Even the small space rocks inhibiting your warp drives- Warp pairing with friendly targets is a broken mess			"

												I decided to change my review of this game to offer up points of why the game falls short. I'll summarize this as much as possible. If you want a very short review it is posted below.The super short review :6 out of 10 ( Good for fist timers and the younger gaming crowd )Anyone expecting a game with depth in story line and ship functionality will be disappointed. The story line is predictable, the benefits are minimal, everyone wins gaming.Would I play this game again? No, probably not unless the developer added many more features and vastly improved the game AI.  The good:Overall a good looking game.Runs well, smooth.  No crashes.Great sound track.Multiple paths to follow to end game ( Merchant, Pirate, Combat, Miner )The Bad:You ""fly"" on a single plane and cannot go up or down. While this is a space game I feel ike I am driving a tank or playing a FPS. The weapons systems on your ship shoot through your ship most of the time. It is a race to get Mark 5 / 6 items, you could do without but then you may have a harder times with the game.You simply follow a simple path to the end game.There is never a bounty placed on your head for the waves of AI you slaughter, your participation is not recognized in this game at all, this includes news stories.Between Story line missions upgrading your ship is essential to completing the next mission you will not know this until you jump in and have a WTF moment.There is no communication between stations for commodities ( minerals and goods ) thus what you buy for in one place might not be worth anything in another or one system over it is double in price. You will never know unless you go there. Ships and ship components are at 100% trade in and up value.  Thus switching out weapon systems is never a loss nor is it better from one place to another.The AI never recognizes you. Sure while you can slaughter pirates whole sale in the hundreds, save countless traders or conduct crippling raids against the AI at no point does the dialog or your player presence change anything in the game. It is one dimensional.  There are always more AI, Going to a pirate faction station and eliminating everything in sight does nothing. The stations cannot be destroyed so eradicating a system of pirate activity is impossible. Random encounters with AI fleets are pointless. Unless there is a bounty loot drops will not even pay for your spent missiles or damage you may take. Best to just avoid them.The face you see of the AI are all the same. Pirates will taunt you and well this is the 100th time you killed that same pirate. Aliens all look the same also. Even some side characters look just like the random pirates as well as the Militia.The lines for the AI or NPCs are the same and repetitive.Trell the AI the story line revolves around makes some minor upgrade to your ship. These are nothing amazing just some sensor and defensive bumps. The only time you interact with Trell is when she wants something ( typical woman ) For an AI with vast knowledge you would think she would tell you how to boost your weapon performance or make some great weapon system or a new type of ship.... nope.I came here to save Criminal Aunt Juno. However the dialogue with here does nothing to tell me why it would be worth it. No back story to tell me why I'd risk my♥♥♥♥♥to save this woman from the crap she got herself into.   Random AI gotcha moments, taking on a merchant mission with a low threat level was not really low at all. This was a game breaking moment for me because it made no sense what so ever. Enemy ships appear out of nowhere, surround your ship and disable it thus killing your mobility. This continually happens while fleets ( from fighters to dreadnaughts ) of AI pop up randomly. To sum it up the game mechanics cheat. You can attempt to run or if you have the right ship component ( so I am told ) nullify the effects of the disabling missiles.  The end game moments are really nothing special. I never got attached to Trell, she did nothing but get me into trouble, heck her upgrades were minimal at best. The was no big glorious end game movie clip or anything special for saving the galaxy from a deadly invasion. After all this Juno buys you a drink and that is the game.The end game:I wanted to finish up achieving the end game in the most ""advanced"" combat ship with a decent fitting. There was a level of satisfaction at that point because annihilating even a super dreadnaught AI at the end was easy.  Completed with mark 5 / 6 equipped Black Gate Dreadnaught 54,000,000 credits, 1498 enemy ships destroyed. This tacked on another 5 hours of game play before I took on the end game mission. The threat level went from Very High to Low.Wasted time, I spent a couple of hours sorting out the AI ""cheat issue"" with the Merchant mission before walking away from the missions. Ironically the combat missions were less dangerous. Exploration, mining and other activities burned up a few hours also. So in 20 to 24 hours you can complete this game with a solid kitted out ship.			"

												Aiming to misbehave is not only rewarded but maybe even required to survive in Rebel Galaxy. Your goals are simple in the black, live, make money, and take care of anyone who tries to stop you from doing the other two. To help you is your trusty vessel of death and destruction, which can be armed to the teeth with guns, missiles, hull upgrades, shields, and gods know what. Along the way you will meet some interesting folk whom may or may not have your best interest at heart. While the main campaign does an okay job of expanding the universe. The meat of the game lies in combat, random events, and upgrading your vessel. The game itself is gorgeous, you can almost feel the sizzling heat of your cannons firing. The explosions of missiles rocking across your ship, and satisfaction of watching your enemies explode in a fiery death. All the ships look unique, the weapons have the proper amount of oomph behind them, and the soundtrack is a homage to Firefly. On top of all that sweetness, the game is really easy to get into and start playing. The game really reminds of AC: Black Flags naval combat, just this is in space. Same level of simplicity with more customization in weapons. Now Rebel Galaxy does have its occasional black holes. There are times where repetitive missions come into play and are required for equipment advancement. Lack of cosmetic customization feels like a miss in an outstandingly done game. The games story itself does feel like it could be a bit more exciting as well. Occasionally during combat it does feel odd you can't move up or down in space. Despite these issues, the game is still extremely well made. No bugs ever interrupted my gameplay. As far as replay goes, there are multiple factions to pursue an allegiance with and multiple play styles you can choose from. Be a bounty hunter, cartel member, or trader, the choice is up to you what role you will play in Rebel Galaxy.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Pros+ The game is massive and from my understanding the systems are randomly generated, so you'll never hit the same systems on a different playthrough. It is probably not as large as other space-sims, however.+ There's lots of things to do, which checks off most of the traditional space-sim tropes: Mining, Trading, Bounty Hunting to name a few as well as a good variety of side missions which cover your basic 'go to point A and blow stuff up' runs to things like 'Go to station B and run/break a blockade to deliver goods'. I've played for 30+ hours in a game which cost me a third of the amount a AAA game does.+ The games events and economy, while basic, are a living thing. They'll play out whether you're there or not. If a station is hit by a crime wave, it will remain until someone goes and cleans it up, whether it's you or the AI militia. Trade convoys cross the system and deliver goods, which effects the prices you buy and sell for. If pirates (or you!) happen to cross paths with them on their trip the items will never get there, which may cause their stock to drop and their sell prices to rise.+ The soundtrack is awesome and makes the game very reminiscent of Firefly. It fits the game incredibly well and makes battles against enemy cap-ships all the sweeter+ Broadside combat is excellent, and remarkably fun. No longer do you just point at an enemy and click - your shields and armor are seperated in to quadrants and you constantly have to think about the best maneuvers to maximise damage while protecting your vulnerable sides. You can even direct-control the turrets on your ship, as well as deploying flak, EMP's, Mines or missiles. + Good variety of ships and weapons. Yeah, they're all cap-ships but that's the name of the game. You're not just some no-name rookie making your name running your fighter from a carrier. You captain corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and even dreadnaughts fitted out with machine guns, missile launchers, pulse lasers, beam lasers, flak cannons and your beastly broadside weapons.+ In almost every regard the game is top-notch: the aesthetics are excellent, the controls are excellent, the sound design is immersive, the world is immense and the gameplay is, most importantly, fun. + The best custom soundtrack integration I've seen in a recent game, you get to pick which tracks play in combat, stations, while cruising... hell - there's even an option to mix your tracks with the original soundtrack.+ Piracy pays in this game - one of my favourite pass-times in this game is responding to merchant distress calls with a few tons of high-price cargo in my posession. Save the merchants, sell the cargo to them at a premium and then threaten them to hand back what I just sold them for free. It's a brilliant way of making some extra cash.+ 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment and ships, so there's never any risk of being stuck with expensive gear you decide you don't like.Cons:- Missions can become a little repetative after a while, although if you begin to feel like this you'll realise it's because you've played the game for a decent stretch of time- Travelling across a system can take a little too long sometimes, even with engine upgrades I'm never feeling like I'm moving fast enough while in warp- Difficulty can spike without warning, usually when you equip your first bit of next-tier tech: there's a reason even the bartenders tell you to upgrade shields and armor before weapons.- Voice acting is 'just' OK. The npc voice pool is shallow and some of the emotional delivery is pretty bland.- The dialogue options really don't serve a purpose. it boils down to 'Option one to be a coward and drop your cargo', 'Option two to politely refuse and lose a faction point', 'Option three to be a badass renegade, 'Option 4 to be a badass renegade and ♥♥♥♥ off this faction' all of which provoke the most pitiful and monotonous responses. If you want to be a badass renegade, be prepared to hear 'I hope you like the cold, Cutter' without an ounce of anger or fear behind it 9/10 times.- This game could have really benefited from a sort of 'infamy system', which, depending on your net-worth, loadout, faction standing or how much ♥♥♥ you tend to kick provided a little more of an emotional response from your attackers. No matter what you do, say or how many of those pirate jack-offs you just disintegrated, they will always give you the same responses - 'drop your cargo or die', 'no? ok, now you will die'. They even say it if you've literally just wiped out all their health and their ship is about to explode.- While the soundtrack is awesome, it's short and the tracks cycle every time the situation changes - it's rare you'll hear one all the way through. I don't think there's more than 10 tracks in total and some of those are instrumental versions of the others. It begins to grate a little around the 9 hour mark - thank god for custom soundtracks. The 'Sons of the North' and 'These Savage Lands' Albums by The Black Spiders fit the game incredibly well IMO and have saved me from getting sick of the original soundtrack.- Once you finish the story, get yourself a dreadnaught and kit it out with 6th Tier tech there isn't really any motivation to continue. The story missions aren't particularly exciting enough to play again so your only goal after that really is to make money that you can't spend on anything. It's unlikely you'll feel motivated enough to commit to a second playthrough due to the 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment. If you have a Blackgate with Mark 6 Beam Turrets, Beam Broadsides and Defense tech then you can literally sell it 1:1, which lets you switch to any other ship you may have missed. The only way to screw yourself out of money late-game is either by trading like an idiot, fighting like an idiot or recruiting mercs who are idiots.Unsure:+/- Yes, it's been said countless times: there's no Y axis of movement. However with broadside combat I believe the game is better off for it. This game would be frustrating levels of fiddly control-wise trying to move up and down, while trying to maintain target lock with your broadsides/control lateral movement while aiming your turrets, while trying to line up your secondaries and maneuvre your ship to keep your target on your strongest side.Summary:There's a lot more they could have done with the ""Negotiate"" part of the game (they put that part of the tagline in quotations? has no-one else mentioned that?), it can get a little bit same-y and repetative after long stretches and it could do with more ship and loadout options but in the end the game is pure space-cowbow fun. My interest only began to waver at the end when I suddenly realised I had enough money to cover buying everything in the game and completing station missions, trading, mining or pirating were not only no-longer a challenge in my mile-long Dreadnaught, but also no longer pushing me towards any kind of goal. This is, however, over 30 hours in while most AAA titles struggle to hold my interest for more than 8 hours.If you love Firefly and the space-sim genre but are put off by the overly-complex nature of some of them then give this a shot, it's the one you've been waiting for. Even if games like X and ED are your bread and butter, buy this as a sort 'tune out and have mindless fun' kind of game to sink a few hours in to. Despite it's lackluster story and character performances as well as a few missed opportunities in gameplay design, primarily it's a game where you're expected to have fun blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and besides Jahovas Witnesses, who doesn't like that?

												Imagine you're playing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.  Now, imagine that instead of being stuck with that one, tiny, but somehow infinitely upgradable little ship, you can actually buy new ships as your fortunes improve.  Now, imagine you're in space.  Finally, imagine you don't have to get out of the ship to follow some British ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around the island for 20 minutes in an area that is suddenly, inexplicably teeming with soldiers.I think I got sidetracked.  Anyway.  This is an excellent quasi-3D ship combat game.  Not a full 3D sim like Freelancer... all player-piloted ships, and those of similar size, seem to occupy the same plane of space.  Rolls, climbs, and dives are not valid maneuvers.  Shields go fore, aft, port, starboard, with no concern for doral or ventral.  Despite this, you don't feel particularly limited in your play.  It's just streamlining something that can overly complicate some other games.There is some downside.  There isn't a lot of variety to your available weaponry.  The targeting AI that controls your turrets most of the time is kinda stupid, and works in exclusive terms, rather that allowing prioritization.  There are, inevitably, escort missions, some of which you will lose for no good reason.  The in-game economy is a little capricious, which makes moving goods profitably as a trader a bit of a long game.  But I still find it enjoyable to spend a few hours making pretty explosions in space, set to a soundtrack that you might find playing in Jim Raynor's house back on Mar Sara- forgettable, upbeat, twangy rock.

												Two dudes got together, drank some energy drinks, and rocked out to Clutch while storyboarding a game.   They needed some fast cash to get their Chevy Nova off the cinder blocks, and had to do it both cheap & good.  They took the basic engine from Torchlight, used it to make a galaxy, and replaced people with spaceships.  They set it to motion with steel guitars, particle effects, and lots of badass.  Rebel Galaxy was born.Do you want to be a badass outlaw space trucker?  Can you deal with not being able to go up & down, an do barrel rolls in exchange for easy to use controls & fun combat?  Can you tell your OCD tendencies to STFU & just enjoy the content?  Most importantly, do you want to be a badass outlaw space trucker?Rebel Galaxy:  Malt liquor & unfiltered cigarettes not included.			"

												I purchased this game on sale at the time for $10 bucks hoping for a fun little space adventure............ 281 in-game hours later and all 37 achievements I would have gladly paid the full $20 price. Rebel Galaxy was satisfying in many ways with very few bugs that i noticed (escort missions being the main issue). With that being said, the trailer is only slightly misleading and i do wish the game had a more involved story and some extra content (DLC involving quest lines and new ships). In all fairness, my final judgement is 9.5/10 BEST 2d plane space game i have played in a long time and i have hopes that I will see Rebel Galaxy 2 someday.......			"

												If you are looking for positive affirmation that this game is worth buying, then stop here and buy it now.Every time I start this game, the start menu music sets the ""Firefly"" vibe of the Wild-West frontier in space.This game is fun and reminds me of playing privateer all those years ago, as a space captain just trying to make a living on the edge of known civilization.Finally, with regards to the Forum-Warriors that loudly whine and lament the lack of Multi-Player, go and play Fractured Space, or even Elite Dangerous if you really need to have PvP or Co-Op.To me one as a time poor Dad, one of the best things about this game is that it is a SOLO PvE game, that I can pause any time, or save and exit anytime without losing my progress.

												Much too grindy and relatively easy. Money is everything - the story itself isn't really driving the game (at least for me).I admit that the game is very enjoyable for the first few hours, but it becomes boring and then annoying. The Equipment/Weapon system is extremely linear (replace Mk 1 with Mk 2, then Mk 3 etc....) and in order to follow the main story line you have to grind through the typical MMO-style missions to buy better equipment...a lot...You cannot capture ships.You cannot make more profit with trading than with missions/fighting, as the trading system is a joke (trade volume is much too small).Fights are fairly unrewarding  (literally ... as most enemies only drop sh**) and boring after you found the best approach to them. It is not true that you cannot fight (slightly) stronger enemies, but at some gear-level difference there is no amount of tactical thinking that will save you.For the rest this game feels like a walking simulator...in space. It is very very very similar to starpoint gemini 2 in that respect.... you watch your ship slowly warping through space for a long time (even with upgrades), and the worst part: any stone/asteroid/enemy/ally you come close to during warping will kick you out of warp (""Warp inhibited by stellar mass"")...after 50 times of this I just cannot take it any more.

												Coming from the guys behind the first two Diablo games and Torchlight, I had some pretty high expectations for this game...and it *delivers*.  The combat is fun and frantic, the graphics are good, the interface is decent, but what made me sit up and pay attention was the soundtrack.  My god, the soundtrack.  No techno-electronica or big orchestras here.  What you get is a hardcore mix of blues, rock and jazz that really just fits better with the Firefly/Cowboy Bebop feel of the setting.  Anyone who puts Blues Saraceno into a used-future space combat game can have my money.  Hearing ""Evil Ways"" start as you get jumped by pirates is a straight-up rush!			"

												I finished the game, and it's time to write a love letter to Travis and Erich and all the people they contracted out for ship modeling / designs / voiceovers, etc.THANK YOU.From the bottom of my brown coat pocket, this is a game that immediately put me in what I could only imagine before ... something resembling the Firefly universe. I think you hit the absolutely sweet spot of fun / progression / story and artwork. I sometimes lost myself flying around, you made it really feel like I was out in outer-space, with the wide variety of planets / nebulas / junk fields / ice fields / asteroid fields, what have you. The sheer number of stations and objects you would run into while out in the cold really made it feel great. The care & thought you put into the simplified UI design was nothing short of brilliant. Simple & elegant.  I thought you had thought of everything and once when flying, my UI popped up and said ""It's been a while since you saved, you should dock at a station to save your game"" or something - then I knew you HAD thought of everything. The story was engaging, and the missions were enough of a large variety. Trade missions, assasination, protection, dead drops, the game really gives you a lot of options. So many cartels to see which one's you'll join / fight. The emergent game play - the distress signals (and ability to trade with the merchants was again a wise design choice as it reinforces saving their butts ;-), the un-identified signals, getting popped out in a junk or ice field, you made what should be a very empty space interesting while travelling around. For two guys and a small army of outside contractors / agents that you employed, this game rocks. I'm so glad that you decided to make this game. THANK YOU!!			"

												Having now played 60 hours into my first Rebel Galaxy playthrough, I feel i can give this game a solid review.Pros:- Awesome graphics (on max settings) that somehow find the right balance between cartoon-ish and realistic.- The ships are very customizable and they all look amazing, with pros and cons to each of them.- Custom music for any area of the game. (if you want to have shopping mall music in your space stations more power to you)- Simple yet effective combat system that relies heavily on shield management and ship positioning. (unless you want to repair at every station you dock at)- Accessible trading system. (buy when red, sell when green)- Good replayability due to the procedurally generated star systems.Cons:- WARP INHIBITED BY STELLAR MASS (this will be burned into your psyche) Literally everything kicks your ship out of warp once you are within 3.0 sm (solar mile??) of it. At least give me the option to smash my ship into an asteroid at warp if i'm that dumb.. this would be equivalent to getting demounted in an MMO every time you were within a few meters of a large rock or a tree... or another player.- While vast, the galaxy, and the solar systems feel lifeless. You will realize very quickly that you are playing a single player game in the cold loneliness of space.- Mining, is borderline pointless once you're at the point in the game where a single upgrade is well over $1,000,000. This is because the average mining drop is either obtanium or meteoric diamonds which sell for $1,000~, and $20,000~ respectively.- I found the default music to be irritating after listening to it for over 5 hours, though some people like it, at least there is the option to play without music or use your own.- The combat is mostly automated and based on whether your ship is stronger than the other one or not... not much outmaneuvering is possible in Rebel Galaxy, so you don't get rewarded for being a better pilot than your opponent.. that and the enemy AI is pretty terrible.- The economy and commerce of the game is completely random, so it makes trading at times very frustrating. Also, some comodoties becomes obsolete due to the limited storage space you have because of how little they sell for. There is also no way to sort or filter the viewing of the comodoties at stations, which you'd think would just be common sense. Any game in this day and age that has an auction house type system has the ability to sort and filter it. What i found to be the best way of making money was to just amass a ton of expensive comodoties and fly around the galaxy and rescue merchants. After resucing them, they will buy your stuff for the max market value, and you also get the cargo of whatever ship they were under fire from.- The story is very simplistic with some unique enemies generated from the missions, but overall it lacks any sort of emotional attachment to the characters or development of said characters. I will say however that The final mission with Trell's goodbye left me a bit dissatisfied, not sad mind you, just annoyed that there was no CGI end sequence like there was at the start of the game. Or even mid-game when she was telling you about how countless past civilizations used her for war etc. Would it have broken the budget to make a cutscene like that while she's explaining her origins? Probably.Overall, the game was fun to play, and advance with the new ships that i upgraded to, but i'm skeptical that i'll be coming back for round 2 anytime soon. Maybe if the weapons were more varied or the trading and economy was more flushed out the game would feel warmer and more dynamic, but i guess this is what you get for a budget title.Rating - 7/10			"

			These are my first impressions of Rebel Galaxy for PC This is not intended to be a considered review. Please keep that in mind when deciding weather or not to pick up the game.		

TLDR: This is another game that needs a maybe button. It's a standard space sim and if that's what you are looking for there is a lot to enjoy here. However, if you are looking for something new then this isn't the game for you. It's also important to note that this is not a serious sim, and it isn't very realistic. However, it's presented well and has a more fun and light hearted theme that some will enjoy. For more please watch the video.			"

												Played this and was essentially excited at first.  I thought ""Woohoo Space Pirate"".  RPG element was something I don't mind and kinda look forward to.  However what killed it for me was the fact that you're in a big cruiser-type ship and you're stuck driving the thing around like a car on a flat surface.  No going up or down, just forward, back, turn left, turn right.  Meanwhile your enemies use full range of 3 dimensional space swarming all around you going up, down, left, right, forward, backward and essentially while you're looking around you can't go up to catch them.  I've had problems where the enemies went way too far up for me to actually do enough damage so I had to give up on the fight.  Every planet and every piece of the galaxy is on a flat 2D surface except somehow the enemies are the only thing that can and will defy that logic.			"

												The only thing that stands out in Rebel Galaxy is music - a metal take on country genre. Otherwise, it's incredibly bland and nondescript: the galaxy is procedurally generated and so are missions (except story ones which aren't captivating either). The AI is bad, the world doesn't feel alive, NPC behavior is way off (a single bomber trying to rob a fully operational dreadnaught - that's par for the course here).Basically, it's a grindfest: you pop ships, buy bigger guns, pop bigger ships and so on until you get to top tier equipment. You can't turn the tide in galactic warfare. You can't make friends or even get in the news. So, in short: if you want a 2D procedurally generated game, play Space Rangers. It holds up well and offers much more nuanced gameplay than this.			"

												I have always been leery of space sims, hearing of the \'horror\' stories of EVE online and the sorts. That is, until my friend introduced me to this. It literally took me five minutes of listening to the soundtrack and watching him play the game for me to get hooked. It was one of the few games on Steam I purchased at full price, and I was not disappointed. Despite its Indie tag, it doesn\'t feel like an indie game. The visuals are spectacular, the campaign is entirely voice-acted (even the alien species), and the combat is great.I don\'t think I need to explain the plot or setting in detail. You\'re in space. You\'re finding ancient♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uhh... Untrustworthy aliens/Australians. That\'s all you need to know.This game does the RPG-style building-up of your equipment very well. You start with a dinky little ship with a laser. After you\'ve completed a few missions and/or saved/looted some traders, you can buy better lasers. But wait! Your ship\'s too small for any more lasers, and you\'re finding it difficult to deal with pirates/police! Well, now you\'ve got to get a bigger ship that can withstand more damage and wield more lasers. You complete a few missions and save/loot some more traders...The game gets progressively difficult in a way that takes you out of your comfort zone. You can continue to do missions in your current system where enemies aren\'t hard to beat, but the reward is significantly smaller than that in more difficult systems. Additionally, you can only get better upgrades to your ship in harder systems. Frequently, you\'ll find yourself battling against a superior opponent, only to either destroy them or escape at the skin of your teeth. The difficulty does peak at some point though. Enemies don\'t seem to get much harder or meatier just as you\'re able to get MK6 weaponry (last tier), while you can still acquire better ships and better equipment. Once you\'ve got the money to afford a Blackgate ship, the game is practically over.The trading system is not as powerful as simply completing missions, but I overheard that the trading system used to be busted, allowing players to make millions within an hour by only trading. Either way, you can still make a hefty sum from researching how each \'event\' changes commodity prices (such as when a planet/station\'s at \'War\', the price of Ammunition goes up). If you\'re looking for a great singleplayer game that\'ll most likely last your 10-20 hours, this is the perfect game, ESPECIALLY for an Indie game. It\'s not confusing, combat\'s satisfying, the soundtrack is rockin\', and... just, everything is there.			"

												First Impression: Fun.  Very fun.  Reminds me vaguely of Star Control 2 mixed with your standard Freelancer-style space game.  Combat is naval-style ""broadsides"" on a 2D plane (not true 3D space combat) but once you embrace that, it's well designed.  You really do get that feeling of capital ship combat, with mini-turrets blasting away at circling fighters and powering up your big guns to take... down... those damn sheilds.  Good good fun, and certainly worth the sub-20 dollar price.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fantastic throwback to games like privateer from my early child hood. Something happens your given a rust bucket from a family member and kicked out into space to do whatever you like. There is a story there if you'd like to explore it, but theres also a very large set of systems for you to get lost in. These systems start easy and quickly ramp up into fleets of doom that look like something out of babylon 5 or a borg invasion.Graphically the game is very pretty. Each weapon type has its own effects and its easy to tell what your oppents are using once you get familiarized with the types. You'll know when your enemy is shielding himself from your attacks and able to plan accordingly.Combat is a blast. Its a traditional ""sailing"" broadside system with a bit of a twist. There seems to be 2 types of ships. Broadside focused ships and turret focused ships. Turret ships have weaker broadsides so slightly less punch but they can hit in 360 degrees around their ship. Broadside ships usually have nasty blind spots at the front or back of their ships but if you end up on their sides your going to be sucking vacuum very quickly.Gameplay is very open. You can do simply the main storyline and just enough side quests to up your combat effectiveness for the next mission or you can join one of the guilds. Partake in trading, Mercenary work, Pirating, and evening mining to pay the bills. All of these have their own supporting play styles, missions, and equipment.Keep in mind that there are also factions in the game, so if you choose to start popping merchant ships for their yummy goodies expect to have to deal with that militia destroyer next time you hit a station.Alternatively there are TONS of randomized seemingly procedurally generated encounters as you fly along towards your missions or stations. Merchentmen calling for help under attack by pirates, pirates trying to lure you in with distress calls, communication beacons you can hack to get some secret info for trading, mining spots, or loot caches, and of course the occasionally massive fleet battle from one of the many factions who's decided to take a crack at each other.All of these features lead to making Rebel Galaxy on of my favorite games for the year and at a price point that is simply mind blowing.If you'd like a bit more info and see how the game plays before hand check out my lets play below.

												If you liked Privateer or Freelancer you will like Rebel Galaxy. Only caveat is the game is a 2D Naval Style Combat. But for the price, it can not be beat.			"

												Though it has its shortcomings in the story arena, it's really an excuse to join the upgrade treadmill in buying the biggest, nastiest, blow-things-up-est ship you can manage. It's all about playing missions to get money and buy those sweet, sweet weapons and armor upgrades until you have a veritable capital-ship erasing fortress. At the end of the game, I spent a good couple hours just annihilating missions for giggles; very fun!And a hint if you plan on playing this on easy mode: join the Merchant Guild ASAP. Equip your ship with Null-Grav Boosters. Occasionally they'll have a mission that's worth like 10x the average mission price because you're supposed to obtain materials and deliver them through a blockade. Obtain them by going to the Commodity Market and looking at which station supplies them. Go to that station, buy their stock, and exit the game. When you continue, they'll have restocked. Keep doing that until you have the necessary units, then deliver to the target station. About 30sm from the location, you'll get pulled out of warp. Just engage your boosters and tap deflectors when rockets are about to hit you or you need to recharge the booster. The first time I did this, I made $250k when missions in the area were only $20-30k, and I wish I knew about it way earlier.			"

												Rebel Galaxy has the potential to be a really fun game, it's very smooth, pretty, and fun for a while, it reminded of Sid Meier's Pirates in space to an extent. The hugest problem though is the game's combat pretty much comes down to grinding for money to get gear so you don't instantly get blown out of the sky. There's very little strategy involved, you either have the right gear or you just get ♥♥♥♥ed. AI ships will just EMP you to oblivion so you can't run away (And you basicially have no defense against this whatsoever), they eat through shields and deflectors like crazy, and if your weapons aren't good enough its game over. Combat in the later game just feels like a war of attrition. I think what ties into this is they focused way too much breadth and instead of depth, the game's big but there's not much there. Hopefully they either fix this or just learn from their mistakes for a sequel, because I did have fun for a while, but the lategame ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t just bored me.			"

												A wonderful game that you can approach in a few different ways. You can run around as a merchant, playing the market for locations to get goods for cheap and sell them at a profit... you can be a mercenary (or a pirate), taking jobs and hunting down bounties... you can even while away the hours mining asteriods for ore and diamonds. Add in a main storyline just engaging enough to keep you checking in on it (when you have the ship & supplies to do so) and a fantastic soundtrack--Rebel Galaxy is worth every penny.			"

												Wow.. This game left me pleasantly surprised. First thing I want to mention is NO you cant get out of your spaceship and walk around on planets. That being said everyhting else in this game is great; the combat, the trading system, the story, the ships, the loot, the banditry, the contracts AND ESPECIALLY THE SOUNDTRACK! If you want a space exploration/battle game I cant recommend this game enough.			"

												I bought this game based on many reviews comparing it to Freelancer. Judging from the youtube gameplay videos it didnt look much anything like it, but I thought it must be a ""freelancer-ish"" feeling about it, once you get your hands on.Nothing farther from the truth. It is nothing like Freelancer. Nothing.+Pros:+ runs decent on older machines ( I cant tell this for sure, i am basing this comments on the sys-req I read on the steam)+ can provide some hours of fun for the really stubborn fans of the genre waiting for a good game to pop out.******- Minuses:- space is 2D. I know many have said it before me, but GET THIS NOW: it is really 2D.- poor controls on keyboard and mouse, clearly designed to be played on controller.- uninsipred controlls for non-flying/combat (i.e. to see your current mission you have to press ESC and pause the game, then navigate some other menus which are selectable only by using left and right buttons)- MISSING a map legend. You learn what everything is by exploring and making mistakes.- menu navigation in bases is cumbersome and the inventory is navigated left, right, up, down (similar to the hellish system from the first Mass Effect inventory, brr)- activity in game feels grindly and repetitive, when not doing the main story missions.- non compelling story arch.- non-human NPC's voices are ghastly and sound like rubbing an angry, hissing cat against sandpaper.- human NPC voices are gruffy as if everyone in space has a cold. Those who are lucky enough not to be cold, are cliche-ish both in tone and vocabulary. Think of any other generic NPC you have heard in 1000 games before.- soundtrack saves face, BUT only if you are into his genre. For me it was fine ar first, but i muted it soon (please don't comment about my music taste; believe it or not, not everyone is into blues rock or country rock)- system voice, ambient and effects are not independently configurable, meaning you will often not hear important system messages over infernal blaster fire.- very poor graphics for a 2015 game, and not many advanced options. Just the very basiscs.Conclusion: I praise the developers for the effort and time they took to create this game, but the overall feeling is that it is amateurish. Not indie, but amateurish. I won't shun away from buying again one of their products, but I will put a lot more scrutiny into it, before buying it.Thank you fellow gamers for your time reading this.Play well.			"

												Rebel Galaxy, a game developed by two guys in an apartment somewhere.  It has you, the protagonist/antagonist, piloting a myriad of ships on a 2D plane while searing holes through smaller ships buzzing around you.  It's a simple game with beautiful visuals and a non-complex playstyle.  It takes a few minutes to get the controls down, but once that's done, it becomes second nature.It's the choose your own adventure book of the space World.  Want to be a militia-supporting pilot that tries to do the right thing?  Ok.  Prefer to be a pirate that melts the armor of miners and traders?  Ok.  Want to be a miner or trader?  Ok.  Bounty hunter?  Done.It has capital ships to fight/pilot, an array of modules/weapons to upgrade and many missions to accept and complete.  There is a propensity for the missions to get shallow, but the combat is fun enough to continue.  The desire for me to have the biggest, baddest ship in the Galaxy continues to drive me.  If I find myself getting a little weary from the missions, I go mine, or trade.  I find myself thinking about how I want to build my next ship.  Do I want an array of beam lasers?  Or do I want to build a missile boat?The game does have a storyline arc, but I'm not fully through it yet, so it's difficult for me to comment on it.  I am intrigued though, because I want to see where it goes.  Since that's the case, it has sufficiently pulled me in enough for me to continue.The music is terrific, and the game offers the ability to point toward your own local set of music based on triggers.  Want your collection of dubstep to play during a battle, but have a desire to have your atmospheric collection to drone on when you're just flying around?  Totally doable.For the price, even at full cost, it's my opinion that the game is worth it.  It's a fun time sink that allows me to drop the ""why so serious?"" facade and just play a fun game involving lasers and explosions while making my own choices.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a babyproofed Freelancer with naval combat and a touch of Firefly.A fun game that unfortunately has too few features to justify getting really invested in it. Space sim fans will probably find this very shallow in comparison, but it can still provide a good ~20 hours of enjoyment for a reasonable price.Not a bad game at all; just don't buy it expecting Star Citizen.

												Honestly, there's nothing wrong with this game. However, after 17 hours in...I felt nothing. It was cool as first. The music got me hyped up, the fighting was...meh. The ship only navigates on 1 plane...but we are in SPACE! So the combat and the movement seems kinda lackluster and once you get passed the cool music you start to realize that the game is super repetitive, kinda bland, and just lacking in life. It's not a bad game by any means, but not something I'd pay full price for, especially when there's other space-shooty-grindy games out there. You want space? Play Elite:Dangerous or something. This is Elite:Lite and Low Fat.Only get it on sale for like...under $10.00			"

												Its unfortunate as the game has so much potential, but in reality is nothing but one big grind.It basicly goes like this, you do a story mission, then you have to grind for hours doing repetitive missions to gain new gear after which you can do another story mission and have to grind for hours again.When you finaly get the baddest ship in the system the story progresses to the next system and it all starts over again.The praised music is nice, but it does get repetitve too when you play for a few hours, its like a cd on repeat all the time.It also bothers me that this game is clearly made to be played with a controller and not with mouse/keyboard.Aiming is done with the mouse on a 2d plane, but in all modes but broadside the crosshair snaps on targets so there is very little manual aiming to be done.You simply select a target and click the mouse to fire the weapons group.Seeing the crosshairs snap your constantly moving you mouse to try and get it to snap on the target you want it.On a controller this isnt a problem as you just move the analog stick, but a mouse doesnt move infinite.Ironicly you cant aim up as everything happens in a 2d plane, but small strike craft do fly over you.Its also not possible to assign weapon groups, the groups are assigned automaticly by the type of weapon used.They are ordenance, projectile and beams, its not possible to manualy fire a mixed selection, you can only control one at a time with the number keys, they others are ai controlled.The game does have allot of good pointers though, the graphics are awesome, the mood is good, its casual and laid back.AI turret control can be set to your preferences, like shooting only selected or target only small craft.There is a large selection of ships and weapons to be had, which gives allot of variation in tactics.The ships are clearly a progression over eachother though, they dont give you room to select multiple ships of a same strength, the next ship in line is always more expensive, and somewhat better than the last, yet requiring a different tactic.Pro's:Great graphicsGood moodVery casualGreat controller supportSomewhat intrigueing storyCons:Allot of grinding requiredRepetitive missionsPoor mous/keyboard support, fixed mouse ballisticWeapon groups are fixed, no buttons to fire other weapons than the ones selectedLooking back, i may not have bought this.

												You can see that I've given this a thumbs up well okay but let's get the bad parts out of the way first. Right off the bat this game is overrated by people new to the genre, who have had bad experiences with other games in the genre, are impressed by dev team responses in threads, are amazed that it's made by a two-man dev team, and love the soundtrack. New to the genre is self explanatory - it's a great and under used genre that has been a niche for far too long. Bad experiences..well a lot of the games of this ilk are either out dated like the greats Freelancer, DarkStar One, and the whole Privateer series, whilst the X series is notorious for being released in terrible condition and aren't patched to a high standard until usually the 3rd major patch. This doesnt make them any less worthy examples of the genre when they ARE finished but the initial buggyness and headaches tend to make people react so badly that the games are crucified before they even get to that stage. As for dev responses..I've not had one to my queries and even had one deleted from the threads altogether so no brownie points there fanboys. Whilst Double Damage are a two man team it is very rare for small or solo teams to do all the work themselves..they hire part-time fillers for artwork, coding..whatever is needed..I'm sure that's the case here - When was the last time you saw a credits list to ANY game that showed one or two names? The soundtrack IS great with its modern outlaw theme (very similar to some of the music in the Sons of Anarchy T.V. show) but great music alone does not make a game.All this said, it's an accomplished entry FOR THOSE NEW TO THE GENRE who may be put off by something a lot more wide ranging and complex like Elite Dangerous; others may be put off by what can seem dumbed down and simplistic by comparison leaving a somewhat arcadey feel to combat. Regardless of how you feel in that respect it's a decent game that is certainly worth the asking price.			"

Pros:- Great graphics, sound effects and music- Enjoyable 2D broadside combat- Missions are quite varied and sometimes fun- Has a campaign- Well optimized*, no bugs encountered aswellCons:- Very few factions that you can actually befriend- Some ships can't be acquired- Extremely simple combat (can be a pro for some, certainly not for me)- The universe feels empty* = I use a pretty dated computer, so it should run well for most people.

												One of the most underrated games on steam. I grabbed this on sale and didn't touch it for weeks but I'm so glad I did. It's action packed with a lot of RPG elements. You can spend hours just exploring or jump into a battle at any time. I was a bit hesitant over the lack of full 3D movement, but it's not an issue at all. This is like a more badass, space-themed version of Sid Meier's Pirates.			"

												Classic space game formula done right. Summary: If you don't hate naval style combat / movement you need to get this one. You don't need a lengthy review on this one, trust me. Chances are you've already played other space games and on paper you'll get exactly what you expect: A short story, fighting, trading, smuggling, mining, rescuing, escorting, ship upgrading, new ships to buy, some factions, some solar systems, jumpgates and .. well .. you get the drift.Originality is not why eventually you'll decide to buy this. Polish and charm is. Very enjoyable naval-style 2d combat. Easy to get into, few keybindings to remember, requires the correct amount of strategy (aka it never gets boring and it never makes your brain melt).Opportunistictrading and mining. No need for spreadsheets or noting something down. You'll instantly recognize red prices, stations with famine, mining rushes, market gluts, under siege etc and you'll know when to buy or sell. You'll stop to help traders being attacked by enemies and then sell them high some of your cargo. Addictive progression system. There's always a new ship, weapon or component to aim for and it will always be addictively close to your budget.  Short, classic, cool story. It won't win an oscar, but the voice acting and general style is pleasing and keeps you mildly hooked. It never limits your sandbox experience though and you'll probably be alternating between sandbox and story. Style. Lots of it. Very enjoyable and unique slide-guitar firefly-like rock soundtrack and you also get to use your own music for fighting, idle and in-station situations. Very colorful galaxy with cool gameplay-changing nebulas and asteroid fields.Make no mistake though, this game won't replace elite dangerous or star citizen in your library. You'll probably be alternating between them. One's for the serious long-term thinking space pilot that grinds money and faction influence with his multiplayer buddies and the other one's for the colorful opportunist lone-wolf / firefly / Han Solo experience.EDIT: Almost a year after having finished my first playthrough i find myself again drawn to this game and going for a second playthrough. In the meantime i've been playing (or re-playing) elite dangerous, x rebirth, ring runner, pixxelfrazer, endless sky, galak-z, beyond sol, cosmonautica and other space games - and i have to say i'm having the most fun with Rebel Galaxy (Beyond Sol and ring runner shared the 2nd place).

REBEL GALAXY IS AWESOMEI am to misbehave... FULL REVIEW[gonewiththewin.com] (gonewiththewin.com) It's Firefly. It's also Privateer. You know what it reminds me off also? Star Fleet Command the old Interplay games. What it boils down to is that Rebel Galaxy is great fun. An easy recommend, and hours and hours of just blowing things up that does NOT get old.

			Do you like Firefly? or maybe Privateer? What about Starfleet Command? Then you will love Rebel Galaxy. Fantastic open world sci fi adventure with a hella dose of sass!		

What is it that you are looking for in a game? Hours of entertainment? That's usually a major defining point if I'm going to drop any kinds of serious cash into a game. Will it invoke emotions? Will it capture my imagination? Does it mechically perform and excel at what it claims to do?Rebel Galaxy is that and more. It draws serious consideration for game of the year. It delivers in terms of exploration, action, strategic combat, and kickass explosions. Is it perfect? No. Missions are repetitive, trading is something you do, but its not viable. Same with mining. Is it fun? **** yes.			"

It's just how they describe it on the store page, a swashbuckling space adventure.Works well with keyboard/mouse, or a  controller.

												This game absolutely has that ""one more mission"" feel about it, typically my ""one more mission"" ends up being a dozen more! It's very easy to get into, and to be honest there isn't a massive amount of depth to it, but what it does, it does well. If you like very open games that reward you for being willing to work to your goals in a manner of your choosing (trade, combat, mining) then this is a good example. If you're looking for in depth storytelling and characterization, you might want to look somewhere else. "

												Its a casual smooth action game. Your space ship cannot fly up or down though. Piloting and combat feels a lot like commanding a naval vessle. The designers could easily use the same engine and core data to make a naval game. Its not bad though. Not at all. Once you accept that's how this game is its super cool! Combat is fast paced and intense. Some fights are insane! It delivers with this very well.I am not far in the campaign but I enjoy what story I have uncovered. Rebel Galaxy shines the most for me with how well it has taken a space simulation idea and turned it into something fast paced. Its married to good action combat and randomly generated missions, events and economy. In a half hour you can have do a hard combat mission, go mining, trade commodities between stations and try to hack into a nav beacon.This is both a blessing and a curse though because those few things I listed is really all Rebel Glaxy offers. Then again, that's pretty much the core features of a space sim too! The difference is the speed at which you can do things here. Its very drop in and drop out (or log off I mean in this case) gameplay. It is great fun for me as I love the X series. But this is NOT a space sim. Its LIKE a space sim with space sim LIKE elements. Which is cool. The focus here is on the action. And the sweet cowboy-like vibe you get everywhere.I strongly recomend this title with a 4/5=======I would really like the designers to come back and add some more stuff in a patch though. I would welcome a good $10 DLC if it added a generous amount of things too!			"

This includes the 2d plane in which you move, aswell as broadsides.The general feel of the game, the vibe it gives off is closer to... well firefly. The music and characters are interesting.If you like sci-fi, piratey stuff and a game with a good vibe you should really check this out. Don't expect anything like EVE for example though.			"

												If you enjoyed games like Freelancer when you were little, then this is the game you need in your life.  The controls may seem a bit simplistic going into it, but once you realize how heavily you have to be timing both the broadsides, managing approaches, and using the deflector, the game can become complicated fast. I mainly did merc work, didn't find much need for mining, and within a little while I found myself turning to piracy as well.This is a very well rounded game with good graphics, only the odd bug or two, and an amazing soundtrack that had me checking their web page, pretty certain I'd just heard Chris Cornell and Zac Brown going in again. Of course, it wasn't, but the hard rock sound track none the less seals the deal. This game seriously feels like it should have a much higher price tag and I highly recommend it.			"

I find it hard to have a negative reveiw for something I put so much time into, So its positive now.Pros: Good musicGood graphicsSolid progression systemOpen world with the ability to choose what you want to do to progressCons:Simplistic combatHighly repetiveMeh main plotlineSome early parts i found very frustrating and had to save scum to get past itSo orginally i didn't like this game.  But what i failed to realize was that this isn't a game you sit down and play for hours on end.  Its a game you play for a bit then come back the next day or so.  Thats what got me I just kept coming back.Also I only spent $6 on it that might have helped.Space pirates/traders/anti pirates unite!			"

												This game feels just right. Its the feeling that you are a space cowboy and the universe is there for the taking. Imagine a mix of Escape Velocity series (Escape Velocity/Override/Nova) and Firefly. This is it. The soundtrack is epic, its the best combination of music for this kind of game I have ever listened to. It makes the game enticing. The gameplay is quite easy and easy to catch up. Space navigation and combat are too easy, specially because there is no movement on the Z Axis. The story in itself is very simple, both in lenght and content and there is only ""one path"" to follow trough. You can continue playing after you finish the main storyline, and that is a huge plus. Specially if we can add mods/dlcs in the future. New ships, new weapons, new missions.I would def. recommend this game.Pros: gameplaymusiccombatgraphicsCons:story qualityonly one path to victoryshort list of weapons/ships "

												Gonna keep that review simple. It is a good game which may keep you busy for 20-30 hours. It has a pretty low replayability though as there is very little interest in restarting the game from scratch (the story missions give you 2 different minor bonuses to choose from on 2 occasions).So about the game, it is a pretty standard space opera trading/combat game and has all you could expect from the genre. Its (only) originality lies in you controlling capital ships (from the small and fast corvettes to the massive and powerfull dreadnoughts) and having 3 sets of weaponry (broadsides, turrets and a tertiary weaponry). Making money can be achieved through a variety of quests, piracy, bounty hunting, helping attacked merchants, mining, looting and of course trading. It is grindy, but fair.Overall it is a solid title and I recommend it for what it offers which is a couple dozens of hours of fun (I have more on record because I deleted a save by mistake).			"

												This pseudo-3d combat sim actually had some potential to be good. Like a lot. And it still has some features that are exemplary. However, it has some awful things in it too.The good:The music. Like the series called Firefly? It will bloody catapult you right into the feeling. It's absolutely fantastic, and you can set your custom music, separated into 'combat', 'ambient' and other categories, and you can even tell the game to mix the originals and your own. This is actually my favourite feature of the game, it is so simple yet so effective.Controls (with gamepad mind you). Intuitive, however, you pretty quickly end up ""HOLD DA BUTTONZ, ALL OF 'EM"". You need to hold X for flak coverage, left stick inclick to use the afterburner, left trigger to aim, right trigger to fire broadsides, right stick to aim your broadsides, so yeah. But still, the controls work smoothly and comparatively easily.The combat in the beginning. While the game still attempts to be fair, it is pretty fun. Small craft can be taken out by your flak and turrets, larger ones get the broadside.The bad""Hey, you go for an Average difficulty mission? How about you get 3 random encounters in the mission area, so you not only have to destroy the 2 light frigates we've sent you to kill, but also 3 destroyers, 9 heavy frigates, about 20 corvettes, and about a 100 fighters, bombers?"" And once the random encounters locations are generated, they cannot be changed. So I have a practically impossible main mission in front of me, ♥♥♥♥ you very much.""Trade system"". Components cost about 100k+ once you hit tier 3 (in the first system, there are already 2 tiers, so tier 3 is fairly early, but you have a good understanding of the mechanics by that time) and your cargo can be about 50 units at best. However, you cannot check the prices of other stations in real time, and you can certainly simply buy everything a station can offer in trade goods, and have half the cargo empty still. An extremely lucky trading run can net even 50k, however, you can earn literal millions with single missions by that time.Pseudo 3d ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The problem comes, is that some stuff is in 2d, some is in 3d. Asteroid belts are in 3d, but your radar is in 2d, which means if you warp travel, you have no freakin' idea wether you'll get stuck in that asteroid field by the annoying ""WARP INHIBITED BY X/Y"" (X=stellar mass, Y=hostile forces) every five second, because some asteroids are on your level, some below, some above, some while you could easily fit under/above it, still inhibits warp because ♥♥♥♥you, Enemy fighters, bombers, gunboats move in 3d, you move in 2d, enemy corvettes and above move in 2d. Your flaks only cover your port and starboard, however, if a bomber is shooting at you from your keel, or from the mast (the bottom and the top of the ship respectively) you can only pray that your turrets deal with him in time. Even better, if it shoots you from your poop, where usually no or few turrets face, and your engines exhaust is harmless (however, you can at least turn and face them with your flaks and broadsides then).Overall, the difficulty spike inbetween tiers is too big (your tier 2 turrets are BB guns against a tier 3 shield), forcing you to farm in the previous system for cash before you can afford proper equipment for the new system. Way, waaay too much farming, and even then, the random events are simply unfair.			"

												UPDATE:  This review is out of date, so take what I say about the mechanics with a grain of salt.  I will not be playing this to see what has been fixed any time soon.  Seriously, I spent a lot of time and got no real reward for the MASSIVE grind.  I doubt I will ever beat this game.  Like I say below, the reward does not justify the time it takes.Like some others, I really like a lot about this game but it has some problems.  The kind of problems that caused me to just set the game down, and walk away.  I will start with what I liked. I liked the: GraphicsShip designCombatCustomizing of ship loadoutsChance to buy items low in one system and sell high in anotherAtmosphere\EnvironmentsAbility to add a custom soundtrack  (I used tracks from the Endless Space and Dungeon of The Endless Soundtracks and I liked it better than the normal soundtrack.) What I did not like:The grind! and lack of variety in objectives - This is the biggest problem for me.  You have to grind a lot to progress, with no real change between the different star systems aside from harder enemies/missions + higher tier gear/ships.  This would not be so bad if there were more to do than the same basic missions repeatedly.(IMO: I think having some unique things to find around in space could make flying from port to port a bit more fun.  You know, things that add life and history to the universe you have created.  )Difficulty Spikes - As others have pointed out, there are delivery missions where upon near-arrival to your destination, a ring of fighter ships appear around you.  These ships are quickly reinforced by more ships.  Even with the threat level low, these fighters annihilate your shields and you get picked off pretty quick.  I have had to quit almost every one of these mission due to an absolute inability to get past these ships. (even after upgrading) Merchants Guild Missions - I had originally planned on focusing my time with the Merchants Guild.  On top of the painful delivery quests, I found the others tedious and boring.  Some require you to purchase a large amount of relatively uncommon items and then deliver them to a certain station.  The amount of time and cargo space required for those missions make them a total waste of time.This is too bad because I much prefer the idea of playing a merchant/smuggler, and I like the ships they offer as well.  So I switched to the Mercenaries Guild because the missions are more fun and make more sense.Except rescue missions.Does anyone else have a huge problem with the rescue missions as well?  Maybe I just suck at those.TL;DR - You might like this for a while if you love space games.  But, there is a good chance that you will hit a wall where your time spent isn't worth the fun gained.  I really want to recommend this game, but cannot. In one word: Plateau.			"

												TL;DR below.This game should be called 'Grind Galaxy'.That's because grinding is basically what you will do for 90% (or more) of your game time. Except you're only going to play it for it's main (and only) story. There are no story side quests. Only missions like: destroy some captial ships, rescue a trader by destroying more capital ships, escorting another ship to it's destination while destroying even more capital ships or deliver goods to a certain base which will be hindered by - you guessed right - capital ships which you will have to destroy or run away from.If you want any challenge out of this game, don't upgrade your ship too much. Do as little grinding as possible, so your missions will stay at least at normal difficulty. The game tells you the difficulty for every mission going from 'extreme' to 'low'. I did the mistake of grinding for a dreadnaught ship with level 6 equipment and the game became childs play.The story of this game is very lackluster and demotivating. There was much more potential in it to work with, but the devs didn't build on that. It also ends very abruptly. Even the mediocre story of Freelancer looks like a masterpiece compared to Rebel Galaxy's. I was very disappointed by the story. Especially after the ending.Trading is a waste of time in this game. It has no real simulated economy and the profit margins are so small that it's just not rewarding. The fastest way to make money is to do side missions which, in basically all cases, come down to combat. And after them you can sell the loot you've got from your fallen foes and still make more money than having bought and traded them.Mining is even more useless than trading except for the one achievement you can get.The visuals of the game are okay. They don't make you go 'wow', but at least they're not ugly. But even the old Freelancer can hold up with it. And Freelancer has a greater variety of areas you can visit. In Rebel Galaxy every solar system basically looks the same.The sound of the game and the appraised soundtrack are okay. The soundtrack might annoy you after some time since it's not very diversified. Too few songs are in the game. At least you can set your own music for the various instances of gameplay.TL;DRIf you're looking for a space action game and haven't played Freelancer then definitely go for that. Or if you want even more quality check out the Descent: Freespace games. Google for Open Freepace for a improved version of them.If you've played Freelancer already and are looking for something similar, even if not as good, you could give Rebel Galaxy a try. But better buy it on sale. It's not worth it's full price in my opinion.If you're looking for a space sim where you can do more than just continuous fighting - like trading, mining, building an empire - you should avoid this game and rather check out the games from the X universe or Elite Dangerous.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Double Damage GamesPublishers: Double Damage Games Initial release: Oct 2015Genre: Action, Strategy, Economy Simulator, Space #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationBuy red, sell green. “Economic prosperity and quality education for our children are inexorably linked.” - Jon HuntsmanRebel Galaxy is a indie developed game best summarized by calling it a space trucking simulator. Think of Elite Dangerous in the ocean. The games combat takes place on more of or less of a two dimensional plane. In the the way that Assassins Creed IV Black Flag naval combat has become a bit of a standard. However fighter ships can go a bit above or below the playing field. Of course there are contingencies that allow you to deal with these inconveniences such as automated scatter turrets that can have a tactical assignments selected while you are trying to focus aiming your broadside hardpoints. The game has faction warfare that evokes a feeling of Mercenaries. Some factions are needlessly hostile to you to begin with while others can be swayed through favors or pushed away by other actions. There is no ship customization other than changing hardpoints, shields and deflectors. Or strait up buying a new ship. The game, despite its open nature, has a very linear progression. I see only 2 ways to go. You either become better at killing other ships or pick a frigate that is better at not dying whilst transporting cargo. Essentially be a bounty hunter bent on protecting the citizenry of the known universe. Be a space trucker and keep your nose clean at least in areas controlled by the militia or become space pirate. This is not necessarily a bad thing but in all honesty it feels very shallow and has a feeling (the entire experience) of being a tutorial to Elite Dangerous. Which again is fine, so long as you expect that going in. There are commodities at each station. In essence you could just play the market to progress and get ahead. There are often events going on like a tech boom or famine where buying low and selling high should be a strait forward affair. The game features a custom soundtrack option. And no, I don't mean like putting on a playlist from spotify. You actually set up custom pathing. As in, choose from list A for battles, List B for Exploration etc etc.. However the game features an OST that I consider quite superb. Its consists of some amalgam of slide guitar space cowboy jams and 90's grunge. Which feels not to far to removed from the serious/satire ratio that Borderlands possesses. THE GISTThe game is basically a more friendly version of Elite Dangerous and that's not a bad thing. So long as your expectations are not higher than that it is a very enjoyable game indeed.Follow my curation for more "

												So much potential! The game made a good first impression, and has quickly gone downhill from there. It seems really padded, with tons of watching your ship warp and a lot of repetition in not only the missions but how the battles play out. It just gets... boring. There's all this seemingly cool economy stuff going on, and NPC ships going places - but they all lack personality and I just can't be bothered. It also lacks gravity - in a tough fight? Just run, warp out, dock at a station repair and reload, and the enemy will just wait there for you to come back and finish it off. I have never seen an enemy ship run once I start wooping them (and therefore I never feel any urgency to chase it). I've also never failed a mission so far - they don't seem to expire, they don't move, they don't get effected if you go dock or go do a bunch of other missions.I WAS super excited to finally try this game. SO MUCH potential. BUT it looks like the devs put all their time into making it look good and forgot to make it IMMERSIVE and FUN. I just don't have any reason to open it up again.HERE'S WHAT WOULD MAKE IT AWESOME - - NPCs that reward you with more than just credits... how about loyalty? How about some good cargo? How about doing a han solo and swooping in to help if I'm in a pinch and they're nearby?- Feel like your actions ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. How about after you blow up 200 cartel ships, I dunno, the Cartel gets weaker? Or puts a price on your head? OR SOMETHING??- Ability to attempt to take over ships would be cool- Ability to build your own small fleet, dominate or take over stations, actually look forward to more than a bigger ship after a crazy amount of grinding- A lot less padding would go a long way to make this fun!!

												People keep saying this little gem is 'the spiritual successor to ""Freelancer""'...well, I feel it's more of 'the more faithful sequel to ""Privateer"" than ""Freelancer"" was'.  This is not to say that Digital Anvil's last(?) release was *bad*, but it's more like this later game manage to recapture the first game's core 'feel' than the sequel.  Make no mistake, it does fit in that same grove as both of Chris Roberts' titles, but it lacks the 'glitz' of a AAA-game like Freelancer; it's got more of a 'rough gem' feel like that Wing Commander spin-off was.And tangible things bear me out: the 'meta-game' is very similar: you have stations/bases that allow you to buy and configure ships, commodity markets to buy and sell goods, a mission computer to take various jobs, a bar to meet storyline people, chat with the bartender for rumors and info and hire wingmen...and two 'guilds' - Merchant and Mercenary - who offer better jobs than the mish compy...with membership.Rogue Galaxy adheres to this system, but adds a little to it; the guilds supply unique gear and ships, for example, and your standing can grow over requirement levels to make same available to you (there was little point in 'grinding favor' with factions in Privateer once you were 'friendly').Now the core gameplay (combat and station-to-station travel) is different; you're captaining a large ship that operates like a blue-water vessel, rather than a glorified 'space plane', and combat is 'raking him with your broadsides' rather than 'curling in on his six and shooting him down', but even that difference doesn't weaken the bond.Even the story premise - you speak with this person and that person, and are given an 'artifact' to hold on to momentarily for someone, and it proves to be very desirous for just about everyone else, painting a giant bullseye on the beam of your frigate.But again, this seems to be loving and faithful emulation of a great older title, and it helps the new game.If you liked Privateer (or even its 'big show' successor Freelancer) you WILL like Rebel Galaxy...even if you prefer dogfighting to battleship steerage.  It will 'scratch that itch' while you're waiting to see how Star Citizen will evolve into something that likely won't be able to....oh, and as I'm sure many others have said: the soundtrack is AMAZINGLY good; catchy tunes that you'll find yourself humming on the commute after a while playing. :)			"

												This game reminds me of Freelancer. In my opinion Freelancer was one of the best space games ever! This game is very easy on computer requirements. I can run it at max settings with no issues and I have a much older system. Pros: Feels like Freelancer style of play but a bit more dynamic. Space combat, tradeing with stations and vessels in space, real piracy including gangs to join, differnt factions that interact based off your standing and more. A variety of ship combat styles to your likeing. Much to explore like Freelancer. There is a cool story that you aren't require to follow but keeps things interesting.Cons: The galaxy isnt known for its extreme beauty but I think thats just a minor. If the game was 60$ then I would complain.I think the ships are all rather ugly. Usually space crafts are designed to look very alien and beautiful. All the ships in the game have this rustic western look and fee. Also the music is filled with that style. So no beautiful space music. (It clearly gives you the option to put your own sound tracks on opening the game)Even conversing with the differnt people at stations they have this western voice style and attitude. It's not my personal taste but to my surpise it is a very minor detail if I turn off the game music. Still these are all very minor cons for a 20$ game that WILL give you many many hours of game play easily paying for itself in gameplay time.If you do the same thing over and over while it may start to feel like a grind to get a more powerful ship and upgradeing it. I recommend doing a little of everything so stays fresh for many hours.This game does feel like a AAA game but at a 20$ price which is very worth it. Hell if you can get it on discount even more so.TLDR: If you like Freelancer and space games this is a gem. Cheap in cost, runs very very well graphics are very good. Lots of fun to be had for a cheap cost $ .			"

Neutral review but steam doesn't allow that option.Pros:- Optimized well, runs at a constant 60fps+ no matter how many ships and effects are on the screen.- Has nice sound effects and music.- Looks good visually.- Fun basic space game with killing and trading.- Ships are varied well and don't look the same as others.Cons:- Lack of ship customization, can't choose turret placement or even colour palette/pattern.- No option to auto repair/refill at stations have to do it manually.- No real tactics other then spin in circles while your turrets shoot and you fire broadsides.- No post-launch updates other then a few bug fixes, no DLC/Expansion to expand on gameplay.- Few mission types, gets repetitive essentially just shoot bad guys, protect good guys, move some cargo around.- Trading is random, consists of buy it when it's low and hope it eventually goes up which can take forever, so need to stop at every single station to try to sell.- Story is shallow, missions are the same as the ones you pick up from stations.- Can't go to the last sector again once you leave it, no warning about it.

												When I first started playing I was put off by the lack of Vertcle movement, For some reason it reminded me of Sid Meiers Pirates (Newest one) and that totally fixed it, I just imagine that my Frigate is Sailing the Solar Sea, and it is great, The game is rather Grindy, but some of the fights I have gotten into just flying about doing Bounty hunts and other missions have been great, Flying to a station for repairs after a rather painful bomber fight, only to find a Juggernaught attacking the station, this thing is at least 5 times the size of my measly frigate, with 4 Frigates larger than mine and plenty of small fighters I though ""F*ck that noise"" Then I spotted the 43,000 Credit bounty on it and I just had to, drawing out his support one by one untill it was just the ""Big Bast*rd"" himself, 10 minutes of circling the slow moving Juggernaught and breaking through his shields and I finally finished him off by Ramming him full speed with my Ram Shields activated.I barely have 10 hours at the time of this review, but I expect at least another 40 in the next week.

												I am very sad and a bit conflicted about giving this game a negative review.  In truth I consider it ""meh"".  Its only real contribution to gaming as a whole is the broadside, Assassin's Creed 4 style ship to ship combat, which is a lot of fun.  The rest of the game is a pretty stripped down and bare bones space sim.  Almost all missions involve combat, even the trade runs.  Being knocked out of warp is commonplace and makes just getting from point A to point B needlessly tedious.  The universe has no depth, there are several factions with friend/neutral/foe ratings you can adjust, but none of them have any substance or even an explanation as to who or what they are.  Trading and mining profits scale poorly as such that they're not a real way to make money as the game progresses.All of these things being said I did put 50+ hours into the game and earned all the achievements.  I enjoyed myself through at least some of that or I wouldn't have done it.  The real problem comes down to the fact that its just a bare bones game that does one thing well: combat.  This is a space game to get if you want to get in quick shoot stuff and get out.  Its also good for fans of the show Firefly who like that type of universe and that type of ""space-western"" soundtrack.  Personally its not my cup of tea but that's just a subjective opinion.  While I don't necessarily regret buyint ir or playing it, I don't think I would have missed out anything had I never bought it.			"

												So. Rebel Galaxy.If you're wondering if Rebel Galaxy is a fun game to get, well, here's three stories to help convince you.Scenario One: Laughing at Bandits.I took a mission to pick up a dead drop, pretty simple stuff. Fly to the location, use my tractor beam to pick up a box from the middle of nowhere, and then return it to the station I left from. Simple stuff.Well, apparently some folks didn't take too kindly to it. I come under attack from a wave of pirate fighters, but due to their.. ahh.. 'Lack of tactical prowess' they all come in at different points across the ice field. I start burning away, because there's no need for a fight, am I right guys? Besides, I have a small network of flak cannons (Secondary Weapon System), so these fighters can't do crap anyways. Well, one fighter (let's call him Jim-Bob) decides to go for it anyways.One fighter against a Corvette. Bad choice Jim-Bob. About 10 seconds later, Jim-Bob is a frozen corpse in space, and seconds before my warp drive fully kicks in, all the bandits can hear is a ""suck it, nerds!"" across the comms.Scenario 2: I'm a Big D*** HeroNot too long after that, I take a job to protect some miners. Might come under attack from some more bandits, maybe the same crew I ran into on the last job, no big deal, easy pickings. I head on out, enjoy the sights for a few seconds, before my ship tells me some unfriendly locals show up. Alright, no big deal, some fighters and a pair of gunships. Still in my old Corvette, with the flak system installed, so no big deal, they all get wiped out, I get paid, everyone's happy, the miners all lived, I got paid, played the hero, good stuff. I do my usual heading on out, accelerate to sublight, and hit the warp engine, all cool-like.I feel the kick-back of the warp engine, and am ready to sail off towards my next job...Except I forgot to keep an eye on the asteroid off my port side, and make it about ten feet before dropping out of warp, where I embarrasingly have to boost past the asteroid, re-accelerate, and then hit the warp drive again.I can still hear the miners laughing...Scenario 3: Lightning in Space. Not so PrettySo, easy job. Eliminate this particularly nasty bandit who's been pillaging and marauding his way across the system. Easy-peasy according to my mission log, thanks to some recent upgrades after a few.. less-than-stellar performances on my next story mission. Head on out there, and as I come out of warp, I notice this beautiful blue nebula, with a bit of lightning. I think it's some really nice decoration for a pirate base, kinda fits the motif.About three seconds later, my computer's lovely voice tells me that my port shield is down, and as a I look at the display, not only is my port shield down, so are my fore and starboard shields. Right as the enemy enters weapons range. Beautiful, simply beautiful. That easy mission turned out to be not so easy. A wave of pirate strike craft, and a Corvette greet my in my old Corvette. I've been looking to upgrade to a nice frigate, but that doesn't exactly help me right now, I'm still in this now-battered heap after fending off most of the wave as the enemy Corvette, my target, starts speeding away. Thankfully, sublight boosters help me catch up to weapons range, which, thanks to my shiny new Proton Cannons, is about three to four times longer than my old standard probably-shooting-a-space-potato broadsides. Well, apparently he notices how my guns are about to fire on him, and he turns towards me, not that far off my starboard side, when my helpful computer notifies me of another problem""Starboard shields down""Well, that's just perfect. the shields I NEED to be up are down, thanks to the space-lightning the pirates conveniently chose to hide in. I'm still kind of battered, a few scorch marks and maybe a piece or two of my hull missing, but this is the one guy I positively, absolutely, have to destroy. I open up with a salvo of Proton fire, and close range to get my Scatter Turrets (run of the mill space-laser ""machine gun"" turrets) to fire on him, hopefully preventing a bit of shield recharge. The gambit works, and despite a few more scorch marks to my starboard side, the enemy Corvette explodes, and the people of the system are safe once more!And I don't get caught on an asteroid this time, letting me feel like an actual good guy. Until I explode next, that istl;dr: Buy the thing. Seriously. I would've paid 40$ for this, and they're selling it for a sale price of 18, and a regular price of 20.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is action-packed sci-fi adventure game.Before you even notice beautiful artwork, textures, models and space, first thing you will love is it's soundtrack and music.With countless side missions beside main story, lots of hours of fun are guaranteed.Game is really well optimized that can run 60fps easy even on weaker machines, overall controls are simple enough that beginers wont have trouble starting a game.Battle mechanism is also a job well done, so even if you get a biggest ship in-game with tons of guns, you can't just jump in combat Rambo style and kill everything, especialy in battles where are bigger ships, a caution is always a must.Despite a decent ammount of buyable and playable ships with a good variety of upgrades, I find lacking that you cant actualy change the ship colors,hell I dont want my ship to be yellow/green.  ^^Another con I find is that you actualy can't make your own fleet, you can hire one wingman and thats it. Also there is no crew whatsoever, it would be nice that you can hire crew that will in someway improve your ship stats and effectiveness.Beside that, I only have words of praise for this game, I can say that it is definitely worth 19,99 with what it has to offer to a player. It is super fun, it has good quality so I can easy recommend Rebel Galaxy to everyone.			"

												The combat mechanics are fun and the graphics and interface are well polished but sadly, this game is lacking any depth.The main story is particularly short and uninspiring, which would be forgivable if there was enough diversity in the sandbox universe to give you something to do but there just isn't.You grind generic missions (take cargo from point A to point B), to save up cash for generic upgrades (laser canon mk1 to laser canon mk2), the systems all look the same, they're all populated with the same few NPC models and the ship selection is limited and dull. All in all it's a bland experience with zero replayability.			"

			Review van Rebel Galaxy http://store.steampowered.com/app/290300/ Rebel Galaxy is een roekeloos ruimte avontuur, vol met actie, ontdekking, handel en onderhandeling met de bewoners aan de rand van...		

 )Double Damage was kind enough to sent us a review copy of this game. We're very impressed with it. It's old school fun in a modern setting. The ships designs remind me very much of the Terran Trade Authority Handbook SPACECRAFT 2000 to 2100AD By Stewart Cowley.The game is an open world sandbox with 14 galaxies. You fly around in big capital ships, which you can upgrade or trade in for a better/larger one. The ships can mine, collect, transport and fight. Mining is done in astroid fields scattered all over the galaxies. Each galaxy is full of spacestations, belonging to one of the 4 or 5 factions (sorry don't know for sure if it's 4 or 5). At the spacestations you can sell your mined items, but also buy and sell a lot of other commodeties. You can also upgrade and buy ships there, hire mercenaries to support you and select missions you want to play. Factions offer missions there and by doing them you will grow in popularity with them, while loosing popularity with others. The less popular you are with a faction, the more likely they will attack you when you encounter them in space. When you are really unpopular with a faction, they will not allow you to dock at their spacestations. Throughout the game you can gain or loose popularity however you see fit. Missions can be focussed on trading, mining, defending or helping others, smuggling and battling.The ships are quite cool, all of them have a bit of an 70's - 80's scifi game to them. You can upgrade their strength, equipment, cargo space, weapons and much more. Quite some options available. To make things easy, the ships more one a 2D plane, in a 3D world. This works very well for this game. The act more like a ship then a plain. They have a main engine, sub warp enigne (booster), warp engine and a interstellar warp engine. Weapons consist of turrets and broadside cannons. You can let them fire pretty much automatic, or take control of indivual turrets. Fighting is done like sail ships do, facing sideways and firing away :DYou can fly around anywhere you like and while doing so you will encounter loot, pirates, astroid fields, others in need of assistance and more. This is all aside from the missions you can do. There are also guilds in the game, joining one or more will give you access to special equipment and ships. The ships you can fly in the game range from firefly size ships to battlestart galactica capital ships and beyond.On top of all this, there's a full story with all kinds of missions and mystery going on. You can focus on the story, do it once in a while or even neglect it completely. Besides the main story, there are a few smaller subplots as well.The best thing about all of this is the freedom you have. Go anywhere you like, play the way you like. Be a pirate, trader, merchant and so on. Follow a story, neglects, do side mission, explore and so on. Mix it all together. The game is really easy to get into, easy to play and offers all kinds of levels of mission, with a very low risk to a high risk. The further you fly into the universe to more hostile it gets and the more advanced upgrades and ships you discover. Easy to play and to pick, yet offering a good challenge as well. Flying is easy, just like driving a car. Battling is really done awesome, you get the whole star trek, battlestar galactica, star wars feel when doing so. No puny little fighter..... no massive firepower :DI guess that pretty much covers it, sure I forgot a thing or two. Is it worth it? Yes, without a doubt. The whole concept is done innovative and very well. Everything blends in and just works well together. It's a very welcome break from all the massive space mmo's and all the small spaceship focussed game.			"

												Cowboy Bebop: The GameI wont lie, this game has blown my expectations out of the metaphorical water. I haven't played long enough yet to give a full review but after 5 hours I have to say this is like a lovechild of Elite Dangerous and Red Dead Redemption (gameplay wise) and also Starcraft and Cowboy Bebop theme wise. It also feels like it could be an extension of the Mass Effect universe.The developers have really focused on perfecting the basic core mechanics that are both simple and have a lot of longevity. I think this is the kind of game you could enjoy for a long time.I've owned this game for quite a while and I never touched it until now and I'm really glad I did. If you're out there and you're on the fence about this game I promise you it is very easy to start. You wont be looking up tutorials unless you want to.Update: After 26 hours I'm finally putting the game down. It was a great journey and whilst the story was nothing special, if you enjoy building up a character from scratch then you'll love this game. As I progressed I felt stronger and stronger but some of that was lost because as you progress to further and further areas the enemies get stronger with you. Whenever I visited earlier systems I was always reminded of my progress though.I think if you were to play this strategically and focused on min-maxing your ship, you could easily get 100+ hours out of this game.Overall a fantastic SCI-FI game and a must buy for people who enjoy starting with nothing and earning a spot at the top.

												Think of it like the naval combat from Assassins Creed Black flag ...but with space ships.Yes it is just a 2D plane combat but it s easy to master and fun.Don't expect this to have the depth of X3 or something that big, it's a small enjoyable ,well designed ,atmospheric and relaxing space combat game.Plus, the space country OST takes you back to Starcraft terrans :)			"

Rebel Galaxy is a story driven space exploration and battle game with a unque style and a firefly-esque feel. Above is a short video of me running through th first half hour or so of the game, below are my thoughts on Rebel Galaxy. TheHiddenLevels.com was provided a review copy by Double Damage Games and for that we thank them.The opening soundtrack and just the music in general really gave that space junker, firefly, out in the verse where there is little law and less integrity vibe.. The following gameplay did not let this notion slip away. This is a fantastic western style space traveler and battle game. I was hooked pretty quickly by amazing music and voice acting, the graphics are impressive as well.I engaged my first enemy and honestly thought I was about to lose my ship when I shot them down just in time, the battles feel tense and while manuvering isn't the focus, you've still got to be crafty. The only thing that was a slight turn off was that other ships I was fighting were able to move on a 3D axis, but of course our ship is not capable of 3D flight. It is a game mechanic so that is the last I'll mention it, becuase the game is supremely fun even without that facet involved. The ship building and upgrade possibilities are relatively deep, and offer a real variance in experience and gameplay. I really enjoyed the feeling of landing on new planets, talking to folks in smoky dive bars, and running errand / bounties for unsavory space characters. It's a great adventure game and I'll likely be coming back to it often to see what's next in the story.I'd reccomend this one to any fans of space games, especially those where players can outfit ships and fly around a massive galaxy. Thanks for wathcing and reading, check out www.thehiddenlevels.com for news and reviews!			"

												great game!- easy to master controls- focuses on things you like to do in-game- you can stop and continue whenever you want- good design (at least I like it ;)- great soundtrack- even if missions from the mission board somtimes repeat, trading and mining gets dull after a while, the main mission-line pushes you continusously through the solar systems where you discover new thingsfirst time playing, 28h on clock, still a lot of fun! :) "

												I came in to this game with the idea that ""If you liked freelancer, you'll like this"".  I liked Freelancer, I didn't like Rebel Galaxy.I felt like the camera was always way zoomed in and at a weird angle, and during combat it's pretty much always facing at a right angle to the direction you're moving (because of broadside combat) so I run in to asteroids a lot.  My second time out in a combat zone I ran into an asteroid that had something else next to it, and my ship got stuck such that it couldn't turn, and you can't go backwards, so I had to reload to get my ship free.It feels like you're flying through something far more viscous than water.  I can forgive constant thrust = constant velocity in space games if they at least let you cruise along for a while without slowing down super fast when you disable thrusters.  This game feels like a naval combat engine with space combat art resources.  I think the ship in assassin's creed black flag has less resistance from the water than your spaceship does in the vacuum of space in this game.I also didn't like the weapons.  They auto aim at stuff, and you do broadside combat where you don't really have to lead or even aim close, your weapons all just kind of pick stuff and shoot at it.  The combat is very non engaging and easy, and if it were hard I'm not sure it would be anything but frustrating since there doesn't seem to be any strategy or skill involved.The UI and the controls on keyboard and mouse are also not too great.  It seems like it might feel better on a console, but that's not much of a ""consolation"" on PC.			"

												""You can't take the sky from me""I've only just begun, but I can say that the combat is very fun, the game plays like a 2D version of FREELANCER or PRIVATEER. Graphically, it's got a lot in common with Freelancer, the color-pallet is even similar.It has a 2D combat that's easy to get into with a heavy influence of naval broadside combat.The game has a wonderful FIREFLY flavor to it. It's got a rockin almost honkeytonk soundtrack that never feels out of place.The universe is DIRTY, it's ORNERY, and it really doesn't like you.The only thing I can think of that would add to the game, is a crew aspect. If you had to find and hire good gunners, or missile loaders, or navigator, I think it would have added a bit of depth. It's not poorer for not having those things, but perhaps a sequel later on can explore that aspect.This is very satisfying game in this genre, and should keep the appetite sated until the Persistent Universe for Star Citizen[robertsspaceindustries.com] (also by the guy who did Freelancer, Privateer, and Wing Commander) comes out. Which will have a similar trading system, but a 3d environment.I'm having a ton of fun with Rebel Galaxy, and I can't wait to play some more.			"

												A very good space RPG game. A very good one for those who don't have the $$ to spend for Elite:Dangerous, EVE Online or Star Citizen.The map per star system is quite big with many enemies or allies roaming around.There are many types of ships to choose on different Stars but they cost quite a lot.Combat is for me, hard as I have yet to master the shield system.You can trade with merchants and different station and read the news to see where is the cheapest and highest market.You can also mine though you will have to sacrifice some of you ships combat parts.There are plenty of enemies that they mostly travel in groups especially if you bump into a Flagship or a Pirate Lord which basically murdered you.Music is awesome all the way.Graphics is beautiful, stunning effects and pretty display on the combat.You can customize you ship from weapons to armor to system though you can't colour it. You can hire mercenaries though only 1 and they can really help take away some of the enemies focus from you.			"

												Nice game (for the money)Some people don't like the grinding it takes to buy all the maximum weapons,defense and equipment but i didn't care about that.It plays nicely and is very easy to learn (I've used an PS4 controller, which is 100% compatible. Even the button layout on screen can be adjusted to the PS4 layout).I've completed the story and reached full strength within 40 hours and I wasn't even trying. Once the main quest is over, the game is a little disappointing and you wanna start over (otherwise the game will become a large sandbox and extremely boring).I would recommend this game if you're a fan of this genre. If the game would be under €10,- it would be a steal.			"

REBEL GALAXYDamn! This is such a nice discovery that I made with this little gem of a game. I had bought it, uh, long ago but finally managed to find the time and see what the hell is up with Rebel Galaxy. Oh boy, why have I waited so long? Close to 47 Hours in playtime, I think this is the longest I've played an Indie game!So what is Rebel Galaxy?If you're familiar with FREELANCER, STAR LANCER, FREESPACE, then you will feel right at home in Rebel Galaxy! The main difference is in RG, you pilot a ""BIG"" Capital ship... well, not the starter Corvette ship but there are many ships to choose from as you progress further till the untouchable ENORMOUS Dreadnought BLACKGATE! Took me forever to get it but once I did, game is just too easy...  Anyhoo... let's see the pros and cons!PROS:+SOUNDTRACK! That Dark Country musical genre is so damn good from the composers known as Blue Saraceno, The Dirty Diary and others!+Simple yet really fun and addicting gameplay.+Controlling a HUGE ship is quite satisfying! You ain't a tiny fighter here but a Capital Ship!+The progress system is taxing but rewarding each time you buy a new ship!+Freedom of progress. Want to farm/grind some more credits to have better gear/ship, do so!+Randomly generated ""universe"" so the solar systems aren't the same in each playthrough. Doesn't really matter I'd say as trading is rather pointless in RG!+21:9 UltraWide Monitor support! Visuals are pretty simple which makes RG not a demanding game!+CHEAP! For a 20$ game, I got more than my money's worth out of RG!CONS:-Average story. Hopefully Double Damage Games can improve upon that in a sequel!-Highly repetitive: Lots... LOTS of grinding. You are warned! To make it easier, focus on the ""DEAD DROPS"" side missions, they don't take long to complete and you can repeat them at will.-Ally/Enemy factions doesn't have any territories. You see them everywhere in all Solar Systems... would love a fixed territory setting like in Freelancer!-Would love more variety of missions, mostly all ""dead drops, escorting, go kill Mr X"".OVERALL:For the first game developed by Double Damage Games, I'd say they started amazingly! Sure there's some irks and quirks to work around so hopefully on an RG2, things would be polished and more meat be added too!RECOMMENDATION:Love space games? You'll love this! I just want to warn you that if grinding in a game annoys the sh!t out of you, play RG in quick daily sessions, that way you won't feel it too badly! At first, I felt the annoying grind but as you progress and get a better ship, the grind is less significant as the rewards are much bigger... so is the drops from killed enemies!I truly recommend this game especially at this low price of 20$, you'll get your money's worth!

												I would buy it again and Rebel Galaxy 2 if it would be there.This kind of game was there once or trice with only a few pixels trading and fighting. Now it's here fully 2.95D with beautiful visual effects. Easy and fun to play (with a controller) after investing a tiny bit of time.This game is not 100% for the hardcore space gamer that's needs to have everything perfect (and boringly slow). For example space is just not as empty as it would be irl,.. but I like that.  It misses i tiny bit of immersion (like a few more different faces or discussion options or some side stories or a bit more rare cool stuff or safe stuff for your retirement). But it is finished and as good as bug free (which is rare).On the other hand there is not as much time consuming todo list management. you can actually ""play"" a lot in less time.There is a lot of action per hour combined with the enjoyment of cruising through well ambianced space... not too long... just enough to enjoy the quiet lovely star rays, while in a warp bubble, or meteor belts before an adrenaline rush when going after some fleet of pirates or when they come after you ;-). Not being bothered with loosing track of everything in fully 3D (for die hards). I simply enjoy playing this for fun. Well balanced between trade, fight, travel, progression. Good interface. Good controls. Still room for a better version or dlc ;-)I vote for version 2			"

												If you're on the fence about whether to buy this game or not, go for it!  Replacing and upgrading your ship with different weapon systems and components is extremely satisfying!  You can change your tactics depending on your preferred style of play, your weapons, and a slew of other interchangeable options that allow you to specialize your ship.  I honestly don't want to give too much away.  The combat is so much fun and it's running at 3840 res well over 100 fps.  The graphical rewards are awesome!  Buy it!			"

												This game is fun, but don't expect it to be a game you will play for 100+ hours.  It'll last the hardcore main story mission runners about 15-20 hours.  The main storyline seems short.  Most side missions are faction based, but pay well for the time involvement.  Side missions have some variety and are easy to find the location of and execute.  If you like doing side missions and answering every distress call, you can expect 50+ hours of gameplay.There is a variety of ships each with their own specific stats, but you are more defined by your ship's equipment.  Multiple options for defenses, weapons, and components.  Once you get the largest ship with almost all of the best weapons, the enemies don't really pose a threat and the large dreadnoughts can be melted in under 10 seconds.  Looting is easy and your cargo capacity is upgradable, to a limit.Controls are easy to use and doesn't require you to learn and use 100 different keys.The soundtrack is great and is a mix of Rock, country, and blues.  It includes music primarily from guitarist Blues Saraceno (Poison, albeit briefly) and others.Achievements are easily attainable.  I finished them in 60 hours(all but one at 56), but I probably could have done it much faster if I wasn't meandering.Graphics are good and have plenty of good effects.  You have many options you can turn off.Minimum HW requirements are low, so it'll be playable on most people's gaming computers.There are some things that could be improved if you analyze every aspect of the game.  This is not a sim, expect it to be somewhat arcade like.  The game appears to be aimed at combat and having a good time.  Don't get hung up on the trade system because it needs an overhaul.Overall, it is a well polished game with good graphics and a good soundtrack.  Buy it for $19.99 and enjoy it.			"

												IntroductionRebel Galaxy is the space swashbuckling brainchild of Double Damage, reminiscing of arcade space games like Freelancer, and is supported by an excellent Firefly-like soundtrack. Unlike most space arcade shooters, the game has no pitch movement, instead opting for travel along a single plane. The main game is set inside a galaxy, although it does feature multiple maps, relatively large in size. Despite its similarities, it does a whole lot of thing in a slightly different manner, from combat style all the way down to the way you travel. What you see is basically a new breed of space arcade gameplay, and very much feels like its own brand of shiny new original IP. Prepare yourself for broadside battles and inter-faction negotiations, along with a whole lot of lighting effects to blind you mid-mining.StorylineThis game actually has a rather interesting story line, which is something I didn’t expect. Basically I was expecting it to be like Freelancer in most ways, but be lacking in some department or other. Despite my previous disposition, Rebel Galaxy follows a decent storyline. Basically you’ve been sent a message from your old crazy Aunt, who actually turns out to be a swashbuckling badass space-pirate at the age of late 50’s early 60’s. You’re trying to find out where she is, and make some sense of this weird AI you’ve gotten a hold of. Needless to say you get backstabbed and used like no tomorrow, and very often end up murdering the people you started out helping. It’s all a bit up and down, but heavily broken up by side quests and random world events. It’s similar to Freelancer in that you really need to do side quests and random events in order to upgrade your ship between main missions.GameplayLearning Rebel Galaxy initially can be a bit odd. I went in expecting one thing, and discovered it was something different. The key problem is I was expecting something akin to most space arcade titles. I wasn’t far off, but I was enough for the game’s management to throw me a bit. From scanning areas to turrets with AI, that and the fact that despite manual aim there’s still an aim assist – don’t walk into this expecting Freelancer/Freespace/X-Wing. Take portions of a number of space arcade games, and you’ll eventually have a recipe for Rebel Galaxy. The mystification lasted only a short while in fairness, it’s just something new you have to get used to, but once you do it becomes second nature. To clarify, this is a good thing. What we have in Rebel Galaxy is something that feels at least a little bit unique, unique enough for us to be learning something new, while enjoying ourselves at the same time.I’d like to go on about how much I love this game, so let’s first get the crap out of the way. Two things disappointed me most. First and foremost is the aiming system. AI turrets are awesome, configurable, and there’s a whole bunch of them and they do their job. Manual aim however, felt consistently interrupted. When engaging in broadside battles the game is constantly doing what it thinks is best. I aim the broadsides at a ship, but there’s another smaller ship closer which the game’s AI thinks is a more important target. The catch is my broadside weapons are slow velocity projectiles, and quite frankly I don’t give a damn about that tiny piece of crap. My lasers will take care of it. Instead of simply aiming at the ship I want to kill (which is usually fine in most cases I might add), the auto-aim kicks in and starts shooting broadsides in a direction that is not where you’re pointing. I hate it when a game thinks it knows better than me, and is flat out causing issues for me in intense combat situations. This doesn’t happen all that often, but it’s enough to annoy me a bit. Freelancer had it right. Allow full manual aim, but add aim assist circles to shoot for to shoot ahead of an enemy’s flight path. Auto-aim is just plain interference, because if you want to adjust the game’s target, you have to go into scan mode and switch targets.This auto-assist comes in a second form, with the game’s speed and travel system. I cannot abide it. I’m sorry, but throttling my sublight speeds and dropping me out of warp at the hint of a sparrow’s fart gets extremely irritating throughout the game. Basically warp can only be engaged when the game says so. Sublight can only be sped up to cruise speeds when the game says so. Give me control of my damn ship’s navigation, and stop farting about like my mother. Nothing has been more infuriating so far than travelling 6000 game-lengths and getting stopped three times between A and B because you skirted around an asteroid field. Freelancer solved it, but adding AI auto-avoidance around objects. You’d occasionally hit stuff and lose some shield, but no problem. Slowing me down, and then further slowing me down to the lowest sublight speeds, forcing me to turn ninety degrees and boost out of an asteroid field is immersion breaking.Rant over. The rest of the game rocks. This game is not Freelancer. Stop right there. Take all those predispositions out of your head, and prepare to play an all new type of game. Movement is entirely on one plane, but that’s cool. It means you can focus more on your tactical (or woefully haphazard) combat with those big♥♥♥♥♥broadsides. Turrets have varying types of AI that can be programmed to fire at certain types of targets, and there’s so much variation in weapons it tickles me in all the right places. Combat feels punchy, it looks pretty, and quite frankly simulating space-pirates is an excellent idea. The easiest way to make money is to pick a mission and then do all the randomised events that happen on the way there. There’s tonnes to do, and an enormous solar system to do it in. You might think to yourself that after the first solar system you’re halfway done, but you’re wrong, there’s a tonne more, and each map is as big as the next. Quite simply put there’s an awful lot of content and a lot of sights to see.Unfortunately I can't fit my entire review in this section.To read the full review, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-review/To read the performance analysis, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-performance-analysis/ "

												Highly recommended for space pilots, space pirates, and especially, space pilot pirates.tl;dr:  Firefly with capital ships by a well-credentialed indie developer (i.e, Torchlight).   Elite Dangerous in an arcade, but still mature, setting.Pros:+ Great polish in graphics.   Crunchy, but colorful.   Just the right amount of JJ lensflare.+ Excellent, excellent, excellent sound design.   Audio feedback is excellent.   Soundtrack fits perfectly.+ Varied ship customization.   Even the starter ship can be outfitted for very, very different roles.+ Thank you for on-screen button reminders!   For a casual, ""old fart"" gamer... that's huge!   (It's not memory loss... not yet... it's only playing 20 minutes a night)+ Broadside combat maneuvering is great!   Many ""Age of Sail"" ship games don't do broadside maneuvering as well as Rebel Galaxy does it. Cons:+ Minor Nit:  Some odd UX choices.   Radial menu has most of what you need, scan button has others, and yet the start menu has even others.+ No multiplayer.  Wow, would this be fun in a team!  I get that it would be out of scope for this sorte, ala Torchlight 1.+ Another minor nit:  Who are the factions?  Are they important?  Not sure.  A few brief pop-ups when you gain/lose standing might help.For <$20, I highly recommended buy for spaceship fans and browncoats alike.    A nice hybrid of space sim and space shooter.			"

												SUMMARY: A simple to play, but surprisingly deep space adventure sim with a lot of personality and style that gives you a solid ""Space Western"" adventure where you can carve your own path.It took me awhile to get into Rebel Galaxy as, early on, the directions weren't that clear and the difficulty was erratic.  That's when I realized Rebel Galaxy, for all its great graphics and soundtrack, really is a throwback to the old ""drop 'em in space and good luck"" games of the past.  Once you realize you are on your own in just about every way, it all comes together.In Rebel Galaxy you come to a distant set of stars to find out what happened to your Aunt Juno.  And from there you can do anything you want, from following her legacy, to trading, to piracy, to naming your ship ""Cosmic Bannanahammer"" and doing donuts in space.  It's pretty much up to you.Basic gameplay involves piloting your ship to different locations and pursuing different tasks - trading goods, fighting enemies, raiding ships, mining asteroids.  From firing broadsides to talking to people everything can be done with a standard game controller, which makes it extremely easy to play.  Though controls can get complex, the layout and design makes it very easy to get into the game.So let's break down the usual parts of these games:PILOTING: Space is 2D here.  Sorry, 3D is just for display.  This may seem limiting, but it fits the easy-to-control method and keeps the game from getting insanely complex.  See, battles are done by . . .NAVAL BATTLE TACTICS: This may take a bit of getting used to, but the game emphasizes a mix of broadside weapons, turrets, and specailized items.  Learning to juggle when to attack, maneuver, and fire takes a bit of work, but is rewarding to get right.  Also some of your weapons are AI controlled, making life much easier.  Speaking of ship components . . .PLENTY OF SHIP OPTIONS: Equipment really matters in Rebel Galaxy and has tradeoffs.   Once you get your playstyle down you can buy and customize ships that fit you.  Little changes mean a lot, which is good because . . .PLENTY OF MISSIONS: Sure they're often find, kill, or trade, but they're fun and more importantly they have impact with your standing of various groups.  Pirates, Militia, Citizens, and more will come to regard you differentlly depending on what you do.  This gives you quite a few ways to play the game.LOTS OF LITTLE BITS: There's also a delightful amount of extras.  Trade advice and data that appears to help you trade.  Guilds to join. Bits of humor.  Random events that pop up to keep the game rich, from ambushes to data transponders.  The more you play the more you find.A STORY THAT SEEMS INTERESTING: At first I wasn't sure about the story, but a few missions in it actually got my attention.  You don't have to play the story, but still.A SENSE OF ATMOPSHERE: Finally the game really manages to create a great ""Space Western"" atmosphere, somewhere between Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and its own thing.  This is helped by . . .A COWBOY BUTTROCK SOUNDTRACK: Really, the soundtrack is the icing on the cake, a bunch of country-rock hard-edged western type songs that complete the experience.  The details in this game really make it.Is the game perfect?  No.  Some of it's very standard game-play, if well-implemented.  The combat can be a bit twitchy and confusing.  Some of the data and info layouts could have been better done.  The thing is with Rebel Galaxy, most issues are really minor.  The game is fun, obviously made by people who love games, and has a clear, well-defined identity.  It delivers.So if you like a good space adventure game, want one that's challenging but you can pick up with realtive ease, then buy the game, get on board the Cosmic Bannanahammer, and head on out to find Aunt Juno.

												Basically AssCreed Black flag in Space, including the grindy and repetative nature that BF had.It has a great charm and flare and perfectly nails the space western vibe that it wants to set up. All the ships are dinged up and rusty buckets, your warp drive sounds like it needs a crank start half the time, everyone including the aliens sound like rednecks while vibrant nebulas full of warm yellows and purples makes the dreary backwater system you're in look cozy despite the absolute zero conditions. Combat is fine if pretty shallow, it emulates Black flag almost completely. Combat is mainly through the use of broadside cannons of which there are three main types for your preffered engagement range as well as a slew of secondary weapons that can either be AI or manually controlled. The main unique spin in all ships have shields as their main defesne and these are set up in quadrents with their own independant health pools giving a bit more importance to positioning than Ubisoft's pirate game. Ultimately that is the crux of the entire game, what is has works well but there is very little variety. You'll find one or two setups that are effective and then proceed to grind away doing randomly generated missions or trades to generate the cash needed to buy the next tier of upgrades to survive the later systems and missions, progression is purely numerical. The story itself while not offensively bad won't offer any suprises but gives a good enough incentive to have you roam around the game world.			"

Pros of the game:Easy to learn - the controls are simple yet still allow for strategic tactics.It plays similar to Freelancer.Decent variety of ships and weapons to try out.An okay faction system. Not as bad as the faction systems you see in other games.Both the ""good"" and ""bad"" factions have their own set of ships, weapons, and components to try out.None of that ""selling items for a lower price than you bought it"" crap. Everything you sell is for the exact price you bought it. So if you don't like one certain thing, you can trade it for something else with no downsides.There are lots of ways to make money. Even if you're just on your way to a mission, you can end up making some decent cash just from distress calls and bounties.It's very easy to tell if you are well or under equipped for missions with the dynamic mission difficulty system.It has a feature where you can add your own soundtracks to the game to listen to.The graphics are pretty nice even on low settings.The difficulty is dependant on what sector of the system you're in. That way you can choose how easy/hard you wish to play.The rewards you get from missions is also dependant on the sector of the system you're in. So completing harder/longer missions yields much better rewards.Cons of the game:Most of the game's settings can only be changed from a separate launcher. If you want to change a setting, you have to quit and re-launch the game.The main story is very short. Can be completed in less than 24 hours.This is debatable, but the story is not really that interesting.Once you beat the game both as a ""good guy"" and a ""bad guy"", there's not much else to do.There's no real reason to use any other ship other than the ""Blackgate"" once you are able to afford it. It's by far the most powerful ship in the game.There is a certain type of mission where you have to ""warp pair"" with an NPC and escort them to their destination. Don't even bother taking these types of missions. The NPC AI during these missions is very bad, often times they'll fly in random directions or just despawn all together and give you an automatic ""mission failed"". And the time it takes to complete these missions is very long as well, so it would be an enormous waste of time if they despawn on you.There are only 4 factions in the game that serve a real purpose. The rest are just for cannon fodder. There is no way to gain reputation with them, which is a shame because they all have their own set of ships that you cannot access or unlock in any way.Rating:Buy it for you and your friendsWorth the full price>>Buy it when it's on sale<<Aim for a free copyNot worth it "

												Great game, incredible music, super easy controls, the ships look like something out of Cowboy Bebop (kinda) mixed with Star Wars frieghters (more so). Looks great and plays great on my mid range pc, no frame rate problems or bugs for me.I think I paid $20 for it, but I'd be happy still if I paid 40+I love how the ships scale up as you go, the universal turret mounts get smaller as your ship gets bigger, and big ships handdle as they should.The story is crap but who cares! you get to fly though space and wreck havoc. make your own story. The 2d plane you fly and fight on just works, attacks just like a naval battle, and is really easy to track enemies. Heres hoping we get a second Rebel Galaxy, cheers!			"

This is a review discussing specific points about the game as a comparison for veterans of the genre.An excellent free roaming space game. Very much a Freelancer for the new generation, featuring Capital class vessels!THIS GAME IS JUST FINE WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE, DONT LET OTHER REVIEWERS TURN YOU OFF OF IT BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE A GAMEPAD!So, in Rebel Galaxy, the value of ALL of the parts you buy for your ship is fully refundable. Including ship chassis. You're free to experiment with new types of loadout at will. No charge for resale at all.There's a stat in the pause menu that shows your Net Worth, including your ship and all of the parts you have on it, what's in your cargo hold, etc. It's a great way to do a single-player space exploration game.People complain a LOT about warping taking too long, but I don't find it a problem at all. You can get upgrades to your warp drive that increase the speed dramatically. As for hitting asteroid belts during a warp, you can and SHOULD watch for oncoming nebulae and asteroid fields. You can literally see them coming from a million miles away, and just steer out of the way. Snake around space for a better paralax view, so you can tell whether you're coming up on something big.Combat is on a 2d plane for capital class vessels, and a 3d plane for fighters and bombers. So, your turrets can hit stuff above and below you depending on their placement, and your side-guns are primarily for hitting the bigger stuff.There is a surprisingly large number of ships in the game, I'd put my currently seen number at about 20. Each faction has their own set of ships on offer. I particularly like the trade faction's GIGANTIC verticall wall of shipping containers, bristling with turrets and cannons.When considering your loadout, you spend a lot of time trying to strike a good balance between equipping anti-fighter, anti-cap, anti-shield, or anti-armor. Each turret and cannon has it's own set of attributes, and the jack-of-all-trades stuff is lacking a little in the numbers department. Over all, weapons feel good and balanced between types, with a slight leaning toward Mining Lasers at the start. I found them good for the first system, and switched out to specialized guns later.The cowboy music aesthetic is nice, very firefly. I ended up turning it off after a few hours of hearing the same four or five tracks, and loaded up a playlist with all the Star Wars music from the original trilogy. Definitely a good choice.Bounties are very easy to get in to. You can find them at random when flying about by using your PULSE scanner, and waiting for the ""Bounty Detected!"" notice, then flying to the nearest enemy group. You can get map icons and waypoints to them by paying a small fee to bartenders at any station. While flying about, you'll come across lots of other stuff too. Message terminals that you can hack with a simple timed button-puzzle put waypoints on your map marking weapons caches and asteroid belts uncommonly rich in minerals. You can find distress beacons, traders or military who are fighting a losing battle and pay you VERY well to save them! You can also find ""Pirate Lords"" floating around out there. They are elusive and unusually powerful enemies with huge bounties on them.Missions are the same old cookie cutter, go here, kill stuff, gather items, come back. But! You can take three at a time, and bang them out really quick. Every station has missions, you can see the relative difficulty of each one as a color-coded mission title, green being easy, red being hard. It's actually quite accurate so far, hard missions definitely require some interesting strategies. The missions pay out as SOON as you complete the objective, so if it's just a kill order, you don't need to return for the reward. Super handy!Some of the later trade-faction missions are super lucrative, but require you to actually go find minerals on your own time. I got a mission to gather Pure Water that took me an hour or so due to NONE of the local stations having any, but that could be why I got the mission in the first place! I ended up mining out a few ice asteroids for the loot, and the reward was over $300,000.Trade itself in the game is very simple. Go to station, find merchandise that is selling low, travel around until you find a place to sell high. Each station you visit will book the sale price of each item FOR YOU, and then map them on a really clever line graph showing maximum price, minimum price, and the average price. This means you can do everything at a glance, and don't need to worry about note keeping on paper. Cargo upgrades are pretty cheap, so most any ship can do some hauling. Obviously, gigantic hauling ships do have a lot more to offer that way though.Some ships concentrate much more heavily on rotating turrets, too. So if you don't like the whole ""Broadside"" dynamic, you really don't have to do it at all. I had a little cruiser with 7 turret slots and only 3 side guns, it was just perfect! The downside to a turret-ship is primarily cost. Turrets cost as much as the entire battery of your broadside guns. They lack a little in pure DPS as well, but you can easily make up for it with proper tactical positioning. Broadsiding is hard to line up against faster enemies, and makes you extremely vulerable to flanking by other enemy ships. It does have a pretty devestating hit if you nail another ship with the whole volley, though!You can blast fighters to smithereens with a well-placed cannon volley, too. That's a little tough, but super satisfying.Over all, I rate this game very highly. Each of it's features feel polished to a mirror sheen. It's very, VERY well thought out, and plays like a dream. I've run the gamut of space-freedom games from EVE to Freelancer to EV-Nova, and I feel like this game is a shining star in the genre!			"

												I am enjoying this game immensely.  The capitol ship combat is a lot of fun and a nice change from the fighter craft games that I am mostly familiar with.  The broadside combat combined with AI turrets makes for an easy to learn and very fun experience. The only thing I am not sure about is the lack of three dimensional flying, but that only seems to make things easier.  I find that when I play I don't mind not having vertical maneuverability, so it doesn't seem to be that big a thing.			"

												It's a *very* well put together game.  I run it with a steady 60 FPS on my potato without having to reduce the settings hardly at all which makes for a rather pretty playing experience.  Well optimized and fun to play and it has a killer soundtrack.  There's definately a Borderlands + Firefly vibe going on and I love it!!  This isn't to say the gameplay is like Borderlands, because it totally is not, but the story, atmosphere, and humor reminds me of Borderlands and Firefly together.It can get a bit repetative.  During a long session you might realize that a particular song has come on more than the rest and it may seem like you're running the same kinds of missions over and over, but so it goes.  The story thus far has been pretty engaging and I don't try to skip every scene because, again, it's a very well put together game.My only regret was not buying it sooner.			"

												Think Elite Dangerous, but with naval combat and a good story.The naval-style combat deters a lot of people, but it actually works quite nicely with the single-plane orbit everything has in every solar system.  That means you can't fly up or down, only left or right.  However, smaller fighter planes and asteroids can fly beneath or above you, requiring your ship's turret placements to be more strategic.You can trade, mine, steal, join factions, make factions hate you, help people in distress, escort ships, fight every time, flee every time (depending on ship speed).  You can play as good, neutral, or evil, or jump around and do whatever pays the most.The game allows you to easily put your own music into it. You can resell every ship or item for 100% retail value.  This means you can test out ships, weapons, defenses, etc. without fear of wasting money.  This is a nice way of getting around the fact that you can only own one ship at a time.I think this game is definitely worth the price.  As of writing this I have played 32 hours.  I'm not done with the main story line, and I don't think I will be for a while.  There is too much money to be made, and too many ships and ship upgrades to buy.			"

												This type of game isn't usually my cup of tea. I'm more into story-rich, very involved RPGs like Mass Effect or Dragon Age. I got this game on a whim, however, and I have no regrets.This is an awesome game. It's not too complicated, but it's not overly simplistic, either. The combat is loads of fun. I loved making my ship better and better and exploring more of the map as I did so. It can get a bit repetitive, but, overall, it's a fun time.			"

												This is the most surprising fun game I've ever played. It has me so hooked that I took a break from Fallout 4 to go back to it. If you read the description, you're likely to tilt your head and say ""really?"", but I swear, they got the formula right. The fights are frantic and intense, but very fun. I have no idea how much story I have left, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens, and the many, many battles I will have to fight before I get to the end.One thing I discovered late is hiring mercenaries from a bar. They are helpful, but have personalities that add to the fun of a mission. The music is a great mood setter, the graphics are good, and believe it or not, locking us to two dimensions makes the fighting more fun because it reduces the complexity of navigation and lets you focus on ship position and weapons timing.

												Its a cool lightweight space sim. Its got good graphics, and the alien voices are pretty cool, especially when they say words you recognize in the subtitles. The music isnt your typical space game ambient or electronica, its a kind of bluesy rock that reminds me of Pandora (Borderlands). Its great.The weird thing about this game is it looks 3d, but its actually on a 2d plane (no Y-axis). Think a top down space sim like Escape Velocity, Ring Runner, Trancendence or any of those, where you are moving on a 2d plane. But imagine the game has a similar POV as the X series. Its really weird and disorienting to be in front of a station and not be able to dive under it.Again, let me state that the game is *lightweight*. Not casual, just not as deep as a game like X3. If you love incredibly in-depth games like X3, Eve, or any of those, you will probably find this a bit too shallow.People just breaking into the space sim genre, or those of you who prefer lighter weight or 2d space sims will probably like this one. For what it is, its done very well. That lack of a y-axis  is hard to get over though, especially if you've come from a full 3d space sim.			"

												What I've been able to play has been fun, and it's certainly engaging...well it would be if it wasn't the buggiest thing I've ever encountered in my life...and I played VTM Bloodlines on release. Currently the crashes make it genuinely unplayable.Recommend to play? Sure, if it works for you.Update- Reinstalled game (repeated local verification showed no errors) , drivers, redistributables and wiped out my saves. Seems to be working now, but I didn't have time to pinpoint the issue/s.Big thanks to Travis, who didn't end up being a part of the solution but has been engaging tirelessly with the community to sort out our crap. Would that all devs were as dedicated...now pop in some chew, set up your spitoon and spacecowboy this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I was really curious how they implemented the broadside-combat in a space game. It seems like they found out that for the broadside-combat mechanic to work, the game had to be in 2D space instead of 3D space. So essentially, a pirate game with the looks of a space game. That would have been fine, if it wasn't for every other ship in the game being able to fly three-dimensionally and you only being able to fly and aim two-dimensionally. So, basically, auto-vertical-aiming, like in the original Doom. But then again not like Doom, as you just have to aim directly at something for your guns to auto-correct the trajectory of your projectiles so they hit a moving target. Makes combat increadibly un-exciting. As combat is an integral part of the game, this just completely turned me off.			"

												Rudimentary plotline, but it doesn't even matter. If you liked naval battles in the AC series, this could be for you. Randomized side missions (with estimated difficulty ratings, which can be a bit misleading) lets you broadside massive ships, let your turrets pop frigates and time your short-duration shielding to absorb incoming fire; standard mission types (escort, bounty kill, rescue) lets you gain money to upgrade ships to fit your play style.

												Interesting concept that gets old really fast. If this had been done better it'd feel a lot more like actually being a space bounty hunter or bandit but after like 6 hours it just turns into doing random missions and running supplies around to get more ship upgrades to do more of the same. The combat never changes the enemies just do more damage, so it just feels like a grind as you do missions to get upgrades to... do more difficult missions... For a world as big as it tries to be, the hubs are extremely generic, the bartenders are almost all the same, and your 'random encounters' all play out idententically with recycled voice overs. The soundtrack gets old af after like the first hour. We get it, the final frontier is an allegory for the western frontier, you don't need to dial that theme to 11. This game had a lot of potential I feel like but ultimately didn't meet it at all, just feels like the project funding got cut as soon as they had something that looked like they could sell. I wouldn't pay more than five or ten dollars. It's fun for an afternoon but aimless after that.			"

												Of all the Space sci-fi games I've played, this is easily one of the most satisfying ones I've played in a long time. It delivers on a great Firefly-esque atmosphere, making you feel like some outlaw merc on the fringes of space, saving or sacrificing whomever you choose. The soundtrack is great, the graphics are quite good, and the gameplay feels incredibly satisfying. From the ""float like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion"" action of the smaller, faster ships, to the bulky and powerful dreadnoughts, each ship class has a great feel to it.The story, while not groundbreaking, does it's job well. And the voice acting, while limited, is more than tolerable at the very least.If you're looking for a super-realistic, newtonian physics based spaceflight simulator, you're at the wrong galaxy. Rebel Galaxy delivers on an incredibly satisfying space cowboy feel, and at a great price too.			"

												I must say that at almost 50hr's into the game, I love every moment of it.  Honestly, at this point the only thing that I dont particularly care for is the fact that there isn't any kind of co-op/multiplayer mode to it.  The story line was compelling to the point that (aside from getting the distress call or unknown signal source) that i found myself wanting to know what would happen next about midway thru it.The soundtrack is very nice, but as with other games, when i want to listen to something else, i mute the music in game and play my own play list.The Broadside combat i throughly enjoy as i enjoy other games such as Black Flag (console), World of Warships, and back in the day Starfleet Command.  To many space sim games that do give you the whole 3D still even lack the simple ability to do a loop.  So why bother calling it a 3d game? (yes i pointing my finger at you STO and EVE)The missions will get repetive, but honestly, what game doesn't make your grind once you reach that certain point?  And there are enough different ships in the game to let you find the ""one"" that fits your play style.  I would love to see more ships added eventually.  (i want to fly that Proteus (red devil cruiser/dread (has the look of the Galactica to it))).   I would pay a little more for a DLC with the ability to fly the Alien/Pirate faction ships.As one other person mentioned, there is no cookie cutter build to deal with all missions.  The only ship that will come close to that is the End game Dreadnaught, but all that does is make you a Jack of all trades and Master of none.  (small spoiler below)(small spoiler below)The only constant you can get is the Broadsides destroying everything in 1-3 volleys unless your doing certain Heroic mission.I hope this game continues to add more to it, but if it don't, i've gotten a great game for less than $20.

												If this was being marketed as some $50 triple-A title, it would be disappointing, but as they say in the ad, it's 20 friggin' dollars (and that's when it's not on sale). Rebel Galaxy is a very simple game, and that is its strength and its weakness. If you're looking for a game with a deep story, complex controls, or a fully realized universe with a vibrant dynamic economy, then this ain't it.  Rebel Galaxy is just a fun way to pass the time. It's a nice looking space game with simple controls and a good cowboy rock soundtrack. Incidentally, if you don't like the soundtrack, or you just want a little more variety there is a way to replace or add to the playlist in the game's launcher. I like that it lets you add different folders for different parts of the game. You want honky-tonk piano in the stations, smooth jazz while exploring and speed metal during combat? You can do that.The game is easy to learn and easy to play so long as you understand that running is often a better option than fighting. A fast ship lets you choose your battles and outrun those nasty pirate ambushes that some players seem to have trouble with. It's also a fun way to play. I especially enjoyed the dead drop missions in which I warped into the middle of an enemy formation, grabbed the loot, and hightailed it out of there before they could say, ""Prepare to die!""Are there better games in this genre? Of course. But sometimes I don't feel like firing up an Egosoft title and micro-managing a fleet of traders. Sometimes I just want to have a little fun. Rebel Galaxy was made for those times.			"

												The game is a hell of a lot of fun until you realize that you can't manually save it. The game only auto saves when you dock at a space station. Prepair to waste tons of time completing missions, bountys, and getting loot only to lose it all because a group of high lvl dudes randomly pull you out of warp and kill you...quickly.   The Devs solution?... quit the game and reload because it saves when you quit. Apparently they don't want you to have so much fun playing their game that you might forget to quit and restart. Until it either auto saves after completing missions or has a manual save, I can't recommend it. It's a shame cause it's a lot of fun. I just won't waste any more of my time losing loot and replaying missions.			"

												Early impression is very good. It's a casual game which is a good thing for me considering how time consuming many space based games are. Rebel Galaxy just lets you jump straight in and start having fun.The attention to detail is one of the most impressive things, most noticably the sound effects and music. Firefly was clearly an inspiration here. Full voice acting is a refreshing change from walls of text in many new space games have used.If I had any complaints it would be that being 2D does feel a little restrictive, but I get why they did it. This could have been something really special if they made it with PC's in mind instead of consoles (but thats just me still hoping for the utimate PC space game to arrive). Dont let that put you off, it's good fun and well worth the price.Something to add - I've noticed people complain about being dropped out of warp due to asteroids and debris. That happened to me the first time I played, but then I realized you can steer around them while in warp. It's very easy to see objects coming up in the distance and it hasn't happened since.			"

												After reading reviews about this game being successor to the freelancer classic, I bought the game. The first few hours of game was quite disappointing as the 2D flight mode and the lukeworm story can hardly convince me that this game is even comparable to freelancer. After 5 hours, however, the game became a little more interesting as weapons and ships are unlocked and some of the missions are quite interesting. I have to admit the graphics are good, not superb, but comparable to the freelance --- a shame on its own as the freelancer was a game almost two decades old. The combat system was not inspiring but acceptable and admittedly quite fun to play. Just as I thought the game is getting better, it quickly revealed to me that this is no more than a freelancer game in its core repacked with better graphics and a toned down 2D flight mode. The game soon degenerates into a struggling effort to complete repetitive missions to gain enough money to upgrade ships and components that are ridiculously expensive and are so for no other apparent reasons than to compel the player to complete those stupid missions. So far I think it is unrealistic to make enough money to buy any of those higher level weapons and ships with trade alone. The difficulty associated with some of these missions are also questionable as some missions would see you quickly swarmed by a horde of overpowered enemies ships while other missions give ridiculously high reward for the simpler tasks.In conclusions, I believe this is a game suitable, in fact I would use the word ideal, for killing your excessive pastime at a moderate price. However, to comment that this game may even aspire to be of the equal to freelancer is a severe overstatement.			"

												Overall this game is amazing. As other reviewers have mentioined this game plays like Freelancer and the Assassins Creed sailing mechanic had a baby.  One issue for me: I did not find the soundtrack to be as wonderful as most do. There are moments where this game genuinely feels like a space western in the vein of Firefly, with moody slide guitar and banjo cues.  At other times, the music drifts into the realm of nickelback clones and pop country (even worse than Whedon's godawful song at the beginning of Firefly).  Personally, I'd ilke to see some of those lound country and blues songs toned down or replaced with a wider variety of background/atmosphere-building music.  Other than this particular issue of taste, I wholeheartedly suggest you buy this. Best space sim I've played in recent years.  Combat is very satisfying and upgrades come quicker than you think if you go about your purchases the right way.   A small tip: don't constantly strive for a new ship. Instead work at upgrading your defenses and weapons. Once I figured this out, it was much easier to complete those high-paying missions needed to finance the next vessel.			"

												I'm a fan of the old-school get your mission from some weirdo in the bar of a space station style of space combat sims. My all-time favorite game would have to be Wing Commander: Privateer. This game does a really great job of coming close to that experience.Pros:The soundtrack is fantastic. All the music tracks are well chosen. I only wish they would release the soundtrack as an option to buy.The choices of ships and equipment are not vast, but just right to keep things fun and keep me working to get more cash so I can try different combinations of builds.The environment is really beautiful. The game is fun to play. I would find myself warping to random spots on the map just to see what was there.Meh:The lack of a 3rd axis took some getting used to. If you put it in your brain that it is a sailing ships game with space textures instead of water it will be easier to wrap your mind around it. Once you do that you will stop noticing the inability to fly up.Besides. ""Up is just where you are looking"" -EnderCons:Some of the pirate encounters feel very RNG. I'll be flying along doing great and defending myself to suddenly find myself in overwhelming odds for no reason what-so-ever and go boom. Mining is boring as hell. And this is from someone who enjoys mining in Eve Online. Overall: This game is worth the price of admission. 7/10			"

												I had been looking for a single player space based game that included missions, mining, exploration and ship to ship combat for a long time before I came across Rebel Galaxy. I picked this game up on sale hoping it would provide me with what I had been looking for and was happily satisfied. You start Rebel Galaxy off in a tiny ship and are quickly thrown into this massive galaxy head first with no real direction and plentiful choices on what to do first, an amazing first impression. After a few hours I found that some of the missions were kind of repetitive so I moved on to a different sector to try a new guild. While the missions did vary there are a lot of fetch quest style side missions that unfortunately did not change as the game progressed. Rebel Galaxy shows you straight from the start these giant dreadnaught class ships worth $15m+ while you are making a measly $10k a mission. This while great, also lead to a desire to acquire better ships and gear as quickly as possible. The problem with this choice is due to the games difficulty system, which  is never explained. Rebel Galaxy seems to use four mechanics to set difficulty; system rating, mission difficulty and the last two are based on what hull class and gear type you are using. The game only considers your highest individual type of gear to set the difficulty which can lead to some annoying situations where you are severely outclassed by the enemy ships . These two points should not dissuade you from this game, however. Almost every other aspect was fantastic. The music, while I found not suited to space exploration, was great and has been well received by the community . The ship types and styles all were unique and looked great while offering a variety of build possibilities and attack styles. The weight and feel of the ships during combat and the combat itself. The battles at the core of the game can be amazingly chaotic, the large varieties of ships / builds with different amounts of each in a fleet can lead to some of the biggest fights you have ever been in. I went into a great number of battles ridiculously outnumbered and when surviving in the final moments after a tense and carefully executed fight,  let out a profanity or cheer due to the satisfaction of these sometimes epic encounters. Overall this game scratched an itch that I've had for years that nothing has come close to. For the price and the amount of time you can get out of this game I couldn't recommend it enough.  "

												From the first riffs of the soundtrack, to the thundering broadsides in your first battle, Rebel Galaxy grabs hold of your inner ""space cowboy"" and never lets go.Honestly, not many games give you the full experience of being an outlaw like Rebel Galaxy. Sure, other games has the long arm of the law chase you around, have you be loathed by the locals, and generally make life less than pleasant as it should be. So, what was missing? The soundtrack. This is hands down one in the top 20 game soundtracks I have had the pleasure of listening to while I played a game.As for the game itself, it is pretty straightforward. Take missions, get credits, earn/lose reputation, and along the way solve the mystery of what happened to your Aunt. While it can get grindy, especially for those wanting to be outlaws and getting that initial ""bad reputation"" you need, there is a fair amount of variety to the missions, as well as stuff to find, kill, mine, trade, etc. You can also customize your ship in a plethora of ways, from weapons and armor, to ship class itself. From gunship to dreadnought, there's a ship for just about everyone.Combat is pretty straightforward, you use devastating broadsides on larger ships to tear them apart, while using your turrets to add to the carnage, or use them to pop pesky fighters. With the customized loadouts, you can make your ship a straight up brawler, or make it a long range ship that deals damage from afar without having to worry about heavy plating. There are also support abilities that can further refine your battle plan, or round out a particular weakness.The map is pretty expansive, and the economy reacts to events, so raiding a convoy or breaking a siege will also affect prices of goods that can be traded. This affords you the player lots of ways to play, from being a miner to a no guts no glory pirate.My only gripes are that it can get grindy, but I really don't mind. The soundtrack and visuals clearly make the downtime less unpleasant, and the long warps around the map have given me lots of places to visit along the way. For someone that enjoys being a space privateer, Rebel Galaxy is a game I am glad that I did not miss out on.			"

												AMAZING game for the money.It has all I want in a space game.  Big ships, automated turrets (even though they're better when directly operated), tons of missions and fun characters, etc. etc.  It looks damn good and the sound track fits the game amazingly well.Some complain about the lack of '3d' movement; as in you can only pilot your giant space barge left or right.  This doesn't bother me much especially considering the price point.  For $20 ($18 during the launch sale) you can't go wrong if you want a light hearted arcadey space game.			"

												Super fun!After watching some youtubers with their early copies I decided this one looked promising but I was worried it would be a little repetitive.  After 4 hours and progressing a bit I have to say that the combat system and enemy variety is so satisfying that I definitely do not see myself getting bored any time soon.  The controls are tight and the combat is deep so it is extremely rewarding when you approach a ship, lock on, blast it with long range and then switch to broadsides to finish someone off.   Can't beat those beats either, the music really adds to the feel.Great work devs!			"

												So... Rebel Galaxy...Rebel Galaxy is a game with a space setting that locks you in a 2D plane. You can steer right, you can steer left and that's it. No up, no down, in a game with a space setting, one of the only settings in which you expect full freedom of movement and you're stuck in a 2D plane. This just doesn't make sense to me, why would you make a space game but then handle it as if the player was a ship in the ocean.This was such a disappointment. I bought this game after I watched the trailers, had a loock at the screenshots, which do look good, and read some of the user reviews. These reviews described this game as a mix of Freelance and Sid Meier's Pirates, games I absolutely love and I go back to play them regularly.What else can i say about this game?The graphics are okay, the music is... well I am not a fan of country music, so it's not for me, but that's something you need to decide yourself.I can't say much about the quests you get or the universe itself, as I only played about 20 minutes and then shut the game down in disappointment.So in conclusion if you want a very good space game with lots of freedom get Freelancer and if you want a game with naval combat on a 2D plane get Sid Meier's Prates (it's on Steam).I will refund this game and I hope that if you buy it you will have a better time with it than I did.

												I bought Rebel Galaxy on a whim, and thus far it has been the best impulse buy I've ever made on Steam.  You control a space cruiser flying around the galaxy trading and fighting.  Make money from trading at space stations buying low, selling high, and use the money to upgrade your ship with new weaons, armor, and equipment.  This will allow you to take on pirates (or become a pirate) and loot your fallen enemies.  Trade, fight, loot, upgrade, repeat until you have enough for a bigger ship and repeat the process.  This is much what I imagine Han Solo and Chewbacca did before running into Luke and Ben in Mos Eisley.  Do you want a Han Solo simulator or a Firefly simulator?  This is pretty much it.  I also enjoy the amount of choices the devs chose to throw at the player.  For almost every mission you have multiple options of how to proceed, be it violently or non-violently.  I have yet to see how many of these choices play out, but Rebel Galaxy has made a very good impression in my first few hours of gameplay.			"

I like it, but...As a fan of Firefly, I like this game for both the whole living-on-the-edge vibe, and for the slide-guitar soundtrack. It's cool.But as an astronomer and lover of science fiction, I'm disappointed.First, in space a real spaceship does NOT slow down just because you kill the engines. There is this thing in physics called ""momentum"". You know, the whole thing about an object in motion tending to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force? In space there are very few outside forces that would cause a spaceship to slow to a stop just because the engines are off. At the bottom of a gravity well, like, say, on the surface of the Earth, a vehicle like a car will slow when you take your foot off the gas because of friction. Silly programmers... If you're gonna make a game set in space, at least pay attention to how things BEHAVE in space.Second, even though the POV can be moved around in 3 dimensions the actual game play is 2-dimensional. You can go right & left (port & starboard), but not up or down. Remember Star Trek II, the Wrath of Khan? How did Kirk beat Kahn? Because Khan was operating in only 2 dimensions, whereas space is 3-dimensional.I mean, c'mon, guys! If you're gonna go to all the trouble of programming a game that is smart enough to have you colliding with ice chunks, asteroids and planetary objects, can't you figure out how to deal with 3 dimensions?The last item is that, like so many other games, once you’ve got the basics down it’s “lather, rinse, repeat.” It would be nice to have more different kinds of missions - medical rescues, something that involves landing on some of the worlds instead of just flying by, I dunno. Something other than just blasting things to smithereens.Ah, well. Given the limitations, I'm gonna have to give this game 3.5 stars on a 1-5 scale. "

												 Rebel Galaxy from Double Damage Games is the space shooter for the fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly who thought the writing and characters were too complex. While the writing is just passable the gameplay is simple in a good way. The player's ship is stuck on a single horizontal plane and 2/3 of the weapons either auto-fire or auto-target but instead of oversimplifying the game it focuses the experience on maneuvering. For more information, check out the  VIDEO REVIEW:

												This game is amazing!  It has great gameplay, from zooming around killing dirty ol space pirates, to mining for riches, or delivering cargo to and fro.  The visuals on it are breathtaking, and the amount you can customize your ship is awesome too.  I just made it out of the first sector, and I'm finding new enemies, a new guild to join and do quests for and new parts of the storyline.  The one thing that I find the coolest is the amount and difference in ships.  I started off with the basic little ship, it has like 4 broadside cannons and 2 turret placements.  I saved up enough to buy the next one that had one more turret placement and thought ""holy crap, I am way stronger now"".  Before I jumped sectors I had saved up for a half million dollar ship ""the barracuda"", because it had very fast speed and manuverability, along with 5 turret slots.  I thought I was the boss... and then I saw the ships in the next sector.  This one I just saw costs 17 MILLION and has 13(!) broadside ports and 13(!) turret placements and is HUGE!  Holy crap, time to do some more missions and save up to get one of those beasts.  I have played for 16 hours as of this review, and I can see myself playing for many more hours to come.  So worth the money!			"

												This game is definitely worth it on sale. The gameplay is repetitive but fun. I recommend playing as a pirate for maximum fun. There is just something so satisfying about flying up to a trader asking for help because he is bring attacked by pirates and joining in on the kill. The life of an outlaw is fun, running from or destroying the militia as they chase you around each system. The music is great. I created a playlist of the songs and have listed to it hundreds of times. The space western theme is well flushed out. Mining and trade are boring. It's much more fun to just take from others. The missions are repetitive but are fun if you like blowing stuff up. There are a decent number of ships and some are faction specific. I enjoy the 2D combat. I fully admit that I find 3D space combat to be too difficult to enjoy. This game is more like eve online in that sense. I definitely recommend you get this on sale. A few dollars for a solid 30-50 hours of fun is well worth it.			"

												One of my shorter reviews.Looks nice.Plays nicely.NPCs are limited, but look, sound, and interact nicely.Story starts simple; quickly escalates into ""new guy saving everybody"" territory.Limited ship selection, but not enough to get angry about.Only negative I found was the main story was short and the universe feels empty once that's over, so longevity was an issue.Check it on Youtube, I'd say it's worth the price tag.

												I bought this game because of the trailer set to ""Evil Ways: Justice Mix,"" and I have no regrets. Whether intended or not, the title is a loving tribute to all ""Cowboy Movie In Space"" stories, from Star Wars to Firefly. As with any other similar offering, the startlingly addictive travel-fight-upgrade loop is crafted to keep you hooked, and hooked I was.""Rebel Galaxy,"" at the pick-up-n-play level, offers a nifty sort of subversive, stripped-down take on maneuvering and shooting. This isn't a game about twisting and turning in every possible direction. Instead, you're locked on a 2D plane, with your abilities to both manage your loadout and hop into manual fire-control being of paramount importance. This is not to say that maneuvering and mobility aren't influential. Rather, it's to say that the approach to those aspects is much more focused; The ""domain"" is restricted to a relatively simple mechanic that's easy for the player to recognize and iterate upon.What's very interesting to me is how this connects to the overall backdrop of the experience. Especially with the ""broadsides"" element, the way the ship-combat works makes that part of the game a ""Tall Ships In Space"" sort of activity, which is usually mutually exclusive from the ""Cowboy Movie In Space"" genre. An odd sort of outcome, though, is that for all the emphasis on the broadsides, the game ends up subverting them. Matching speed and hammering away at an enemy is fine if you outclass them, but you're far better off getting on their tail and letting your turrets do the work. A smaller ship can really beat up on bigger adversaries that way, because the truly frightening firepower can't hit you.""Rebel Galaxy"" doesn't quite hit a perfect mark. The way the interaction is broken up into three modes is strange and clunky, with two kinds of scanning (the pulse and detail scans) being strangely divorced from each other in both where they are found and how they work. Also, the ""loot"" value/ mission value/ mission difficulty/ equipment cost curves start off being very nicely tuned, but then seem to diverge as the game gets into the late stages. Particularly frustrating were missions labeled as being relatively safe, where that label apparently pertained only to the very beginning of the mission. A few moments into the actual meat of the encounter, and you might find yourself surrounded by a large number of very dangerous opponents.The problems are very small, though. ""Rebel Galaxy"" is a truly worthy effort that is fun to play and manages to have its own identity. I hope there are more like it over the horizon.			"

												Rebel Galaxy plays like a mix between Privateer, Freelancer and Sid Meier's Pirates in a good way. You have all of the staples of the arcade space sim golden age. Lots of stations, equipment, ships, systems and planets. You have combat and trade missions. You have bars to visit and fully voiced characters and wingmen to talk to and a full campaign story. I loved it and I'm sure that you will too if you remember the old arcade space sims fondly! My first impressions:

												Great space action RPG. As a low priced space game I didn't expect much, but have found this game fun and satisfying.The world is full with a great variety of things to do. Everywhere you go are distress beacons, asteroid fields, ships to fight. Even while on a mission you constantly run into things to distract and entertain you. There are a huge variety of quests to suit any play style.The combat is interesting and challenging. The world is 2d and the ships feature big broadside guns, naval combat style.There are a variety of upgrades that will change the way you play. Broadsides cannons, turrets, missiles, different shield and engine styles.If I have a single complaint it's the difficulty curve of the main quest. The missions ramp up very steeply and require doing tons of side missions to earn cash for upgrades. While I'm still enjoying myself, it does get a bit grindy.			"

												I have to say, I love the style and presentation of this game, and the gameplay is superb. There is a balance in every type of play style and it feels fantastic to lay waste to your enemies in whatever fashion you choose, be it ramming into the hull of enemy ships, overwhelming them with a superior arsenal, or quick strikes that topple your alien foes with mosquito bites. The base soundtrack is limited but manageable with the option to extend the playlists with your own tracks. If you want to blow up♥♥♥♥♥♥while listening to Drake, you can do it! My biggest gripe with this game however... Is the repition. You will be destroying bandits, evil alien factions, the lawmen and women of the galaxy... but thats all the game has to offer. Even into my 20th hour of gameplay I was in love with the combat system, but as the dust settled and the story came to mind, I couldn't find it in me to play past a certain point. I love this game and I believe with a little love and attention for the story or making the economic elements more accessible it could be great.			"

												Bought it and immediately tried this game after looking at the nice reviews. Anddddd....... 8 hours gone just like that. And another 7 hours in the second day.....Ok here is my short review about the game after playing it for 2 days:PROS:- Nice graphic- Nice background music- You can change the background music with music you have, you even can change it for specific situation like music in combat or just gliding around. I use battlestar galactica bgm and it's awesome- Awesome broadside combat, blast away enemy ships with lasers, photons, or whatever you have- Lots of customization for your ship- Cool shipsCONS:- For unknown reason, when I enter the main menu sometimes the game crash- You can't customize ship paint, I really hope I can do thisNEUTRAL:- You can't go up and down in this game, pretty weird since the setting is in space. But this make the game easier to play- No mod support now AFAIK. If there is a mod support, this game will be even more awesomeIt's on sale now and I reccomend you to buy this especially if you are a fan of space battles.			"

I though the pinacle was HOMEWORLD from back in the day and then they re-released it with better bells and whistles and I never thought there could be a better title. Then my sister sent me this game for a present...and it BLEW MY DAMN MIND! I slobbered over my keyboard at the sheer epicness of this game.

												This game is great! You'll be able to find a lot of reviews listing its general qualities, so I'll just talk about my experiences with its combat.Note: This is not a 3D movement dogfight space combat sim,  combat in this game is closer to what you might find in old naval battlesCombat against a mixed enemy fleet is truly a multitasking excercise. You'll be using your boosters to keep yourself alongside larger enemy ships so you can use your broadside cannons, timing your deflector shield uses to block their incoming broadsides/missles, and spamming X button to fire EMP flak at the smaller ships so you can focus on the big target.I find myself having to think about positioning alot, and having to boost away from larger ships or swarms of small craft while i swing my own ship around because the big hole in my leftside hull cant take it anymore, so i reorient and come in from a new angle. So far about 50% of my combat has been outside of mission running. You'll often find distress beacons, get tips from bartenders on bounty locations, or just plain run smack into an enemy fleet while warping somewhere else. Certain missions seem really unbalanced at first, but after refitting to the right weapons or adopting new tactics, suddenly theyre totally manageable. "

												As a fan in general of the larger and more complex space sims such as the old X games I can say I had a lot of fun with this game despite it being ""simpler"". If you're looking for a game that is very deep and has fully fleshed out trading, reputation, 3d flight you may want to look elsewhere (X3 or Starpoint Gemini 2 come to mind). I don't think that's what the developers were trying to accomplish here. I think they wanted the fun and engaging nature of a naval pirate game with some light-weight trading mechanics, where the focus is kept on the combat with the loot system basically for rewarding the player and enabling progression. In that I think they succeeded and did a great job in bringing that feel to a space setting while adding a distinctive feel with the music and pace. I will say that I did have a minor issue with the game where once I found the right setup it became pretty easy to cheese my way through the fights, but it was still a blast.			"

												This is the most fun I had out of a game in a long time. The music is fantastic and really sets the mood. The combat might be 2D but I feel it doesn't take away from the game at all. The ships and stations have this old look to them that I like but not be for everyone. Combat isn't easy either! I often found myself running into fleets of space pirates and getting rekt, thankfully hiring a mercenary really helps. Saving can be annoying because game only saves when you leave a station so you have to be careful going place to place.			"

												Rebel Galaxy....Probably the most fun I've ever had with a space game like this ever. The soundtrack alone attracted me to this wonderful game, only because it's such a perfect match. Though I must say, at the time of writing this, I have roughly 60 hours set in right now into Rebel Galaxy, but it does not match the potential amount of hours I COULD be spending playing this game. With it's randomly generated ""Systems"" or whatnot, it provides a relatively fresh experience with every new playthrough. The only downside with this model, is there is a general process that is the same, and it goes with the advancement in tech vs. the contracts price in every system. Right out of the start cutscene, I could spend maaaybe 2-5 hours building up enough money for a new drive that allows for Solar System Gate use, and start working easy contracts in the furthest system. Run into no conflict, and in the matter of hours attempting at getting high tier gear relatively early on in the story breaks the immersion a little bit. Even if you were to stay true to the story aspect, you can get to a specific point and still go do side quests and contracts for money. There are many directions that you could take with every playthrough, and thats what I'm getting at exactly. No matter how hard or easy you make it for yourself, it's still amazing what one could do in this game.I will have to say, it does break a little bit of realism/immersion at times, when Juno talks  about ""your small ship and how it may be time for an upgrade"", and you already maxed everything out. It just seems weird to me. Little prompts like that. Another thing that concerns me is the difficulty overall, it goes from baby steps to smacks in the face pretty quick, and the overall progression seems a little awkward when moving up in tech. I found that the only way I could survive going up in difficulty for the next system was to earn a ridiculous amount of money, go over there, and buy the highest tech because that would be the only way I could even survive there. The whole concept of Mining or Trading seems a bit awkward to me, because if you want to mine, you have to go at it for a long time to make any real profit. It feels almost useless to me (Mining), unless you find that golden nugget in a desert, the Antimatter Specks, which I have yet to find. The only way you can even make trading profitable is if you attack convoys or traders due to the large amount of items they have that are super profitable OR fighting Pirate lords with high end ship systems, though, they are insanely hard sometimes.PROS:1. The whole badass atmosphere (with music) gives the player confidence and has a really good feeling while flying through space in my awesome ship with big weapons2. Optimization and level of content allow the highest graphics even on lower end machines3. Ship designs seem really well thought out and allow for a multitude of playing stylesNEUTRAL:1. Combat feels tasteful and well done, though lack of ways to end your enemies in your travels feels saddening at times. When I'm flying past, I feel the only way to really do damage is broadsides or lots and lots of turrets. If only there were more ways, it would feel just perfect.CONS:1. Mining is tacky and has a useless feeling. One could be mining for hours, but unless they are mining the right materials that usually scarce in most astroid fields, so it doesn't feel fulfilling2. Solar Systems never really feel unique, a few system is a new system. It may have labels that some places are better for trade or mining, but I haven't really noticed a difference anywhere.3. Factions seem pointless sometimes - because I could be super friends with the militia and citizens, but NOBODY else would like me, and it wouldn't matter because I wouldnt gain anything from them anyways. The only other faction that matters to some degree is the Red Devil Raiders, but they offer mid-game gear from my current understanding. If the other factions had more purpose and personality, I'd be more inclined to try improving relations with them, IF there was a way besides surrendering all of my cargo whenever they see me.Rebel Galaxy is definitely a fun game and I highly suggest you give it a try!---NOTE---The game is not far from its release date, so I expect a lot of changes in the games further history, but for now, this is what I see :)			"

												I've only gotten a few hours into this game, but I'm already loving it. It appears to have the full range of activities in the Freelancer tradition: exploration, trading, mining, and loads of combat. You have faction relations that can go up or down depending on who you do missions for, and there seem to be space ports all over the place to dock at for missions and equipment. I've only barely scratched the surface of the main story, but it's intriguing so far.Combat seems to be the focal point of the game, and it's really well done. I'm not sure how much more layered it can get, but it's nicely varied so far. You control a capital ship rather than just a fighter, and you seem to have two primary classes of weapons: broadsides and turrets. Broadsides do massive damage, but are slow and can't track fast moving ships. They're great against other capital ships though. Turrets can lock onto targets and tear up small fighters, but they can overheat if you don't give them a break from firing. And the cool thing is, they will automatically fire while you're controlling the broadsides. In addition, you have a thruster boost mechanism that can increase you speed, but which can also be depleted from over use, such that it needs a rest to recharge. On top of that, you can get a deflector add-on which is something like an extra shield that absorbs essentially all incoming damage. When it's up, you can't fire your weapons, and it has limited energy which drains over time or rapidly when it's taking hits.What all this means in practice is that you've got a lot of systems and energy bars to keep track of, which keeps combat really engaging. It was a tiny bit overwhelming or frustrating initially, but I felt like I got the hang of the essentials within maybe half an hour. At that point, combat was a blast.I can't say much about the main story, since I've only gotten a couple missions into it, but it seems to revolve around some form of advanced technology and finding a lost relative. Interesting enough that I want to see where it goes. The world feels large and full of activity. Visually, the game is gorgeous, with great effects for all the weaponry, and the music is awesome, a dustry, countrified rock soundtrack that really adds a lot of character to the experience. I love me some electronic music, but this is a nice change of pace that gives the game a distinct personality. In summary, if you ever played the old Wing Commander games, or Freelancer, or anything similar, you will love this game. It even more closely resembles another game call Nexus: The Jupiter Incident that came out about a decade ago, which had an equally interesting story. I'd say the primary difference with that game is that combat is much more refined and well done here. If you're like me and aren't sure, but crave space adventures, get this game.			"

												One of the best space games I played in the last few years, e. g. I played the X series, Starpoint and Elite Dangerous. It has quite a good story (in comparison to other games) and there are a lot of ships which you can buy and upgrade. This game has a lot of potential, hopefully the developers will make another one - with a much bigger universe.			"

												I am old enough to have enjoyed the original Elite back in the '80s and this has the same basic game elements - start with a clapped-out old ship and upgrade it through a series of missions (story and optional), obtain better weapons, carry more cargo, etc. etc. and choose how law-abiding or otherwise you want to be. The game's strengths are the solid storyline, music and easily mastered combat system (although it  is slightly confusing at first, given it operates mostly in 2D in a 3D world). There are enough factions, mercenaries and systems available for this to be fun - it's no space simulator. The main con would be the other side of that coin - once you've completed the story it's hard to see the replayability but at the price point it's well worth investing in. Hopefully a sequel and/or DLC will expand the story/universe and/or gameplay without making it a game where you need to memorise the mapping of your entire keyboard.			"

Managable difficulty spikes and I didn't even realise that I spent 8 hours playing today because it's so immersive. 9/10 Will def play again. And probably alot.			"

												The soundtrack makes this probably the best Firefly game we'll ever get, but if - after a dozen hours have you memorized every note of the included tracks - you throw in the right custom soundtrack it pretty much covers Cowboy Bebop as well. Mechanics-wise this is basically Freelancer 2, except with far better 2D naval combat, randomized systems and sectors, far less ""loadscreen"" traveling (instead you free-form warp and dodge obstacles and it usually takes 40-60 seconds) and the endgame is you piloting gigantic behemoths with dozens of automated turrets in gigantic battles with up to a hundred ships.The variety of mission types for the generated missions is reasonable but limited, so it's up to yourself to pick the type you enjoy (pro-tip: escort missions usually pay that much for a reason) and to get the insane(ly expensive) gear you'll need need to either batch a few dozen missions or - much more exciting - pick the contracts that the game deems far too hard for you and play smart (and hope for the best). So that's both difficulty selection and clever risk-reward choice to let you pick the pace you enjoy.There are definitely a number of systems that feel functional yet rudimentary that i'd like to see expanded for a sequel, but this delivered everything i always thought i wanted from the larger space games like Elite or EVE (ha) or that other sad joke in a much more condensed and enjoyable package.

												This game has the understanding that many of the more recent space sims do not, namely that a living world creates immersion and that the major component for creating a living world consists of real voices, simulating communication with the player, and a vibrant AI system. Add to it some hearty music and Rebel Galaxy feels warm and alive, unlike its much more expensive predecessors.The main gameplay feature that sets this space sim apart from all others is that the battle happens with Black Flag type naval combat, where the ship stays on a flat plain and fires cannons from the sides. Pro's: Good flow: you complete missions, scavenge ships, buy upgrades, move to more dangerous areas, buy better ships, help out allies, do more missions, etc. It gets addicting.Dynamic unbalanced world: I once came across an enemy capital ship in a low-difficulty space that annihilated two militia capital ships and was clearly overpowered for the area. Another time, I came across a giant pirate armada next to a planet. Yet another time, the mission was labeled hard but turns out to be super easy if you are fast enough. Maybe these are all bugs, but they make the game feel more dynamic and realistic.Music: slide guitar rock is great. I bought the songs before the game even came out.Combat is fun. Lots of ships flying all over in the colourful chaos of battle.Customizable fighting styles: Buy a fast ship or a slow mammoth; long range torpedo boat or point-blank cannon. You decide.Good value for your money.Cons:Saving behavior. At the time of this review, the game saves whenever you quit the game or at a station and there is only one save. This means: 1. you cannot load a previous game if you mess up and 2. if anything happens to your save, you are screwed. This means you have less freedom to experiment. I have yet to find a game where the checkpoint system did not annoy me.Flat space: While the naval combat system does work, part of what I love about space sims so much is the freedom to fly anywhere and by restricting the movement to a plain you are cutting at the core of what is interesting about space sims.Trading system is mediocre: You can buy low by paying attention to the news and then sell high but it is nowhere near as profitable as doing even the easiest of the combat missions and just does not work very well.In time, a few annoying bugs did reveal themselves, though nothing gamebreaking.

												I bought this game on 2016 winter sales for about 9 bucks. With that amount of money, and with our alcohol's price, I could have got like couple of beers, may be some spirit, and then proceed to get waste on New Year eve.But no, I bought this piece of work instead.On my first hours, I died 3 times. The first, I did not know that despite showing [Low], the pirate can still make me a slice of cheese with their laser. I guess the system should have warned me at a safe distance, not when I was up close and personal then a red text that said ""red level"" appear. The second time, I flied too close to the sun (planet) and the third was when I have the idea of taking a gunship ""up close and personal"" with a destroyer.I should have bought the beers.

Posted: June 7, 2016
												Yet again, the fact that Steam reviews don't have a ""Meh"" button, is really unfortunate.At first, I didn't like the game - death was frequent and random and the camera was terrible. I even got a Steam refund, thinking that the game was horribly ported, but I found myself missing the combat and feel of the game, so I bought it again... on sale mind you.Having a lot more time in the game now, I can give a clearer opinion on the good, the bad and the plain outright moronic.You control a capital ship and you shoot at other capital ships with a combination of turrets and broadside guns. While there are also smaller ships in the way of fighters, gunships and bombers, you can't control them or even deploy them. If you want an idea of how ship combat works and have played SPAZ2, then you pretty much know. I'm not sure who plagiarised who, but someone did. I can't seem to find anyone else who has raised this point, which is strange, as the similarities are uncanny. Anyway, the good points and the bad.First the good stuff. The graphics on the ships are nice - very nice. Everything else? Not so much. I'm not sure why space is so bright in video games, but I don't like it. The planets look pretty bad in particular, but luckily they are just obstacles to go around and the level of interaction with them stops right there. Another good point is the feel of the ships.Another good thing is how the combat feels. At least most of the time anyway. Flying around in a big ship with turrets and lining up broadsides is pretty neat, though I tend to stick with turret heavy ships and let the game do the aiming, as broadsides don't seem particularly useful most of the time with the speed of combat as it is.So the bad stuff. This is tough, as I don't know where to start. Ah wait, I know.""Space"" is kind of a strange word to be using in this game. You are on a 2D plane. There is no up and there is no down. This might as well have been a boat game rather than a spaceship game - it would have made more sense. It's not too much of a bad thing, I guess, as full 360 movement isn't always done well, but then come the obstacles. Flying through asteroid or junk fields is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ especially when you graduate to the bigger ships. Squeezing in between spaces can be awkward. Even worse is when you are ""warping"". See, when you aren't in combat, you will, after a time, automatically start going at ""sublight"" speed, in which your ship will go faster than it normally can. Any ship, or rock, or piece of space junk and this faster speed will cut out. Let me tell you: ""space"" is full of crap in this game. I dare you to fly any sort of straight line in this game without running into a junk field, asteroid field, ice field or random pirates who happen to be sitting in your flight path. It's so bad that it feels cramped and clunky. It's really bizarre.Another issue that I find annoying is to do with the fighters. Remember I told you that the game is on a 2D plane, right? Well that doesn't apply to fighters. They have full 3D movement, so targetting them can be really hard, especially with the broadsides. Turrets can handle them but they seem infinately more powerful than capital ships when even in small groups, which I find pointless. Also, you'd better pray that you don't encounter fighters of a higher rank than you because they can outrun and outgun you. When the only thing to do is to cut your ship's engines and wait for your inevitable death as you can't fight and can't run, then you know something is seriously wrong.The largest issue, however, is unibutton. If you've played any game ported from a console, you'll know what I'm talking about. Some games call it a context button while others call it an action button. I call it a lazy porting button: used for control pads with limited buttons and annoys us PC gamers with keyboards. This button is responsible for your warp and will automatically light up when you can warp... it's also your tractor beam, your speed increase button and hailing button. When you are near cargo, have hails going off and simply just want to go to warp, you might aswell just blow your brains out instead of waiting for the inevitable frustration triggered aneurysm. Devs: this is the PC. I have dozens of buttons which I'm not using, is it really so much to ask that I be able to map different actions to them?The game can feel good though it does get repetitive after a time and the issues are just mind bogglingly dumb. A minor issue (in terms of the game not my hearing) is that the menu sound and music is so much louder than the actualy game that I have to keep turning the volume down when I exit.This game is ok if it's on a sale, you will get some gameplay out of it and I do feel that it's better value for money than Space Pirates and Lego 2. Don't expect it to last, though.			"

												Have you ever wanted to sit in the captain’s chair of an all-powerful dreadnought with enough firepower to evaporate a fleet of foes? Then this might just be the game for you.In Rebel Galaxy you take reigns of a huge ship and carve your own path through a randomly generated quadrant of space. You can choose the path of a hero and save those you meet from a vast array of pirates and rogues. Or you can fall prey to greed and debauchery, siding with the Red Devil Cartel and carve your way through every enemy that stands before you.But that being said you could choose to do neither. There is always the option to be a humble miner and strike it rich in one of the vast amounts of asteroid belts and nebulae that litter the universe. Or perhaps the life of a trader is more up your alley, with a huge amount of commodities and a living breathing market place that varies from station to station and can be influenced by every day events the choice is yours.The game looks great, it may not be the most stunning graphics available today but I loved how it looked. The ships have super details models, the stars and planets were a joy to look at. The battle effects were bombastic and colourful. Every shot from my huge broad side barrage lit up the night sky as it ripped through the hull of my enemies. The audio is fantastic too. The music chosen for the sound track really adds to the title; each song filled with a defiance that really gets the heart racing and only adds to the reminiscence of Firefly or so many spaghetti westerns that said screw you to the man. The sounds were great as well, the whirring up to using your warp drive or the blasting sounds of laser-fire as it rips through shields and hull alike. The only let down is some of the voice acting was not stellar, but what’s there is good enough to convey the story.Speaking of which the story serves only one purpose, to convey your ship from one star system to the next. Most of the adventure in this title is not from the main plot but from the tales you form yourself. Taking on a trade mission and getting ambushed in a system that is far beyond your ships abilities, warping in to help a trader being pirated by xeno scum or the joy of stumbling upon a fleet of pirates and having them throw your offer of surrender back in your face and blasting them to dust as punishment. The main plot is not bad by any means but the game is so much more.Now gameplay, there are so many facets that it would be impossible to go through them all. The main game is either menu-based, exploration or combat. The menus are as expected. But the meat of the game is its exploration, so much to see and do and the ship controls fantastically. The one drawback is turning speed; the manoeuvrability of the larger ships is very slow and can make tight turns laborious. Combat on the other hand is snappy and fast and only hindered by turning speed. But since a lot of your turrets autofire you feel like a god when your ship can decimate everything in its path on its own and when finally you bring the broadsides to bear its goodnight to whomever you are aiming at.The ships themselves are fully customizable. From engines to weapons, turrets to warp drives, even the size of your cargo hold, everything can be modified, changed and improved. Starting with the most basic of equipment you soon build a ship Mal Reynolds would be proud to call his own. From the tiniest corvette all the way to the mightiest of destroyers each has its own quirks and I enjoyed playing all of them.This game is phenomenal and will have you enraptured for hours. Some people may feel it’s a little slow to begin with or the combat is a little tricky with slow aiming, but if you can get past all that it’s a real gem and I had a whale of a time with it. Plus at full price it is still cheap I would recommend buying this all day any day sale or no.Have Fun ^_^			"

												I've played a lot of space simulation RPG's going all the way back to the original Wing Commander and I can honestly say this is the first one in a long time thats held my attention long enough for me to only get two hours of sleep on a work night.Its a great mix of sandboxing and storytelling and largely just makes you continually go....""eh I can do one more mission"" til its way to late for you to pretend you're a responsible adult.As a PC player I can't say I'm a fan of the simplified console controller interface, but...its functional and works great on a PC either way so I can't really knock it other than a simple nitpick in regards to the on screen control layout not really doing much for my immersion levels...which is a minor quibble indeed when you come across a nice little gem of a game like this that costs less than 20 dollars.If you enjoyed anything up to Freelancer, or even if you currently enjoy Elite:Dangerous and would like something a little less full of other people....Rebel Galaxy is a great piece of work for the money.

												I've been a fan and follower of just about every space game out there ever since Star Trek played on the TRS-80 back in 1980. On and off of Steam I've bought and tried most of the Elite-type, x4 style, in cockpit, top-down, you name it... I've tried and played it. Not many have been as fun to play as rewarding and smooth as Rebel Galaxy... in fact I'd say only one other game comes close... But Rebel Galaxy takes my vote for sure!I look forward to seeing if and when this game gets modded, where it can be taken... It'll be a fun ride for sure.If you enjoyed Privateer, Elite, Freelancer, X-Terran Conflict, Wing Commander and similar... You're sure to love Rebel Galaxy. I haven't even left the first star system yet there's SO MUCH to do! I'm in my second ship, but with all the upgrades, addons and captured hardware my tier 2 ship can handle some pretty bad-A ships. I am truly enjoying the experience!! I give it 8 out of 10 stars. Why two stars less? I would have liked to have been able to build my own starbase or home base. And possibly have planetary landing and exploration... Hopefully in future addons or DLC's... who knows. ;) "

												It's not Elite: Dangerous. It's something a lot more fun and less simulationist. Also less time-consuming.Gameplay is two-dimensional, and borrows the idea of the ""broadside"" from the age of sail. Otherwise, it has most of the thematic elements you'd expect in some form - trading, piracy, factions, side events to stumble across and so on.One of the things I really like is how ""alive"" the galaxy is. It's full of miners in asteroid belts, pirates preying on them, distress beacons, mysterious transponders, ancient minefields, and so on. You can come across two hostile fleets fighting it out with no regard for you. Although there isn't Elite's ability to tip the balance of power by your actions, just smaller scale events that make a minor difference to market prices.Difficulty estimation is occasionally .. surprising. Upgrade your defences first.The cowboy rock soundtrack makes a nice change from the expected, and there's a feature to drop in your own music.Plays nicely with an Xbox controller, although you have to quit game to change control modes. Note you only save when undocking!			"

												OK, so this game is insanely difficult in the beginning.  It's hard to get enough credits to improve your ship.  Don't let that discourage you.  The gameplay is fantastic!  I love exploring the galaxy.  If you like space, pirates, and action, then I recommend this game.  It doesn't hurt that the music is fantastic, either.			"

												I recommend Rebel Galaxy, but you've got to know what you're getting into.Rebel Galaxy initially has far more personality than many of its peers in the ""randomly generated open world space game"" genre.  Unfortunately, the space cowboy facade wears off pretty quickly and the game still boils down to being the same sort of soulless mechanical grind as every other open world space game. The only thing compelling you to play the game is getting the next bigger ship, until you finally get the biggest one, and then you're left only a bit of a hollow feeling at having wasted so much time doing the same things over, and over...and over.So why the thumbs up in spite of these gripes?  Because it's priced right and I knew that's what I was getting going in.  For what it is, it's quite fun to play; it strips away some of the unnecessary complexity of similar games and lends itself to being played in short bouts - which makes it far more palatable to me than some of these games which require an hour just to make one profitable cargo run (you know which ones I'm talking about...). It scratches an itch for space shootin' without being particularly cumbersome to play. I've had enough fun with it for the price that even if I had stopped playing before getting the biggest ship, I would have been satisfied.Just go in knowing that there's a ""honeymoon"" period with this game that eventually wears away before the raw mechanical nature of it is laid bare and if you start getting bored.  After that, I recommend treating it as a ""filler game"" you play in short bouts between doing other things and you'll enjoy it.I do have a couple specific nitpicks that I will list only in the event that they could be taken into account for future improvement:The soundtrack is great...but it makes me realize why some other space games have ""ambient"" orchestral soundtracks.  The game can easily sustain many, many more hours of gameplay than there's soundtrack to cover and the 10th time you hear the same song, it will start to drive you nuts.  There are simply not enough songs in the game.  You can import your own custom soundtrack and that's good, but requiring a player to go to the effort of cultivating his own soundtrack just to avoid being driven insane by the hearing same steel guitar alt-country song for the 65th time is a problem.Regarding the ship models, it became a little too apparent that some were done via contract work or perhaps even just bought off a content store.  The first few ships were very clearly designed to fit the game.  However, some of the later model ships have designs that don't really gel with the visual design of other ships in the game (even accounting for them coming from different alien races). Some have turrets in spots that don't really make sense for the game's mechanics (which ends up in the turret being fairly useless because it's often blocked by the ship's own geometry), or the broadside fire coming out of parts of the model that don't look like they were designed for that purpose.  I wish every ship in the game was as carefully designed as the starter ships.			"

A boy has the right to dream......there are endless possibilities stretched out before him.Rebel Galaxy takes the classic free-form, open-world space sim a la Darkstar One, gives it amazing, brutal, fast, exciting combat, adds a strategic economy with stock market-esque line graphs, a bunch of well designed, fun-to-fly ships, pumps in some grungy western blues rock, and then throws you into the middle of your favorite outlaw studded sci-fi show. We're talking Outlaw Star, Firefly, Dark Matter, Battlestar Galactica, etc.I was initially sold on the soundtrack alone (seriously, just watch the first trailer and you'll know what I mean). I thought I would lament the loss of a Z axis in flight/combat, but because of playing on a flat plane, it plays very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag's ship-to-ship combat, and as such it's very smooth, easy to grasp, and fun.Pros:+ Excellent Soundtrack+ If you don't like the soundtrack, or want to add your own flair, the soundtrack can easily be replaced with your own music, separated by category (idle spacefaring, combat, space station), and your own music can be played along with the included soundtrack+ Smooth combat+ Lots of spacecraft+ Well made stock market style economy+ Planetary events add strategic value to trading+ Feels like you're right inside the Outlaw Star or Firefly universe+ Later fights are challenging, but fun+ Warping between planets is very relaxing+ Space is big. Each solar system is pretty massive, so expect to warp a lot+ Inside jokes and references to other sci-fi media is plentifulCons:- A bit grindy, especially early on- Missions are fairly repetetive- Some later fights can be brutal- Losing a big battle means going back to the last station you docked at. Dock often- No piloting small fighter craft8/10 Would soar like a leaf on the wind			"

												REVIEW – REBEL GALAXYIf you’ve ever prayed that Firefly would be turned into an action-packed space sim, just pour yourself a tall glass of bourbon and strap in, pardner. With the crunchiest roadhouse-cowboy soundtrack this side of the ‘verse and a visual feast that can only be described as f---ing majestic, Rebel Galaxy has been lovingly hand-crafted to appease the most deeply rooted spacelust in us all. Gods. Be. Praised.Here’s the story: Your aunt Juno, a semi notorious ne’er-do-well, has vanished under mysterious and potentially dangerous circumstances, leaving you with a junkheap of a ship and a cryptic message. You’re then set loose in the Xanthe star system (the beginner zone) to carve your own path, choose your side(s), and blast through the near and far reaches of space trying to save the old gal from her fate. And that's just the start of it.The solar systems are randomly generated but feel fully realized, with fluctuating economies, random events, and an endless torrent of side quests. The factions are pretty clear – there are “good” guys and “bad” guys, and it’s rare to help someone without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off someone else, and you’re definitely going to be doing that. You’ll make heaps of money, buy bigger ships and WAY bigger guns, and doing lots and lots of killin’ folk, often in self defense.A majority of your time will be spent fighting nasty people and blasting around the systems for your quests, and it can feel grindy sometimes. That said, I managed to spend WAY more time than I expected doing just that without it feeling tiresome. Hell, it took me 13 hours of gameplay before I felt like finishing the story quests in the very first system, and there are 14 systems. The physics are just delicious, the visuals are head-shakingly grand, and the sound design is so good it hurts. It’s all more than enough to make you forget you had a life outside which, frankly, is kinda the point. Rebel Galaxy is heroin wrapped in crack and drowning in whiskey. So, giddyup.How I’d describe it: EVE for introverts.Score: 4 out of 5Why: Gameplay is unbelievably good. Character interactions feel a bit railroaded, but let’s be honest – that’s not why you’re playing. "

You can trade and mine too, but let's be honest, the fun is in kicking♥♥♥♥♥GREAT soundtrack with the game. Well worth the $20 investment--good for 25-35 hours of enjoyment.			"

												I've played a lot of space simulation RPG's going all the way back to the original Wing Commander and I can honestly say this is the first one in a long time thats held my attention long enough for me to only get two hours of sleep on a work night.Its a great mix of sandboxing and storytelling and largely just makes you continually go....""eh I can do one more mission"" til its way to late for you to pretend you're a responsible adult.As a PC player I can't say I'm a fan of the simplified console controller interface, but...its functional and works great on a PC either way so I can't really knock it other than a simple nitpick in regards to the on screen control layout not really doing much for my immersion levels...which is a minor quibble indeed when you come across a nice little gem of a game like this that costs less than 20 dollars.If you enjoyed anything up to Freelancer, or even if you currently enjoy Elite:Dangerous and would like something a little less full of other people....Rebel Galaxy is a great piece of work for the money.

												Have you ever wanted to sit in the captain’s chair of an all-powerful dreadnought with enough firepower to evaporate a fleet of foes? Then this might just be the game for you.In Rebel Galaxy you take reigns of a huge ship and carve your own path through a randomly generated quadrant of space. You can choose the path of a hero and save those you meet from a vast array of pirates and rogues. Or you can fall prey to greed and debauchery, siding with the Red Devil Cartel and carve your way through every enemy that stands before you.But that being said you could choose to do neither. There is always the option to be a humble miner and strike it rich in one of the vast amounts of asteroid belts and nebulae that litter the universe. Or perhaps the life of a trader is more up your alley, with a huge amount of commodities and a living breathing market place that varies from station to station and can be influenced by every day events the choice is yours.The game looks great, it may not be the most stunning graphics available today but I loved how it looked. The ships have super details models, the stars and planets were a joy to look at. The battle effects were bombastic and colourful. Every shot from my huge broad side barrage lit up the night sky as it ripped through the hull of my enemies. The audio is fantastic too. The music chosen for the sound track really adds to the title; each song filled with a defiance that really gets the heart racing and only adds to the reminiscence of Firefly or so many spaghetti westerns that said screw you to the man. The sounds were great as well, the whirring up to using your warp drive or the blasting sounds of laser-fire as it rips through shields and hull alike. The only let down is some of the voice acting was not stellar, but what’s there is good enough to convey the story.Speaking of which the story serves only one purpose, to convey your ship from one star system to the next. Most of the adventure in this title is not from the main plot but from the tales you form yourself. Taking on a trade mission and getting ambushed in a system that is far beyond your ships abilities, warping in to help a trader being pirated by xeno scum or the joy of stumbling upon a fleet of pirates and having them throw your offer of surrender back in your face and blasting them to dust as punishment. The main plot is not bad by any means but the game is so much more.Now gameplay, there are so many facets that it would be impossible to go through them all. The main game is either menu-based, exploration or combat. The menus are as expected. But the meat of the game is its exploration, so much to see and do and the ship controls fantastically. The one drawback is turning speed; the manoeuvrability of the larger ships is very slow and can make tight turns laborious. Combat on the other hand is snappy and fast and only hindered by turning speed. But since a lot of your turrets autofire you feel like a god when your ship can decimate everything in its path on its own and when finally you bring the broadsides to bear its goodnight to whomever you are aiming at.The ships themselves are fully customizable. From engines to weapons, turrets to warp drives, even the size of your cargo hold, everything can be modified, changed and improved. Starting with the most basic of equipment you soon build a ship Mal Reynolds would be proud to call his own. From the tiniest corvette all the way to the mightiest of destroyers each has its own quirks and I enjoyed playing all of them.This game is phenomenal and will have you enraptured for hours. Some people may feel it’s a little slow to begin with or the combat is a little tricky with slow aiming, but if you can get past all that it’s a real gem and I had a whale of a time with it. Plus at full price it is still cheap I would recommend buying this all day any day sale or no.Have Fun ^_^			"

												If you liked Darkstar One, you'll almost undoubtedly love Rebel Galaxy. It's not complicated, or too technical, or too vast. After a very minor learning curve as compared to many Space Sims, you'll be deep in the story before you know it. It's just fun. The combat keeps you just busy enough without overwhelming you. The game difficulty doesn't seem to be adjustable, but strangely enough it feels just right. It's not so difficult it's frustrating, nor so easy it's boring. It's just fun. I love Space Sims, but have only ever played a handful that I really, really liked, and this one is now on that list. Why? Because it's not crazy stupid ridiculous. It's just fun.			"

So far I have about 24hrs in and I've died like 10 times already but discovered something new in the game while doing so, which takes something out of the sting of death a little but not much.Going into combat is also very hectic, just like a real space battle would be.

												Main storyline (with a few side missions) took about 30 hours. It's more arcade than sim, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.This game is greater than the sum of its' parts. Graphics are nice to look at but not the best I've seen. Combat is satisfying despite occasional glitchiness. Storyline is a little predicable but the characters are interesting and the voice acting (for the most part) is pretty good. Despite these minor annoyances, this game is, hands down, the most fun thing I've played this year. On top of that, it's got the best sound track for a game that I've heard in a very, very long time.It's inspired by the Firefly TV show and really does a great job of capturing the look, feel and character of the 'verse.Even at it's regular price, it's worth the time and money.

												A space game with lots of great concepts, the only problem seems to be due to the fact that it was mostly done by 2 people. The only problem I've had with this game is that faction reputation scores don't seem to give the effect that I expected them to. For example if I got my reputation upto ""Friendly"" with the militia, I would expect them to be friendly with me when I hail them and so far I got the same response I used to get back when I was still in neutral. Other than that it is a great game, you can ally yourself with citizens and militia or be a pirate shooting up citizen and milita ships. Combat is well done and there's different types of ships and gear that you can fit it with. There's also an option to hire mercenary to fight along with you and there's a nice economy simulation under it all. And finally soundtrack really fits with the game, has space-western vibe to it. In conclusion, get this game you wouldn't regret it.			"

												This is my first review in Steam :) I hope it would be helpful for you.I played for 45 hours and I definitely give thumbs up to this game. If you are a fan of Firefly, and if you like Star Trek - Star Wars style space combat, this game is for you. Although not being a masterpiece; the game has a nice atmosphere, wonderful music and sound effects, flashy explosions and lasers, detailed unique ship designs, in short: it has a %85 healthy body and mechanics.Pros & Cons:- The depth of space looks nice, however the colours are mostly vivid mostly and too luminous for space. Though it's less depressing :))- Warp and Jump concepts are very nice. - Thumbs up for weird aliens, their creative languages and weird ships (gets weirder further you play the main mission :) - The game lacks of citizens living wandering around when you visit a station. When you visit a bar, you can only have the bartender and your hired gun, which is so unrealistic. -Diplomacy needs to be worked on some more. And yes, I agree with the other guy: developers need to put a ""reputation"" system inside the game. When a guy destroys 100 capital ships and some 500 fighters, weaker enemies should run away from you on sight, or at least try ;) There is a ""Hail-dialogue"" system in game. Little bit impractical. You can choose to intimidate your enemy which I succeded several times. Still nobody says ""Oh noo! it's the guy who eats destroyers in breakfast! We frakking need to disappear right now!""- After 30 hours repeated side missions decrease the fun. Fortunately the main quest saves it from boredom.-  The turret manual targeting sucks, it's pretty hard to choose your target in real time combat. You can of course ""tab"" and lock your target but I don't like wasting my time when i have 20 meteorites to hit around me (yeah you can do mining and sell the ore you extract)- You have many options to outfit your ship with deflectors, shields, rockets, lasers and such and especially with useful components. The turret's locations are important, nevertheless you can't just drag and drop your weaponry on the ship as you like. You will need to know by trial and error which turret is which and install-uninstall the weapons until you find the right one (I have 8 turrets on my ship for instance).That's it for now :)			"

I just thought I'd  put my imput  into this ""unique""game and definately say you owe it to us fans to not let this game {die in the water};so to speak. Constructively speaking I agree with the rest of the fans it needs a lot more goals & missions /and possibly more of a fun story again to follow or any more extra content you two can think of.               Please reply,Thanks.			"

												I really liked Rebel Galaxy for the trading aspect. Wasn't too fussed about the main missions, but was fun just bombing it from station to station, buying low and selling high. And last but not least, the soundtrack is incredible. I'll be listening to some of those songs on youtube way way after I've put this game down.			"

You got it!You want to be a space miner dodging Jared Fogle like space pirates?! Hell yeah you got it! A long with a footlong full of turrets, broadsides and lasers!This game rocks harder than an asteroid field.10/10 would protect spacer miners again.			"

												If you liked Darkstar One, you'll almost undoubtedly love Rebel Galaxy. It's not complicated, or too technical, or too vast. After a very minor learning curve as compared to many Space Sims, you'll be deep in the story before you know it. It's just fun. The combat keeps you just busy enough without overwhelming you. The game difficulty doesn't seem to be adjustable, but strangely enough it feels just right. It's not so difficult it's frustrating, nor so easy it's boring. It's just fun. I love Space Sims, but have only ever played a handful that I really, really liked, and this one is now on that list. Why? Because it's not crazy stupid ridiculous. It's just fun.			"

												This is my first review in Steam :) I hope it would be helpful for you.I played for 45 hours and I definitely give thumbs up to this game. If you are a fan of Firefly, and if you like Star Trek - Star Wars style space combat, this game is for you. Although not being a masterpiece; the game has a nice atmosphere, wonderful music and sound effects, flashy explosions and lasers, detailed unique ship designs, in short: it has a %85 healthy body and mechanics.Pros & Cons:- The depth of space looks nice, however the colours are mostly vivid mostly and too luminous for space. Though it's less depressing :))- Warp and Jump concepts are very nice. - Thumbs up for weird aliens, their creative languages and weird ships (gets weirder further you play the main mission :) - The game lacks of citizens living wandering around when you visit a station. When you visit a bar, you can only have the bartender and your hired gun, which is so unrealistic. -Diplomacy needs to be worked on some more. And yes, I agree with the other guy: developers need to put a ""reputation"" system inside the game. When a guy destroys 100 capital ships and some 500 fighters, weaker enemies should run away from you on sight, or at least try ;) There is a ""Hail-dialogue"" system in game. Little bit impractical. You can choose to intimidate your enemy which I succeded several times. Still nobody says ""Oh noo! it's the guy who eats destroyers in breakfast! We frakking need to disappear right now!""- After 30 hours repeated side missions decrease the fun. Fortunately the main quest saves it from boredom.-  The turret manual targeting sucks, it's pretty hard to choose your target in real time combat. You can of course ""tab"" and lock your target but I don't like wasting my time when i have 20 meteorites to hit around me (yeah you can do mining and sell the ore you extract)- You have many options to outfit your ship with deflectors, shields, rockets, lasers and such and especially with useful components. The turret's locations are important, nevertheless you can't just drag and drop your weaponry on the ship as you like. You will need to know by trial and error which turret is which and install-uninstall the weapons until you find the right one (I have 8 turrets on my ship for instance).That's it for now :)			"

												Only played this game for 2 hours at this point but I'm seriously impressed. In terms of space exploration and combat, Rebel Galaxy is simple. You have one horizontal plane. You steer left and right, go faster or slower. Where the game lacks in flight complexity, it makes up for in very fun broadside naval combat, an engaging story and the freedom to make bad decisions. You are free to roam wherever you want and do various things at your leisure. The conversations you have with potential friends and ememies effect the outcome of the interactions. The sound track is AMAZING. Most - if not all conversation so far - is voice acted. Such a fun game.			"

												You all need to disregardd the reviews stating this is just attrition based, and you dont need to maneuver.You also need to disregard the reviews  stating Broadsides don't matter because it's easy to maneuver.You notice both review types are actually opposed. Is it attrition click fest I have better shields and guns I win? or is it maneuver based? If you think it is one or the other, you're like those reviewers, and you've probably played the first hour or 2 at most.This game has tactical and strategic level element to the battles.  You have to know when it's time to dish it out and depend ony our shields, and when it's time to maneuver, when it's time to boost, how to approach a battle from what angle based on the craft they have and so on.Saying that - this is a great game, and thankfully it seems the people who are misinforming others count only for 9% of the reviewers...

												I bought this game and was immediately hooked.... it's like Freelancer and Firefly had a baby! You don't play this game for the simulation, but for the amazingly fun space battles. My only possible complaint about this game; it can be challenging, but for those of us who eeked our way early through sheer aggressiveness to the Blackgate Dreadnaught with 20 MK6 Neutron Broadsides and just about as many MK6 Particle Lasers and 100,000,000 credits to our name. ;) No mission is ranged any higher than 'Low Risk'.... and I want more stuff to explode in glorious fireballs! So, the only negative thing I have to say... GIVE ME MOAR BOOM! :D			"

												Takes the fun/addictive elements of freeform space sims while avoiding the over-complexity of some of these titles (such as the X-series). As usual you start with an underequipped ship and earn money for better weapons/systems, new ships, and even mercenary support if you want it. You can earn money via missions (randomly generated and storyline), trading, mining, piracy or bounty hunting; it's up to you if you want to stay the right side of the law or if you aim to misbehave. It's worth noting that your starting ship is a corvette and the ship classes only get bigger from there on (right up to massive dreadnoughts). Because you're always commanding a large ship, combat is very different from a fighter-focused space sim and as others have pointed out it the 2D movement gives a 'naval battle in space' feel to it (though faster paced); it actually works pretty well, making the battles very fun to play - which is a good thing, because there is a lot of combat in this game.Visually this has a beautiful-looking universe, some spectular space battles and a wide variety of nice ship designs (from Serenity-style rustbuckets to more conventional-looking starships). I like the fact that the different ships cater to different playstyles -  bigger isn't necessarily better as there are other factors like speed, manouverabilty and weapon placement, so instead of a linear progression to the 'best' ship, people will find their own favorite ships along the way.There are some aspects of the game that could do with some improvement such as the scaling of encounters and missions - the actual difficulty of missions doesn't always seem to match the stated risk level. Also it's quite possible to get into fights where the only chance of survival is to run, especially at the beginning of the game; though this is not a bad thing in itself, the fact that the game pops up a combat tutorial note on your first fight (even if you're totally outmatched) could confuse new players into thinking they should always be able to win their first battle. I can see why the single checkpoint-type save is controversial, but personally I'm fine with a single save AS LONG AS there is some backup in case of corrupt saves - fortunately haven't had a corrupted save yet, but would be pretty peeved if this happened after hours of play.The hillbilly rock soundtrack does help create that 'wild frontier' Firefly vibe, but it also starts to get a bit old after about 10 hours - fortunately there is an option to stream your own music - this is a great feature that allows you to select different music sources for different situations (ambient, combat, idle, station etc).Overall this is probably the most enjoyable space game I've played since Freelancer.

												Pretty close to being a really solid game. I'm going to recommend it over all, with the suggestion you pick it up on sale at some point. Pros: -the space combat is pretty fun-the soundtrack is great-fairly robust quest system-good options for making a lot of money regardless if you prefer mining, trading, or combatCons:-Main quest is super short, consisting of about 8 ""go here kill these guys"" missions.-Although there are tons of options for side quests, they get old pretty quickly.-40 hours of play time and everything is done, got a dreadnaught with maxed out gear, mostly special pirate/virilax loot gear, about 30 million creds in the bank on top of that, and just pretty much bored with it. I will miss the soundtrack, though.Just the game itself I'd give it 5/10, but if you can get it on sale for 5-15 bucks it's worth it if you're in to this sort of game.			"

												This game nails that slide-guitar Firefly vibe dead-on and I cannot fully articulate just how happy this makes me!  The ship-upgrading, trading and mission-running conventions are comforting and welcome, though the plane-locked flight model is not what I'd wish for -- I miss being able to fly freely in all directions AND I DEEPLY RESENT THE NPCS WHO CAN FLY ABOVE OR BELOW MY SHIP AT WILL -- but I'm getting used to it.  Same with the  mock-capital-ship ""broadsides"" pew-pew combat: not my preference, but it is at least unique and interesting to figure out.  What Rebel Galaxy lacks, though, it makes up with an overall style that goes surprisingly far to make this game a lot of fun.  The character design (THOSE ALIENS!) & engine graphics are beautiful and the music is SO damn good.  I do not regret getting this game in a $7 Humble Bundle after waiting to get it for a year and a half because I am cheap.  Cool game and I hope there's a sequel because there needs to be more space-cowboy games out there, full stop. "

												So I finally beat the main story and every single minute of it was fun. Early on when I started following this game they said it was a mix of Freelancer/Privateer + AC:Black Flag + Sid Meier's Pirates! + Star Control 2 and that is a very apt description.As a kid I really loved Freelancer. Exploring a large system on my own, outfitting and upgrading my ship, taking missions from various factions, etc. This scratches that itch like no other since Freelancer. While I hope Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen will be able to get there they seem far too focused on the multiplayer experience. If you loved Freelancer and enjoyed AC: Black Flag's combat this is the game for you.Pros: Fun CombatNice story that doesn't over stay it's welcomePlenty of shipsLot's of options for ship customizationCons:Pirate story not as deep as I'd hopedI wish there more varied random events in systems like wormholes "

												Tl/dr: It is a really fun and nice game from some Indie developers, and while there are some bugs and exploit possibilites in the game, the devs throw patchs from day to day, so in a short time I'm sure they will be all gone. It is definetly worth its price, for 20 bucks you get 20+ hours of fun, far better than a cinema!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The gameplay is simple, but if you got the vibe of it, it's hard to stop playing. It's not a space-sim, but a more arcade-ish game with a very strong atmosphere. catchy soundtrack (which you can extend/replace with your own music from your hard drive if it's not your style), Beatiful skyboxes, plenty and mesmerizing explosions, laser projectiels and engine trails.The combat is really fun, you have to position well so you can fire with your main weapons on the side of the ship. It might be a bit challenging first but as soon as you learn the tricks and how to sail in the blins spot of the other ships, it becomes much easier, but stays as fun as in the begining. there is no better feeling when you destroy a ship 3-4 times bigger than yours on your own.The controls are made for controlers mainly, and many people say that keyboard+mouse is bad, but personally i had no problem with it, only when you aim with the turrets, the camera can stick to strange places, but it doesn't matter as they will be on auto fire 80% of the time, while you ahndle the broadside guns.The story mission is a bit short and simple, and sadly many characters get only a little screen time. But the dialoges are really well written. Overall if you rush the game it can be finished pretty quickly(possible evein in 5-10 hours, but if you fiddle around it can last up to 25-30 hours! it took me around 20 hours to finish the main story [while i did plenty of sandbox stuff] and other 3 hours to get tthe best stuff in the game.), but even if you get the best weapons and defensises on your favorit ship, the combat is still fun and you can spend a hour easily to blast some poor souls into the space.

												Been immersed recently in Rebel Galaxy, though the game lacks the ability to move up and down, it makes up for it in the following ways.1- The Music is perfect, every time I go into space combat in EVE or STO or any other space game; Star Citizen, Elite, etc. I always have to patch into Pandora and set some rock and roll or techno. This is the first space game I never touch Pandora in, the music is perfect for the combat and for the moment.2- The variation of ships for a game at this price point makes me wonder why its not more expensive. To me this game's value would have to be set at 39.99 or 49.99. I have seen games at a 60 dollar price point that has less content and less hours of gameplay than this. Everything from frigates to Dreadnoughts are in the game with unique and epic designs to be found in each one.3- The Story for me is actually interesting, without making any spoilers, I am very interested to see whats next. While doing these missions it reminds me of firefly pulling into a space station and checking the mission board for any missions I can make a few credits on. Get some munitions or better weapons.4- The graphics are quite good, the explosions are beautiful the weapon designs are stunning. Coming from someone who is an avid player for Star Citizen, to say I'm actually quite pleased with the graphics of this game speaks a lot for itself.5- Some may not see this as a plus, but you cant just get carried away in combat, not paying attention to your shields, not using your deflector shield and rotating your ship can lead to some frustrating moments when you see your ship explode from damage. I got so into the combat that I didn't realize my ship was taking critical damage and suddenly... BOOOOOM SPOOOSH BAWWW.Only negative I see for this game is the lack of 3 dimensional movement. However I have played games that don't have a jump function and they are amazing. The guys who developed this game did an astounding job making it, and it is a must have in anyone's game library that even remotely likes space ships.my rating is a 9.5/10			"

												I'd call this a light recommendation. There's a great deal of repetitive game play, but I found that for the price it met exactly what I wanted: a space game with some space fights that made me feel like a space ace. The story-line is intriguing, but there are some stoppages as you have to upgrade your ship as you progress or it will not be powerful enough for the missions. Despite the somewhat repetitive nature, there was a certain appeal to finally getting that new ship and whipping the♥♥♥♥♥of those pirates that took you into hull so many times. Treat this game like it's Gran Turismo, Space Edition, and you'll probably solidly like it as I did. Game is 8/10. EDITED because I forgot to mention, the MUSIC is AWESOME. Totally makes you feel like you're in Firefly. There's only a few different songs, but they are masterfully done and very immersive. Music is 10/10.			"

From the intro music to the narration, it reeks of the Old West...cowboys and indians, that kinda thing. It should also conjure up images of ""Firefly"", if you get what I mean.The story, at least in the beginning, is kinda cliched - Almost the same story from Independence War Edge Of Chaos. Your Aunt sent you a cryptic message to meet her at a space station way out in the boonies, you get there and she's not there. You meet a ""friend"" of hers, and he starts sending you off on missions with promises and leads to help you find your Aunt.Now, I haven't put in much hours into this game yet but I can already tell I'll be putting in a couple of hundred hours at least.

												Decent game, Looks great, plays great and is overall fun.  You will say two things while playing this game. #1  Great i just got dropped out of warp again within five feet from the last group of enemies that just dropped me out of warp,#2  I don't understand why the game even bothers to give you options to buy better shields and weps. Enemies get through your shield in seconds and your weps never get through the enemies shields fast enough.  It's annoying to have to constantly having to fix your hull and buy ammo.Like I said, good game overall for a sp game.  It's a shame the developer added more mobs that jump you every five feet instead of a story that works or better combat mechanics.Plus there is little to no replay value for this game, replaying this game gives you nothing new and the story is a one way trip.I would wait until this game is on the 5$ discount rack.   It's not worth the price they are asking.			"

It certainly isnt freelancer or any game of that sort with story depth, but then again we dont always need that to enjoy simple space games. This is a space western if there ever was one.

												I have loved the space game genre since I was 8 years old. The fact that I am recommending this means that out of the 95% of released space sim titles I have played to death, Rebel Galaxy manages to stand out a cut above many of them. I am not even a quarterway finished with the main storyline, yet 10 hours in, the amount of content is quite impressive, and makes gameplay enjoyable to say the least. First and foremost, this is a third person spaceship simulator. There is no empire building or 4X gameplay involved. You primarily fight, trade and explore in Rebel Galaxy, and start off doing the main campaign which you can deviate from at anytime. Of course the campaign has you flying around a little bit to do other things, but fighting is usually involved. Wonderful thing here is though, interactions with NPCs in the campaign and in general allow for non-violent alternatives to do a mission, or, for instance, to handle a pirating attempt or an illegal cargo inspection by system militia. There are about a dozen solar systems in Rebel Galaxy, so you are given some wiggle room to move around. Content such as missions, NPC spawns, and solar system events are randomly generated. There is enough variety to keep things from going stale, and as you get farther away from your starting solar system, more content (ships, equipment, guild allegiances) is available to you.Combat is a bit different in Rebel Galaxy. And your ship's motion is limited to 2D movement only (while fightercraft and the environment objects can have 3D motions and positions). I will seperate this into two parts. Offensive capabilities and Defensive capabilities.Offensive capabilitiesIncludes 1) A primary weapon 2) A secondary weapon 3) Turret systems 4) Mercenaries 5) Deflectors. Primary weapons can be either pulse laser types or beam laser types. You fire broadsides (i.e from the side) at the enemies on either side. Very powerful, and include a small charging time for an auto-aim accuracy bonus. Secondary weapons are either mines or missiles (point & shoot or seeking). Good damage. Turret systems can be either pulse or laser types. You can take control of your turret groups (1 at a time only) and fire at enemies in a 360 degree arc. Critical against fightercraft and provide good sustaining damage against larger craft. Mercenaries are fightercraft/gunships that follow you around for a 1 time fee. They are very durable, are good fodder, and you can only have 1 with you at any time. Deflectors are a sort of temporary shield you can activate which absorb damage. You can also ram enemy ships with them to inflict damage.Defensive capabilities Include 1) Deflectors 2) Shields 3) Armor 4) Hull 5) Engine boosters As mentioned, Deflectors are temporary shields that asborb damage until you run out of charge, in which case you must wait for them to have charge in order to use them. Shields are divided into 4 sections that protect your ship (front, port, starboard, aft) from all damage and collisions. Armor protects your ship's hull. Damage to armor can damage to ship systems. Hull is your powercore. If it goes to 0, you die. Engine boosters can be used to maneuver weapons fire, outrun missiles, outrun foes, and kite enemies.Combat aside, the graphics are very nice and well optimized. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful, it reminds me of Firefly.As with any game, there is a bit of a grind involved to gain credits in order to unlock higher tiered ships and equipment. Best way to go about this is doing a bunch of high paying missions (mission payouts generally increase as your overall strength increases) alongside a storyline mission once in a while. Or however you want. Imo the grind doesn't feel like a grind sometimes. It's pretty fun to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. All in all, I dig it. Combat is different, not shallow. Plenty of content. Good soundtrack. Solid mechanics.  Decent plot. Way to go Double Damage Games. I hope you keep making titles in this genre!			"

												For people too wimpy for Elite Dangerous, and too suspicious of Chris RobertsGreat rock/punk-blues soundtrack that suits the ""wahoo space cowboy firin' mah layzers"" style.Two caveats.There's no up or down (which will be weird at first to anyone who's ever flown anything in any game), you navigate your ship across a flat plane. You can aim your guns up and down, but your ship will only steer left and right; you're flying what amount to capital ships in this game, so its not completely ridiculous logic I suppose, if nothing else it makes aiming your main broadside cannons easier. You can give the AI control over all the rest of your armaments, or you can swap to them manually at any point.  I prefer to let the AI eat away at the small fighters and crap while I focus my roflstomper on the big armored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with giant guns. Because it needs roflstomped. Repeatedly.Second, random asteroids and space debris knock you out of warp.  That's really annyoing because then you have to realign for warp which means moving around the random object you got hung on which is time consuming and it happens frequently; it should be more like Eve, where you do have to align and accelerate into warp speed proper but once your ship begins warp, it passes through solid objects from asteroids to planets. Its a small thing but it gets old really, really fast. There are upgrades for the warp drive but they increase warpspeed rather than improve your align time or reduce the amount of time needed to align; I would much have preferred the latter and just have maximum warp speed determined by ship class, again like in Eve.I beat the story, unlocked all the achievements (legitimately) and still find myself doing stuff in it for short stretches of time, I really enjoyed it.Probably not what you're looking for if you're a fan of either of the games referenced in the beginning though, at the very least if you come into this game looking for one of those games you'll be disappointed; I didn't know what to expect, and I like it!

												WowThis game has blown me away. Everything from the theme down to the actual gameplay. I love the music and the look and feel of the game. Really captures that same theme that things like Firefly managed to capture.My main concern when going into this game was knowing that it didnt have full free range 3d movement. You are basically a boat, on a 2d ocean that spans in all directions. (ie: you cant go up or down like in most space sims). Shortly after playing though I realized something. You arent a space pilot in some action game. You are more like a bridge commander. Piloting and combat are more akin to something from the startrek films than being seating in the pilot seat of an X-wing.  Does this work? Yes, it does. Quite well in fact. I quickly stopped caring that I didnt have full 3d range of movement, and found myself just enjoying the ""flow"" of the game. The music is great btw, really helps bring the game to life.Combat is quick, and very ""Edge of your seat"" once you get past the first couple of tutorial battles. Sometimes you have to run. The game doesnt scale stuff to your level, and you often find yourself in over your head. Escape is a viable tactic and meant to be part of the gameplay. Dont worry though, you wont find yourself running often unless you go charging head first into some space pirate zone.The game actually has a LOT more depth to it than I expected it to. The further I played, the more features I discovered. Its so much more than just a funky space combat simulation game. I personally cant wait to play more, and really start diving in to what the game has to offer. Its got me hooked.My only real gripe is how there isnt an option to pull the camera back some during broadside combat. I feel a bit ""boxed in"", which really hinders my combat awareness of things around me. You can find youself crashing head first into things during broadside combat because your field of view is so limited due to how close you are zoomed in to your ship. They really need to add an option to configure the distance you want the camera to be at, or add a toggle that works similar to the camera view distance in a car racing game.The other nice feature that easily goes over looked, is how well this game performs. No performance issues, no GPU or CPU load issues. Overall its a well optomized game. (it could use a few higher quality textures here and there though)So... overall...Do you like space games?Do you like star trek style combat between big ships?Do you enjoy the backwater, wasteland themed style of Firefly?If so, I highly recommend this game.

												Best bang for your buck!  Rebel Galaxy is a game set in space were you fight intense enemies while controlling and maintaining your ship,shields,armor, and weapons. It starts out very simple and even helpes you along in understanding everything while also getting you right into the combat and interesting story line. No spoilers from me :o! But with it being under 20$!? And a game that can have you playing for many hours at a time while enjoying every minute of it. I'm telling you now. If you enjoy space, battles of many different types of enemies, and the every so often rescue of someone in trouble or even killing both of them and taking the loot then you must try this game. Best way i say the game is like is an EVE that wont make you pay monthly to play and one where you still have a life since you dont have to spend days or even months to get the ship you want. Its easy to build up your ship or upgrade it.			"

												I love the soundtrack. The combat is good, though it's easy to lose track of what you're shooting at in the larger battles (there's a lock-on option, but too many buttons to press to get there so I never bothered).The trading part is tricky when the date is not displayed and you have to sort of guess the selling price of an item to sell it anywhere since the market price is ever changing and you have no way of knowing what sells how much, and where to sell.Main storyline is simple, good, but simple. And short.Paid full price. Would pay full price again if they ever did another one. Heard that only 2 people made this game. Would like to tell them they did a good job. Hope the next one they make (if they decide to make it) will be even better.			"

												It was pretty fun, the naval combat/broadsides mechanism was cool, and it's a solid 35 hours of gameplay, but it doesn't have tons of replay value and once you've hit endgame content, it stops being particularly difficult. You basically only die at that point if you get completely surrounded, your engines get disabled, and you're outnumbered 25 to 1. Which does happen, but not often. One on one, you'll wreck absolutely every ship in the game without really trying once you're running Mk6 everything.There's still a handful of annoying bugs, but the developer's fixing them very quickly and they're being super-responsive to bug reports.

TL;DR: A solid, arcade space privateer game that'll scratch the itch of many a space cowboy out there, complete with excellent music to fit the theme. Fans of space games (or Firefly) may find a charmer right here for a price that wont break your wallet too hard.+ Solid gameplay mechanics and progression that'll keep you busy for hours, having fun being your own space captain. Solid combat (deflector shield = timed block, broadside ship combat), calming (if flashy) mining, and cutthroat trading are all here. Be a Han Solo, or a Boba Fett, or more.+ Quirky singleplayer storyline, but as with an open-space game like this, you can easily ignore it and go your own way. Think Skyrim + Space Cowboy and you're not far off.+ Colorful and unique art direction for environments, ships, and characters that you meet. Ships and weapons have clear design lines they follow. Enemies are color-coded for easy identification. Space is colorful and interesting to look at. Damage on ships is well-rendered, complete with breaches in the hull, burning, and metal skeletal remains in impact holes. Weapons are visually impactful, and can be clearly discerned in the heat of combat.+ Characters you meet have a lot to say, voice-acted too, complete wtih unique alien languages to boot!+ Excellent ""cowboy"" music that sets the mood perfectly, firing at the perfect time. Crescendos with the right track for high-intensity combat. Drops it down to a mellow tule when in station. A forlorn tune for when travelling. Its perfect, and when you dont like it, there's support for inserting your own!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Camera is too zoomed in. Its difficult to keep situational awareness when the camera zooms so far in you cant see your entire ship anymore, let alone whats immediately around it.- Game's graphical fidelity with texture quality is a bit lackluster in places. Character fidelity is serviceable, whilst lip syncing is a bit off.- Space travel and combat is exclusively 2D in nature.- Minor problems here and there (the odd V/O line thats not volume-balanced, odd UI design choices, etc) detract from the game little by little. Take for example the UI display for shields and hull plating. They fade as they take more damage, when it would make more sense for them to work like bars taht decrease in size the more damaged they are to make the information more clear to the player. The default E key is used for far too many things. Default bindings may be a bit off-putting for some folk, like mistaking Secondary Fire (Shift) for Deflectors (Space) in the heat of battle. Very distinct (if not difficulty-spiking) power gaps between upgrades on equipment and ships and enemies in general. Things of that nature.- Default music may not be to the taste of some.- No multiplayer support.			"

												tl;dr: If you loved Freelancer, Starpoint Gemini 2, or any of the 2D/top-down ""open world"" space combat/mining/trading games, buy this immediately.I never write reviews, but man, this game. This game hits way out of its weight class. Watch the trailers, listen to the music - the whole soundtrack is that awesome, and they match tracks to gameplay so darn well. The characters, the music, the ships - the whole vibe fits right alongside Firefly or Cowboy Bebop.But how about gameplay?This game is darn near everything that I loved about Freelancer - open choices about alignment, how you wish to accumulate wealth (with net worth being the best equivalent to RPG ""level""), and so many over-the-top, very expensive upgrades available beyond what's needed to ""finish"" the game that's any space grinder's paradise.It only deviates from that mold on three critical points, by order of significance:1) Combat is dramatically different.  This is not, and does not pretend to be, a dogfighting/piloting simulation. There is nothing that approaches ""real"" inertia. You have two axes of freedom (yaw and velocity front-to-back), not six. In that respect, think of it like SPAZ or other 2D space games, but with phenomenal graphics. This game is 2.5D, not 3D.But it works. Combat is less adrenaline-fueled flips and rolls, and more stately dance of large ships, where positioning far outstrips reflexes - half way between something twitchy like Elite: Dangerous and point-and-click orders of EVE Online. Everything you fly is a ""capital ship"" and mostly behaves like one. (That's not to say there aren't plenty of size class upgrades - you could double-park your starting ship in the exhaust ports of some of the larger ones.) This plays more like AC: Black Flag's naval battles, in that your biggest (and manually controlled) weapons are mounted broadside, so this is big ships barrelling up side-by-side to blast the hell out of each other.  In an interesting conceit, fighters are given 3D flight capabilities and can fly over and under you, while capital ships (you and AI) are stuck on a 2D field - 3D flight is there, just for the annoying gnats that you don't fly.So combat can take a while, and it'll feel dull to the adrenaline junkies, but it's just the right mellow level of exciting for the person who finds RPG combat exciting and laments their survival skills in FPS deathmatches against all the coked-up squirrels who make your reflexes look like dial-up latency. (So... me.)2) The world is just plain smaller. Systems are bigger, but there's only about a dozen of them. There aren't a whole lot of factions or terribly interesting power dynamics between factions. But you know what? This wasn't a $50 or $60 game. I felt like there was a totally reasonable, if not Freelancer-scale, level of world available to be for the price tag. Should they ever decide to DLC in more content, I'll be first in line: it would be a better game for it, and completely reasonable to come with an additional price tag, given what the base game sells for.3) No multiplayer (or the accompanying dedicated server). This one's a bummer, as the only thing I like more than this genre is this genre with friends, but that's a big jump in development complexity for a budget title. So it doesn't feel like a glaring omission or a developer shortcoming (and indeed, leaving it out of scope is better than a broken implementation), but I would love to see a Rebel Galaxy 2 with full multiplayer support Freelancer style.Otherwise, this thing is dreamy. Every time I find an annoyance in this game, it's because the level of graphical polish, voice acting, and audio design fool me into thinking I'm playing a big-budget AAA title. Then I remember the price tag, and I'm again floored how hard this game hits for its budget.			"

												this game is decent.  it has pretty good rpg elements with all the ship upgrades.  the combat is a little odd with the broadside weapons, but you get used to it.  the diffculty progression is pretty good as well.  if areas are too hard, upgrading your ship can help you to get through them.  actually, achieving the ships and upgrades were the funnest part of the game for me.   the story line is a little short.  i completed it in about 34 hours.  i could have done that quicker, but i opted to get the biggest ship before completing the final mission.  you can keep playing after you complete the story line, but there really isnt more to acheive or more content to experience.  get it while its on sale. its deffinately worth $10.

												It's like Firefly meets Freelancer. Yes, you cannot move on the vertical axis, but that helps focus the action around your big, lumbering ship. Fights are beautiful and chaotic, punctuated by alerts from your ships friendly AI voice. The missions can be a little repetitive, but it seems like there are lots of different ships to buy, oodles of parts to upgrade, and many different factions to assist or annoy. Overall, a polished and enjoyable game that can make you feel like Admirals Adama or Ackbar.			"

It's very polished looking. The only reason I know it's an ""Indie"" title is because of the other reviews. It's a solid production. Pretty fun so far = If you go into it realizing that for $9.99 you could get a six pack or good beer or a movie ticket for a 2 hours show, the value is apparent. I'm happy with the purchase and I've just scratched the surface.

												Very good game in a genre that has some terrible games. If you like an open world , spaceships with some good variety, good combat and not overwhelming to learn and get comfoirtable with then this is your game. Some space games are just very complicated or difficult I liked the fact that the combat was sort of like being in a boat with broadside combat. You dont have to worry about adjusting your height and just worry about direction and distance. You can also do the trading and mining thing to gain power but that gameplay is not for me. Mining is dull in my opinion.It's light on story and background info but that is fine with me. The graphics are good, sound effects good, music excellent, voice acting good but limited. Solid game all around, worth the price. no brainer if on sale. Pick it up.			"

												So yeah, Not sure what to say here. The game ended so suddenly I wasn't sure how to feel about it. Its fun enough, but very repetitive. I felt like I was mising a large chunk of the game by the end of it. Like there was so much more I could have done. I visited maybe 3-4 of the systems long term, and the rest were either pass through or never even visited. None of it felt needed, or for that matter wanted. The ship progression as well was very pointless by the end. Once you have type 6 armor, shields and deflectors you can use any ship and have pretty much no issue. Take a light Frigate up against an ace super battleship? No problem, they will never get through your shields.I stopped caring about a better ship once I got the McKenley. It pretty much shreaded everything with type 6 neutron beams and mining lasers, but dear god was it slow.All in all - Meh. Its fun, I need a meh button to rate this game with, but for now I will just thumbs up it as it was good enough I felt I got my monies worth.			"

Incredible beatufil graphics, low system requirements(my gpu burned out so I'm playing this on a GT630 on max settings without AA), very few minor bugs that are crushed by the devs with ultra light speed (I had an issue with my ship, I posted the bug, the dev req. the save, I provided, in 30 min the dev sent a modified save my way and posted that the fix will be in the next patch).If you enjoyed : Starpoint Gemini 2, Space rangers 2, X3, X2, Freelancer, Homeworld, Sins of a solar empire, etc.... aka good quality, gorgeous space games, this is a game that can stand beside them in feeling and level of detail. Also it's f___ing AMAZING that the main team is made out of 2 TWO developers. Incredible. This game is almost AAA quality. First time I see such a great game launched by an indie team.The game is on a niche of it's own. Not many like this, although a little similarity with Starpoint Gemini 2.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS AT FULL PRICE.			"

												The game is not very good. There is a lot of interesting stuff happening from the open world missions to some of the RPG dialogue, but the dialog is about the only thing rpg like.  I might keep playing to try the bigger ships, but combat really isn't fun, you sit in your big ship and chase around smaller fighters with your turrets while waiting for an opportunity to broadside the bigger ships.  There will be damage reported to your ship but hard to tell what it actually means, until you blow up.  Flying makes getting between missions a bit of a bore.			"

												Having grown up on games like Decent: Freespace, Freelancer, EVE online, X3, etc. A bountying hunting/trading/spacesim that only occupies a single plane of flight is just weird. It doesnt feel right at all, all this space, and I can only navigate left or right? No up or down.Trading was so-so, once you get a good method down, you just rake money in. Got boring real fast. If you are a die-hard space-sim fan, I wouldnt recommend this game at all. It doesnt really feel like one at all.			"

												I freakinglooooooooovethis game's music.It feels so badass. I can't get bored of it :D----------------------The first assasin's creed I played was Black Flag. I loved that game and played it for hours and hours.It convinced me to get the rest of the series, so I bought one and two. I was about to buy AC3, but then I thought ""pace yourself, dude""Then I was muddling through civilians, looking for a yellow dude.Then I was slowly walking through a city.Then I was riding a horse.Then muddling through crowds again.And then it hit me. It was the ship that was the fun part.This game takes quite a few pointers from that game, but retains enough of its own to feel relatable, but different.Missions are a bit repetitive if all you're doing are bounties, but it changes up when you enter a new system.Now. Two things I really liked about this game were:1- It's not another freaking roguelike, and no permadeath if you didn't save. You'll lose all progress from when you last docked, tho, so keep that in mind. If you can dock, dock.2- Your equipment costs as much when you sell it as when you buy it, so you can swap equipment and experiment without having to fear losing money. Which means that finding a weapon in a crate is always great, no matter if it's usable or not.Anyway. I tend to like more the in-cockpit space shooters, but those have the really annoying tendency to make enemies turn circles with you.Oh yeah. Did I mention that your turrets fire automatically, but can be aimed manually? that's good stuff.Oh man. This music.			"

												It's what the first Starpoint Gemini would have been if it wasn't developed by slav♥♥♥♥♥, but with a spaghetti-western twang to it.This is NOTHING AT ALL LIKE FREELANCER.This game is NOTHING AT ALL LIKE ANYTHING IN ASASSIN\'S CREED.This game is NOTHING LIKE COWBOY BEBOP OR FIREFLY... it just has a couple tracks featuring a guitar --- ooooooooooh that's firefly! ooooooooooooh ride my hype-stick ooooooooooooh space cowboys - no... just no... it's Starpoint Gemini with a country track in the mix.Do not ride people's hype trains, because actual flavors of what people hype up like that simply don't exist.Which all-in-all is very very sad because this game has a lot of good things going for it that stand out on it's own without being lumped into incredibly vauge and generalized references... just don't expect as much as people are claiming is there, because again, it simply isn't. GAMEPLAY:Quick. Don't expect tonnes of hours unless you force yourself to drag the game out.Fun. Really fun - I couldn't put it down for the first few days (then I beat the story and stopped caring because I had the best ship and gear, period)Equally proffitable to trade or fight your way up (I got lucky abnd kept finding clouds of things called ""face of gozu"" so my fight-intended gameplay did turn to occasional crude mining to leap forward in the game FAST)All of the exact flippin' same mechanics from Starpoint Gemini, meaning the whole game takes place on a two-dimensional plane... in space...CONS:Well I honestly hate how much like the first Starpoint Gemini it is. It's often distracting, and I had PTSD-like flashbacks of the most horrible russian voice acting you could possibly imagine...The story is... terribad. I didn't care... I just COULD NOT care about anything that was happening and everyone and their dog all looked like either targets or speed-bumps in my pursuit to become the biggest, baddest mo-fo in space.Only need one possible conversation choice ever: ""Get behind me, meat-pop, and watch how it's done.""I didn't even get interested until, I kid you not, the very very end where the AI you are hauling around starts to actually BE a flippin CHARACTER present in the nearly non-existant plot line. Not enough ships.After the storyine ends, if you have the biggest and best like I did by that time, the game becomes quite literally - pointless. When you DO reach that point, you are so OP, no fleet generated to fight you can take you down unless you get jumped while taking an afk dump.Comparing this to Freelancer is a huge insult to Freelancer and Chris Roberts - whoever does that owes Mr. Roberts an apology. Freelancer is a benchmark standard in space-traders/space-sandboxes... and this DOES NOT meet par with Freelancer on any grounds of reasoning.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY: Because when you get rid of the slimy hype that would otherwise leave you dissappointed in not getting what was so highly promised in praise - it's a kick♥♥♥♥♥space trader that lets you roam around in a rather large sandbox and blow the crap out of nearly everything in sight.It's very simplistic and very easy to learn and master, and is also controller compatable - though KBM is best for this game.Overall I give it 7/10 - best to wait and get it when it's on sale. Cheap.			"

												Pretty fun to start, and an enjoyable take on space combat - with similarities to naval battles (broadside cannons being a big focus).Unfortunately, the story is entirely uninteresting and there isn't much content to the game except for a grind.  The grind doesn't lead anywhere interesting, either.  Ultimately, the game doesn't have much depth.			"

												It has a firefly theme to it (the music especially). Which is awesome.Game plays on a 2D plane. You basically fly around doing missions (basically kill missions, or fly into a bunch of guys and take something and leave while they try to kill you missions). As you fly around you get blockaded by enemies who you have to fly through/around to get back to warp. As you fly around you also run into distress beacons you can go to and either fall into a trap or come to someone's aid while they are getting killed.Basically killing is the only real solution to anything in this game. I think that's it's major weakness.The commodities market is pretty lame. You can only put a few things in your holds and most stores never sell enough of anything to fill your holds to do proper buy/sell trading. And even if they did, it's almost never going to be all of the good stuff with a good price. Otherwise this system could be pretty fun if it was balanced and actually changed with supply/demand. All in all it's fun for a while. Then it gets grindy. Then it gets really grindy. Then you use cheats and give yourself all the money you want. Then you go out and realize there's nothing else to the game and you quit. If you can get this for $5, I'd buy it for some over simplified naval combat in space with the firefly theme to it. But while this game engine is good enough for some pretty awesome gameplay....sadly, it is pretty void of good content.Almost great. "

												THE GOOD:This is a game that is visually beautiful, with great graphics and sound.  For instance, the details on damage your hull takes is, for lack of a better word, gorgeous.  High production values all around.THE BAD:Wow, I just can't get into the gameplay at ALL.  Take all the parts that aren't fun about World of Warcraft, and combine them with all the parts that aren't fun about X3: Reunion.  -Shallow RPG elements.  Shallow dialogue choices.  Shallow, linear plotline buried in a sandbox game.-An ""open world sandbox"" that is mostly empty, and is in TWO dimensions.  (This is a space game.)  -Grinding the same bounty quests over and over for money for upgrades.   -Combat is similar to space battles in Star Trek Online, but shallower, with less strategy and fewer options.  I kept wishing for the officer abilities of STO to give it some variance.-3/4th of the enemy you face are starfighters, which you have to bat away with your turrets. Fighters move in three dimensions; you do not.  To help you hit them, your reticule locks onto them and follows them around.  So you're pretty much just flying in a circle and holding down the fire button.  Against 3/4 of the enemies you face.-Oh, and by the way, you know that cool ""Evil Ways"" song in the preview movie on the store page?  Well, you'll think it's alot less cool when you start playing because that song (in rotation with perhaps two others) is your constant companion as you amble around the universe looking for mobs to grind. THE VERDICT:Dull.  There isn't much more to this game than the combat, and I can tell the combat is supposed to feel a lot more exciting than it does.  When you streamline something to a certain degree, it moves past ""stream-lined"" and ventures into the dangerous realm of ""dumbed-down.""  The combat feels dumbed-down, the trading feels dumbed-down, and the RPG elements feel dumbed-down. After playing for about an hour and a half, all I want to do is reinstall X3 so I can play a game that does all of these elements correctly.  Glad I got this at a discount, but I still wish I could take this purchase back.			"

												Good game for the money with some major drawbacks.Pros:- Great atmosphere- Enjoyable Costumization- Enjoyable Fights but (see cons)- Good difficulty balance- Nice random events but (see cons)- Great soundtrack- Beautiful universe and ship design Cons:-Fights get stale fast and are in terms of tactical depthness pretty bleak after a short while. Enemys get spawned in around you which is a huge letdown. The fighst needed features like e.x. Take cover behind asteroids to avoid incoming fire from enemy, Take cover behind enemy ships to avoid fire. Maybe features like cloaking (you can detect every ship with a simples can, th game needs a system like world of warships), sideway boosts or big space battles with way more ships but a tactical feature to command and order friendly ships to win battles. (stop the game like the scannermode give us a overview and command features)- Market system is to simple after a while and it should add new goods if you get to new systems or have individual goods that you can sell in different systems and more economical possibilitys.- Random events like distress calls or bountys are great but two features get boring pretty fast- Events on planets have a good impact on the econemy features but some events don't effect the prices as much as they should in my opinion. - Rewards for e.x. destroying big battleships or pirate kings are inconsistent and don't scale properly- And last but not least my most important complain:The missions are too similar and there are only a handful of Story missions. The pretext of the Mainstory is good but it feels like the WHOLE CAMPAIGN should be only the FIRST CHAPTER of the whole story unfolding. Everything feels impersonal. You are traveling space for years and you have interaction with 4 notacible Characters in the whole game if you count all mercenarys as one character of interest.I'm aware that this is a fairly small project from a very small developer team but the wasted potential on this game is making my head spin. So for now, as regrettable as it is, I can't wholeheartly recommend for you to buy this game.			"

												This story is not 30-40 hours to complete -.- takes maybe a max of ten.   I would love to see more difficult missions, currently the ship I am in has no threat to it which would be nice to see if you ever get around to introducing more content.  Overall the game is very pretty but the story is very dry in terms of content.   The ending just feels like a scavanger hunt and the final battle can be won without having to fire a shot of your own.   Overall I love the game but would greatly appreciate some more endgame things to go explore or fights similar in strength to the end boss.  I am recomending it because I love the game to death.			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

Posted: December 20, 2015
												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

												This is yet another game where I wish I could give a middle rank, neither a yes or a no, but a ""meh"" rating too, however since the game is cheap, and has very good production values, and is fun for a little while, Ill give it the up vote.Anyway, you can watch some videos to see what kind of game this is about, however, Ill just get into some of my gripes with the game design.Some minor issues that annoy me:1.  Missions are over scripted and in a way are not realistic.  For example, every time you have do a trade-guild mission to ship some specific cagro from point A to B, you will ALWAYS be intercepted.  There is ALWAYs trouble.   Now if this were the only problem, I could overlook this.  The actual problem is that the REAL trade mission is to actually destroy the guys who intercept you.  Case and point, I took a very lucrative delivery mission that took place in  the same system.  It was rated as HIGH risk.   I figued I could run away.  My mission is to deliver something, not kill things?  RIght?  Oh no, quite wrong.   So I am getting close to the station I need to make my delivery to, and as usual, the trap is sprung and a bunch of ships appear from all directions and they pull you out of ""warp"".    So what do I do? I escape, I use my after burners and get enough distance and jump back into warp.  I make it like 5 clicks and the same trap happens again.  I do this 2 more times and each time the trap is reset and sprung again which is just terrible game design.  The only solution is to kill the ambush.  All mission types that are not supposed to be directly about combat workout the same way.2.  You can have missles as weapons, the problem with them is that you do not have a lot of ammo, which makes sense.  However, if you are an NPC, then you have infinite ammo.  I once had a ship that shot waves of missiles the killed my engines.  The didn't do any damage to my ship or shields, but I couldn't move.  It just sat there for like 10 minutes keeping me pinned.  I had to Alt-F4 to recover because if you exit normally, it would save your game and I would have been stuck forever.3.  No quick save.Ok, enough of the small sutff.  Why did I stop playing this game without finishing the main story?  What is the big thing that is wrong with the game design?Basically it is repetivie and boring.  Combat is boring.  Flying around in space warping everwhere is boring.  Each star system is randomly generated, but they are all very generic and you can't really tell the difference other than this sone might have a yellow sun and the other one has a blue sun.   There is nothing to explore or find.  Its all the same, everywhere.Now maybe if you LOVE space games you may get a lot more milage out of it then I did, but after about 20 hours the game felt more like work then fun.			"

												Purchased on a lark and was suprised by the game's quality. Broadside space combat, mining & trading all take place with an overall ""western"" theme. The soundtrack is catchy and sounds great. The game can get repetitve but the core conecepts are fun enough to have anyone coming back for more. As an added note since I've seen some reviewers upset by the concept of the game: the game takes place in 3D space but you are fixed to a 2D plane, while this may sound lame for a space shooter it still feels like a lot of fun in its execution.

												Open world Space Pirate/Trader RPG! Which will you chose? You can be a trader, fighter or a mix. The music is fantastic and dead on for this type of game. The voice acting, graphics and game play are all great and help deliver a fun and entertaining game play experience. It's linear and has no up or down movement, but it works and in a time when the industry is all about freedom of movement in games it is not needed in this game and is not missed. You can tell the game has heavily drawn from TV show Firefly. Shiny!			"

												I bought this on a whim yesterday after seeing it available, probably one of the better purchases I've made recently. The gameplay is simple but feels rewarding and the challenges scale well when upgrading and buying new ships and equipment. Story seems to be balanced so far and between side missions, bounties and the occasional mining mission Rebel Galaxy ticks all the right boxes for a fun, 'don't take me serious' space-ship shooter.I would reccomend this to those who like their sci-fi, space shooters and ELITE/EVE: Online (esque) mechanics, albeit in a simplified form.

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a light hearted space sim, borrowing ideas from games such as Sid Mier's Pirates! and others. Graphically styled like Galaxy on Fire and Torchlight, it's a pretty game that runs smoothly other than when using the warp gate (no big issue really, they're used infrequently). Controls work nicely with both mouse/KB or controller. The game offers plenty of ship customisation, do you want to be a ship of the line with massive broadsides? Or perhaps a gunboat bristling with turrets? Maybe you want to long-haul goods across the system? Heaps of options for you to try out.My only real negatives so far;1) Not enough music, the music in the game is AMAZING, but the sound track needs to be a little longer I think2) Stop dropping me out of super-cruise etc when near asteroids etc, if I can visually plot a safe way through a field, then let me. :DSeriously though, this game is amazing value for $18, if you like space sim-lite, this is your game, or just want to blow up ships across the galaxy, look no futher.9/10, definately recomend.

												This story is not 30-40 hours to complete -.- takes maybe a max of ten.   I would love to see more difficult missions, currently the ship I am in has no threat to it which would be nice to see if you ever get around to introducing more content.  Overall the game is very pretty but the story is very dry in terms of content.   The ending just feels like a scavanger hunt and the final battle can be won without having to fire a shot of your own.   Overall I love the game but would greatly appreciate some more endgame things to go explore or fights similar in strength to the end boss.  I am recomending it because I love the game to death.			"

												Definitely fun, I won't lie. It has interesting mechanics until you get to know them, at which time, it can make even the more difficult battles a bit trivial. I also think the mid-game suffers a bit. Running around just to get money in order to rank up weapons, defenses and components was perhaps the most boring part of the game. I did like the story, though and it was fun finishing things up. It's a great game for flying around and shooting down space pirates... or being a space pirate yourself.  :)			"

Posted: December 20, 2015
												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

												After playing several hours of this game I can say without a doubt, Rebel Galaxy is AMAZING. *It's the perfect blend of action packed navel combat with dynamic trade economy. If you thought X was an interesting concept, but though that the gameplay felt like doing spread sheets in a 3D shooting gallery, then look no further, Rebel Galaxy is your game. *The combat is fun and easy to pick up, with its Black Flag style broadside combat, but has alot of depth and strategy aswell. I found that a fast frigate could out do a powerful, lumbering dreadknoght with speed and manuverability, or that using your ship's suppior broadside's range could keep you out of harms way. *The economy is dynamic and interesting but not overly complicated ""cough cough X!"" and scoping out trade roughts in the games massive, proceduraly generated universe was alot of fun.*The style was another big draw with it's awesome southern rock/blues/country soundtrack and it's wild west, bad-side of town vibe. Not to mention, the ship models are fantastic!*The game also has alot of choice for missions and encounters. Do you help the pirates take down the merchant for a haul of loot, or do you take a stand and protect the merchant to increase your reputation with the citizens?*And finnaly, the devs are great. They're helpful and dedicated and constantly patching the game and listening to the communityIn the end, Rebel Galaxy is a terrific, deep space, swashbuckling adventure sure to keep you flyin' for along time.

I'm more concerned with the quality of content and this does that very well.  It is not a AAA but if they had dumped the money and time into it -- it could have been.It is worth the $20 all day and if it is on sale and you don't buy it as a SciFi fan well then you're just silly.Babylon 5 style ships mixed with a Firefly feel?

												Love being a space cowboy in Rebel Galaxy, it just feels good to fly around and fight other ships! Graphics are amazing even on my mid-level system, my jaw dropped when I first loaded up the game. My laptop has a hard time running it though.Great pacing, lots of things to do; explore the solar systems, smuggle cargo between space stations, start fights with space pirates and steal their cargo, sell loot and upgrade your weapons...buy a new ship once you've saved up enough.I also like how you can customize your ship to fit different playstyles, there's no wrong answer, combat always feels intense and rewarding. Outfit long range cannons and missles to snipe opponents from afar, for medium range fightfights use blaster turrets and rockets, or cover your ship in lasers to cut ships apart up close! You also get to pick whether you prefer a huge tank-like ship or a sleek corvette, customize your speed and durability based on your play style. There are no levels, the more money you make the better ships and equipment you can afford, so buy trade items low, stock your hold with valuables, and sell to the buyers offering the most at the commodity markets at the space stations.One other thing I love is the music. Not only does it come with great music by default, you can use your own MP3 collection, and it will change songs for Ambient, Combat, Idle, Menu, and Space Station. So I made folders for each music type, copied songs that fit the mood into the folders, and added those folders to the game's music library. So when I'm cruising through space I can enjoy some low key Beck and Radiohead, but when a fight breaks out the game will start blasting Green Day or the Klaxons!Buy it! Don't even hesitate, don't even worry, don't even give it a second thought.			"

												I've only put a few hours into this game so far, and I'm enjoying it immensely. Broadly, Rebel Galaxy reminds me of a mashup of the Assassin's Creed series, World of Warships, and good old Freelancer. The former because the way that the map and locations work (markers and missions within the system map), the second because of the similar broadside naval combat mechanic (which, given the lack of a traversable Z axis [for simplicity's sake] in the game, works surprisingly well), and the latter because...well, you fly around in space and do whatever you want for a career.Rebel Galaxy is very smooth. Everything looks wonderful, the theme music and some of the game's feel are obvious homages to Firefly and Serenity, but the overall experience is pretty fresh. While the exploration and side mission elements of gameplay can get redundant (see Assassin's Creed), the constantly evolving state of your own ship keep things fairly interesting. The difficulty curve can be a little intense. Like AC, this is forgiven somewhat because the game autosaves every time you leave dock, but there are a number of bloody lessons to be learned early on while you learn how to poke around the galaxy without dying with some frequency.Combat mechanics are very nifty. In addition to hired help and the already highlighted broadside combat system, turrets, auxiliary weapons, and various modules help keep combat pretty fresh and interesting. Plus it all looks very pretty, and blowing up pirate capital ships is viscerally satisfying in a way that Eve never accomplished.Very, very recommendable to fans of any of the above listed titles (disparate though they may seem), as long as you dig things in space. A great, sandboxy capital ship combat game that really WORKS, unlike so many halfhearted efforts.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a light hearted space sim, borrowing ideas from games such as Sid Mier's Pirates! and others. Graphically styled like Galaxy on Fire and Torchlight, it's a pretty game that runs smoothly other than when using the warp gate (no big issue really, they're used infrequently). Controls work nicely with both mouse/KB or controller. The game offers plenty of ship customisation, do you want to be a ship of the line with massive broadsides? Or perhaps a gunboat bristling with turrets? Maybe you want to long-haul goods across the system? Heaps of options for you to try out.My only real negatives so far;1) Not enough music, the music in the game is AMAZING, but the sound track needs to be a little longer I think2) Stop dropping me out of super-cruise etc when near asteroids etc, if I can visually plot a safe way through a field, then let me. :DSeriously though, this game is amazing value for $18, if you like space sim-lite, this is your game, or just want to blow up ships across the galaxy, look no futher.9/10, definately recomend.

												It's a fun little space game. It's no replacement for freelancer, but pretty fun. You can only pilot the lager ships and they are rather limited. The bloom and lens flare can be a tad too high at times. And large ships can't fly along the z-axis. Still looks nice. For the price I would recommend this game, but be caution this is a budget game and it shows. Combat is fun and simple. Works with the steam controller. 7/10			"

												Definitely fun, I won't lie. It has interesting mechanics until you get to know them, at which time, it can make even the more difficult battles a bit trivial. I also think the mid-game suffers a bit. Running around just to get money in order to rank up weapons, defenses and components was perhaps the most boring part of the game. I did like the story, though and it was fun finishing things up. It's a great game for flying around and shooting down space pirates... or being a space pirate yourself.  :)			"

												Very easy to get into, casual to play, with enough depth to keep you interested and keep coming back for more. I found the game mechanics to make sense, the controls easy enough to figure out with explanations  what controls do what in the menu. This isn't Elite Dangerous or something hardcore and it's not meant to be. As example, to keep the fighting engaging and keep tactics interesting, the game employs an old style sailing ships battling by broadsides method of combat. I've read some reviews noting this as a bad or lazy mechanism... I found it wonderfully engaging and allowing battles to feel epic. I'm able to pick the game up after weeks of not playing and jump right in. Fun times! The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic to boot.			"

												Recommended for the $18 I paid for it, probably nothing more... maybe $20:+Great soundtrack - gives it the Firefly feeling+Combat is fun enough+Different variety of ships to choose from+Voice acting is great, especially compared to Starpoint Gemini 2-Post-campaign is lackluster - Dreadnought class wrecks anything within two beam broadsides-Trading is weird. Traders offer to give you an item for 5k while they offer to buy the same item at 9k. Wat-Story is super bland - EVERYONE is forgettable; even the last boss is forgettable as I neutroned his♥♥♥♥♥into oblivion with barely any hull damage.You control your ship on a 2D plane while the non-capital ships have 3D movement. Feels like AssCreed Black Flag naval combat in space - could be a negative for some but nevertheless, still fun.tl;dr: Not GOTY content, but enjoyable at the pricepoint - realistically can enjoy it for about a week before moving onto something else			"

												I never write reviews, and I only do so for games that I think are that much fun, that I need to tell everyone!Rebel Galaxy is a weird thing, it combines ""naval"" combat with space ships and quite some options to (role) play the game.The combat, is in one word, different. You fly in 2D space, as the rest of the capital ships do, and only the lighter fighters are able to fly everywhere, but you only fly capital ships.If you want someone to explain on how you should tackle the combat in this game, then dont read this, I think you should totally find that out yourself. There are some really powerfull combinations but almost everything works together if you set it up logically.In ways how to play the game, there are different factions. the Citizens are what the name says, these people just want to live and inhabit most of the stations.The Militia are a military 'police' faction, taking down pirates but also stopping illegal trading.The Merchant Guild and Mercenaries Guild are a thing of their own. The Merchants are traders and specialize in getting cargo through the system. You can join them if you want to focus on trading with stations, because the trading and goods system in this game is quite fleshed out!The Mercenaries supply contracts to you if you join them, also giving you access to better equipment, like most factions do in the game when you join them. They work with and against everyone, its up to you what you choose.Then there are quite alot of Pirate and Raider factions, you'll meet the Red Devils and Double Jack's first, and you can join them if you play your missions right and work against their enemies, though all of them start out hostile to you.There is alot more to tell, but you can find it out for yourself. I still havent beat the main story, as i'm to busy working for my chosen faction, which is alot of fun.If you can get this on sale, defenitely get it, otherwise its still a pretty good deal!			"

												Basically, my few complaints with this game are the same as those for Interplanetary: Everything is pretty much restricted to the 2D ecliptic, even the fighter-class craft don't wander very far above or below that, certainly not outside of a good weapon's range. I mean, what if I don't feel like having to fly around three planets just so I don't get kicked out of warp? Why shouldn't we be able to run a few hundred thousand kliks above or below the orbital plane? Also, the time scale is apparently vastly inflated, but none of the orbital objects in any system move in relation to anything else. I understand the necessity of keeping the jumpgates in specific places, but planets should move. The perfectly circular assumed orbits are unrealistic and unnecessary. Lastly, I would love to be able to hail a militia vessel to actively turn over contraband cargo I may have picked up, in exchange for a +1 to Militia relations instead of having them discover it on your ship and attempting to confiscate it for -4 to relations.   That said, the game really is a treat to play. The light effects I thought were especially good, the control scheme is nicely ergonomic, and the space combat is pretty exciting. The campaign missions had a  rather interesting plot, but I went through them in fewer than fifty hours, and I did A LOT of side missions so I had really good equipment. I would really like to see more missions in the story. If you remember Privateer fondly, you might also like Rebel Galaxy.			"

												The gameplay is nice, graphics are nice, definitly a recommended buy! However, it does seem to be lacking a bit in content after playing it through, as I felt the factions you could choose to side with in the game definitly could have had some more faction specific ships, weapons, engines etc. I understand that the reason for this is that the development team was small and it didnt really bother me in my first playthrough, sadly it did take away some of the replay value.

												I was on the fence about a 2D space combat game, but having played it it's a fun game.It has some problems, the control system seems to be based around a gamepad so there are a few limitations on the UI that wouldn't otherwise be there. There are also some curious design decisions like being unable to access your cargohold/factions list/tactical menu etc while docked.There is no RPGesque character development, the only limitation on what ship/equipment you can use seems to be money and to a lesser extent faction.The combat in the game is fun. There is a large variety of equipment available to outfit your ship in order to compliment your playstyle. For instance you can gear your ship up for long range sniping, close range, and even fitting special deflector shields in order to cause extra damage ramming into other ships. In general the combat seems very well thought out.On the other hand the trading and mining feel a bit lacklustre. Mining, even with the ""perfect"" mining setup is haphazard and rarely nets you anywhere near the amount of money combat would in the same amount of time. Trading seems too random in that it's very hard to charge what good will be worth more at any given station. I freely admit though I haven't spent a lot of time trading, so it's very possible that if I invested more time in it I'd understand the system more.I've read complaints about the save system. It's a standard autosave only game, and the autosave only takes place when you dock. This means that if you pick up 3 missions, complete 2 and then die in the 3rd one you'll lose all that progress. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing as you just weigh up the risk and dock if necessary to save.The soundtrack in the game is...interesting. I kind of liked it at first, but it becomes very repetitive after a couple of hours. However, using the launcher you can easily add your own music.In summary this game is definately worth picking up if you enjoy space action games.			"

												Over all I like this game. It is a fun combat focused game. the brodside style is great but can make it a little challenging in the belts with all the rocks you can run into while looking to the side. The voice acting is ok and sounds like your dealing with folk living in the backside of creation, does remind one alittle of Firefly. Though there could be more of it and more variety.  That said the game feels a little flat for an open world style game. Some things are missing that other open world games have, ie the Elder Scrolls series.   Other than the main story line there is nothing to do except the mission boards and get credits for your next upgrade. You can join the guilds but the only reason to is for the gear that only they have. There should be guild specific storylines, as in other open world games, with thier own consequences and rewards (not just creds but uniqe gear as well) to make it worth your time to join.  I enjoy playing this game. But would like to see some DLC's or mod's come out to fix these little flaws. All in all thumbs up.   I have now finished the game and got all achivements. The torpedo's shot down took the longest (killed the little guy's then circled the leviathon just out of gun range in projectile turet mode for ever).   I still like this game but I'm sad it is so short.			"

You fly a ship (you can upgrade and buy bigger better ships, different classes and styles for different play styles) there isn't a real difficulty, the game is only as hard as you make it. Make money, blow stuff up, do some side missions if you want. Pros:Big maps, lots of exploringRandom events that change aspects of the gameEngaging combatTHE SOUNDTRACKAgain: THE SOUNDTRACK.Lasers and suchPotential replay value (the maps are randomly generated based on star maps)Controller supportCons: Enemy Variety is limited to the area you're inShips are a bit expensive, but they *ARE* spaceships, they're not cheap.You'll spend a lot of time going from place to place, afterall space is a big place. Combat for the ships is limited to 2D (No up and down, strictly left, right, and forward. this does help with using cannonry )No options menu in-gameI am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar!  "

												Summary: This is a nice, action-ladden space opera. Decent presentation, virtually bug-free and quite a lot of fun for many hours.Further Info:Think of Starpoint Gemini 2 done right. It has nice (albeit cheesy) music, pretty nebulas and explosions and Laser Beams. Like, a lot of beams. And missiles. There are a lot of spaceships that you can customize with different type of weapons to accomodate your game style. Whether you prefer to attack from afar or get in melee (including ramming), there is the right equipment for you.So if you like to blow up spaceships of all kinds, this is your game. However, if you like a realistic space sim, stay away from it. There is nothing realistic in Rebel Galaxy. Flight physics are very basic and very forgiving. Space in the game is only 2D, at least for you. There are objects and enemy fighters that can fly above or below you, but you cannot. To me, this is a great design choice. But this means that you will not really do any dog fighting. Instead, combat feels like seaships battling with the sea removed. This impression is supported by the fact that ships in Rebel Galaxy have their most powerful weapons mounted at their sides and not the front.And by the way. While you can mine in this game and trade, you will likely spend most of your time blowing up spaceships. Mainly because mining and trading is very rougly implemented. I guess, if you make a space opera, you have to allow people to mine and trade. Because people expect it to be there. Even if it is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥There are a couple of negative points I would like to mention: the loot system is very basic. There are a few weapons you can only get from destroying other ships, but these are very rare and not really special. So upgrading your ship is mainly done through spending credits you earn through missions. And while the ship customization options are fine, I would have preferred still more options. Like putting extra power into weapons by sacrificing shield strength. Or installing an extra tower while giving up a support module. Also, the story is sort of generic. No big surprises there.Still, this is another game that revives the space opera genre, which was believed dead long enough. And if you are actually still expecting Star Citizin to be great, this might be a game that shortens the long wait.8.5/10.			"

I still havent beat the main story, as i'm to busy working for my chosen faction, which is alot of fun.If you can get this on sale, defenitely get it, otherwise its still a pretty good deal!			"

												I've only put a few hours into this game so far, and I'm enjoying it immensely. Broadly, Rebel Galaxy reminds me of a mashup of the Assassin's Creed series, World of Warships, and good old Freelancer. The former because the way that the map and locations work (markers and missions within the system map), the second because of the similar broadside naval combat mechanic (which, given the lack of a traversable Z axis [for simplicity's sake] in the game, works surprisingly well), and the latter because...well, you fly around in space and do whatever you want for a career.Rebel Galaxy is very smooth. Everything looks wonderful, the theme music and some of the game's feel are obvious homages to Firefly and Serenity, but the overall experience is pretty fresh. While the exploration and side mission elements of gameplay can get redundant (see Assassin's Creed), the constantly evolving state of your own ship keep things fairly interesting. The difficulty curve can be a little intense. Like AC, this is forgiven somewhat because the game autosaves every time you leave dock, but there are a number of bloody lessons to be learned early on while you learn how to poke around the galaxy without dying with some frequency.Combat mechanics are very nifty. In addition to hired help and the already highlighted broadside combat system, turrets, auxiliary weapons, and various modules help keep combat pretty fresh and interesting. Plus it all looks very pretty, and blowing up pirate capital ships is viscerally satisfying in a way that Eve never accomplished.Very, very recommendable to fans of any of the above listed titles (disparate though they may seem), as long as you dig things in space. A great, sandboxy capital ship combat game that really WORKS, unlike so many halfhearted efforts.			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

												This story is not 30-40 hours to complete -.- takes maybe a max of ten.   I would love to see more difficult missions, currently the ship I am in has no threat to it which would be nice to see if you ever get around to introducing more content.  Overall the game is very pretty but the story is very dry in terms of content.   The ending just feels like a scavanger hunt and the final battle can be won without having to fire a shot of your own.   Overall I love the game but would greatly appreciate some more endgame things to go explore or fights similar in strength to the end boss.  I am recomending it because I love the game to death.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a light hearted space sim, borrowing ideas from games such as Sid Mier's Pirates! and others. Graphically styled like Galaxy on Fire and Torchlight, it's a pretty game that runs smoothly other than when using the warp gate (no big issue really, they're used infrequently). Controls work nicely with both mouse/KB or controller. The game offers plenty of ship customisation, do you want to be a ship of the line with massive broadsides? Or perhaps a gunboat bristling with turrets? Maybe you want to long-haul goods across the system? Heaps of options for you to try out.My only real negatives so far;1) Not enough music, the music in the game is AMAZING, but the sound track needs to be a little longer I think2) Stop dropping me out of super-cruise etc when near asteroids etc, if I can visually plot a safe way through a field, then let me. :DSeriously though, this game is amazing value for $18, if you like space sim-lite, this is your game, or just want to blow up ships across the galaxy, look no futher.9/10, definately recomend.

												It could use some more story and a little less grind but all in all a very enjoyable ""broadside"" game.  I don't necessarily consider full 3D movement to be the crux of space games.  I'm more concerned with the quality of content and this does that very well.  It is not a AAA but if they had dumped the money and time into it -- it could have been.It is worth the $20 all day and if it is on sale and you don't buy it as a SciFi fan well then you're just silly.Babylon 5 style ships mixed with a Firefly feel?

Posted: December 20, 2015
												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

												Love being a space cowboy in Rebel Galaxy, it just feels good to fly around and fight other ships! Graphics are amazing even on my mid-level system, my jaw dropped when I first loaded up the game. My laptop has a hard time running it though.Great pacing, lots of things to do; explore the solar systems, smuggle cargo between space stations, start fights with space pirates and steal their cargo, sell loot and upgrade your weapons...buy a new ship once you've saved up enough.I also like how you can customize your ship to fit different playstyles, there's no wrong answer, combat always feels intense and rewarding. Outfit long range cannons and missles to snipe opponents from afar, for medium range fightfights use blaster turrets and rockets, or cover your ship in lasers to cut ships apart up close! You also get to pick whether you prefer a huge tank-like ship or a sleek corvette, customize your speed and durability based on your play style. There are no levels, the more money you make the better ships and equipment you can afford, so buy trade items low, stock your hold with valuables, and sell to the buyers offering the most at the commodity markets at the space stations.One other thing I love is the music. Not only does it come with great music by default, you can use your own MP3 collection, and it will change songs for Ambient, Combat, Idle, Menu, and Space Station. So I made folders for each music type, copied songs that fit the mood into the folders, and added those folders to the game's music library. So when I'm cruising through space I can enjoy some low key Beck and Radiohead, but when a fight breaks out the game will start blasting Green Day or the Klaxons!Buy it! Don't even hesitate, don't even worry, don't even give it a second thought.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												TL;DR: if you're looking for something like Privateer or Freelancer, this game scratches that itch quite nicely.Pros rockin' soundtrack and fantastic sound direction massive capital ships that truly feel badass simple, yet engaging combat system great voiceworkCons original soundtrack is limited, so after a while, the same songs get stuck in your head as you loop them over and over. Fortunately, game allows you to add your own music game is quite grindy, as you need copious amounts of credits to advance tiers of difficulty. Can get repetitive after a while. not true 3D as the Y-axis is fixed like in Freelancer, but you cannot fly up and down at all. Makes the game simpler, but not a true space sim.PS: Get the Radovich. It's awesome.			"

												These guys follow the K.I.S.S. method when they developed this game. You can't go wrong with playing a game this much for $20. Just save yourself the grief and just get it already. If you need to know more about it then read the reviews below but beware that they still don't touch on the charm that this game offers when you play it. Yes the main campaigh gets wrapped up pretty quickly, and it left me wondering if the story will continue on in a sequel game. (I hope it does!)  Although i think it was left open ended depending if the game is popular and profitable enough to do a sequel. ( i hope it does!) Can't you tell how much i enjoyed playing this game? Oh and don't worry about blasting through the story the first go around. I challenge you try it the second time and play as a pirate scum!! That is what makes this game so cool...""replayability"".

												If you liked Freelancer and/or Privateer then Rebel Galaxy will feel very familiar, but be warned: this isn't a massive game. There are only a dozen or so (mostly identical) systems to explore, and the campaign is relatively short and uninspired. The crucial elements are all there  - a trading market with fluctuating demand, factions, ship upgrading, space combat - and are competently done even if they are relatively shallow. I hope the interest generated by RG will convince the devs to create the much larger, much more ambitious game that RG could be if given the time and resources.			"

												The game is fun at the beginning but it lacks some fundamental RPG elements such as XP and a leveling system. This makes all those small and sudden fights that happens along the way a bit dreary since they don't feel very rewarding.Also the game and combat system was immensely confusing at first, but after a couple of hours I got used to it. The gameplay itself is arcade-ish like Starpoint Gemini 2 (which I love more than any other game), and this is a good thing.However, the lack of a progression system and the fact that you have to grind immensely to get though the main story is a huge downside.

												If you were ever a fan of the Escape Velocity franchise you'll fall in love with this game. While it is missing some key elements from games like Escape Velocity such as being able to board and capture vessels to build a small fleet of escort ships it definitely fits the classic bill of running missions out of seedy bars on backwater stations and running those luxery goods from place to place to rake in the dough hand over fist.Soundtrack is heavily influenced by the dark and outlaw country genres of music, predominately by guitarist Blues Saraceno and acts such as The Blue News whichs adds a very heavy credit to it being a premier Space Western. Spend more than five minutes in the game and you'll be wishing you were raiding Space Trains belonging to Space Yankees who sacked the Space South after Sherman's Jump through the Orion Spur.Graphicly it is a decently impressive game that doesn't really fail to impress when it concerns ship, station or other object design and detail... also love burning up in atmospheres of planetary bodies, so gotta watch that hahah... seriously don't fly too close or you'll melt yourself six ways from STS-107.Overall if you want to jump into something that'll suck you in for a couple dozen hours its well worth the purchase for the sound track alone, which you can stand alone play from the game's data files (if you have anything that converts .ogg format)			"

This game lets you be a complete @$$ if you want to be.Want to go and slaughter Milita and Civilians? Go Ahead.Need to be the hero and save everyone? Feel free.Money your motovation? Become a Trader or Mercenary.Or you can Kill everyone and make EVERY faction mad at you.The quests in game or ""missions"" all pretty much involve some sort of combat even if it is nothing more than you survive long enuff to run away.Combat is the bread and butter of the game with diffrent firing arcs for every ship. Armor, Sheilds, Deflectors, Special comps, Engines, Jumpdrives, there are alot of items in game to modify and change to your liking.I dont want to go into to much detail as exploring and finding out what you like is a big part of the game as well as finding your own play style.With all that being said the one gripe I have is the ""Risk"" lv of each mission can be VERY misleading. I can say Low or very low risk and out of nowhere 4 Dreadnaughts that outgun you so bad that if they look at you youed die can appear.Good Luck.			"

												This is a pretty mellow recommendation. It's a pleasant game for wandering around being the most brutally murderous good samaritan, but doesn't really have much in the way of great exciting moments. The combat is pretty unique, but lacks skillshots or headshot-analogues. The economy (with the mark 1-6 versions of items) is set up such that you can throw down a huge number of credits on upgrading your ship to feel pretty much the same as it did before.It's mostly an improvement on Freelancer though I think, with more nuanced combat, a more lively world, and less time spent docking with trade lanes.

												This is a fine game, with chunky graphics, chunky music, and chunky gameplay. It's kinda like Borderlands, but in space.The music is smooth - one of the tracks is a bottle-neck blues tune about an untrustworthy space-hooker... or it may not be about that at all. Buy this game, they accept doubloons, you may be able to barter it for a crate of dynamite.			"

												You got problems captain.You just came out of warp. Your screen fills with red icons as criscrossing missile trails and cannon fill your vision. Seems this station is under attack by a rather nasty group of pirates. You can see your turrets taking aim and firing as you aim for the station itself. The system militia seems to be doing well, but the pirates just got reinforcements. Torpedo bombers and enemy frigates are starting to get real close. Too close for your liking. You activate your flak cannons and watch the fighters pull away from you. Unleashing a broadside into a passing enemy frigate, you idly wonder if maybe you should just take that mining laser off of your rear turret. Maybe get another tachyon turret? Your ship shakes violently as a mine slams into your hull, and with growing concern you hear your ship calmly relay the fact that your engines are slowing down. Hitting your deflectors you absorb a few torpedo hits as your shields try their best to recharge with the brief respite you have given them.Best shields in the sytem you had thought to yourself as you happily pressed the buy button after trading all that juicy ore you mined. This situation probably wouldn't have been a big deal, if you hadn't of been ambushed on the way here. Apparently when the mission board said 'deadly ore delivery' they had meant it. That fight with two massive heavy frigates had ripped most of the armor off of your hull. Then your hull had been beaten something fierce. Emerging from that fight with a mere 20% hull integrity had been rough.That was before the distress call. Sure, you could have ignored it, after all in your experience sometimes it was a trap. Yet sometimes it was a trader in need of help. You had come out of warp with all of your weapons singing. The friendly trader barely expressed his grattitude before handing over a handful of credits and jumping to warp. Sure, you could have ignored them and kept on trucking, but that aint you, is it outlaw? Frontier folks gotta stick together.You sigh as you realize you just fired on a militia ship. It was gonna be a while before you could build that rep up. Luckily, the station was in full view, and you hit your boosters and your deflectors to make up the remaining distance.As you dock, you smile as 31,900c goes into your account, and the repair costs of your ship are covered by those alien artifacts you scooped up coming in.You have heard rumors of other galaxies. Starpoint Gemini 2, X3 Terran Conflict, Evochron Mercenary, Freelancer, but word in the space bars is that all of those where missing something. As you replace your flak cannon arrays with EMP grids, you can't help but smile once more.Yeah, you got problems captain, but that's the way you like it.			"

												English is not my primary language, so please, be patient :)Man, I'm not one to write reviews, but hell, this game is FUN !It was a very welcome surprise for me. I've played elite dangerous and other space games around, but nothing as fun as this one. The game awsome, good graphics, fast combat (even inside a capital ship, belive me), great learning curve, easy to play, not a insane number of commands, keyboard/mouse or joystick, great music, you really get the feeling of a space cowboy and pause: Yes PAUSE ! hit esc and everything stops ! You can get a soda, got take a leak, eat some pizza and the game will wait for you ! Want to snan some ships for cargo ? No problem, hit TAB and the game stops letting you scan ships without worring abou hitting something. The progression is also good, the game will give you bether missions based on the configuration of your ship. Bether ships, bether credits for your time. The side missions may seen repetitive, but, as long I'm blasting stuff up, I don't care, ehe. The game has many ships to fly, and even more as NPCs. Also, a good amount of gear for your ship. Main gus, sub guns, turrets, engines, warp drives are just some to name. HINT: A good defence IS A GOOD DEFENCE ! Don't neglect shields, or you will find yourself blowing up more than you like.Final words. Game is solid, for the price, it's a bargain. 8/10 If you're looking for a fun game to pass time, without the big worries of other space sims, go ahead, you will not regret it!			"

												Take a triple-A space game, boil it down to its barest essence (and maybe burn off a little presentation in the process), and you have this.  It is simple, straightforward combat (Black Flag style) and space trucking with just the barest storyline spread over it.The soundtrack is pure 'Murican bad-assery.  I want to grab my trusty steed, a lever action rifle, and ride off after some desparados; but I'll settle for taking out some space pirates.Great value at the price point ($20).  Rabbit Murdoch actually made a good recommendation for once. #GamersWithJobs			"

												Reminiscent of the game Privateer. You get dumped into a sand box with a vague mission and a crappy ship. You fight, mine, trade, and explore for money until you can afford better a better ship. Combat is somewhat simplistic. Not a simple point and click but there is some timing and strategy involved just not much. Good game so far.			"

												Okay, so as I write this I am currently only at eleven hours of playtime, not a whole lot really. And in the grand scheme of things? I've barely scratched the surface of this game. You're dumped into a solar system, with a few planets and maybe ten-ish? stations to visit and get some random missions from. Cool, great, awesome. Did I mention this is only one solar system out of a galaxy? Sure it's in space, the game isn't really going to be absolutely teeming with life or a huge population, but whenever you find a landmark there's usually some miners, pirates, the Militia, or some traders that are around, and it's up to you how to interpret who is friend, who is foe, and who is prey.Can you be a pirate in this? Absolutely. Can you trade and smuggle illegal materials from different stations? Of course, just be careful of Militia patrols - they're in bigger, and meaner ships than you are to start out with, and they tend to shoot first and ask questions later if you're on the wrong side of the law. And of course you can also play the role of a bounty hunter, chasing after Pirate heads to fuel your bank account and taking up odd jobs to buy a few new guns along the way.You can also be a trader, taking supplies from one station, then going and selling them at another station to make a huge profit. There's a news-feed option in there to let you know what the latest prices are for each station, if you're patient enough. Just look out for the pirates. Or, if you're a wuss, you can just be a miner and shred through astroids with mining lasers, selling the metal ore for profit, and running the hell away from the Pirates who like your cargo, but don't like the work.As far as the combat goes, there's nothing really all that complex about it. You've got Broadside weapons, Turrets, and Secondaries. Broadsides are pretty self explanitory - they're guns mounted in the port and starboard sides of your ship (Left and Right) that are your main ship-killing weapons. What's neat is you can just spray-and-pray with them if you want, or you can charge them up, take aim, and have a well-timed barrage that leads your target so it lands right into their hull. Although if you're point blank, sometimes the spray-and-pray is better for use as a DPS race.Then you have turrets. You can have some pretty simple stuff... missile turrets, laser turrets, beam weaponry, and even some flak guns to take down those pesky fighters and bombers swarming around your poopdeck.And lastly there's Secondaries. Secondaries are essentially up to you, and effect certain places where your craft will be effective. You can put... bigger flak guns, you can put mine launchers, dumb-fire missile launchers, heat-seeker missile launchers, and so on. As far as the story goes? I haven't really gotten that far into it yet, but from what I can tell it's super simple and not really anything that you're gonna get lost on. Find some alien-tech doohickey and then go on an adventure to find out what the heck it is and what it does.Bottom line is this: If you like Starpoint Gemini, but thought the combat and world was exceptionally boring (like I found it to be...)? You'll like this. If you like pretending you're piloting Serenity or the Outlaw Star, you'll like this.You can't take the sky from me.			"

												This game is exactly how a sci-fiction space sandbox game should be in my mind. I believe you will find the same idea if you enjoy Galaxy on Fire series on Android, as this game seems to be even better than that.And I see they put quite some effort to optimize the graphics etc., I have never imagined my lame laptop would have such performance with all the glorious scences in game.Another thing worth mention is that the music. IDK other ppl but hell the original music in the game fits perfect, and you can use your own music as well.There are some minor flaws, like you cannot really rotate your capital ship to the 3rd axis (ie flying upwards or downwards) while other smaller fighter class ships can. But I will take it as unnecessary complexity so basically no downside for this game.			"

												OK, So I know I dont have a whole lot of time in this game but my favorite genre of games is space flight/simulators. As far as a single player space simulator this is by far my favorite. You are not limited to just fighting all the time you can MINE and TRADE as well!!!! So if you feel like taking a break from all of the Multiplayer space games (Eve online, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, ect.....) this is the game for you. This game is a simplified, single player version of Elite Dangerous. Also the graphics for such a small game are quite AMAZING!!!! They show hull damage significantly better than most space games out right now. So in short great game probably gonna put in an easy 100 hours into it. Wish I could give it more thumbs up.			"

												Call me utterly surprised. This game came out of no where from me, and if not for a reccomendation from someone I trust I would have never even heard of it. This is a game by a series of devs that know their stuff. The controls are very slick and accessible, the ship piloting is fantastic, and it's the kind of thing that could have had a waffly, generic scifi electronica or trumpet track and instead has some of the most radical rock/country (yes, I am advocating something that is at least in part country, but I mean listen to the trailer people) I've ever heard backing it pretty solidly. That tangles with the interesting strategies for space battles, the system for navigating faction trust and how you can play out numerous missions without even touching the main story. This is an excellent example of emergent gameplay and, while the story to me is really just so much background noise, even the little things characters do and say add to the setting's charm. This is AAA+ to me, amazing and simply made me a fan of this dev in whatever they do.			"

												This is my review, the game is great, love it quite abit. Being a Former EVE Online player, and multitude of other games I got in my own collection, The controls for this is very simple... for I will admit, I am no pilot! I am the only person in the world whom can crash an aircraft on takeoff!But the controls are easy, and I love it.Okay so here are the pros that I can safely say: for one, 19 bucks for the game is a bargin compared to other games, such as Elite: Dangerious (I tried it, cant fly), I like the trade system in the game, cause lets face it... repairs can suck at times, and drains the living hell out of your coffers. It doesnt hurt to dabble in it afterall, suppliment your income to ensure your vessle is in combat shape? why not right?Another is the combat system, The turrets, the Turrets! Oh how wonderful it is to be able to set the turrets how you wish. Leaving you to focus on defence, Sub Weapon systems (EMP Flak for the win), and the broadsides! while the turrets can rip the little fighters apart (they suck at times). the Manuvering is very smooth if your comfortable with the standard Keymotions from MMOs, you know the ASDW.Okay, time for the Nitpicking;the Cons;Ship content; I was told by a Dev (Thank you by the way) They will adjust ships to better suit how each is to stack up, so no one size fits all vessle... But still, we could use more ship types. even have Fighter Crafts of our own, even Bombers (For you batshit crazy aces out there, you know who you are), And maybe JUST Maybe, look into adding Multiplayer content, like conversion option for Single or Online version. Some people wanna rub other peoples faces into their afterburners afterall, and some are lone wolves in a sense.Mercinaries: Well not really judging, but would be nice if there was more of them to choose from, its like... each part of the space you go to, its sometimes the same pilot sitting at the bar (Stalker much?), So be kinda nice to have to hunt down your fav merc, and make them worthwhile to hang onto (rather than rehire them later in the game just to keep up with the enemies in the area)Factions: Needs a hint more love, maybe more factions?, and of course adding stuff for the factions to do (stuff that can affect each galaxy?) So Devs if your reading this and not vomiting from my pretty sad review. Take a moment from giving yourselves a far well deserved pat on the back, and look into Factions. Then Add and Fluff (and polish them out), it would give you ALOT more stuff to do, and would (hopefully) get alot more people to buy itSo all and all in a Nutshell (if your still sane after reading this, grats, if not... I heard the Jello in the institutes is nice),The Game is great with next to no complaints, great soundtrack (be better if you can change the channel at times), Good content, and player control. I highly recommend getting this game...Oh by the by, for you new players out there... hire a merc, they are a real help!-----Spoiler alert!-----THE CAKE IS A LIE!!			"

Cowboy Bebop EditionI have been waiting for this game since I stopped playing FreelancerAt the time of this review I have 14.7 hrs and I have only just made it into the second sectorPros Large sectors with the freedom and range to do whatever you choose (mining, trading, pirate, mercenary) Multiple ships and upgrades, further diversified by guild specific upgrades Universe feels alive, randomly intercepting a pirate attack or being ambushed Interesting combat (naval style), broadside attacks being the main weapon usedCons Gets a bit grindy at times in order to progress, although it's realistic and makes you appreciate your ship as you upgrade it 2D plane playstyle, so no nifty barrel rolls to evade attacks Story isn't amazing  Buying and selling is weird, assuming because gui is made for both keyboard and controller Auto stop on cruise control, sometimes good, most of the time tediousRecommendations Fleet building, I get it's a primarily lone ranger feel but I would love to build an AI fleet to really wreck havoc Being able to have multiple gui windows, again I know it's made for conrollers but I'd like to have that space captain feel, being able to monitor my cargo bay, knowing what's contraband or not. Monitoring a locked on enemy whether or not it's in view.  Damaging ships like ftl, I wish I could exstensively damage an enemy thrusters or target their missile launchers with my turret to temporarily disable them, nothing major just would make fights a bit more interesting and not just bigger guns and better ship wins Overall though it's a great game especially for $20, if you love sci-fi and want that star trek style  battle where you both slowly move hitting each other balancing your power usage between thrusters, shields and weapons then definitely buy this game "

												It's not awfully deep, the story and dialogue is flat, you'll have to decide between better ship and better guns, better guns and better engines, better engines and better shields. You'll never feel like mining is worth the time, you'll feel like merchant jobs are all about punishing you for taking merchant jobs, you'll take one escort job before you decide you should NEVER do escort jobs. There are many things about this game you'll wish were better, you'll wish they were better because even though they aren't, you're having a really really really hard time stopping yourself from playing. So much is just good enough in this game to keep you glued start to finish. You will get your $20 worth and more out of this game and you will write a laundry list of suggestions for RG 2 because you really want RG 2 and you will weep because there never will be an RG 2 because 6 of your friends *want* but have not *bought* Rebel Galaxy.

												I really enjoy playing this game. I loved watching the streams on YouTube before release. I was having a hard time waiting for the release date thou to tell you the truth. Watching an awesome game is great but playing the game yourself is even better. I will have hundreds of hours on this game. I just know it. Be friends with the Militia, a pirate, or anything in between. You can also do your best to remain neutral so you can go everywhere. There is no set path you must follow to finish the game. You can abandon the storyline or play after you finished it, it's your game. Have fun everyone and enjoy.			"

												Take a triple-A space game, boil it down to its barest essence (and maybe burn off a little presentation in the process), and you have this.  It is simple, straightforward combat (Black Flag style) and space trucking with just the barest storyline spread over it.The soundtrack is pure 'Murican bad-assery.  I want to grab my trusty steed, a lever action rifle, and ride off after some desparados; but I'll settle for taking out some space pirates.Great value at the price point ($20).  Rabbit Murdoch actually made a good recommendation for once. #GamersWithJobs			"

												English is not my primary language, so please, be patient :)Man, I'm not one to write reviews, but hell, this game is FUN !It was a very welcome surprise for me. I've played elite dangerous and other space games around, but nothing as fun as this one. The game awsome, good graphics, fast combat (even inside a capital ship, belive me), great learning curve, easy to play, not a insane number of commands, keyboard/mouse or joystick, great music, you really get the feeling of a space cowboy and pause: Yes PAUSE ! hit esc and everything stops ! You can get a soda, got take a leak, eat some pizza and the game will wait for you ! Want to snan some ships for cargo ? No problem, hit TAB and the game stops letting you scan ships without worring abou hitting something. The progression is also good, the game will give you bether missions based on the configuration of your ship. Bether ships, bether credits for your time. The side missions may seen repetitive, but, as long I'm blasting stuff up, I don't care, ehe. The game has many ships to fly, and even more as NPCs. Also, a good amount of gear for your ship. Main gus, sub guns, turrets, engines, warp drives are just some to name. HINT: A good defence IS A GOOD DEFENCE ! Don't neglect shields, or you will find yourself blowing up more than you like.Final words. Game is solid, for the price, it's a bargain. 8/10 If you're looking for a fun game to pass time, without the big worries of other space sims, go ahead, you will not regret it!			"

												Okay, so as I write this I am currently only at eleven hours of playtime, not a whole lot really. And in the grand scheme of things? I've barely scratched the surface of this game. You're dumped into a solar system, with a few planets and maybe ten-ish? stations to visit and get some random missions from. Cool, great, awesome. Did I mention this is only one solar system out of a galaxy? Sure it's in space, the game isn't really going to be absolutely teeming with life or a huge population, but whenever you find a landmark there's usually some miners, pirates, the Militia, or some traders that are around, and it's up to you how to interpret who is friend, who is foe, and who is prey.Can you be a pirate in this? Absolutely. Can you trade and smuggle illegal materials from different stations? Of course, just be careful of Militia patrols - they're in bigger, and meaner ships than you are to start out with, and they tend to shoot first and ask questions later if you're on the wrong side of the law. And of course you can also play the role of a bounty hunter, chasing after Pirate heads to fuel your bank account and taking up odd jobs to buy a few new guns along the way.You can also be a trader, taking supplies from one station, then going and selling them at another station to make a huge profit. There's a news-feed option in there to let you know what the latest prices are for each station, if you're patient enough. Just look out for the pirates. Or, if you're a wuss, you can just be a miner and shred through astroids with mining lasers, selling the metal ore for profit, and running the hell away from the Pirates who like your cargo, but don't like the work.As far as the combat goes, there's nothing really all that complex about it. You've got Broadside weapons, Turrets, and Secondaries. Broadsides are pretty self explanitory - they're guns mounted in the port and starboard sides of your ship (Left and Right) that are your main ship-killing weapons. What's neat is you can just spray-and-pray with them if you want, or you can charge them up, take aim, and have a well-timed barrage that leads your target so it lands right into their hull. Although if you're point blank, sometimes the spray-and-pray is better for use as a DPS race.Then you have turrets. You can have some pretty simple stuff... missile turrets, laser turrets, beam weaponry, and even some flak guns to take down those pesky fighters and bombers swarming around your poopdeck.And lastly there's Secondaries. Secondaries are essentially up to you, and effect certain places where your craft will be effective. You can put... bigger flak guns, you can put mine launchers, dumb-fire missile launchers, heat-seeker missile launchers, and so on. As far as the story goes? I haven't really gotten that far into it yet, but from what I can tell it's super simple and not really anything that you're gonna get lost on. Find some alien-tech doohickey and then go on an adventure to find out what the heck it is and what it does.Bottom line is this: If you like Starpoint Gemini, but thought the combat and world was exceptionally boring (like I found it to be...)? You'll like this. If you like pretending you're piloting Serenity or the Outlaw Star, you'll like this.You can't take the sky from me.			"

												Reminiscent of the game Privateer. You get dumped into a sand box with a vague mission and a crappy ship. You fight, mine, trade, and explore for money until you can afford better a better ship. Combat is somewhat simplistic. Not a simple point and click but there is some timing and strategy involved just not much. Good game so far.			"

												This game is exactly how a sci-fiction space sandbox game should be in my mind. I believe you will find the same idea if you enjoy Galaxy on Fire series on Android, as this game seems to be even better than that.And I see they put quite some effort to optimize the graphics etc., I have never imagined my lame laptop would have such performance with all the glorious scences in game.Another thing worth mention is that the music. IDK other ppl but hell the original music in the game fits perfect, and you can use your own music as well.There are some minor flaws, like you cannot really rotate your capital ship to the 3rd axis (ie flying upwards or downwards) while other smaller fighter class ships can. But I will take it as unnecessary complexity so basically no downside for this game.			"

The games story is fairly simplistic and straight forward and the characters aren't oozing complexity that you meet a long the way but the feeling of the game is truly terrific.  The enjoyable action keeps you at the edge of your seat while the just one more ship upgrade keeps you in it.An enjoyable romp through space, two thumbs up!			"

Posted: January 19, 2016
												 Rebel Galaxy is the first “space sim” I've ever played to completion. I've tried getting into a few others (Elite: Dangerous and Dark Star One come to mind), but after the initially overwhelming but ultimately satisfying learning curve of those games had been conquered I got bored and dropped off once they devolved into tedious job simulators. Rebel Galaxy includes all of the main features of those more complex games, but streamlines them into something more digestible. It takes a hit on it's sense of “realism” and scale, but it's engaging and simplified loop of progress is enough to make up for that.  Did you know space is actually a flat plane? It's a silly concept and not really a complaint, I know, but Rebel Galaxy's one dimensional representation of open space is a good example of what you're in for. You never have to worry about vertical thrust or rolling your ship, just 360 degrees of activity. This feels like literal, ocean-based ship-to-ship combat and navigation with a space backdrop. And it works if you're willing to accept it. What you're losing in freedom you're gaining in ease of use. Most extraneous, technical fiddlings are stripped out: just point your ship where you want to go and hit the warp drive. Hold “A” to dock. There are four speeds to pick from, but just go full throttle and if you want to slow down or stop hold back on the left stick. You know it's a casual sim when the game's launcher recommends you use a gamepad. Again, none of this is inherently bad, it just is what it is. It's an arcade representation of a notoriously complicated genre.  Also unconventional is the personal story that is the driving force of the game. You inherit a ship from your aunt that contains some fragment of something or other that a number of local scumbags seem interested in acquiring. It's pretty clear that there's more to the fragment than meets the eye, and sure enough it soon awakens as an AI. The AI, Trell, directs you to other fragments scattered around increasingly dangerous sectors of the galaxy, which she uses to upgrade your ship to make it feasible to travel to even more dangerous parts of space. She also warns you that there are bad space guys after her, and if they get her it's bad news for everybody. This is all told through really nice looking close up conversations with Cortana's cousin Trell and other characters you meet in seedy space bars. You have some options for responses, but they're pretty limited and don't seem to matter too much. While the story starts off strong and shows promise, it ends up falling apart and fizzling out toward the end. It's the most disappointing aspect of Rebel Galaxy; it had the potential to be a grimy, emotional space opera but doesn't know how to progress or wrap up. It ends so abruptly I actually had to back out of the game and check my achievements to make sure the story was actually over. It was...  While it's a shame the fantastic but rather shallow characters are underutilized, the story is just a jumping off point for the familiar loop of space truckin'. Earn money by any means to upgrade your ship to make it easier to earn even more money in order to buy even better ships to make more money faster. It's a grind at it's core, but the ships look cool and the job simulator repetition is painless enough. You pick missions up from job boards at any space station. These range from delivering cargo to other stations, hunting (space) pirates with bounties on their head, picking up data at dead drops, etc. The higher the difficulty the more money you receive. You could also buy and sell goods for profit, but I didn't find the investment worth it if you're not nuts; you regularly pick up salable cargo from defeated enemies that you can exchange for pure profit so don't bother. You'll also run into distress signals in your travels where you can assist for some easy cash, or take out random bounties. Basically: play the game to earn money.  Almost any path you take will involve combat. Thankfully, like the rest of the game, getting into scraps is simple and enjoyable. You maneuver your ship as you would in naval warfare, with your main means of attack being your broadside cannons. The longer you wait to fire the more focused and accurate your shots become, so you can pinpoint a distant enemy for devastating damage or spam a barrage of wild shots to keep a ship's shields down or harass smaller swarms closer to you. You're also outfitted with a secondary weapon you can use with the “X” button. I went with flak cannons to destroy incoming missiles and smaller vessels, but you have options like homing missiles as well (which you need to buy ordinance for). Depending on how large of a ship you're piloting you can equip a number of turrets like shield destroying missiles, long range lasers, or mining lasers. You can control these manually, but I found the simpler my approach to combat the better the results. After experimenting with using the secondary lasers to take out smaller ships and targeting individual modules on capital ships, it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize I was overplaying the game. Just focus on your broadsides, spam your secondaries, and let the auto turrets do their work and you're playing optimally.  Rebel Galaxy offers a custom soundtrack option, and it's a small feature that goes a long way. The included soundtrack is decent, twangy Space Western tunes that sell the premise, and the ability to add your own songs is invaluable. You have several pathways to store the music, so you can divide your list to play only while at space stations, at the title screen, while traveling, during combat, etc. If you don't have Deep Purple's “Space Truckin'” on there you ♥♥♥♥ed up, but other than that it's great to inject your own mark onto the game and it makes travels through deep space feel like a road trip. This was a standard feature of the Xbox 360 but has sadly dropped off, and having it fully integrated here is fantastic and certainly welcome.  If you're looking for a deep simulation that requires every button on your keyboard for knobs and dials and subsystems Rebel Galaxy might not be the game for you. If you've come to the realization that those games are for crazy people and want to relax to some Johnny Cash as you cause some space wars and marvel at how such visual chaos can be distilled into simple arcade controls, Rebel Galaxy delivers. The promising story ends up being kind of crap and there's a definite grind to endure, but the game has heart and personality and delivers what I value most: fun.			"

Posted: January 19, 2016
												Quick Summary: Rebel Galaxy is an open-universe space combat/exploration/trading/mining/pirating game.Quick Score: 8/10 - Great gameplay, graphics and sound, can get grindy and repetitive.Full Review:I'll talk about, in order of relevance to me personally, Gameplay, Graphics, and Sound.Gameplay-If you liked the ship combat in Assassins Creed Black Flag, then you'll find something to love here. The game takes place on a flat plane, which means no z-axis navigation. You're solely on the X-Y Plane. And that's a good thing, once you see the competition you're up against. But don't worry, only the smaller craft go up and down, the larger ones don't. You can individually man a selection of turrets or your broadsides in combat. There's a variety of each type to choose to suit your playstyle. If you like to get up close and personal, or keep your distance, there's a weapon for you. When you are not controlling the turrets directly, they are controlled by the AI, which you can configure. You can set them to lock onto specific targets, fire at will, or be completely manual. It's up to you. Even navigation is largely the same as Black Flag. Accelerate in stages, decelerate in stages with optional braking, and turn from side to side.Aside from that, there's things like factions you can side with, an economy to exploit, mining activities, and so on. A story is present, but can go largely ignored. Feel free to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up and rack up the credits to the next ship upgrade. Speaking of, aside from aforementioned weaponry, defenses such as shields and armor and subsystems, which run specialised tasks as additions to your ship, can be upgraded. In a refreshing change of norm, you don't lose any credits when buying and selling items for your ship, so you're free to experiment until you find something that works. Even the ships you purchase come in a variety of sizes, from meek little frigates to massive and lumbering dreadnaughts and destroyers. There's plenty of ways to find a loadout more to your playstyle.One complaint I often see in space games is the sheer lack of things to do between travels. Fortunately, Rebel Galaxy keeps you on your toes. What may seem like a routine flight to another station may result in attending to a distress signal, getting ambushed by the enemy, or crashing into a nebula, with rocks (sorry, unsure what it's actually called) to dodge, mine or destroy. You can't expect to set your target and make some tea. There's also significant strategy in taking down opponents. Firing at the left side of the ship reduces the shielding for that side only, and not all the way round. Same goes for armor. So do you take an all-sides approach, or focus on one side of the ship? It's not so easy to just fire away, as you need to consider these things when attacking.Should you wish to make some dough, you can take on side missions or perform things like trading, mining, bounty hunting, and so on. It shouldn't be too hard to get the credits required for your next purchase.Graphics-I'm not one to stress on how pretty a game looks. I'm more for graphics. But my oh my is this game pretty. I'm more the person who feels Mirror's Edge looks better than Crysis 3, and the same goes here. Not the Crysis 3 thing. Space is beautiful. Instead of making it a black cosmos, with little white dots, it's colourful. Distant nebulae pepper the view with dashes of red, green, blue, purple, etc. Ships look worn but strong. Damage modelling is pretty impressive. ou can see scorch marks and chunks missing, embers glowing with some of the inner components revealed if you suffer significant damage. Weapons look beautiful when fired. They glow brightly, be it lasers or missiles. Speaking of, there's a flare effect from oncoming missiles fired from afar. Gives it a very cinematic feeling. There's also enough lens flare to make JJ Abrams happy, but it's done tastefully. Rest assured you won't have your view blocked by it. The UI is clean and uncluttered, letting you really soak in the surroundings. Rocket trails, when at warp, leave long blue lines behind you, and they each have a different layout depending on the thrusters of your ship. The Pulse effect looks good, akin to sonar visualised. When braking your ship, the thrusters turn red, as though they were brake lights. I considered it a nice touch.Sound-Best soundtrack so far. The game comes with a preloaded country/western soundtrack, that actually fits really well with the game. Should it not be your thing, feel free to add your own music collection, with the ability to set specific folders to different moments in the game, ie Combat, Travel, and so on. I personally set some dubstep for combat. As for sound effects, they're powerful. Flak cannons properly deafen, missiles have their own distinct sound, and everything comes together without sounding deafening. Even the AI which reports on your ship's status is plucked straight outta Sci-Fi stereotype, but hey, it works! Voice acting for the other characters you meet along the way is decent, but some of the quips from your enemies will begin to repeat fairly early.There's variety in language too. Different species may speak different languages, but in a way that sounds realistic. All in all, pretty good.Conclusion: The game gets repetitive, sure, so its longevity  really depends on how much fun you can have. I personally see this as the kind of game I can invest quite some time it, but your mileage may vary.			"

												This is my review, the game is great, love it quite abit. Being a Former EVE Online player, and multitude of other games I got in my own collection, The controls for this is very simple... for I will admit, I am no pilot! I am the only person in the world whom can crash an aircraft on takeoff!But the controls are easy, and I love it.Okay so here are the pros that I can safely say: for one, 19 bucks for the game is a bargin compared to other games, such as Elite: Dangerious (I tried it, cant fly), I like the trade system in the game, cause lets face it... repairs can suck at times, and drains the living hell out of your coffers. It doesnt hurt to dabble in it afterall, suppliment your income to ensure your vessle is in combat shape? why not right?Another is the combat system, The turrets, the Turrets! Oh how wonderful it is to be able to set the turrets how you wish. Leaving you to focus on defence, Sub Weapon systems (EMP Flak for the win), and the broadsides! while the turrets can rip the little fighters apart (they suck at times). the Manuvering is very smooth if your comfortable with the standard Keymotions from MMOs, you know the ASDW.Okay, time for the Nitpicking;the Cons;Ship content; I was told by a Dev (Thank you by the way) They will adjust ships to better suit how each is to stack up, so no one size fits all vessle... But still, we could use more ship types. even have Fighter Crafts of our own, even Bombers (For you batshit crazy aces out there, you know who you are), And maybe JUST Maybe, look into adding Multiplayer content, like conversion option for Single or Online version. Some people wanna rub other peoples faces into their afterburners afterall, and some are lone wolves in a sense.Mercinaries: Well not really judging, but would be nice if there was more of them to choose from, its like... each part of the space you go to, its sometimes the same pilot sitting at the bar (Stalker much?), So be kinda nice to have to hunt down your fav merc, and make them worthwhile to hang onto (rather than rehire them later in the game just to keep up with the enemies in the area)Factions: Needs a hint more love, maybe more factions?, and of course adding stuff for the factions to do (stuff that can affect each galaxy?) So Devs if your reading this and not vomiting from my pretty sad review. Take a moment from giving yourselves a far well deserved pat on the back, and look into Factions. Then Add and Fluff (and polish them out), it would give you ALOT more stuff to do, and would (hopefully) get alot more people to buy itSo all and all in a Nutshell (if your still sane after reading this, grats, if not... I heard the Jello in the institutes is nice),The Game is great with next to no complaints, great soundtrack (be better if you can change the channel at times), Good content, and player control. I highly recommend getting this game...Oh by the by, for you new players out there... hire a merc, they are a real help!-----Spoiler alert!-----THE CAKE IS A LIE!!			"

												OK, So I know I dont have a whole lot of time in this game but my favorite genre of games is space flight/simulators. As far as a single player space simulator this is by far my favorite. You are not limited to just fighting all the time you can MINE and TRADE as well!!!! So if you feel like taking a break from all of the Multiplayer space games (Eve online, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, ect.....) this is the game for you. This game is a simplified, single player version of Elite Dangerous. Also the graphics for such a small game are quite AMAZING!!!! They show hull damage significantly better than most space games out right now. So in short great game probably gonna put in an easy 100 hours into it. Wish I could give it more thumbs up.			"

Cowboy Bebop EditionI have been waiting for this game since I stopped playing FreelancerAt the time of this review I have 14.7 hrs and I have only just made it into the second sectorPros Large sectors with the freedom and range to do whatever you choose (mining, trading, pirate, mercenary) Multiple ships and upgrades, further diversified by guild specific upgrades Universe feels alive, randomly intercepting a pirate attack or being ambushed Interesting combat (naval style), broadside attacks being the main weapon usedCons Gets a bit grindy at times in order to progress, although it's realistic and makes you appreciate your ship as you upgrade it 2D plane playstyle, so no nifty barrel rolls to evade attacks Story isn't amazing  Buying and selling is weird, assuming because gui is made for both keyboard and controller Auto stop on cruise control, sometimes good, most of the time tediousRecommendations Fleet building, I get it's a primarily lone ranger feel but I would love to build an AI fleet to really wreck havoc Being able to have multiple gui windows, again I know it's made for conrollers but I'd like to have that space captain feel, being able to monitor my cargo bay, knowing what's contraband or not. Monitoring a locked on enemy whether or not it's in view.  Damaging ships like ftl, I wish I could exstensively damage an enemy thrusters or target their missile launchers with my turret to temporarily disable them, nothing major just would make fights a bit more interesting and not just bigger guns and better ship wins Overall though it's a great game especially for $20, if you love sci-fi and want that star trek style  battle where you both slowly move hitting each other balancing your power usage between thrusters, shields and weapons then definitely buy this game "

												One of the most underrated games on steam. I grabbed this on sale and boy am I getting my $7 worth! It's action packed with a lot of RPG elements. You can spend hours just exploring or jump into a battle at any time. I was a bit hesitant over the lack of full 3D movement, but it's not an issue at all. This is like a more badass, space-themed version of Sid Meier's Pirates.			"

												Reminiscent of the game Privateer. You get dumped into a sand box with a vague mission and a crappy ship. You fight, mine, trade, and explore for money until you can afford better a better ship. Combat is somewhat simplistic. Not a simple point and click but there is some timing and strategy involved just not much. Good game so far.			"

												If you remember games like Freelancer and Freespace 2 and wish there was a modern game like them, then this is the game for you. It's a single player space adventure with naval style combat, complete with broadside attacks. Upgrade your weapons, shields and more or save up to buy a whole new ship - anything from a nippy little corvette to a huge and powerful dreadnought.[PROS]* The soundtrack is immense. It's sort of bluesy and grungy, with a definite western feel (think Firefly). The heavy guitar riffs brought a smile to my face more than once during a pitched battle.* The story. Engaging and fun, with just the right amount of grinding side-quests in between.* Active developers. The game is post-launch, but they're still working on it and perfecting things, which is always nice to see.* The graphics. The ships are very detailed in perticular, with artistic and individual designs for each one. None of the 'stock blocky ship 1a' nonsense you get in some games of this ilk. They all have their own distinc look and feel.* Firefly. A lot has been made of the similarities and they are there. Mostly in the asthetic rather than the actual gameplay, but it really feels like that's the universe you are playing in. What's not to love about that!* Freedom. Choose to stay in a fast ship with high maneuverability, or spring for a lumbering dreadnought, armed to the teeth. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow. There really is no perfect choice. You can switch between ships you have bought with no penalty too, which is a great touch.[CONS]* Campaign could be longer. A mid-level ship is more than sufficient to complete the whole thing, so the awesome but expensive top-tier ships don't get a proper airing. However  The campaign ends on a cliff-hanger, so a sequel or expansion might be in the works. * Navigating can get a bit irritating. You drop out of FTL travel when you get close to an asteroid, or any other obstacle and they are everywhere. This would be okay, but you can never see them coming in advance. I got used to it though, since travel times really aren't that long anyway. "

												English is not my primary language, so please, be patient :)Man, I'm not one to write reviews, but hell, this game is FUN !It was a very welcome surprise for me. I've played elite dangerous and other space games around, but nothing as fun as this one. The game awsome, good graphics, fast combat (even inside a capital ship, belive me), great learning curve, easy to play, not a insane number of commands, keyboard/mouse or joystick, great music, you really get the feeling of a space cowboy and pause: Yes PAUSE ! hit esc and everything stops ! You can get a soda, got take a leak, eat some pizza and the game will wait for you ! Want to snan some ships for cargo ? No problem, hit TAB and the game stops letting you scan ships without worring abou hitting something. The progression is also good, the game will give you bether missions based on the configuration of your ship. Bether ships, bether credits for your time. The side missions may seen repetitive, but, as long I'm blasting stuff up, I don't care, ehe. The game has many ships to fly, and even more as NPCs. Also, a good amount of gear for your ship. Main gus, sub guns, turrets, engines, warp drives are just some to name. HINT: A good defence IS A GOOD DEFENCE ! Don't neglect shields, or you will find yourself blowing up more than you like.Final words. Game is solid, for the price, it's a bargain. 8/10 If you're looking for a fun game to pass time, without the big worries of other space sims, go ahead, you will not regret it!			"

												Take a triple-A space game, boil it down to its barest essence (and maybe burn off a little presentation in the process), and you have this.  It is simple, straightforward combat (Black Flag style) and space trucking with just the barest storyline spread over it.The soundtrack is pure 'Murican bad-assery.  I want to grab my trusty steed, a lever action rifle, and ride off after some desparados; but I'll settle for taking out some space pirates.Great value at the price point ($20).

												If you're looking for elitist  3D space combat with twitchy impossible combat and hardcore navigation and think it's fun to die trying to dock your ship, don't waste your money.If you want a fun game that's rewarding in small doses or good for an epic gaming weekend, this is it.  But warn your friends and family that they will be seeing less of you for a while....It's a beautifully done space combat/trading/questing game.  You can be a trader, you can be a miner, you can be a pirate, you can be a quester, or most likely you'll find yourself doing a little bit of all of it.  Or a LOT of all of it.I will suggest playing with a controller...I'm a longtime keyboard and mouse guy and I never use a controller for anything.  Thats a big part of why my Nintendo was gifted to my nephew and my xbox hasnt been plugged in for 2 years, but with this game the controller just feels right and works perfectly.Pros: *  It looks 3D, but it's mostly a 2D game, so it simplifies the navigation and combat *  Its very open.  There is a story line to progress through , but you're free to ignore it, or progress at your own pace*  You can fire it up, do a couple of quick quests, and feel like you accomplished something.  * And then a couple more, and then just one more, and then another one.....and 8 hours later you've played a quick game* It autosaves every time you visit a station.  So if your next quest goes horribly wrong, and you die a fiery death, then reload and try again. * If an objective is too hard, there are plenty of options to go make a little money, buy some better armor and weapons, and try it again.  Yet somehow it doesnt feel grindy, it's fun.* After over 30 hours, I still have the music turned on.  I saw one review call it ""Cowboy butt-rock"" - I'm not sure if they meant that as a compliment or an insult, but it kind of fits.  Either way, I like it.* The one time I had a problem, I posted a question on the support forum and got a response in 15 minutesCons* If you're not a fan of the ""Cowboy butt-rock"", turn it off.  The game is still worth it.* The game is so awesome it will inspire you to take time out to write a review, which takes time away from playing the awesome game.* I can't think of any other cons to put here* Really, why are you still reading?  Buy the game already "

Traders offer to give you an item for 5k while they offer to buy the same item at 9k. Wat-Story is super bland - EVERYONE is forgettable; even the last boss is forgettable as I neutroned his♥♥♥♥♥into oblivion with barely any hull damage.You control your ship on a 2D plane while the non-capital ships have 3D movement. Feels like AssCreed Black Flag naval combat in space - could be a negative for some but nevertheless, still fun.tl;dr: Not GOTY content, but enjoyable at the pricepoint - realistically can enjoy it for about a week before moving onto something else			"

												I love this game, although it is clearly build to be played with a controller (which i bought for this game) the controls are great. The game is not the fastest playing game and you will have to do sidemissions to upgrade your ship. At the start you get a capital ship which at the moment is the only type of ship (read: corvettes to dreadnaughts). And you are send of with a mission however you can also go explore, trade or be a pirate if you want to. And last but not least the music is Awesome!In short: I recommend this game to anyone who like spacegames but does not need them to be overly realistic! "

It has just the right amount of complexity while maintaining its low pressure nature and has very fun combat. Perfect game to blow off steam just cruising around in your ship.It has a respectable amount of customization options and fighting styles.My only real complaint is that there isn't an endgame area with powerful enough enemies for my invicible Revenant :( But as you can see that was after 30 hours of playtime.

												Was looking forward to this game since I used to play Privateer as a kid and this game might bring back some of those memories.From a technical perspective I can't recommend this game. Sorry.In 4k it's unplayable with a mouse. The mouse does not work correctly. In 1440p it's better, but the mouse still does not work correctly. Basically the issue is that even though the cursor is visually on a selection the game does not recognize it being there. That means you have to move the mouse around until you find the area of the screen where the game thinks the cursor is in the correct spot. They should just remove the 4k and 1440p options from the settings until this is fixed. If you don't mind playing in 1080p I'm sure you won't have to worry about the mouse issue. I see some people saying how nice the graphics are, but I don't see it. The textures are very ""muddy"" and blurry. Yes, I was in 4k and max settings. Easily was over 100fps so you know it's not a graphic intensive game. Which is probably a good thing for many people. Sound and music seem top notch the little I played the game though. Had to ask for a refund because of the technical issues.			"

												A rather small game with huge potential for sequel.- Assassin's Creed ship broadside combat style. Movement in game is 2D (no up or down), feel like battleship rather than spacecraft.- Variable play style. Trader, miner, smuggler, mercenary, assassin, transporter, saboteur or just an a$$hole who blows stuff up for fun.- Factions and Guilds are interesting enough.- Space feels lively and vivid. Soundtrack is sublime.- No in-game purchases bullsh_t.- Dynamic economy&logical system.    *Various events such as famine, tech boom, celebration, invasion etc.   *Intercepting diaplomat ship might result in interplanetary war which you can make profit by selling war supplies or accepting mercenary contracts.   *When famine hits a planet you can sabotage the relief efforts by intercepting supply ships then sell the loots at the planet for greater prices than usual.   *Slave smuggling, drug trafficking, f_uck a planet economy up by hoarding gold.:( I'm a bad person.Bad stuff:- Some features are shortcoming. Usual for a small company dev.- Story and dialogues are rather bland. The game could be A LOT more creative.- Controls can be confusing once in a while.- Not enough weapon choices.- Can be repetitive and grindy.			"

												Spent around 50+ hours in this game, finished it after obtaining MK6 equipment and being able to get the more expensive ships and guild ships.Having played through this with a good friend watching it live on Stream for the majority of the playthough i can say i enjoyed this title a lot.But i have gripes, gripes that comes from that it's meant to be played with a controller.There is a distinct snapping with aim assist in this game, this paired with no pitch control (Y axis for your spacecraft doesnt exist, but exists for other smaller crafts and various world objects/projectiles)The game felt huge at the beginning but the main storyline skips through sectors mid story, which leaves you just going through sectors without a reason to stay (unless you are doing trading, mining or hunting).It feels like this game was ported over from a Console, but that could also be good.. hear me out.In 50+ hours i have not had a single crash or bug, nor any weird software issues at all.This could very well be thanks to that the game is polished in that sense, framerate feels solid aswell.Game is beautiful (even if nebulas are tiny dust clouds compared to real life), the game allows custom music for: Idle, Combat, Space stations, ambient & main title.This is a very nice addition and lets you (once you get bored of the ingame music) put your own tracks for various interactions in game.Game plays well, no stutter or dips in general performance.I highly recommend playing this with a controller, as with a mouse the snapping / aim assist gets very frustrating once you wanna have more of a freelook aiming.Story should be made longer, or added with DLC as it felt short and kinda rushed, especially compared to the amount of sectors you dont even do any type of missions in at all. (you mainly just go find npc for mission->go and talk to npc->gate->gate->mission->gate back->gate back->find npc who gave mission->talk to npc.It does have some issues in those areas i mentioned earlier, but because it performs so well, and compensates with positives i can only give this a thumbs up.Improvements for a sequel in my mind would be:Expansive story, more side quests (not just mission board money makers), get rid of aim assist/snapping and give us Y axis / Pitch.

												I'm a bad guy. I really am. And the fact that you can rack up with some of the toughest guys in the game and still beable to manage the story well enough just makes this great. And the diverging missions that offer a real choice in the universe is amazingly interesting. Game play wise its pretty solid, though I do with you had the ability to travel on the Z axis as well, but hey, it makes fighting a bit more of a challenger when you're twice the size of the target. Soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I love the Sci-fi western feel. Makes me think of Firefly meets Freelancer.10/10 would highly recommend.			"

												I will recommend this game but its not a resounding endorsement.Buy this game if you want something you can jump right in to and pick up on instantly.Don't buy this game if you want depth and progression of difficulty or features.Combat is really simple. Trading is really simple. Flight is really simple. Upgrades are really simple.. 1->2There is little to no room for customization.The game ran well on my system, the music was decent, and overall it's good for about 15 hours of entertainment.I got it on sale for ten bucks and feel okay about that.

												I've seen some reviews that the battles aren't in three dimensions and that is slightly annoying, but I get why they did it.  Plus, it becomes a non-issue very quickly, as your mercenary (get one ASAP, they last until they die) takes care of a lot of the 3D fighters and the bigger battles have so much going on, the 2D actually helps.  That being said, this is like you're a young Han Solo in the Firefly world.  I'm barely fans of either universe, but this game is a fun ride and for the price, I feel like I got my money's worth.

Requires skill. My computer is very old. I'm running this game on a GTX 260m, and it runs flawlessly, with everything turned ON. It's incredible.Stop wasting time. Just freaking buy this thing.

												Short : its like elite-freelancer with more soul (firefly like) on 2D plane with different combat mechanics.Overall i realy like the game, below in points:1-Very nice mood. Its really got that Firefly mood. Teh galaxy is alive, plenty of events that affect the game (for example a holiday wiht gifts custom on a planet means certain items will have very high price etc ), you can get tips from bartendes, hire mercenraies, help traders under attack and get rewards from them etc. I liked Elite but tough beatifull, it felt a bit sterile and souless to me. Here i love it,The music is quite unusual for this type of game, inmstead of electronic trance-ambient you got hard rocking blues. I love it, tough if you dont dig rock/blues might a problem.2- Open end game. Follow the story or just take missions, bounty hunt trade, whatever you like. Plenty of ships and upgrades.3-Ship control is unusual. It looks 3d but in truth is a 2d plane.You got a third person view , Eve online like, but you must aim in combat.4-Combat: its quite unusual and initially i was disspointed by it , i yearned for full 3d and standard cockpit view. But at some point something clicked  and i began to really like it.Its broadside based,  you can aslo control turrets.5- The graphics are nice, and i ahvent run into many bugs (i think i crashed once)If you are past Privateer/Elite/Freelancer fan, i think you should enjoy it very much, tough i recommend wathing vids to see the unusual ship control/combat in action.

												I was suprised. I really like this game. Being both a story driven and, sandbox game that blends very nicely. (IE:Your not forced to do anything, and have all the tools and oportunities of every other AI player from the start.) *almost, there are some races that have improved weaponry and such, but these can be ""obtained"" in various ways. I'm not sure about all unique crafts, but they are not OP so not a real worry.It gives me all the excitment and fun stuff that Elite Dangerous promised(lied about), and has never delilvered.Your actions have an impact in the game in a way that doesn't seem grindy.It feels fun and less like having a second job. *See Elite DangerousI don't have to pay $60.00 a year to play the full game.The controls took me a few mins to figure out, but then I'm using a keyboard and mouse, but after a few mins I was having a blast.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes space-flight, open-world, scripted or sandbox type play.You can choose to play as the ""good-guys"", ""bad-guys"" or anything in between, or any type of character you want really, AND change your play-style at any point. Various missions give you the oportunity to improve your relations with the different factions regardless of past history.The graphics are terrific.My rating 9.0 out of 10.Having finnished the game; the rating stands. I should lower it a bit due to the unfinished feeling the game leaves you with as pertains to the interface, contant speed bumps, other factions, and weaponry and such. Still I had fun. The modding community has tried to keep this game fresh and fun for those of us who have finnished it. But, without real modding tools, this list is short and creating your own mod is way too much work to be worth the effort atm.Hopefully, the Devs will create something to make the process a bit simplified or the replayability of this game may suffer in the long run.

There's a lot of ship variety to keep things interesting but it did tend to get a bit tedious late in the game.  Either way, it was fun.			"

Something that you probably need to know, is that this is kind of close to a simpler version of Elite: Dangerous, and honestly, i have had much more fun with it than i had with Elite: Dangerous, i'm glad this game is this simple; i've had problems with Elite: Dangerous because it was so complex and hard to get into, just to learn the games controls took a long time, but this game i could easily get used to it.This game is alot of fun, and deserves the price it's put up for, i'm glad i bought it.

												Starts to become repetative towards the end, but still a great game.+GREAT soundtrack+Good visuals+Engaging gameplay+Fairly well designed trade system+VERY engaging and fun combat~Story is meh, not great, not bad.~Random pirate encounters are really neat at first, but become common after the first 5 or so that happen.  One of the best ways to farm cash though, bounty from enemy ships.-Once youve figured out the games combat and the best loadouts, you can fairly easily 1v1 any ship in the game, and take on fairly heafty fleets on your own.  As said, makes the game become a bit repetative toawards the end.-If you want to get the largest ships in the game, it will take a LOT of farming/grinding for cash.-Missions become repetative pretty quickly, not a lot of variance beyond 5-10 types.Overall, I consider this a great game.  I purchased it for 10$, and easily got my moneys worth.  Soundtrack alone is worth the purchase lol.  I even boot it up for other space games.8.5/10			"

												2.5D game with good looks and great gameplay. Even though you can skip the story completely it guarantees you at least 20 hours of gameplay just to finish the story mode, thus the ships and upgrades you can work your way to buy.As many other ""space sims"" out there you can spend time mining, trading, doing mercenary work and questing. It's all about finding what's best for you. There are ships to fit your needs and you can always improve them. Reminds me a lot of Endless Sky and Freelancer but with better graphics and fancy effects.The soundtrack leaves me speechless and the game gives you the ability to add your own songs into the soundtrack so you can listen to your own music while playing. Realism is not the main factor here but this game sure is really fun! 10/10, waiting for a faction revamp DLC.			"

Must be Liquor Luck.>Getting a taste for higher-tier ships, need more money badly, but don't wanna resort to illegal activites.>Couple more hours of drinking and smuggling.>Regular goods just don't cut it anymore, so out the window morals go, let's become a drug trafficking, war-mongering space slaver.

												This is a great space battle and trading game, but it does leave some things to be desired. The main storyline is quite short and I imagine that most people get to the ending without knowing it - its very sudden. The storyline is too short to make saving up for better ships and weapons worthwhile. It's cool to have the biggest, badest ship and tearing enemy's apart with waves of munitions is quite fun, but it's a side mission grind that gets you to that point. If you follow the storyline's natural progression, you wont even get close to obtaining the best ships. All in all, time worth spent and I enjoyed most things about this game. If you can get it on sale, I'd say go for it.			"

												Made by two guys, and you can really see where that is obvious. Lots of cutbacks. For example a male cruiser pilot will suddenly turn female on the comms and ai is shared a lot, meaning a pirate will get interdicted by friendly merchants guild ships who have the exact same ships and exact same all-female captains as the miltia does. Lots of shared and samey stuff.Nevertheless, you can also see where those savings went. Very few bugs, cool aesthetic and with the awesome feature to add your own music even for different situations. This is a super easy to learn, fun space shmup where all to a surprisingly kicking vanilla soundtrack (seriously, check it out on YT if you like space westerns) The gameplay is a little repetitive, but getting bigger and bigger ships is just so satisfying.For this price? I haven't had this much fun in ages. Hope for an improved sequel someday. 7/10.			"

There are plenty of spacesims where you can hull contraband to get this type of gameplay if youre looking for it. Its lame- For the on sale price and on sale price only I would recommend to a younger crowd. Its simple and childish "

												Rebel Galaxy is a rather 2D depiction of space travel and combat with limited gameplay options. However, the game is nice looking and the slow grind to earn money makes upgrading your ship feel great. Getting larger and larger ships as the game progresses feels good but the grind is almost too repetitive. There is also a market that seems a little out of place for the ""space cowboy"" vibe this game usually has. The main campaign is short lived and feels rather pointless by the end. All in all this is a good game to play if you just want to play something mindlessly. A good pick up if its on sale. Fun but not memorable.			"

												There is something incredibly satisfying in aligning your ship alongside another and unleashing every single broadside cannon you have. In combination with the incredible music giving every fight you take a Wild West spin; you truly are on the lawless outskirts of space. You start with nothing and climb all the way to the top in any way you want. Trader, Miner, Mercenary, Pirate. Just be careful who you make enemies with, anything goes in this game.On the subject of trading, Rebel Galaxy contains a simple yet effective trading system with market values that will change in response to local events. Discover trade routes from station to station, capitalise on resource shortages, a station currently being blockaded will be in desperate need of supplies.When you feel strong enough, use a jump gate to travel to one of the many other systems. Make sure you are prepared though; higher risk brings higher reward but you won’t be smiling facing a Dreadnought class ship armed to the teeth. This game stands out as one of its quirks is that it is locked on a 2D plane, honestly I think this brings its benefits. You're at the helm of a capital ship, you wouldn't be doing amazing tricks. It also simplifies the controls, meaning you can focus less on keeping the ship level and more on the actual fight. Just listen to the soundtrack, it completes this game.

												In rebel galaxy you will find yourself on the edges of civilised space, space stations placed anywhere from the hollowed out husk of a mighty asteroid to in orbit around colossal gas giants will be a sight for sore eyes as you pilot your ship into the awaiting docks, the repair bay will offer you a chance to repair the fractured hull, weapons ranging from ionised bursts of plasma to mighty missle batteries having punched through the shield and torn through the hull damaging systems as well as your own weapons, handing over an adequate sum of currency to the shipwright. You may choose to offload cargo, either acquired via the mission board (cargo needs to get around somehow), trade with a cargo vessel you pulled out of the fire as pirates attempted to 'appropriate' its cargo or from the ruined husks of the pirate vessels themselves (maybe even the trader too if you're so inclined)Maybe you're looking for a job? or perhaps to finish one, handing over the agreed upon cargo for a sum of credits, hitting up the mission board to pick out a slew of quests to keep yourself busy as you trek across the system taking on a notorious pirate here, guarding a mining outpost there or perhaps assisting the militia forces take on a pirate convoy, headed by a mighty command ship; there are no shortage of things people want done.And after all that there's the bar, where you could chat up the tender, asking for news he might be partial to, whether it be as simple as an excalation of pirate activity in the sector, or perhaps that one of the stations in the system are going through some rough times, that being said no one pays more for food than those who need it and where there is demand, there is supply, but whether or not you're the one to supply said goods is up to you.Or perhaps you're looking for bounties? Slip the barkeep a couple hunded credits and suddenly you've got the locations to a few people someone out there wants dead, and are willing to pay for it.At the bar you might also meet a merc, spend a couple thousand on a good pilot to watch your back, this section of the galaxy is after all 'mostly' lawless space.Your visit done, you return to your ship, maybe spend a few thousand credits on an enhanced engine, thicker hull plating or better weapons, maybe even a few new tools to help you along the way, making your weapons deadlier, your aim sharper and those pirate scum a little less threatening.Whether you want to take to the stars as space trader extraordinare, feared bounty hunter, humble asteroid miner or parhaps cutthroat pirate, (Perhaps a mix of all four?) Rebel Galaxy can certainly accomodate.{Serious stuff out of the way, I caught a pirate group harassing a salvage crew harvesting the wreck of a giant (at least 12 times the size of my current ship) capital vessel (which you can TOTALLY get later) caught in the midst of a minefield, I noticed a cluster of mines near the enemy vessel on and ended up taking a shot at the explosives, which like a chain reaction of epic preportions exploded (As 'explosives' tend to do) taking out the pirate in a single shot, moments like that is what this game provides, if any of this review sounds like something you'd enjoy than I wholeheartedly recommend Rebel Galaxy.}			"

												Classic Naval Broadside Cannon Combat IN SPACE!This game is a ton of fun, from the moment you start you literally can do anything you want. Whether it be bounty hunting, mining, protecting, exploring. Everything is right there, right away. It's simple with it being on a flat plane (meaning you can't fly up and down, instead you go left, right, and straight). Surprisingly it doesn't take to much away from the game. Combat is fast paced and their is a varity of ships to face, from small fighters to capital ships. Some of your weapons crush small fighters but won't even scratch the paint job against the capital ships. There is plenty of upgrades for your ships and the best part is when you buy a new ship, you don't have to rebuy everything as it swaps out the ship but keeps the equipment and automatically sells the old ship (so if you're a tad short on money it'll do an exchange where it sells your ship first then buys the new ship making it pretty seemless to purchase new things). The sounds are pretty good in the game, I really can't complain. Especially when you hit warp. The voice acting is above average for a game of this production size.All in all, if you like space, I'd have to recommend this game. I got this game when it was $9.99 and to be honest, it would be worth it at $20.00 hands down.			"

Discover trade routes from station to station, capitalise on resource shortages, a station currently being blockaded will be in desperate need of supplies.When you feel strong enough, use a jump gate to travel to one of the many other systems. Make sure you are prepared though; higher risk brings higher reward but you won’t be smiling facing a Dreadnought class ship armed to the teeth. This game stands out as one of its quirks is that it is locked on a 2D plane, honestly I think this brings its benefits. You're at the helm of a capital ship, you wouldn't be doing amazing tricks. It also simplifies the controls, meaning you can focus less on keeping the ship level and more on the actual fight. Just listen to the soundtrack, it completes this game.

												Rebel Galaxy has very fun space battles and for the a indie game has good graphics my only complaint is that the story gets a little boring after about 20 hours of play time but still I think it's worth the price tag			"

												Made by two guys, and you can really see where that is obvious. Lots of cutbacks. For example a male cruiser pilot will suddenly turn female on the comms and ai is shared a lot, meaning a pirate will get interdicted by friendly merchants guild ships who have the exact same ships and exact same all-female captains as the miltia does. Lots of shared and samey stuff.Nevertheless, you can also see where those savings went. Very few bugs, cool aesthetic and with the awesome feature to add your own music even for different situations. This is a super easy to learn, fun space shmup where all to a surprisingly kicking vanilla soundtrack (seriously, check it out on YT if you like space westerns) The gameplay is a little repetitive, but getting bigger and bigger ships is just so satisfying.For this price? I haven't had this much fun in ages. Hope for an improved sequel someday. 7/10.			"

												This is a great space battle and trading game, but it does leave some things to be desired. The main storyline is quite short and I imagine that most people get to the ending without knowing it - its very sudden. The storyline is too short to make saving up for better ships and weapons worthwhile. It's cool to have the biggest, badest ship and tearing enemy's apart with waves of munitions is quite fun, but it's a side mission grind that gets you to that point. If you follow the storyline's natural progression, you wont even get close to obtaining the best ships. All in all, time worth spent and I enjoyed most things about this game. If you can get it on sale, I'd say go for it.			"

												- Feels like a console game on PC- Arcadic, Lacking detail alot of detail a space sim should have.- Music is good if you like hearing the same few tracks on repeat.- There is gravity in space ( Your ship cannot move anywhere besides forwards and backwards / left and right- The Combat as goofy- To me a space sim should be about exploration, combat, mining, trading, and even building.. this is very limited in detail in these aspects- I bought it for $1.48 and played about $1.47 worth of it- The storyline starts you off looking for your aunt, runs into smuggler gameplay, yada yada. There are plenty of spacesims where you can hull contraband to get this type of gameplay if youre looking for it. Its lame- For the on sale price and on sale price only I would recommend to a younger crowd. Its simple and childish "

												Rebel Galaxy is a rather 2D depiction of space travel and combat with limited gameplay options. However, the game is nice looking and the slow grind to earn money makes upgrading your ship feel great. Getting larger and larger ships as the game progresses feels good but the grind is almost too repetitive. There is also a market that seems a little out of place for the ""space cowboy"" vibe this game usually has. The main campaign is short lived and feels rather pointless by the end. All in all this is a good game to play if you just want to play something mindlessly. A good pick up if its on sale. Fun but not memorable.			"

												In rebel galaxy you will find yourself on the edges of civilised space, space stations placed anywhere from the hollowed out husk of a mighty asteroid to in orbit around colossal gas giants will be a sight for sore eyes as you pilot your ship into the awaiting docks, the repair bay will offer you a chance to repair the fractured hull, weapons ranging from ionised bursts of plasma to mighty missle batteries having punched through the shield and torn through the hull damaging systems as well as your own weapons, handing over an adequate sum of currency to the shipwright. You may choose to offload cargo, either acquired via the mission board (cargo needs to get around somehow), trade with a cargo vessel you pulled out of the fire as pirates attempted to 'appropriate' its cargo or from the ruined husks of the pirate vessels themselves (maybe even the trader too if you're so inclined)Maybe you're looking for a job? or perhaps to finish one, handing over the agreed upon cargo for a sum of credits, hitting up the mission board to pick out a slew of quests to keep yourself busy as you trek across the system taking on a notorious pirate here, guarding a mining outpost there or perhaps assisting the militia forces take on a pirate convoy, headed by a mighty command ship; there are no shortage of things people want done.And after all that there's the bar, where you could chat up the tender, asking for news he might be partial to, whether it be as simple as an excalation of pirate activity in the sector, or perhaps that one of the stations in the system are going through some rough times, that being said no one pays more for food than those who need it and where there is demand, there is supply, but whether or not you're the one to supply said goods is up to you.Or perhaps you're looking for bounties? Slip the barkeep a couple hunded credits and suddenly you've got the locations to a few people someone out there wants dead, and are willing to pay for it.At the bar you might also meet a merc, spend a couple thousand on a good pilot to watch your back, this section of the galaxy is after all 'mostly' lawless space.Your visit done, you return to your ship, maybe spend a few thousand credits on an enhanced engine, thicker hull plating or better weapons, maybe even a few new tools to help you along the way, making your weapons deadlier, your aim sharper and those pirate scum a little less threatening.Whether you want to take to the stars as space trader extraordinare, feared bounty hunter, humble asteroid miner or parhaps cutthroat pirate, (Perhaps a mix of all four?) Rebel Galaxy can certainly accomodate.{Serious stuff out of the way, I caught a pirate group harassing a salvage crew harvesting the wreck of a giant (at least 12 times the size of my current ship) capital vessel (which you can TOTALLY get later) caught in the midst of a minefield, I noticed a cluster of mines near the enemy vessel on and ended up taking a shot at the explosives, which like a chain reaction of epic preportions exploded (As 'explosives' tend to do) taking out the pirate in a single shot, moments like that is what this game provides, if any of this review sounds like something you'd enjoy than I wholeheartedly recommend Rebel Galaxy.}			"

												Classic Naval Broadside Cannon Combat IN SPACE!This game is a ton of fun, from the moment you start you literally can do anything you want. Whether it be bounty hunting, mining, protecting, exploring. Everything is right there, right away. It's simple with it being on a flat plane (meaning you can't fly up and down, instead you go left, right, and straight). Surprisingly it doesn't take to much away from the game. Combat is fast paced and their is a varity of ships to face, from small fighters to capital ships. Some of your weapons crush small fighters but won't even scratch the paint job against the capital ships. There is plenty of upgrades for your ships and the best part is when you buy a new ship, you don't have to rebuy everything as it swaps out the ship but keeps the equipment and automatically sells the old ship (so if you're a tad short on money it'll do an exchange where it sells your ship first then buys the new ship making it pretty seemless to purchase new things). The sounds are pretty good in the game, I really can't complain. Especially when you hit warp. The voice acting is above average for a game of this production size.All in all, if you like space, I'd have to recommend this game. I got this game when it was $9.99 and to be honest, it would be worth it at $20.00 hands down.			"

												This game fills a void in the market: accessible (arcadey) freelancer-esque open-world space game. That was a mouthful.I'm completely enamoured with this game right now. It has fun naval-style combat (complete with broadside cannons), upgrades to buy, ships to save up for, and space pirates to blow up. It feels good, it looks good, and it's a boat load of fun.However, I'm worried that the game's content will come up a bit thin. The missions can get repetitive very quickly, and there is a lot of repetitive action going on with a very thin reward and upgrade structure. I'm only 7 or so hours in, so time will tell if the depth opens up later on.I hope the devs continue to build on to this and flesh it out in the future. As it is, it's a good game. But It could be a lot better too. "

And the diverging missions that offer a real choice in the universe is amazingly interesting. Game play wise its pretty solid, though I do with you had the ability to travel on the Z axis as well, but hey, it makes fighting a bit more of a challenger when you're twice the size of the target. Soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I love the Sci-fi western feel. Makes me think of Firefly meets Freelancer.10/10 would highly recommend.			"

That would have just made this game even better than perfect.  The gameplay is pretty easy to understand, it's easy to find your way for your quests, and the map is pretty awesome.

												Disclosure: I received the key from the devs a few days before release.Pros:-Amazing interface that works perfectly with both Mouse+Keyboard and gamepads.-Easy to follow Video+text tutorials simmilar to those in Deus Ex Human revolution.-Addictive combat on a 2D plane but with a twist: fighters and gunships evade fire in 3D, which opens up more room for specialized weapons. (and the developers capitalized on that fact)-Everything is voiceacted. And it's good :)-Progression is slow but steady. It will take you dozens of hours to get the best ship & gear but since you constantly advance a weapon turret here and a subsystem there it will feel a lot less grindy.-Progression is completely open and the campaign reacts to your behaviour (so, if you choose to be a pirate it just works!)-You can mix your on audio files to the soundtrack collection and even differentiate Combat, Station, Ambient and other types of music usage.Cons:-I would have really loved this to be a $40+ title with even more ships, factions and better skyboxes.

												Enemy levels up when you add items to your ship. This breaks the game.There is no point in getting a better ship or better weapons and items if the battles are just the same anyway.I had to find this out the hard way when I installed some systems that made the value of my ship go up. And then the enemies everywhere instantly got better weapon. Because that doesn't break immersion right?You can basically control the enemy difficulty by NOT putting stuff on your ship.It's a real shame too because everything else in this game is great.			"

												Combat is shallow, boring, repetitive and easy. The progression for the equipment curve is bizarre, everything almost doubles with the upgraded versions (weapon damage, shields etc.) Feels weird equipping your first next level equipment that basically obseletes your other weaponryTrading UI is a pain to use to find the information you want. Tractoring specific items is also an issue.The trading is made more interesting with random events affecting prices one way or the other. It was fun for a while running embargo blockades for the big $$.In this game an asteroid field is 5 rocks and a tin can, a nebula is a few puffs of smoke. All that really changes is the system backgrounds.All the stations are basically the same. There's not much personality in this game.Hailing system is half-done e.g. hail someone emitting a distress signal, and they'll tell you they don't need any help with anything, until you close your distance a certain amount.Someone offers to give up in a fight, and you reject it? Can't push them for more credits, or even take their original offer.You are free to warp in any direction, but you will be pulled out of warp near any object and don't have any direct control over your speed (fields and other environments are probably so small in size and barebones, so you don't get caught in them warping)This leaves all the systems without much structure. If you want to go to a station across the map, just point your ship and go. Maybe you'll warp right through a miniature junk field without hitting anything and get a 20 credit exploration bonus (equipment is in the thousands, I don't know why this is a thing?)Another fun feature with warp is occasionally you'll want to catch a special ship/s that comes up on the system map. You warp to them, and the game will match your warps so you're in formation, instead of letting you blast past and cancel their warp.Also, game says ""warp cancelled by stellar mass"" every time you're pulled out of warp, regardless of what caused it. Come on guys.If you're after something like Freelancer or even something like Pirates! I wouldn't bother			"

												Fresh and simple, this game manages to create the feeling of an enormous, dynamic Freelancer-style sandbox with fantastically simple arcade-style controls.  Easily one of the most intuitive games I've ever played, and one of the prettiest (and in light of that, one of the best optimised too - running far better than games with lower requirements and looking better than some with higher requirements too).  This game feels a lot like Diablo II, perhaps unsurprisingly since those games are amongst the staggering pedigree of the team of TWO core developers.   The two games on Steam that seem closest to it in aesthetics and playstyle would be, I think, Starpoint Gemini 2 and Drifter.  I've got both and after 1 hour on Rebel Galaxy I already know I'm going to spend much more time on this than the other two.  It is far simpler to pick up and have fun with than Starpoint Gemini 2 - a real sense of instant fun and adventure - and it's significantly more polished and deep than Drifter, as well as being much prettier.My only gripe with the game is that all the action takes place in a plane as opposed to having real 3D movement.  You can't pitch your ship up or down.  Hardly game-breaking, and I suppose it's true that the vast majority of real star systems are organised in a plane, but they are far from 2-dimensional from the point of view of a human space-ship!Don't expect an X-series experience.  This game is much closer to classics like Freelancer and Tachyon: The Fringe.  It's not shallow, but it's certainly not ""spreadsheets in space"" either.			"

												I bought this in a previous 50% sale and would say that at this price it is definitely worth it, however after having now played it for 30+ hours (and finding it hard to put it down each time) I think I would have paid full price too!As many reviews have already stated this game is like the love child of Sid Meier's Pirates and Freelancer, it's neither one or the other but has emulated some of the features from both games and merged these into an interesting hybrid. The 2D naval style fighting makes it less complicated than a 3D counterpart but don\'t let that fool you that it's less of a challenge. The variety of ships, weapons and modules give it enough diversity to keep you playing for that next upgrade but without bombarding you with sheets of complicated stats. The soundtrack isn't going to be everyone\'s taste but I think it's awesome and really suits the pace of the game.Yes it's a bit clichéd, the main story is short and it's quite simplified compared to others in the genre but that's the beauty of it - it isn't trying to copy a successful franchise and then failing miserably; it has it's own spin on space rpg that's different whilst being familiar at the same time.Edit: Removed typos caused by mobile app			"

												A short learning curve, but the games throws you into the action fast in a universe where you can't count on everthing you run into to be 'in your league'. After getting smoked A LOT, I learned how to judge fights quickly and get away if I stepped in something too deep. Looking forward to seeing if the trade system gets deep, but just as a shooter it's great.First, it's 2D space, if that isn't obvious from the videos- but there's good reason for it. INstead of traditional 'chase them and try to shoot their♥♥♥♥♥ style dogfighting, it's battleship style broadside combat with an interesting fighter/gunnery system where your turrets can be set to auto or manually controlled as needed.Loving this game. Recommend a gamepad, I use an Xbox 360 controller. Tons of fun with it, and the controls are well mapped (although I find myself constantly forgetting about where to find what I need between the Start menu and Y meu)			"

												The simplest way to describe it is Naval Space Western Game.You travel around in outer space, doing missions, fighting space pirates, buying and selling stuffs from planet to planet. But I won't call this space sim in the sense of freelancer or X series! You actually only travel in one plane. there's no vertical movement. And you're not flying a dinky fighter. You're flying something bigger than that, a frigate or gunship at least. Which fight with broadsides. Why? Because space is an ocean. It's Naval Space.Why western? Because it's a space western game as well. Just check the trailer and absorb the music and aesthetics.In other word, weird but cool game.			"

												Wasn't paid for my review.  Let's get that out there in the open.  *pushes beer under his bed with his feet, all slick-like*AHEMThe game is a prettier, more entertaining version of Space Rangers.  You can choose to slay pirates, trade comodities, or mine your way into a larger, faster, more powerful ship all pimped out with the latest murder gadgets ranging from flak guns to missle turrets.  Broadside firing is a nice plus in the middle of battle while all the other guns are auto targeting.  Lots and lots of fun.Pros:+Lots of upgrades+Lots of stuff to explore/hack/kill+Space is beautiful and makes me wee nips perky+Tons of missions+Lots of ship variations (Though I'm limited on what I can see this early in)+Battles need finger dex and quick reflexes when against more powerful ships (I'm assuming controller is easier)+Character models are pretty cool+Warp auto disables when you get to target, so no need for timed disengages+Customize firing/targeting for auto-turrets as you move into a good firing position for broadside+Battles can be rather long, but hella enjoyable when you beat out capital ships with crappy weapons/armor+Love the western-rock music vibeCons:-Missions are the samethings over and over-Autosaving only kicks in when you dock, so DOCK OFTEN or exit to force autosave-Warps disengaging due to pirate ambushes are no bueno early in game-Warps disengaging in mine fields is no bueno-Warps disengaging in electrical storms is no bueno-Warps disengaging in astroid belts is no bueno-Auto plotting courses would be nifty-Dev is buying reviews with early access codes all illuminati-like-Didn't come with beerI give the game 5 Landsharks out of a 6 pack			"

												Charming, if limited, arcade game written by the creator of Torchlight.Whilst it really isn't anything special, Rebel Galaxy enjoys a level of charm not often seen in the modern gaming world. From the sci-fi western setting to the naval-esque space combat, Rebel Galaxy takes a lot of smart-but-simple game mechanics and throws them together in one thoroughly enjoyable and deceptivel moreish space romp.Whilst it will feel familiar to both fans of games such as the X series as well as hardened ARPG players, both will see where the limits shine: from the limited dimensions of space combat to the under-developed item metagame, Rebel Galaxy is very much a jack of many (if not all) trades, but a master of none.

												I really want to like this game because I love the whole Firefly thing it has going on. There are definitely things to like about it, but it ultimately is just a very boring space sim with a kinda lousy battle system IMO.Turn-ons:+Firefly!+Soundtrack is great!+NPCs are marvelous!Turn-offs:--The broadside combat. I played the game for 3+ hours and fought a fair number of battles against pirates in that time. I even upgraded to better weapons and different types of weapons. But the combat just never started to feel good. Broadside combat is great with sea vessels because they are both sea vessels. But in this game your ship is confined to a flat plane while enemy ships are flying loops over you and under you as you try to lock onto them. It's more like trying to use a sluggish wooden sailing ship to engage in broadside combat with a bunch of airplanes and submarines. I'm not saying that it's impossible or anything, but I did find it really irritating and it did not start to get better.--It is very empty and boring. It has all of the things that space sims normally have, such as trading and merc missions and ships parts that can be upgraded and so on. But I put in several hours into this game and I spent most of that time staring at the butt of a ship flying in a straight line toward a mission destination. I seriously just set the controller down on my desk, folded my hands, and watched a picture of a space ship. For minutes. MINUTES ON END. I found out that I could upgrade all of my engines and boosters etc to get some more speed out of the ship, and I was feeling very positive about that at first, but then I realized I was STILL pretty much spending most of my time staring at the butt of a ship flying in a straight line. So much yawn.--The game seems heavily skewed toward playing as muscle. If you tend to lean a little more pacifist/trader in space sims, then this game does not seem very friendly towards those types. When I first started running missions, I initially was only accepting missions that the game explicitly labeled as VERY LOW RISK, which were usually just trading missions that asked me to go pick something up and bring it back or transport some cargo from A to B. But EVERY SINGLE ONE of these missions resulted in a scripted ambush attack from multiple pirate ships. Literally every time. So there's not really any point accepting the missions that pass themselves off as the pacifist types because this game shoves you into combat literally every time. Every mission is a combat mission. Always. Without fail. Or so this was my experience.--But did I mention how incredibly boring it is? This was really the thing that made me stop playing the most. Most of my time spent playing this game I did not feel like I was playing a game. I felt like I was staring at the butt of a ship that was doing nothing.And then it occurred to me that I could be playing a game that felt like doing things. So I'm done with it.I love the whole Firefly thing, and apparently lots of people think the game is just great, but man... I could not stay awake while playing this thing.			"

Product received for free
												Rebel Galaxy is a very casual space pilot ""simulator"", all combat is really handled in 2D and mostly resembles sea battles (broadside artillery, all ships except fighters manouver on the same ""height"") so if you're looking for a serious space-sim it's not for you.Gameplay consists of main storyline broken up by (a lot) of generated sidequests which get a bit boring after a while since there's only a few types (search and destroy, delivery, defend target, pick up object). Since main story quickly ramps up in difficulty you'll be grinding these quite a lot. Apart from sidequests you can also play as a trader, buying low and selling high, a miner selling resources found in asteroids, pirate hunter looking for bounties or a pirate hunting civillian ships.As you progress you will upgrade your ship with new weapons, shields and additional equipment, every once in a while buying a new ship.Pros:+ Enjoyable space combat (if you dont mind the sea battles feel).+ Plenty of ships/upgrades to work towards.+ Decent voice-acting (somewhat repetetive lines from enemies).+ Multiple ways to progress.+ Great musicCons:- Requires a lot of grinding sidequests to progress.- Not much depth or variety beyond the basics.

It feels like a rushed college project where the devs just wanted to get it turned in and get their passing grade.The lack of content, the lack of everything in this game makes it a grindfest and a pretty boring one at that. Seriously you could buy this game, play the 3 hours and 59min and get your refund, because the next 25+ hours are the exact same thing.Missions are ""Go here and kill everything"" - No real strategy involved other than don't get overrun. You can kite for days.Ship upgrades lack diversity.There's nothing else to do. You fly around galaxies that all feel the same, going from point A to point B, mining and trade are simplistic time wasters that try to add complexity but fails. "

												Boring and buggy as hell. You are going to die a lot, and it's not because the little fighters have more firepower than you, but because of atmosphere that will destroy your ship in the middle of space, or some 20 clicks from a moon, yes a moon, smaller than your ship, and destroys you with its atmosphere. Or because of Militia suddenly turning on you and killing you with 20 ships as soon as you've completed the mission to help them rid of pirates, etc... etc...It is a nicely presented game with noobish bugs and ideas. Also the game was designed for a console and it plays like this on the PC too. Pretty annoying! The camera which is changing view randomly as it feels the need, and not letting you decide what you want to see on the screen is a hell to work with. The story is boring, the missions are repetitive, and all of the same sort. You basically almost have to fight or run, no matter what mission is it. The guilds are just an extension of the mission system, and nothing else. All in all, this game, if expanded upon, would be great, but it looks like it's unfinished, with development cut short before major features were added.			"

Often you are killed as the mission ratings are listed as low and you jump into a battle with more ships than you can count. You will basically find yourself grinding out mission after mission to afford the next upgrade rather than skill having any influence on the battle.			"

												Not only is this game inspired by one of the single greatest television shows ever made, Firefly, but it also is one of the single greatest games ever made. It's combat mechanics are normal, yes, but they still feel new. If your playing on a mouse and keyboard, I highly recomend that you get some sort of controller. Trust me, the game gets at least 80% better with the smooth movements of a controller's anolog sticks.Other aspects of epicness include its BADASS style. the graphics, gameplay, and ESPECIALLY music compliment this games similarity to Firefly. The only difference being that there are aliens, its rock type music instead of pure country, and the combat is space based, as opposed to firefly's ground based combat.Speaking of music, it's amazing. It may have been made before this game came out, but its almost as if it was MADE for this thing. (link:

												This is a pretty good space RPG. In addition to the main campaign quest, you pretty much go around the galaxy accepting different bounties so that you can upgrade your ship and complete the harder quests in the campaign. Almost all the bounties are combat-type bounties. You can also acquire money through trade on the commodities market, but it can be very time-consuming. The key to commodities trading is finding out what outposts will pay the highest for various products. For instance, a scientific oytposts will pay higher for intellectual property and tech stuff, but a rogue or outlaw outposts will pay more for illicit drugs and whatnot. You can also gain trading info by reading news boards and speaking to bartenders. Traveling between space stations and various parts of the galaxy can be boring. It can take several minutes to travel between points on opposite sides of the galaxy.The graphics are nice and the music is awesome, but it gets a little monotonous after awhile since it plays constantly on a loop throughout the entire game. The combat is interesting. It is ""naval-style"" combat, which means your primary guns fire from the side. This imposes a significant learning curve to combat since you have to fight sideways, which makes it harder to see incoming missiles. There are secondary weapons that you can switch to that don't require sideways combat, but then you have to constantly adjust your ship angle if you switch weapons a lot. It is challenging but rewarding when you finally get it all down.Rebel Galaxy is a fun and nice alternative to most space sims that require a lot of management and alliance building over a long period of time. Rebel Galaxy commences with all that by giving you a campaign and a ship. The rest is up to you.			"

Upgrade when you need to, learn to use missle weapons.  Dont be a bull in a china shop, use tactics where to shoot enemy ships and positioning is key.  Upgrade defenses first and foremost.If you try to rush this game it will seem like such a grind, trust me I did that and my first 10 hours was not fun, take some time look at the scenery, watch who you do missions for this will determine your friends, tactical fights and sometimes you just have to withdraw you just have to.  If you take it easy just move on through you will love this game, I do at least.If you push and grind and max everything as soon as you can, I fear you will come to really not like this game, and that would be to bad because it offers so much for the price.Good luck in the milky way and beyond commanders.

												A very good game ,its a  fun world and what I would consider a perfict blue print for what could be the standerd for this style of game. This game could easly be adapted in to a HUGE list of other worlds , Star gate , Star wars, firefly you name it this game could be made in to the skyrim of space games. I would pay good money for a large expansion of this game.			"

												I hesitate to give this a positive review, but I suppose it is good in its own quirky way.  The gameplay itself is very, very, very, VERY repetitive however the story is fairly decent and the combat is pretty satisfying albiet two dimensional with massive broadsides, but no real fighter play, there are fighters, but A you can't control one of them and B outisde of large groups they are just annoying. After the end of the story thats pretty much it, you can continue to grind if you wish, but there isn't much to do. I reccomend it on sale.			"

												I like this game.  A LOT!  I bought it because I was looking for something similar to EVE, but without the malicious player base that EVE is notorious for.  This game filled that nitch nicely.  PROS:This is one of the few games I've played recently, where the keyboard/mouse control scheme is every bit as good as the Console Controller scheme.    Intuitive and effective keyboard control make this a joy to play without a controller.The Graphics are Very nice, and Don't require a Monster video card to run.  (I'm running it on an old nvidia 9800 gt with 512mb of Vram and it runs just fine.  Framerate rarely drops below 60fps, unless I turn on depth of field and motion blur.  Then it still plays fine until I get into a nebula, where my framerate starts to crawl with certain effects, so I would recommend playing with those two settings turned off if you are using a lower end video card.The story is interesting enough and the voice acting is well done.The combat is where this Game really really shines.  It's very well executed, with controls that feel natural and fluid, and the explosions when enemy ships pop are extremely satisfying.    The 'Missions' section of the game  is well set up and fun to play.  Mining works fine, and trading is functional enough.You can hire a mercenary (only one at a time) to fly with you and help you fight, and early in the game, they are quite strong.This game has a really cool feature called 'warp pairing' where you escort a ship by moving up in a flanking position and select the 'enable warp pairing' feature, that basicly causes you to follow the lead ship through warp while staying in formation  (sort of like gang warping in EVE online)  It works well most of the time, however, asteroid fields and such can cause the ship you're escorting to get a little confused sometimes.  It's still fun to do though and is a nice change from the typical; ""Go here and kill everything."" type missions. Cons:One of the biggest Cons for me is the difficutly system.  It is based on a number of factors, (Star system, equipment grade, ship type, etc) and it works well early on.  However around the later part of the second system and beyond, the difficulty gets a bit unstable.  You will run into large difficulty spikes that seem to come out of nowhere.  It leaves the game feeling a little unpolished, and can be frustrating.  (in the second system, I was using all Mark III equipment and weapons, and I got a Mark IV mining laser from an enemy drop so I popped it on... and promptly got blown up over and over again until I took that little booger back off again.  Adding that one cheesy mining laser pushed me up into a higher difficulty bracket and made doing even simple missions very difficult or even impossible.  My advice?  Don't upgrade weapons one at a time.  Save your money and do them all at once so you actually have the firepower to take on that next difficulty bracket.)Trading can be profitable, but is a bit clunky.  There is no realtime feed telling you what prices are in various stations/systems so the only way to see if you will make a profit is to physically go there and look for yourself.  A live feed (or at the very least a price list that updates once a day or so, would be a huge help, and would save the player from making tons of wasted trips to stations.)One of the few things I dislike about the keyboard/mouse setup is what I call; ""the-one-press-wonder-key"".  The 'E' key does various things depending what is available at the moment.  The problem lies with the fact that if several options are open at the same time, the key starts popping from one option to another as you fly close to them.  I've been caught trying to 'tractor beam' some loot into my hold and had the prompt switch as I'm pressing the key so that instead of getting the loot, I warp away.  Same thing when trying to loot while close to a station.  You end up docking instead of looting.  This happens alot and is pretty frustrating sometimes.Enemies tend to spam really annoying weapons at you when you move beyond the first area.  Leach missles and mines that screw up your engines and shields are used constantly in the later game and they are quite irritating.  There are ways to protect yourself to an extent, but they require precious component slots to equip, and most ships don't have enough space for all the systems you will need. Verdict:Even with the Cons mentioned above, I find this game very fun (I've spent over 300 hours on Rebel Galaxy at the time of this writing) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Space ship game based around Capital ship combat and broadside bombardments!  There's nothing as satisfying as scraping hulls with an enemy ship and unleashing your Broadsides into it!  Amazing!			"

												I love this game! I do most of my playing when I'm on duty and have some down time, so please, don't let my in game time fool you. I have played this game A LOT! It has it's qwerks, but there's noting like releasing a full hail of weaponry down range from your broadside cannons! I really like the music as well. I also like the fact that if you don't like the music, you can change it to whatever you like. Sure, there is some repetition here and there. Seems every bartender in the galaxy is the same person. It really doesn't bother me that bad. This works great with the Steam controller. Controlls are intuitive and eas to learn. It'll be no time at all before you are out and about fiding the best prices for the goods you have, or out hunting bounties for killing local thugs. Be warned though, tis game can get brutal really fast. Where you might dominate in one system, you can get totally owned in the next system.I will say this, while it doesn't have the free flying 3D movement, this game does take me back to my love for Freelancer. They do manage to make it feel natural.If your shy about the price, catch it on sale.			"

												There's a little bit of grinding to do in this game, but they keep it fun and somewhat interesting (the bad♥♥♥♥♥music helps), and it is mainly in the beginning of the game when your ship is miserable. But once you get a decent ship with good gear, the game becomes a total blast. EVen the repetiton of side missions somehow remains fun. It's the closest to a Firefly video game I'll ever get, I guess. Pretty top-notch, this game.			"

												I bought the game hoping it would be like freelancer only improved. I was disappointed.This game has a ton of potential but the storyline is horrendously under-developed, there are just 3 mission templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort) which makes the game feel repetitive and much of a grind after about 5 hours into the game.The different game areas are largely the same, each area/star system is just a slightly different layout with a random number of stations and varied difficulty zone rating.The mining and trading mechanics of this game just plain suck which really forces you to only do missions. The game really needs some sort of crafting feature for mining and/or trading to be worth the hassle.This is such a shame because the game has so much potential to be everything freelancer was. But instead all we got was a super cut down version of freelancer with updated graphics.			"

												Boring and buggy as hell. You are going to die a lot, and it's not because the little fighters have more firepower than you, but because of atmosphere that will destroy your ship in the middle of space, or some 20 clicks from a moon, yes a moon, smaller than your ship, and destroys you with its atmosphere. Or because of Militia suddenly turning on you and killing you with 20 ships as soon as you've completed the mission to help them rid of pirates, etc... etc...It is a nicely presented game with noobish bugs and ideas. Also the game was designed for a console and it plays like this on the PC too. Pretty annoying! The camera which is changing view randomly as it feels the need, and not letting you decide what you want to see on the screen is a hell to work with. The story is boring, the missions are repetitive, and all of the same sort. You basically almost have to fight or run, no matter what mission is it. The guilds are just an extension of the mission system, and nothing else. All in all, this game, if expanded upon, would be great, but it looks like it's unfinished, with development cut short before major features were added.			"

												It looked fun at first, but I got sick of it very quickly. The manually targeted weapon that your ship has is utterly useless compared to the autoaiming laser turrets you can get - or even the mining laser. Missiles are completely useless. Buying the best available shield is relatively cheap and makes you basicly invulnerable in 80% of the encounters, while the other 20% swarm you with so much enemies that no equipment will save you anyway. The threat assesment that is given with each mission is completely unrelated to reality too - that random swarm that kills you can just as well come from a low risk mission (or it may be an independent random spawn close to the mission location).The autosave feature in this game is the worst - it only saves when you dock. It is really annoying to have to dock all the time instead of doing 4-5 missions at once, just because of the risk that some encouter would be too hard. No manual saves.There was also one random ""save compression error"" followed by a crash that returned me 2 docks back.			"

Often you are killed as the mission ratings are listed as low and you jump into a battle with more ships than you can count. You will basically find yourself grinding out mission after mission to afford the next upgrade rather than skill having any influence on the battle.			"

												Really good and fun game. Played almost non stop for 2 weeks straight and beat it with 37 hrs on record, probably could have gone quicker but I enjoyed taking on side quests and building up my ship. I finished the game with a Manticore destroyer, mk6 shields/armor/broadsides, mk5 everything else. The campaign could likely be finished with an even smaller ship as long as you can deal some high damage. There's still some game left for me to play after beating it, the game goes right back normal just without the campaign mission.  I haven't had the chance to play with a cuiser or dreadnaught yet, and some of the side quest missions are still pretty challenging with my destroyer.Technically the game runs smooth as butter, and looks pretty decent. The game only crashed on me a single time while playing. I did have a problem where if I left the game paused for 10-20 minutes my computer would restart? Never happened while playing though. I played with a KB/M and thought it was fairly easy to get into, it definitely appears setup for easy controller play though.For a budget game it just feels really polished and well thought out. I LOVE the music selections, even if they can get a bit repetitive.  Worth the normal $20 price, but a great buy when on sale!			"

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes sandbox / space exploration / shoot em up's.... well... .....I'd recomend it to nearly everyone.    I WOULDN'T recommend it to anyone who was involved with the creation of a game called Freelancer that came out nearly ten years ago.... they'd probably wonder why these game developers stole every single idea they had in their game... slapped some differnet names on the characters 'n races .... and started charging people money for it like it was their own original idea.Don't get me wrong.... I really like this game (probably because it's practically identical to freelancer... which I loved ten years ago). I would, and do, recommend it to all who like this genre. But I'm left wondering...... did the developers buy the rights to the original Freelancer game? ...did they just steal EVERY idea they used in their game from it thinking nobody would notice???  ... or did they think that gamers inevitably forget about the games they love and play for hundreds upon hundreds of hours as the years pass. I haven't forgotten about Freelancer.... and in my opinion.... even for a ten year old game.... it's still better than this one.			"

												I think it's hard for me to express how much I'm in love with this game. The unique style of 'flat' space combat allows for combat to be focused on broadside cannons. The lack of a ""Z"" axis of movement allows focus for more tactical real time decision making in combat instead of focusing on keeping your nose pointed at a lead indicator like most space games. The music and theme are amazing as well! This is the frontier of space, so naturally theres an old west theme throughout The music consists of driving rock & metal rooted in the old west. It evokes fond memories of the T.V. show Firefly during some chords. It's worth mentioning that if you're looking for a space exploration game along the lines of the X series or Elite, that's not really what this is. This is a space adventure with exploration elements. On sale this game is an absolute must buy imo, but it's worth the current full price as well.			"

												I'm addicted.........That being said. This game is AWESOME. I'd of reviewed it sooner cause I instantly fell in love, but I've been unable to peel my eyes away. Every free minute I get on the PC, I'm playing this.It's a great semi-casual game that compares a lot to FTL in it's rougeness, and as far as combat and missions go it seems to take a lot away from EVE Online. There are other comparisons but these stand out the most. The missions and combat have managed to keep me just on my toes enough every time I start to open my mouth to say ""This is getting repetitive."" I get put in my place by some new tactic a higher level enemy is using. There is a bit of story line to the game, but It's there more to keep your compass from spinning as you progress than it to make the game linear. You could play for hours and hours and never touch the main mission and not get bored.I really can't think of much bad to say about this game. One downside that comes to mind is warp times can seem a bit long after you've been doing a lot of hopping around, but it's really not so bad as there are ways to negate it. Also, aiming with turrets at small targets can be a nuisance if they start maneuvering above or below you.Other than, a well spent 20 bucks. I've paid $40+ for a lot less entertaining crapware. If you enjoy Spacey, shiny thing. Get this damn game! You won't regret it.			"

												People NEED to play this game. It is so much more fun than some ofthose hard core space sims like EVE and Elite. Its simple, fun, beautifulto look at and has one killer soundtrack. A guy that made a guide saidit is one of the quickest ways to feel like Malcom Reynolds, and he wasright. This is awesome!			"

												I hesitate to give this a positive review, but I suppose it is good in its own quirky way.  The gameplay itself is very, very, very, VERY repetitive however the story is fairly decent and the combat is pretty satisfying albiet two dimensional with massive broadsides, but no real fighter play, there are fighters, but A you can't control one of them and B outisde of large groups they are just annoying. After the end of the story thats pretty much it, you can continue to grind if you wish, but there isn't much to do. I reccomend it on sale.			"

												I bought the game hoping it would be like freelancer only improved. I was disappointed.This game has a ton of potential but the storyline is horrendously under-developed, there are just 3 mission templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort) which makes the game feel repetitive and much of a grind after about 5 hours into the game.The different game areas are largely the same, each area/star system is just a slightly different layout with a random number of stations and varied difficulty zone rating.The mining and trading mechanics of this game just plain suck which really forces you to only do missions. The game really needs some sort of crafting feature for mining and/or trading to be worth the hassle.This is such a shame because the game has so much potential to be everything freelancer was. But instead all we got was a super cut down version of freelancer with updated graphics.			"

												Boring and buggy as hell. You are going to die a lot, and it's not because the little fighters have more firepower than you, but because of atmosphere that will destroy your ship in the middle of space, or some 20 clicks from a moon, yes a moon, smaller than your ship, and destroys you with its atmosphere. Or because of Militia suddenly turning on you and killing you with 20 ships as soon as you've completed the mission to help them rid of pirates, etc... etc...It is a nicely presented game with noobish bugs and ideas. Also the game was designed for a console and it plays like this on the PC too. Pretty annoying! The camera which is changing view randomly as it feels the need, and not letting you decide what you want to see on the screen is a hell to work with. The story is boring, the missions are repetitive, and all of the same sort. You basically almost have to fight or run, no matter what mission is it. The guilds are just an extension of the mission system, and nothing else. All in all, this game, if expanded upon, would be great, but it looks like it's unfinished, with development cut short before major features were added.			"

												It looked fun at first, but I got sick of it very quickly. The manually targeted weapon that your ship has is utterly useless compared to the autoaiming laser turrets you can get - or even the mining laser. Missiles are completely useless. Buying the best available shield is relatively cheap and makes you basicly invulnerable in 80% of the encounters, while the other 20% swarm you with so much enemies that no equipment will save you anyway. The threat assesment that is given with each mission is completely unrelated to reality too - that random swarm that kills you can just as well come from a low risk mission (or it may be an independent random spawn close to the mission location).The autosave feature in this game is the worst - it only saves when you dock. It is really annoying to have to dock all the time instead of doing 4-5 missions at once, just because of the risk that some encouter would be too hard. No manual saves.There was also one random ""save compression error"" followed by a crash that returned me 2 docks back.			"

You will basically find yourself grinding out mission after mission to afford the next upgrade rather than skill having any influence on the battle.			"

												The best way to describe this game, I think, is to imagine a simplified Freelancer that doesn't take itself nearly as seriously. It has this sort of disjointed western-slash-Caribbean pirate theme to it that works brilliantly in its favor, lending a much needed injection of comic-book stylization to the genre of space trade & combat sim. The voice acting is good enough not to be grating or distracting, which is great. What's a little less great (but maybe not by a lot) is the two-dimensional flight. Again, simplified. A 6DOF shooter, this is not. If you can do naval combat, you will probably do fine here. To me, this makes the game feel a little strange, not being able to fly up or down in space. But not a deal breaker. The soundtrack is very fun and unique, but some of the tracks end up sounding a little same-y after a few hours. Gameplay pacing moves about the same as Freelancer, so if you enjoyed that title, you will probably feel justified in spending full price on this one. If you're expecting a fast-paced space shooter, maybe wait until it goes on sale.			"

Never gets old, especially if you try new turret combos etc. You can either pour accurate broadside fire from afar, or turn on your deflectors and ram the enemy ships in the♥♥♥♥♥ Soundtrack, is freaking awesome.

												Rebel Galaxy: Ah what a fine Adventure made by 2x Developers :) Imagine a Firefly Space Adventure with Mass Effect's space flight bits and the naval combat from AC: Black Flag. You can trade, mine or fight & each one has it's affect from Rp point of view. For example, let's say you are bringing food to a station in famine: you can increase your profit by blowing up relief ships heading to the station (or not). You can negotiate your way out of fights by dropping cargo, bribe officials to smuggle illegal goodies out of a station :P Definitely Worth a buy at full price for ppl who enjoy this Genre & why not for newcomers heh. Pirates & Aliens fighting with the player in the mid. Add a bit of mining & different upgrades for ship & there's decent Low Budget Space Flight Boom Boom :) Liked the sideways navy-like battles. Your actions affect your reputation with the citizenry, the militia & various Pirate Factions. Series of story missions take you from one side of the sector to another & each mission, main or side is marked with its ""risk level"". That Allows you to judge whether to take it & do right away or take some time to upgrade your equipment first. Soundtrack in Rebel Galaxy is Atmospheric, Real gritty & includes world country rock tunes. Soundtrack had big impact on my decision whether to buy RG when watched the Trailer :) Paid full price at Steam & happy for supporting Devs :) Only 2x Negative things to say are: Can't Look Map inside Station & Can't use ""Engage Warp"" Keybind separated from Interact Key. For ex: Using Tractor Beam to take items. Frustrating as need to wait to pass some item(s) floating in space or take them before can activate Warp. Also sometimes ""Engage Warp"" Pops to screen with delay. Not good when in rush to catch Pirate Lord or in a hurry to save some Ally. Minor things ofc so didn't ruin Goodiness lvl :) Ppl who look for a well engaging story aren't going to find one, but the characters have tons of personality & story is ok :) This is good work as 1st adventure from Double Damage games. Devs put a lot of heart into this & can be seen. RG's Fine Tunes: http://rebel-galaxy.com/the-rebel-galaxy-soundtrack/My High School Review 8.5 / 10Enjoy the Flights :)			"

												I know it isn't technically a RPG but it feels like a RPG. And it is a short RPG at that. This is a good thing. If you don’t want 100+h RPGish game this is a good game for you. The gameplay loop, trade/do missions -> buy new/better gear -> repeat, sustains the game for the duration.  At the last main story mission, I felt satisfied. If it had been any longer I might have gotten bored. That being said I would probably buy an expiation containing a new tier of ships, so I could play ten more hours. The music is unexpectedly perfect, slide guitar. I like this game. "

												This game is both oddly addictive and frustrating.  Hours of play go by without me noticing, but every time something annoys - combat mechanics, navigation, etc.  The good:Right out of the gate, you can do stuff.  You’re not limping around with crappy, starter equipment very long. The first couple missions are just challenging enough, and give you a decent reward to do some upgrades.  There’s no dishonor in running away from fights until you get good enough equipment to fight back.It’s really is immersive, and I love that you can play your own custom soundtrack which enhances that. I haven’t done much with the main story yet, having too much fun tooling around the galaxy doing side missions and exploring stuff.  Equipment upgrades don’t depreciate, so you can sell them back for the same as the purchase price.  This is great when you’re starting out and just figuring out the game mechanics.  It eliminates those costly newbie mistakes that handicap you as you advance.The annoying:Some of the mechanics clunky.  For example: When mining, you blow up the asteroid then have to go hunting for what pops out using the pulse feature, boost your way to the loot (being careful not to overshoot it), then painstakingly angle into the sweet spot that will auto trigger your tractor beam. I’d really like to be able to target stuff manually and then grab it. I have to agree with other reviews about the lack of Y axis. It is really frustrating, particularly in a big firefight when you have a swarm of nimble enemy fighters attacking you at all angles, disappearing along the vertical just as you go to nail them and all you can do swing from side to side, waiting for them to get back to the horizontalDifficulty ratings are a crap shoot as far as accuracy.  I’ve gotten my tail kicked on a “low” risk mission and blown right through a “high” risk mission.Misc:The game doesn’t recognize my Xbox 360 wireless controller (which works with other Steam games), but does recognize my old Logitech F310 USB gamepad.  I find that handles the game better than K&M.			"

Nothing more entertaining or profitable than stealing from the trader you are escorting.*Exploration can be quite captivating thanks to being set in space.The Bad:*Obvious console port with minimal mouse utility in menus.*Nausiating edge scroll turret aiming and disorienting auto tracking.*Semi-fixed distance 3rd person view which can only be changed in menu, not on the fly.*3D mining from a 2D plane can be frustrating as nodes can be difficult to aim at depending on turret configuration.*RPG elements are minimal involving buying upgrades for one's ship, mostly linear, and fulfilling quests to receive mutually exclusive bonuses.*Inability to scroll through one's weapons, can only select weapon groups be it ballistic, flak, laser, or the various missile types, making it impossible to see beneath one's ship to personally aim at fighters.The Ugly:*Trading, I swear the comerce AI is programed to to drop the prices wherever you go making it nearly impossible to make money through trading outside of special events such as Famine.*Diplomacy, nearly non-existant beyound scaring off weaker enemies (kinda pointless) or dumping one's cargo to appease pirates (rarely worth it), and no way to improve relations beyound fulfilling quests for the five main factions (takes too long) or responding to distress signals (can be risky early on), and no way to improve relations with the minor factions.*The Grell, ugly♥♥♥♥♥fish ♥♥♥♥ers with frankly overpowered ships who swim in schools, avoid at all costs until very late game.Despite the overwhelming negativity presented above, I still enjoy the game and would recommend it, so long as it's on sale.

												Fairly easy game to grasp.  Pretty fun too.  Doesn't have the steep learning curve as the X Rebirth series which is a huge blessing.  That being said it is an open ended smuggling/fighting/etc type of game.  I think of it as like the Firefly TV series.  You can do good or evil or even a little of both.  I am still learning as I go but it quite an addictive game.			"

												Wall Street meets space.Graphics are pretty solid, performance is good. Plenty of depth in the game. Most missions are nothing special but the gameplay and extra things you can do is pretty nice (you can trade commodities to earn $$$$ which is cool).There are some faction mechanics but I haven't played enough to see how those work fully.One issue I have is that the main quest difficulty curves up like a mofo so you gotta do a fair bit of side missions on like the third or fourth mission before you can continue.

												While the story is pretty barebones, the combat and the music is where this game is at. I've now spent 18 hours roaming the galaxy, and while I can understand people saying it's repetitive, I really enjoy the space-trucking, Jim-Raynor-space-combow feel to this game. Some people compare it to Assassins Creed 4's naval combat (that games single strengh, IMO), and while this is certainly a obvious comparison, I actually think that the combat in this game is better, as there are multiple types of weapons for different situations.I got this on a 33% sale, but I would easily recommend this game at full price.EDIT: after 34 hours, I feel I can say with certainty that I'm done with the game. I finished the last mission, and while I still could max out the biggest, most badass ship out there, I'm not compelled to do so. All in all a good game by it's own, and when you factor in the relatively low entry price, it's a no-brainer.			"

												This game represents everything that's right about games.A couple of guys named Erich Schaefer and Travis Baldree put this thing together. Between the two of them, they've had a hand in Fate, Mythos, Diablo II, and Torchlight. If you liked those games, and have played Freelancer or the little known Escape Velocity, this game should be an instant buy. Even if you haven't played space based ARPGs, you should buy this game.Why? It feels good to play, and everything in the game is secondary to it feeling good to play. That's how it represents everything that's right about games: it focuses on playing as being the critical element. The controls, sounds, and looks of the game come together to make it feel like you're playing something that's meant, designed, and created to be played, above all else. What really drives the game is the desire to kill things and become space rich, so you can kill stronger things and become even more space rich. It's the drive to kill, loot, and kill and loot even more that keeps the player going.If you're into narrative heavy games, then you probably should pass on this. The story is campy, and not something that you'll remember for crazy plot twists or complex drama. But it's just interesting enough to keep you moving forward.Rebel Galaxy has some sim-lite features, though not especially fleshed out. A player can disrupt a trade convoy, which keeps supplies low and prices high at a station. Or they can break through a blockade, and exploit the need for supplies to work towards becoming space rich.Looking forward, this game provides a solid foundation for further features to be developed. I think this has a lot of potential to become an even better game, with deeper complexities driving the sim-lite features.Really though, if you played and loved kill & loot driven games like Diablo II & Torchlight, or especially if you have played Freelancer or Escape Velocity... you need to buy this.

												TL;DRIf you like economics / 2D naval style combat / challenge, get this game.It's worth more than you're paying.Pros:This game feels highly polished for the ~$20 price tag.Economics function quite well, are not random, and you can earn Credits fairly quickly once you see the patterns. (i.e. if there's a Militia Embargo on an outpost, bring it military style products for a nice profit)The ships are interesting and specialized. You feel accomplished when you get the next awesome ship and throw some killer components on it.Computer requirements are well within reach for most PC gamers.^>It feels very optimized and lag is infrequent.The graphics aren't comparable to BF4 but, it's a very pretty game.The story, though not entirely compelling at first, is well written as are the characters for their minimalistic impact on the game.There's been ZERO glitching. That's just fantastic.Cons:Difficulty may seem overwhelming at first but, you'll quickly understand the importance of picking your battles and what upgrades are needed. Until you learn to broadside properly, high-range turrets will be your best friend.I can't really think of any others at the moment. I've been having a really good time. :)Suggestions:Co-op Play would be EPIC in larger scale confrontations.When on the Commodity Window make a sortable LIST of the other outposts you've visited and their pricing instead of the slow ""here's the price at this location"" rotation. I've spent far too much time just sitting in my chair waiting for the outpost i want to see prices for pop up without having to go back into space and look at it on my map.The distance between the sides of your ship and stellar masses when trying to warp is too great. Front space is wonderful but, if i can turn my Radovich completely sideways and not hit what made my warp stop that's a problem.Also, a question to the Devs;Did a few members of your team REALLY enjoy ""Armada"" for the Dreamcast? Because this feels like what that game should have been. I loved that game when it came out and put far too much time into it and this feels heavily influenced by it.Comp specs:AMD FX-6300 OC'd to 4.5GHzRadeon R9 280 OC'd to 280x specsUltra setting, Full Screen, 1080p = 140FPS most of the time.

No micro management or in-depth colony baby sitting dragging you down.Another rarity hit's steam, rarity being, a 100% fun game at a bargain price, you don't see one of those every day.This one is a little like Templar battleforce when it comes to looks.  It doesn't look much in the screen shots and videos, but once in the actual game it looks pretty good.

A little limited in scope (basic storyline, no first person stuff, okay graphics) and it can become a drag earning enough money to get a ship that isn't totally torn to pieces as you progress through the story.

It has loads of depth, great dialogue, awesome graphics and an amazing soundtrack that makes me feel like am part of the firefly TV show! I fell in love with the title and am really hooked on it. From upgrading your ships weapons, armour, parts and more to grabbing new and more powerful ships to entering huge fire fights that are insanely awesome to partake in. I couldn't recommend Rebel Galaxy more!Check out a little more here -

												Followed this game during it's development and was intrigued by it's take on a navel-style broad side combat. I know some might want verticle access for combat but honestly, this game doesn't need it. If you're familiar with the ship combat in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag then you'll know exactly how this game plays. The game is packed full of side quests, your classic fetch, eliminate, gather and escort. Several factions exist and many are joinable, some at war with one another so there is a sense of choice but it's not very deep. There's plenty of freedom, being a pirate is entirely possible but expect resistence.The sound for this game is great, from the mechanical vibrations, rising whurrs and powerful sounding blasts, it all feels very appropriate to the space exploration theme. With a very firefly esque feel to the music, you get that space-cowboy feeling right off the bat. There's an option to add your own easily, if you prefer as well.People looking for an extremely rich story and lore, incredibly complex combat mechanics and deep reputation based faction reputation systems might be a little disappointed, Rebel Galaxy certainly has these things but they're light. Overall, this a great 20 hour game with outstanding sound, combat and just enough exploration and progress to keep you going to the end. I wish there was a little more to story and lore but overall, I can't explain. If you can grab it on sale, totally worth it.			"

I wish it was multiplayer, but otherwise I have no large complaints!+Game starts you out with a decent ship, decent side-missions to earn credits fairly fast (no heavy grinding which is awesome)+Interesting storyline, keeps staying interesting throughout (not that far in yet)+Choose your own allies, side, fighting style+Epic music, or you can use your own+Blast aliens, or if they're blasting you negotiate to give 'em your cargo to let you free. Cool immersion that way+Dropped outta warp, destroyed some aliens with a full broadside rapidly, messily slapped all over their ship. 10/10-No 3D movement, you move on a flat plane (side to side)...

												After careful consideration, I can't recommend this game as it stands. It has a lot of potential, but due to various bugs and imbalances it fails to live up to that potential. The system it uses to classify mission difficulties is spotty (some very high risk missions are easy, while some low risk missions are very difficult). Escort missions are extremely buggy: escorts path back and forth regularly, they have almost no armor and NPCs don't have aggro tables AFAIK, if you engage personal warp for even a moment you immediately fail the escort. Some missions have you kill another faction's ships with no warning, so it's tricky to farm faction rep when a mercenary guild mission for 15 rep might have you killing merchant guild ships and losing 30 rep with them. On top this, it's extremely grindy. Get to a system, buy modules that are ~50% stronger than the ones you entered the system with, move to the next system since all the content in that system is obsolete now. Aside from the story, it's the same missions grinded over and over. ""Go here and kill these two groups of enemies"" ""Escort this trade prince to that station"" ""Take this cargo from point A to point B"". Honestly, this feels like a game that someone worked long and hard on, but then 80% of the way in they decided they needed to wrap it up ASAP and filled the last 20% with hollow, paper mache content. For the first 10 hours or so it was fun, but once you realize that it's just going to be the same recycled grind over and over it leaves you with a sinking feeling of ""why am I still doing this?""

												Shallow.On the surface this game is fantastic. I want to love it. The soundtrack makes you feel like a space cowboy right at the main menu. The designs manage to sell you on this gritty space society without feeling messy or cluttered. The gameplay premiss seems like a fresh twist on a working concept... and here things fall apart.It has an interesting idea of broadside combat in a freelancer type space sim, but it fails to achieve either. Whatever there is to master in this game is mastered in under an hour, and it basically comes down to ""have bigger guns and better shields"". Any fancy manouvers will only give the enemy time to recharge their shields or let them turn their undamaged sides towards you. Just fly up and hammer them harder while your turrets autoshoot any fighters. After that you just repeat the same interactions over and over to earn cash towards upgrades that add +stat% . You can feel safe taking any mission that has a danger rating you've dealt with before, because they scale with you and nothing ever changes.Even more dissapointing is the fact that there is virtually no point or reason to fight or do missions as it's slow and tedious, forcing you to cover large distances of empty space. Just find the trade route that is currently most profitable per minute and fly it back and forth until it drains to make atleast 10x in an hour what you could have gotten from missions during the same time. This way you'll never make enemies either!Also, dont buy anything but cargo or cargospace boosts.♥♥♥♥♥♥is super expensive and serves no point. You basically don't have to fight ever if your goal is to become the biggest bad♥♥♥♥♥in space. Some light shields and an engine will do fine! Any investments in your ship will just take money away from buying up expensive cargo. Then, when you made all the money there is to make from trade runs where you interact with absolutely no one... buy the most expensive♥♥♥♥♥♥you can find. Voila! You are now the best at this game and nothing can hurt you!The best part? Maybe you got a bit eager and there was more money to be made? Bigger ships to be found? Better guns? And now all you trading captial is gone? NO PROBLEM! Just sell all your ship parts AT COST and become a peacful trader again. You could just do this at any point when you wanted to actually kill something. You never have to feel invested in anything! Choices have no consequence or impact. Life is great in space! Except for all that emptyness and boredom you will feel. They really captured that part... "

												This is a FUN game. Very Fun!   I keep looking for the single ultimate magic answer for my space game hunger.  The more games I try, the more clear it becomes: there is no answer - there are many different answers, each answering in a slightly different way.. and some answer better than others.  Rebel Galaxy is one Very Good answer!  I may not yet have spent quite as much time in this game as in some of my other favorites (X3AP, Rebirth, Evochron, Starsector, Endless Sky, SPG2, Freelancer, iWar2) - but I have enjoyed every single minute of it!  Its fun and refreshing and easy to sink your teeth into, and has a great space swashbuckler feel to it.  Rebel Galaxy is a great game and I happily recommend it.  There's also something to be said for the modesty of it - a great value that kinda flies under the radar, and doesn't seem to get the applause it deserves.  Other reviews and the description will give you a pretty good idea what it's about.  I just wanted to give a quick thumbs-up, as I've been meaning to for about a year.  The idea of Freelancer + Firefly gives a good general sense of gameplay and theme.  At first I was reluctant due to the 'flat space' nature of it, but it turns out it just feels right - and fresh, and fun.  Anyway - if there's (hopefully!) any DLC or a RG2, I'll be all over it, instantly, no questions asked.  Not many games have earned that kind of trust!  Well done Dev's, thanks for a Fun game - and I really hope you have more of this yet to come in the not too distant future!			"

												So far from my limited playtime, I can already tell it will be one of those ""I'm only playing it because I am bored"" type of games. Right from the get-go the menu does not use the mouse (it has some in-game menu use, but it is very buggy)...obvious console port. Overall I would say just wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.Gunplay: 4/10It is very annoying to shoot enemies with your broadside cannons because they lock on to targets, so you are not really aiming. Same with the turret and missiles. Sometimes the aiming redicle will lock up when trying to aim due to it trying to stick on to a different enemy. The gunplay just isn't fun.Graphics: 8/10The game looks nice, but at first glance it seems much older than 2015. Still, good or bad graphics don't determine a game's quality. Story: 7/10The story line is neat, but right from the start it gets predictable. Also, most missions are ""Hey, you! Go run over there and shoot something for me, thanks."" You go do the mission, return, and then do it all over again. Also, all stations are the same (not externally or main characters, but the generic character models and interior is all the same).			"

												I really wanted to like this game, however although the theme is great, the controls, mechanics and overall design have a few warts that ultimately make it a very unsatisfying experience.  Things like warp travel being easily interrupted by hard to avoid objects in space, the little space fighters being far more dangerous than many capital ships and the overall grindy feel are all examples I would point to as being annoying to the point of turning me off the game.

												Definitely the best space game since Freelancer. I've been waiting years for something similar to Freelancer and this does not disappoint. It has broadside combat for the most part, which is pretty fun once you get used to it. My only complaints so far are that there are not a wide array of ships to choose from. I think I've seen 5 so far. There are also huge ships that the enemies have with smaller fighter ships that surround them in combat but you cannot use one of these ships. Other than that the game is pretty awesome. I'm really enjoying it and look forward to finishing up a gameplay as the good guy so I can be a pirate in the next round.			"

												In general, the gameplay is fun, but I found the necessity of grinding too extreme for a paid game. I have a bit of a lower-tolerance for grinding than the average person, but once I settled into the routine of ""I need more money to buy better ships/weapons, so I'll grind meaningless missions/mine/trade"", I felt like I immediately needed to stop playing the game because I wasting my time in generally meaningless gameplay. For someone who like grindy games, or just a fan of sci-fi games in general, you would probaly still like it.			"

												Rebel Galaxy at first looks like alot and to be quite honest it is and in a very good way! It has loads of depth, great dialogue, awesome graphics and an amazing soundtrack that makes me feel like am part of the firefly TV show! I fell in love with the title and am really hooked on it. From upgrading your ships weapons, armour, parts and more to grabbing new and more powerful ships to entering huge fire fights that are insanely awesome to partake in. I couldn't recommend Rebel Galaxy more!Check out a little more here -

												A space fighter/flight game is an itch that has gone unscratched for a very long time and for a very simple reason; They’re not terribly user friendly to start with. They're mostly varying flavors of spreadsheets and menus.Rebel Galaxy avoids this problem by... not being a very complicated game. It’s stuck on a single flight platform which completely omits the need for severe flight tactics, and is instead comparable to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag’s style of naval combat, down to the similarly used “Broadside” cannons. After that, it’s a matter of strategically placing some of your turrets as they autofire at your enemies while you control one, usually some type of rapidfire thing to cut through your enemies.Enemy ships, usually the small fighters, tend to have access to the 3D plane which is not as much of a problem as you might expect as it usually just means you need to plan your position to open fire. Again, your guns can shoot them depending on placement.Meanwhile it has a sort of MMO-like questing style of clearing enemies, shipping goods, defending traders, as well as a story mode. I actually have a lot of fun just ignoring the main quest (As you do), running around making ALL the money, upgrading my ship, and having a giggle when my main quest’s risk rating reads “Very Low”.As an aside; The music is wonderful and it took considerable resistance not to name my ship “Serenity”. It’s got a couple hours of full length (~3 minute) songs that will change in space stations or open battles which helps mix it up a bit.If I had a complaint, it’s probably that there’s not too much to do mid flight. Mid transit, there’s not a lot of popups when you’re fighting thousands of whatever-unit-of-distance it’s using. It amounts to three things interrupting your warp speed: Distress Signals, Ambushes, and Asteroid Fields/Nebulas. Beyond those, you might want to stop to play some piracy and raid trading convoys that go between space stations, which manipulates the market for you to take advantage of. I just wish there was more to do when I'm aiming for an objective that's tens of thousands of whatever-unit-of-distances away.Ultimately, it’s nice to find a space game that I can be moderately good at. Everything is put together pretty well, and while some may call it too simple; I find it works in the game's favor. Space games these days feel the need to overcomplicate themselves, and Rebel Galaxy avoids that.			"

												This game brings to mind a delicious combination of Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Spaghetti Westerns, Wild West Novels, the Imperial Navy from Warhammer 40,000, and Battlefleet Gothic. But I'll be sure to be more cohesive at this point. Firstly, the music is great. As in, bloody fantastic, perfect, chill-inducingly delectable. It makes me so happy to hear a westernized form of country again, even if it is more modern. It practically makes me weep with joy and happiness. The music guides you along a beautiful path of twisted flaming wreckage and bloody gorepiles in space of the helpless rended limb from limb by a cascade from your turret networks. Truly, it makes me nearly froth with inarticulate rage and glory, my blood flowing in great cascades from my eyelids to hear this music. I would rate it a 7/10 or even 8/10 if I am particularly in the moment.Next we have the gameplay, an enormous bulky monster that growls across the scarred membranes of your cerebral cortex. First of all, it is weighty. I feel as if I am a space marine interred in a mighty dreadnaught of the God Emperor of the Mandkind whenever I go into warp, barreling on to my inevitable destination and perhaps description. Secondly, the combat makes my eyes burn with the dancing hatred of a thousand devils, shewn from the eternal Blood War by a great swathe of undead demons lead by Orcus himself. I revel in the heinous and most deliciously extensive.  The pound of my ordnance and turretry as I combat the vile hordes of heretics and pirate scum makes me giggle as a mentally deranged serial killer escaped from Alcatraz. Truly, this game excels in its gameplay.Finally, as I must say, the westernized feel bleeds over heavily into the characters, making for interesting dialogue and contact with either unknown xeno scum or unwashed and mangy of hide baffoons. As the clink of aged coin, illicit goods, or untold amounts of credits flow from my scabrous hands as we exchange evil pleasantries and oafish camaraderie. I can do nothing but appreciate this.I recommend this game highly my battle brothers, my dark souled companions, my vicious murderers and my fellow hiver scum.  You will do no better on this day if you seek endless battle, horrific suffering, and countless bouts of larcency, lies, and lack of litigious action. “The past shall consume the future, the dead shall consume the living, and chaos shall reign supreme!”--- Unicron "

												Love it.I've played it for quite a while now, and I love what they have done with the atmosphere and the battles. If there was an expansion, I would definitely buy it, as I just completed the main story. I am going to play more, try other storylines, perhaps try a bit of trading and even a bit of piracy.So, the parts with potential for improvements:I wish there were more setting for the stupid mercenary ship, such as ""protect me, don't go running off on your own to die"". That's not really a big deal though, I can always get more mercenaries, they don't seem to understand that it is certain death to sign up with me.The missions have no deadline, such as there is in Elite Dangerous, and that means there is also no real rush. If you have accepted a mission, you can probably wait until next year before you complete it, no matter what the description says.So, I would like more rush, and more stories to complete. And perhaps a reason to get out of my destroyer and into something bigger.			"

Use that cash to buy a bigger and meaner ship and/or choose from tons of interesting and tactical diverse upgrades.

												I didn't know quite what to expect. But from the trailer it looked like it would be an absolute wild ride.It is.I don't know what pulled me in more: The incredible soundtrack, which while somewhat short, never ever got old and always pumped me up for taking on a whole enemy flotilla single-handedly while being completely out-classed and out-gunned. Or the visuals which are stunning from the very beginning. This game has hit a perfect spot of being scifi and western: a playable Firefly. It keeps you enthralled even after you finish the story. The developers really hit spot on on the idea of purely enjoyable gameplay. It's not complex and convoluted. It's not necessarily simple either. you have to think about how you approach your enemy. What weapons are best, do you go with massive firepower or shield and hull strength? A middle ground? How can a small cruiser take on a dreadnought 5 times it's size without getting obliterated? There are a couple pseudo-downsides, other than the (epic) short soundtrack, The first somewhat downside to this game is that because it's their first one (as far as i can tell), they weren't able to make it bigger, or the story longer. There isn't much character development, however they put a LOT of thought into what was there, such as if you listen to the alien languages, you can actually pick up what words mean what in the translations. I'm a language nerd and that scored MAJOR points for me.The other downside is that you have to get used to it not being a 'realistic' space game, since you are playing on a flat plane, you cannot do spins or attack from above or below as you would imagine being able to in theoretical 'real' space combat.But the gameplay is so fun that, at least for myself, i completely discarded that particular misgiving and simply had fun with it.This is quite honestly one of the best games i've played in YEARS, i can't recommend it more.This is one of the few games where not only do i WANT more, i NEED more.

												Its not so much a space sim as an ARPG with space ships. But trading, mining, bounty hunting, piracy and even faction relations are all here. Sure, it takes place on a 2D plane, but the broadside combat more than makes up for that.Customize your ship. Buy new ships. Chat with shady aliens. Run from the law or side with it. And maybe even find your Aunt Juno while you're at it.Its a dangerous galaxy out there.In a word: Shiny.			"

												Such a fun game. Compared to other space titles around at the time, Elite, Star Citizen, Star Conflict, No Man's Sky, and a host of others surfacing and submerging, this game stands out first to me the fact that it's single player. Shock horror. If you can get over that, it's fantastic.     I can't stress enough what a masterpiece the devs have done as far as software goes. Produced in a ridiculously short time, by the guys that brought us diablo, and then torchlight. Install's 2Gb, and run's so smooth even on a low end laptop. Has controller support, also (personally i love the controller controls on this title, well thought out, the commands are simple enough to just get stuck in). The controls overall aren't gratuitously complex. There aren't as many menus to cycle through as other games, and this doesn't feel like a bad thing, or that you're missing things. The combat is great fun. Winning or losing, it just FEELS good, with an awesome soundtrack to accompany it. Basically, in my view, while i enjoy say, elite, for a long term, ""sim"", this is arcade. It's pick up and play, blast a few minutes out and achieve something. It doesn't have so much replayability for me personally, but for the 1 playthrough alone, it was worth every penny. While writing this i genuinely am getting a hankering to play it again some time, so, i guess it has some replayability factor afterall. I'm not sure what else is important in a review.... it's smooth as hell to play, bug free (i'm aware that of course there'll be bugs these days in most titles, but i haven't found any thing i'd call a bug. The forums are well maintained and there's few bug reports from people with competant brain cells, if any, that haven't been addressed and long fixed. There will always be a vocal few that want to run across a open room in a shooter, towards an enemy sniper, head on, without jinking, get shot in the head, and complain that the sniper rifle is OP, and game breaking. Welcome to the internet. It's bug free, fun to play, great soundtrack, cheap game even when not on offer, looks great on not so great machines. Cons? Can't play with friends. Oh well, they'd only mess things up.			"

												This game was fun for about a day, then the ""side missions"" became incredibly repetiative and boring, and the combat pretty much the same.  For anyone that is comparing, I felt the same about Sid Meyer's Pirates, some of my friends loved that game, but I thought it got boring really fast.  At least in Sid Meyers, you get to get off your boat and do other things, in this game you are just flying around the galaxy doing odd jobs trying to upgrade your ship so that you can fly around faster and do more odd jobs, etc etc.  Space themed dungeon crawl?

												All I can say is, wow. This game is loads of fun. Really don't have anything bad to say about it. I was a little concerned about the 2d playing plane, however it's not even an issue, and hardly noticeable really. Frankly, the battles are so chaotic sometimes, it would be near impossible to manage in 3d space. The graphics are great, a solid performer, bug free, good voice acting, interesting characters, good mission variety, and many different ways to play.Good stuff here, and the price can't be beat for such a rich title. Well worth the money. 9/10			"

												If this game felt any more like Firefly it would be Firefly!The game is brightly colored, beautiful to look at, sounds great, and has an enjoyable soundtrack.  All of which come together to give you that feeling of a western in space.You can make your way by trading, scavenging, performing missions, bounty hunting, and what we have all come here for really..... FIGHTING! All so you can afford that next ship upgrade.  But maybe you should save your credits for that bigger ship with the extra firepower and a slightly bigger cargo bay.All in all this is a fun game that gave me nearly 40 hours of gameplay just on the story and some sidequests alone, and if I wanted to there are still more things I could buy and more ships I could upgrade to because the game doesn't finish when the storyline does.

												Awesome game. It's pretty easy and gives you freedom to explore the world. Reminded me of Freelancer despite having a completely different combat system and being in 2D (you don't have a Z axis to move).You start with a basic ship and weapons, enough to finish some quests and start upgrading your equipment. As you advance the storyline and get more cash, you can start to buy better weapons or get a new ship, which gives you the ability to equip better gear so you can take on more dangerous enemies.The music really goes well with the gameplay, it also let's you add custom music in case it becomes repetitive.

												A space privateer like game where you can only fly in 2D? So disappointing, also the main story is very generic and bland and very very very similar to Freelancer, and while these games are meant to be grindy so you can buy a better ship and better gear, the missions you perform to get said funds are incredibly repetitive and become very dull. The visuals of the game ARE nice and the soundtrack is amazing, but that still doesn't save this game from being mediocre at best.			"

												The game is basically meditation (flying) punctuated by spur of the moment naval-broadside combat (your capital ship versus pirates). The core narrative and the bartenders (talk to them at each station) breathe life into the game. The music while flying around at warp speed has been a really relaxing experience (something I rarely want from a game, but it works here).Also: I\'ve seen a lot of people trying to make Firefly references and I can tell you this game has nothing to do with Firefly aside from the space cowboy music and that you happen to be a captain of your own ship. There\'s nothing in the galaxy or story that is similar and you won\'t have a big crew of interesting people (which is what made Firefly the show that it is).Play the game for what it is: space trading with naval broadside combat. If that sounds interesting, I think you\'ll find your money well spent (especially if you pick it up on sale).			"

												Oh my, what fun!So I read the reviews with people saying this game is like a mix of Freelancer, Firefly and Assassins Creed IV (the naval combat sections) and I guess those are pretty good comparison.The game certainly has the Freelancer vibe, with an open universe, optional story-line, combat, trading, rep/guild affiliation etc.The Firefly comparisons I think stem mainly from the music, but given you are flying a large vessel (not a smaller fighter) you do feel like you are captaining a ship with crew. and yes, you can 'aim to misbehave'Combat and travel is strictly 2D, but before you judge that too harshly, it plays our like ship combat from AC IV, with broadside combat being the order of the day. And it WORKS!It actually reminds me of the animated movie Treasure Planet a bit. Oh yeah, I am totally now a space pirate! Controller support is well implemented and I don't need to touch my keyboard to play (other than to hit 'play').Just shy of 2 hours in and barely scratched the surface, but based on what I have seen so far, this game could charge at least double the current price and still be good value.Recommended.

												If you're gonna get this game you should really know what you're getting in to. The combat could be fun for some, but to me it's dull, unintuitive and lacks depth of any kind. It's not about skill it's all about your gear.The missions are uninspiring and feel like quests in MMOs, that would've been fine if not for the fact that this is a single player gane and I expect more from it.The story wasn't too gripping at first but there might be some people who are really interested by it.The travelling is boring and takes waaaaaaay too long.The soundtrack is good though so I give it a plus there, the voice acting is also good and there seems to be put in a lot of effort there.Do your research before buying the game, this is a very unique game... For good or bad (With my taste it's bad bu tI can see where others find the appeal).All in all I'd say this is a very niche game, but if you're looking for a star citizen or elite dangerous type of game this is not it.

												Double Damage does a great job of putting solid combat and a addictive upgrade system into a solid space sim.. Rebel Galaxy is not dificult to get into, it doesnt take 20 different controls to fly the ship, just a controller. Not to mention the soundtrack is just awesome, cant remember the last time I actuly went out and got the music to a game! So my verdict is this is a solid game and you will have a blast playing it.Want to see it in action or check out some of the 21 different ships you can fly then follow this link to my channnel where I have full coverage:https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRevPlays "

												You've played Freelancer, right? That's the comparison you'll hear the most often. Take Freelancer, make it prettier, remove actual free flying and exploration, muddy the PC port waters with a UI that isn't really comfortable away from a gamepad, and tack on an atrocious blues/country rock soundtrack choking on its own distortion. That's Rebel Galaxy. I get the feeling they wanted to make a naval combat game, but decided spaceships were cooler than boats, and set it in space instead. It helps to imagine the entire gameplay area as a giant, flat, invisible ocean, and you're just floating on the surface -- planets and bases are nothing but islands to stop at or maneuver around. Other ships can go above or below or around you, but you're stuck on the surface, plunking away with broadside guns and the occasional turret. Homeworld's map screen alone has more maneuverability options than this entire game.Gameplay-wise, you just do the typical Freelancer things: Visit space stations, accept jobs to improve/diminish faction reputation, occasionally pick up a plot-related mission, collect resources, trade commodities, earn money, upgrade your ship, wash, rinse, repeat.Mercifully, the music can be disabled.

 20€ for some dry bones As far as i know, it was the devs first game ever, developed by a single guy. So i guess 99% of development time was spent into the graphics.The game has a big world. Big and really empty. Rarely you´l find a convoy or pirates, thats it.Trading system is basic. VERY basic.Battles are 2D. In Space. No joke. And basic. Lock target, charge shot for some seconds, fire. Assasins Creed 4 made more fun.Theres no boarding. No killing shields or engines. You can only target the ship directly or some additional turrets, if its one of the bigger ones.Story is also basic. Nothing impressive. Found someone on the forums who finished it in 13 hours.All in all, the game is nothing but grinding the same missions all over again until you can afford gear for the next area, then its grinding again.As you can figure, once the short story is done, thats it. Nothing more to do. Not that you need to, but you also couldnt even be a pirate afterwards, cause theres no booty in empty universe. Just very rare miners or freighters, whic you cant board, that drop one or two units of cargo after getting destroyed.And during all that time you hear nothing but that sh*tty rock-soundtrack. Thank god you can replace it with custom sounds. CONCLUSION: Nice foundation made out of expensive, snow-white marble. Too bad construction stopped right here and the house was never build.			"

												First and foremost I'm not a paid reviewer/streamer/critic or any of that. I was blessed enough to receive a key for free eventhough I will buy multiple copies of this for my family/friends. Just being upfront about it but I played in the beta and pre-release so my review is coming from all my experience with the game. Now onto the review. Ever since the rlease of Freelancer on PC way back in 2000, I have been aching for a new space sim experience. If your like me and also have that itch then look no further. This game has pirating/trading/looting/mining/space battles.... a whole slew of things you can do in the sandbox that they have created for you. There are several systems or galaxies in which you traverse and have jump gates to connect them. Each system has its own factions with which to either befriend or destroy. You have a main story but also space stations with side missions along with the included Trading/Mining/Mercenary guilds which also provide missions. These three factions also provide unique ships, weapons, shields, and other things to outfit your ship. The combat is likened to naval style (think Assassins Creed Black Flag ship battles) and its set on a 2d plane. The art style, ship design, space backdrops are all top notch. The audio is also one thing that is a step above. The soundtrack alone warrants a look at this game. It gives the feel of a space fairing outlaw lol. Think Firefly, Han Solo, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star vibe. The sounds of the weapons firing gives a sense of real power and gurth behind each barrage launched from your broadside cannons. The best sound to me is when your FTL drive spools up and then hits warp.This game has been on my radar for some time now as my top 5 most anticipated games of 2015. I knew that Travis and Erich who left Runic Games to establish Double Damage wouldn't let me down. If you have any interest, what are you waiting for help these two Devs out by purchasing this amazing experience! I know I will be purchasing copies for my friends and family and for only 20$ US you can't beat that deal. The price for value is one of the best of 2015 alone. Do your self a favor and play it.			"

If you want a game like this, but is older but has a great story, buy ""tachyon, the fringe"" can't beat Bruce Campbell and the fighting system is way way better. You can also go X3.

												I really wanted to like this game, it is almost good. I got this after reading the Freelancer comparisons, but this game is not even close to it, it doesnt have the combat dynamism as it is naval based combat instead of fighter ships, nor the story pacing which helps improve your vessel before main missions, its more of go on playing until you get into a snafu.I specially don't like the combat, to me it feels grindy instead of tense and fun, there's no going up or down, it is a 2D flight system while some enemies have the freedom to move into the third dimension and even though it may fit the naval combat system, it feels weird.It has to be said that it is a great game to have been developed by a two man team, but it falls short of what one may expect after a Freelancer comparison, sadly it is kind of misleading and a video about the combat system would help clear things up.If you like Freelacer type games and think you may like the naval combat system a la ACIII+ ship combats, you should at least try this. I'd say it is a good game, just not for me...At least I enjoyed the music XD (it actually is very fitting).(I may update the review if I end up playing more (I still want to like the game))			"

In most missions rather you or the enemies are unkillable juggernauts, its also annoying that you can do some bounties before you get the bounty and when you do get the bounty there is nobody there to kill so you just wasted 400 credits for usless information. Its also crappy to have a ship combat game were you are bound to an axis and cannot dogfight while the enemies can fly around you shooting you. The AI for your guns should also be better, it makes sense that if 2 of your turrets can auto fire than all of the turrests should be able to auto fire.The game does do a very good job with its music and thematic choices but there is no point in dragging yourself through the lame combat to explore the world.

												Unfortunatly the gameplay just falls a little flat. I like the idea but I don't feel any depth. There's not much more to it than just fly in a circle and fire. And the RP side falls just as flat.			"

			Views: 190		

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/290300 MASSIVE THANKS TO THE DEV'S FOR THE STEAM REVIEW COPY!		

One of the best space adventures I've played in 2015.... don't miss this gem of a game. Rebel Galaxy is a swashbuckling space adventure, with action-packed combat, exploration, discovery, trade, and “negotiation” with the outlandish denizens at the edge of the known universe. As the commander of an immensely powerful star destroyer, you’ll battle pirates, explore anomalies, befriend aliens, scavenge battle wreckage, mine asteroids, and discover artifacts. Choose your path as a roguish do-gooder, crafty space-trader or power-hungry privateer – or maybe a little of each! Buy larger and more powerful craft with your hard-earned credits, and outfit them with a variety of wicked weapons and defenses. Set in a galaxy of fantastic sights, and secrets to be found, Rebel Galaxy is above all a space epic of adventure, exploration, and combat. The edge of the universe is a pretty dangerous place, so watch your back. - Highly Recommended!			"

												I've had more fun in the first five hours of playing this game than I have had in a long time. Combining elements from many beloved titels across genres, Rebel Galaxy is what you're looking for. It's 2D approach to space combat leaves your focusing on tactical options and attacks instead of trying to orient yourself constantly like in other games such as Elite: Dangerous. Thatisn't to be said that movement can't be still be a challenge. When you add in the need to manage weapon types against mixed engagements -- which are almost always the case. In these clashes you will face one or several other capital ships and a wide variety of fighter and gunship craft. The former come in a nice mix -- you don't know if the next capital ship you are going to run into will be an up close brawler or a ranged homing missle boat. The sub-capital ships although substatially lower defenses still provide pressure on the player. In swarms fighters can effectively dodge in and out of turret arcs if they aren't focused on. Gunships, on the other hand, pack a punch in a small size. A group of these gunships can be as dangerous as some campital ships.I speak of the wide range of encounters the player can have but the variety doesn't end there. Consider the different armerments that any one ship can use. Will you use a long range anti-captial ship guns paired with swarm missle launchers or will you choose some beefy in-your-face anti-capitals paired with several flak turrets? The number of combinations doens't end there. Each turret location on your ship can be outfitted with a different type of turret. If you sesired, you could put to gether a kitchen-sink styple ship!Beyond the mechanics of combat Rebel Galaxy also gives you the freedom to choose the type of contracts you take on. If you are able to plan ahead you can take several missions and set up a somewhat efficent flight path. The mission types tend to fall into a few different catagories; courier, defense, elimitatie, dead drop (recovery), or collection. Although mission fall into these catagories as a rule, the way each unfolds is randomly generated to keep you on your toes. If jumping mission to mission isn't your thing or you just want a break, you can also do some margin trading or mining.The tradeing consists of transporting goods between locations in hopes of turning a profit. This seems simple, but a host of factors will influence your success or failure. The way time works in Rebel Galaxy has what seem like short warps between locations to having passed several days. This leads to a an amount of uncertainy of a fluctuating market shortly after you've left. Random events will also add a little spice to the mix. These events allow you to swoop in and pick up goods when they are over-saturated or drop your goods into a starving market. Ships in Rebel Galaxy also have a fairly limited cargo hold. So, no running around the system with vast amounts of cargo in your hold just waiting for the opportunity to offload it onto a waitting market.The difficulty that Rebel Galaxy provides is a welcome change to the modern status quo. Rather than needing to set a arbitrary difficulty setting you need simply get yourself in hot water by approaching a mission or location that's rated ""Risk: High"". This nice little warning suggests what you'll find will be a distinct challenge no matter your tactics or fit. At noumerous times during my play, I found myself feeling quite the force to be rekoned with. After rolling through enimies and dispatching them in a short time I presumred I was the big man in the system. Then I was ambushed in mid warp. I thought to myself, 'I've been killing everything iwth no problem; this area is probably too easy for my current skill."" I was so wrong. The three capital ships and a  few squadrons of gunships ensured that my growing ego was quite deflated. Although I could have, after being ppulled from warp, turned and ran to safety, I instead engaged foolishly and committed to a fight I couldn't win.To sum it up, if you enjoy space combat sims like Freespace, Elite:Dangerous, ando thers this game will provide a refreshing spin on the favorite genre. As you challenge yourself with different play styles and different engagements you will be rewarded with the uncertainty of your success while being excited to try again after your ship explodes. For a standard price of $20, I would buy this game twice. Enjoy.			"

												Would be an awesome game if difficulty balance was not so ♥♥♥♥♥♥. A ""Very Low"" risks mission gets you killed in no time, but you might succeed easily in a ""High Risk"" one... associated with their save system, you'll find yourself doing the same things over and over again. And in a game that is already quite repetitive, you clearly don't need that. A frustrating overall experience.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game. The first time I saw it, I thought ""This looks so cool, must be hell of a lot of fun"". The atmosphere, the particals, the spaceship battles, etc. When I bought it during the summer sale, it was one of the first game (of the 10 that I bought) that I installed, just to get disappointed. The game didn't launch for me. So I uninstalled it. I later upgraded my OSX (yes, I am on Mac) for Smite and decided, why don't give it a second try? So I reinstalled it, and launched the game again. It froze on the Titlescreen. I had to restart my PC, then it finally worked and I dove right into it...The first thing I noticed was the music. It fits the game/theme perfectly, some sort of ""Space Rock"". It's the kind of music you would expect Han Solo to listen to whilest flying. The rythem is good, quality is good and the feeling is even better. I think the best thing in this game is the music (@Devs why don't publish the Soundtrack?).My first 30mins with the game where not enjoyable. My camera was moving around like a drunk guy on a unicycle. I couldn't get ride of the feeling that mouse accelerations was on. I looked under controles, and the only option I saw was to turn down mouse sensitivity. After that it worked a bit better, was still frustrating though. I enjoyed the dialogues a lot too, the characters where what you expected, a bit clichée but still really fitting into the game. Your choices concerning responses are not amazing, but they give you a bit of choices, which added a nice little touch, which isn't useful, but I still considere well placed in the game.And finaly, I came to the combat. Hell did it look cool, and hell did it play♥♥♥♥♥♥ After I died the first time, not knowing how to use my weapons properly, I closed the game and played something else. I was so frustrated. I later tryed again, giving the game 3 trys to convince me that the combat was fun. For me it never felt fun.The biggest problems I encountered where the camera. The placement is awkward at best, and it can ruin everything. I sometimes couldn't even see where I shot because the camera backed down behind the ship, whilst I was aiming. And moving it back up again, well, now it goes way overbord and I ca't see the enemy ship properly.Another aspect is the free movement in combat. You and other heavy ships are limited to a 2D combat field, whilst small fighters can fly all around you. That wouldn't be a problem, if you didn't have to fly, fight and try not to ram something at the same time.To break it down: You will ram into things if you focuse on the combat aspect, and you will not fight well if you focuse on the flying aspect. The auto aiming of your beta canons it terrible. It locks you onto someone and you shoot. But if you have locked onto someone, you won't be able to aim at someone else. I would have liked to get a fonction where I can aim freely, and then press a button and that locks my aim onto that target I'm aiming at currently. Another problem with that auto-lockon is that your camera moves with the target. I had small fighters circleing around me, spinning my camera like crazy, making it impossible to fly properly.My last, but not unimportant problem with combat is, that enemies fly away. But you are in free space, so they can fly where they want. So you have to concentrate on fighting them, and following them around, which to me, somebody uncapable of multitasking is too much of a challenge.To summe it up, I really liked the music, fantastic. The dialogue is not really useful, but a nice touch. However, the combat system ruined it for me, to such an extend that I don't feel the need to continue. I know I didn't even play 3hs, but the combat is so frustrating to me, that I will probably not continue, as I play for fun, not to be more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off after then before (and yes, I'm not one of those oldschool elitsts that have to play every game for the challenge, I play them for fun).So do I recommend this game. No, not really. I do recomment the soundtrack. And if you can multitask, otherwise, stay away. But who am I kidding, I'm a stranger on the internet, that hasn't even finished the game.If you can, and have a friend who has the game, try it, see if it's for you, and then buy. For me this game was really disappointing, not because it's beyond bad, just because I came in with expectations that where not reached.			"

												I loved this game but it has very little replay value. I pretty much tried all the various strategic setups possible in my one play through. It has me wishing there were crew, boarding, and other characteristics similar to FTL. Planetside or more technical mining would have been cool too. The game felt a little empty like there were other things that could have, or should have happened. The main story was also a bit too short and there's nothing really existing outside of that. Once I hit the end there was also no reason to further continue because I already had one of the biggest and baddest ships with most of the weapons being the top-line. There was very little that could stop me at that point so to max out every thing would have been redundant.There's also lots of glitchy bits. Still I recommend this game because it's more about the music and the feel. It had a very cinematic aspect to it and I thoroughly enjoyed cruising through the stars and exploring. In tribute to my ships:Rasputin - HammerheadFish Face McGee - Barracuda (The one I had the hardest time giving up cause it's agility made it dominant against all but the absolute biggest mothers)Free Loader -  RadovichLazy Jane - BlackGate			"

 Overall: 2/5  - A space combat action game that resembles Freelancer. - Recommended only if you are a fan of the genre. Pros:- Players can choose to trade or mine, in addition to just fighting enemy ships.Cons:- Story about finding your missing bad♥♥♥♥♥aunt is not very interesting. - Missions lack variety and feel repetitive. - The primary weapon being on the ship's sideboard does not make much sense in terms of gameplay.- It is too easy to make much money by trading, which in turn enables you to buy strong weapons and spoils the game.- The combat is conducted in 2D, not in 3D field, which lacks reality.

												Arcadey spacesim with bluesy cowboy bebop/firefly jams.   You fly your ship around on one axis, but there are tons of weapons, components and ships to buy.  The game has 5-6 different factions that range from bandits, to the law, whom you can either side, or fight against.   There is an in-game economy where different outposts want different things, so you can spend your time just smuggling narco-cola, or live organs if you'd like to amass a fortune.I've only gotten a few hours on it, but I'm quite hooked!After giving it some thought.  It's kind of like Dope Wars in Space!			"

												Ok there's enough reviews about the games content and what you can do. This game is fun, initially. That's it. The fights, the graphics, the soundtrack, everything, it's all fun.........initially. After 30 hours of gameplay I am bored witless. In fact if I had the soundtrack seperately I would be disinclined to play the game at all. It is just repetitive in the extreme now. There's not many ships, there's not many factions. There's no real diversity in missions. There's no immersion or roleplay element with which to amuse yourself. It's just become one long dullfest. I think even the developers are bored of it. There have been no real changes to this game since release. Aprt from a few bug fixes they haven't added anything new or worthwhile.Let's also trounce the myth that this is some kind of successor to Freelancer. Absolute BS. I still play Freelancer now, albeit in a modded form. 16 years after it was released. This game, I was bored of in 16 hours. It has no depth and nothing to drive you on and keep you playing or just exploring. Freelancer systems were unique and atmospheric. Systems in RG are sterile, empy, uninteresting and so similar in appearance that you are never entirely sure which you are in.Combat is 2 dimensional, there's no up or down. Freelancer combat is tactical, intense and challenging. Not flat, predictable and too easy. Save you money, find an old copy of Freelancer. Install the Discovery Mod, and never look at this game again.			"

												An awesome concoction of naval-style  combat, exploration and♥♥♥♥♥kicking fun. I must say it was a great game, and is still one of my favorites. Pros:- Pretty good graphics and optimized performance- actually good voice-acting- Space depicted as it should - a great realm of exploration, pirates, space rocks- You can kill almost everything including Main Quest NPCs (except space stations)- The♥♥♥♥♥kicking ACDC style, swash-buckling music when you are in combat is so fitting. Great Music. Yup- All round fun especially done by a small indie company- rock'n'rolling with music and reasonably good combat system (can be repetitive though)Cons:- Rather limited choice of weapons, utilities and upgrades- warping can be a somewhat pain especially when you played too many fetch quests so that you can rank up your allegiances- Campaign was a little short- Side missions can be seriously repetitive, but at least the music and steam-rolling fights help elevate thatOverall:Great Indie game at a great price! - rewarding experience for exploration and well optimized combat systemReplay? Yes, if there are expansionsRecommend? Definitely			"

												Great game. Reminds me of the assassin creed black flag ship combat combined with freelancer. The story is pretty weak but the tall ship combat combined with lots of upgrades makes it a fun time. The soundtrack is an amazing firefly-esq western score.A couple downsides:-Nothing really to do after 20 hours (maybe 30 hours for achievement completionists)-No real reason to explore (no secret gates that I could find like freelancer)-Biggest issue: No crew interactions or upgradable crew. This would be a fantastic improvement.-Some balancing issues (minor)Overall, I recommend. Especially for $10-20.			"

												Arcadey spacesim with bluesy cowboy bebop/firefly jams.   You fly your ship around on one axis, but there are tons of weapons, components and ships to buy.  The game has 5-6 different factions that range from bandits, to the law, whom you can either side, or fight against.   There is an in-game economy where different outposts want different things, so you can spend your time just smuggling narco-cola, or live organs if you'd like to amass a fortune.I've only gotten a few hours on it, but I'm quite hooked!After giving it some thought.  It's kind of like Dope Wars in Space!			"

												If you enjoy space sims I wouldn't worry much about the people complaining about grinding, this game is an amazing  arcade capital ship battler. Just doing a few battles for fun every once in a while will earn you T6 equipment for your ship and you should easily have a dreadnaught by the campaign's end if you save up. If you have ADHD and the attention span of a goldfish I might avoid the genre in general.			"

												Fantastic open world, space sim RPG. Designed with care and attention to detail from 2 veterans of the PC RPG industry. Gorgeous graphics and fun combat. The main complaint you will read on various reviews is the 2D or ""single plane"" combat. It was desgined to simulate naval battle and for me it works great. For the $20 asking price at launch (actually $18 with the launch discount) it's a definite buy and comes with my highest recommendation.			"

												Third person perspective with an arcade feel. Truly a great game that will give you over 100 hours of enjoyment.Tons of ships to unlock and upgrade, and engaging combat and NPC conversations that feel like they mean something.The soundtrack for this game is second to none. You will feel like a true \""space cowboy\"" after a few minutes.The combat in this game is engaging, you pilot your ship and aim with broadside bombardments that shred enemies. Overcoming overwhelming odds is something you will be looking for, and doing so successfully will usually yield you some sweet rewards.For the price you cannot beat this game. If you enjoyed any space games in the past, this is absolutely a must have.			"

												HiReview:By far the best game I have played this year, why you say, since it is new and refreshing, and have extremely addictive gameplay. Great gameplay, great sound, great graphics.My wishes:Just wish the dev could add visual personalisation, and perhaps see physical growth to your ship other than just adding turrets, perhaps even colour changes or skins. Multiplayer ala diable style would be great too. like 2-3 allies fighting of smaler waves, until the big boss arrives, and these provide unique drops.			"

												This game is awesome - a sublime combination of Firefly-esque western soundtrack, colorful visuals, and pulse-pounding action. A spiritual successor to Freelancer, though the setting isn't nearly as well fleshed out as Freelancer. It still kept me hooked for many enjoyable hours, despite myself.This game is what Elite: Dangerous could have (and should have) been, but fell far short of. Highly recommend this game.			"

The equipment is varied enough that there is some variety and entertainment is trying out various ships and builds, and the game features broadside main guns, turrets, and dumbfire slots on every ship.Pros:Fun arcade mechanicsDecent amount of ships and equipmentCons:Can get very repetativeTrade and mining mechanics are dull			"

												3rd person view of what is essentially a tabletop game.  (You can steer left or right, but not up or down.  It's not ""space,"" the whole game exists on one flat disc surrounded by  a space background.)Text flash tutorials don't really do a good job of explaining what you need to do, or what you should expect from combat.  That being said, combat (once you get the hang of it) is really well done despite being on the previously mentioned flat surface.Extremely imbalanced difficulty levels may discourage some players.  Each solar system, including the first one, starts off very difficult.  Avoid fights, do some cargo hauling missions to upgrade your ship before attempting combat or progressing the story.The story starts pretty shallow, towards the middle it stays shallow, and it ends shallow.Once you get the hang of the combat in this game, and if you're ok grinding cargo hauling missions from place to place - it's a lot of fun.  Objectively I don't think it's a very well polished game, but it's definitely worth the ten bucks on Steam Sale if you're a big sci-fi fan, and only if you're a big sci fi fan.Hitting recommend because subjectively I'd rank it between 5/10 and 6/10			"

												Not the most complicated space sim/spaced RPG I've ever played.  But simplistic does not equal simple.  I'm only about two hours in and there's depth here.  You spend all of your time on your ship.  The times you do dock at stations, these are static scenes that you use menus to navigate.  That said, it's functional.My one complaint is that the game isn't 3D.  Yes, it's 3D rendered but you can't move across all three axis.  You're stuck in a plane and this is space. Come on, you couldn't have provided some damn height to the systems?That doesn't take away from the fun I've had so far.  Definitely worth the sale price.			"

												Fun indie/open world/action RPG set in space.  Any old gamers who remember Escape Velocity series will enjoy this, as will any fans of Firefly who want be an independent captain operating on the fringes of legality in the vein of Malcolm Reynolds.The combat is good, but I did find it became tedious after a while.  The main quest will become challenging if you don't take on side quests but none of them are particularly interesting (""Fly to X system and deliver cargo"" or ""Destroy pirates at Y coordinates for a bounty""), just repetitive radiant missions.  Nor did I find the main quest story particularly compelling, and I wish the roleplaying element and world-building were stronger.  The ship models available for upgrade also felt a bit constrained, although the amount of customization for equipment is outstanding.The soundtrack really makes the game, reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop at its best.

												What a BLAST!!! Want to know how Han Solo felt? give this game a whirl. Bang for the buck this is an awesome deal! t is part space sim, part arcade game. At first I was disappointed that there seems to be no vertical axis, only horizontal. That after a while seems to not matter so much. It seems to be pretty large and very beautiful. I havent even left the first galaxy yet...hopefully there will be expansions as things go along. In the mean time there is plenty to do...trade, smuggle get into MANY fights. Upgrade your ship, get a new one...visit strange new places and interact with alien races... Some will be disatisfied there is not the depth of a sim...it DOES lean towards the arcade side...still...that to me isn't a huge deal. There are plenty of in depthe starship simmulations. This has just enough of it and the fun or the arcadish feel. THEN there is the music! AWESOME! very blues rockish, gets you right in the mood to BE that Han Solo character or be your own Scruffy Nerfherder! This was supposed to release on PS4 and I had been waiting, but no date...So I bought it...a couple of days later, what do you know...they released it  there as well. So I have 2 copies! Its good enough and really cheap enough for me to not mind so much.  I very much reccomend this game!			"

												This is an awesome game. It's like Assassins Creed naval combat in space. Every time I think ""I've played this too much today"" it draws me right back in. Definitely one of the most enjoyable space games I've ever played.			"

												Really enjoyed this game.  I'm a huge Firefly fan, with the style, game mechanics and awesome rock soundtrack, it comes very close.  I love the different approaches you can take, the interesting storylines and exploration.Awesome game!  I'd like to see more random events and character development/story.			"

												Like Sid Meier's Pirates in space.  (Though I haven't completed it yet.)Pros:Great graphics.  All the fancy post-effect stuff from AAA titles.  Very cool ship design, from concept to greebling.  And lots of them, too.A surprising amount of ships to buy and play with.  You can trade to a different hull anywhere it's sold, just so long as you have enough money.  You get full price for your trade-in.  Which means you can tradeout your hull for a mission than trade it back.Interesting ship components with meaningful effect on gameplay, diverse weapons.  No one weapon setup is optimum for all situations.  Ships range in size from small corvette's to large dreadnaughts, but everything still has a role to play.  (Tradeoffs between size and power vs. agility and speed.)Excellant economy, trading, and mission based shipping.  Easy trading.  The market value of goods on a planet is auto updated each time you visit it.  Very exciting too, what with scripted rebel and pirate attacks during shipping missions.  And roaming pirates and rebels you can run into just trading on your own.  You definately must keep your ship well outfitted for tougher shipping missions.  Lots of money to be made!Missions of all types vary in difficulty according to your current ship and rig, but you can see a dynamic difficulty rating before accepting it.  Easier missions are always available, if you find yourself up against a wall.Lots of things to buy and upgrade for your ship, or tradeout for an alternate rig to complete missions.  Different races sometimes require different tactics. Cons:There are a few vague ratings and descriptions for ships and components.  But you can usually find the info you need on the Community Hub.Relatively small galaxy compared to more hardcore (and expensive) space trading sims.TL:DRA casual naval game set in space.  The focus is on fun, and zappy pastel deathrays.  Space looks pretty, which is important if you have to spend alot of time staring into the starry depths.  Trade is better than viable, it's an important way to advance and upgrade your ship.  And anything that isn't clear in game is usually on the Hub.I hope they make a sequel!			"

												3rd person view of what is essentially a tabletop game.  (You can steer left or right, but not up or down.  It's not ""space,"" the whole game exists on one flat disc surrounded by  a space background.)Text flash tutorials don't really do a good job of explaining what you need to do, or what you should expect from combat.  That being said, combat (once you get the hang of it) is really well done despite being on the previously mentioned flat surface.Extremely imbalanced difficulty levels may discourage some players.  Each solar system, including the first one, starts off very difficult.  Avoid fights, do some cargo hauling missions to upgrade your ship before attempting combat or progressing the story.The story starts pretty shallow, towards the middle it stays shallow, and it ends shallow.Once you get the hang of the combat in this game, and if you're ok grinding cargo hauling missions from place to place - it's a lot of fun.  Objectively I don't think it's a very well polished game, but it's definitely worth the ten bucks on Steam Sale if you're a big sci-fi fan, and only if you're a big sci fi fan.Hitting recommend because subjectively I'd rank it between 5/10 and 6/10			"

												For the price, this is a great game. It goes a long way to capture what it might be like to be a space outlaw. A controller is certainly recommended but the devs don't hide that. It may not have the content of some AAA games, but it is certainly worth a purchase at under $20.			"

												It's basically Serenity or Firefly: the game. And I can't stop playing it!!!!!Pros: Multiple ships? check. Lasers and aliens? check. Cowboy western outlaw theme and soundtrack? check. Mining? check. Bounty Hunting? check. Cargo hauling and smuggling? check. Pirates and pirating? check. Mercenary work? check. Cons:2d space to move in (tho you quickly get used to it and it simplifies the combat, you wont really miss the 3rd dimension)side missions are pretty standard fare and repetitveNOT ENOUGH OUTLAW COWBOY MUSIC!!!!!!!!!My only wish is more of everything and ,specifically, I'd like to see derelict ship salvaging to be a possible activity to make money! Awesome game all around! If you like most or all of the above pros then stop pondering and get it!!!!!!!!! "

												What a BLAST!!! Want to know how Han Solo felt? give this game a whirl. Bang for the buck this is an awesome deal! t is part space sim, part arcade game. At first I was disappointed that there seems to be no vertical axis, only horizontal. That after a while seems to not matter so much. It seems to be pretty large and very beautiful. I havent even left the first galaxy yet...hopefully there will be expansions as things go along. In the mean time there is plenty to do...trade, smuggle get into MANY fights. Upgrade your ship, get a new one...visit strange new places and interact with alien races... Some will be disatisfied there is not the depth of a sim...it DOES lean towards the arcade side...still...that to me isn't a huge deal. There are plenty of in depthe starship simmulations. This has just enough of it and the fun or the arcadish feel. THEN there is the music! AWESOME! very blues rockish, gets you right in the mood to BE that Han Solo character or be your own Scruffy Nerfherder! This was supposed to release on PS4 and I had been waiting, but no date...So I bought it...a couple of days later, what do you know...they released it  there as well. So I have 2 copies! Its good enough and really cheap enough for me to not mind so much.  I very much reccomend this game!			"

												Love the game. If you played Freelancer back in the day this game has alot of similarities. You can play the campaign at your leisure. In fact the game is very much like an rpg in that you have to ""level up"". Buy better ships and accessories. The controls are easy to learn and the capital ship combat is fun if a bit fast paced for larger ships. It's unfortunate you can't fly in a true 3D space like in freespace but I soon forgot about it and was sucked into the gameplay and universe.It's hard to believe that this is an indie game. Freespace is still the standard for mouse driven space action games. But until Microsoft decides to release it to steam or gog, this game will most certainly scratch that itch. Definitely worth a play if you are a fan of Privateer, Elite, or Freespace.			"

												Well, I bought this on a whim, but it turns out, money was never better spent.All in all, I would defintely recommend it to anyone who's wanted to fly their own starship in a mostly lawless zone. If you've ever played Tachyon: The Fringe, you're going to love this game.I know that quite a few might be turned away due to the thing's lack of vertical flight. Put simply, the lack of a vertical axis isn't a drawback - it's a feature. The kind of ships you'll be in charge of, you won't need a vertical axis.I'll list out the good stuff and the bad. Hopefully that'll help.The Good:-1) Low-cost title that plays like a AAA game.2) Fast-paced and simple to learn.3) Quirky in many aspects.4) Great soundtrack, with an obvious inspiration from Firefly.5) Very nice ship design, and a used-up feel that's surprisingly cozy.The Neutral:-1) Star-systems aren't particularly unique, but the graphical detail and insanity offsets that to quite some extent.2) Trading and Mining are viable alternatives to a kill-em-all blitz, but it can be boring or tedious after a point.3) Fairly interesting characters, but their full potential was never realised.4) Cash is something weird - either so much that you don't know what to do, or too little, resulting in you getting outgunned.5) Mercenaries are a nice touch, but again - like the main characters - not realised to their full potential.The Bad:-1) Some missions can be hilariously broken, and tougher than they look, which can cause hair-pulling at times.2) Rather short single-player campaign.3) Can be slightly boring after a certain point, though not too bad.4) No further development on this title, it would seem. Hopefully there'll be more on this after some time.Definitely give it a try. You won't regret it!			"

												a laconic and easily enjoyable psychadelic spaceblastemup.  the soundtrack fits it perfectly, and there's immediately plenty of visceral action with a very uncomplicated interface and easy learning curve - quite refreshing for a spaceship game.  within an hour I was actively seeking fights with the local gangs just to unload perfectly timed broadsides of hot plasma death whilst lazily unleashing a cloud of flak on ne'er-do-wells amidst volleys of akimbo laser death while blitting deflector shields at perfect timing in response to inbound missiles without having to perform any kind of keyboard calesthenics.  with a couple of hours play it's the polish on the details that stand out:  the gnarly warp effects, the way your ship sways and groans when adjusting warp trajectory, the automatic camera and the timing of the music as it changes to the scenario all fits together beautifully to form an immensely satisfying experience.

												I give it a cautious thumbs up. If you enjoyed the naval combat in Assasin's Creed: Black Flag, get ready for that exact same experience except with better music and laser beams.Pro's:Excellent soundtrack and if you get tired of it, the game makes it really easy to swap in your own at start up.Combat is simple, but can be challenging at times depending what sort of mess you fly into.The ship design is interesting and the different weight classes make each class pilot differently enough to keep them distinct. That said, it'd be nice to have a few more ships to choose from or mod support so we can make our own.Con's:Eventually the whole game gets repetitive. The music repeats after a bit, the systems start to look the same with the only real difference being the color of the core and the enemies are more or less interchangeable as far as faction goes.Characters are forgettable and the story won't suck you in, but for $20 bucks you knew there was going to be a trade off and the narrative is it.If you can't wait to play Star Citizen and Elite:Dangerous seems to complicated and in depth or requires too much patience, than this might be your cup of tea. You could do worse for $20 dollars (20 tacos at taco bell?). If you catch it on sale for $10 or less, I'd say go for it without reservation, at full price you might want to ask yourself what else that $20 could buy you.If the game ever gets mod support then buy it without hesitation and see what kind of hijinks you can get up to.

												no z axis. its a freakin beautifull game. but you have no idea how boring it is to have no z axis till u expect it and its not there.taken from revewer kobo....i agree completely   ""I also didn't like the weapons. They auto aim at stuff, and you do broadside combat where you don't really have to lead or even aim close, your weapons all just kind of pick stuff and shoot at it. The combat is very non engaging and easy, and if it were hard I'm not sure it would be anything but frustrating since there doesn't seem to be any strategy or skill involved."" -kobothat was honestly an even biger turn off for me than being stuck on a horizontal grid. You literaly just charge the weapons and point in a general direction. if theres 2 ships in that direction then the cannons just shoot the one they want			"

												A very enjoyable, even if a bit short and light on content side space combat sim/exploration game.Pros:+ Fun and often surprisingly complex combat, with decent weapon variety and high emphasis on manouvering+ A lot of ships to choose with often real trade-offs (firepower vs manouverability) and a decent amount of customization.+ Short, but enjoyable story+ Unique climate, with voice-acting and sountrack properly supporting the ""Wild West"" vibe.+ A universe full of random stuff happening+ Nice looking and well optimized graphicsCons:- Short main story- Somewhat generic and repetetive side missions- Not that much content - in my playtime I've bought the strongest ship with best modules and basicly saw everything the game has to offer- No endgame or super-rare stuff worth finding- Trade and mining are somewhat limited, there is no industrial aspect in the game like in Elite: Dangerous or X3This game definitly turned out to be much better than it had any right to be. If you're looking for a somewhat casual space sim that will give you an engaging universe and freedom to choose your own style of playing, look no further. It won't last forver, but will give you 20-30 hours of very solid experience.I just hope they will come up with some expansion packs or a sequel that will expand on the formula. They have most of the basics done right, giving the player some far-reaching goals, like conquering stations and building an industrial empire would make it absolutely awesome.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun game, that get's repetitive in the later parts.I really enjoyed most of my time with the game, it doesn't have much variety though. There are not many different quest types and it feels like the music loops through the same few songs over and over. These things are no problems in the beginning. I had a blast just trucking through space, retrieving and delivering cargo to different stations, outrunning or shooting bandits, earn money and upgrade you ship. Once I was ready to leave the first system I realized it doesn't really change.It doesn't help that you have to do the ""grinding"", side missions between the main story to earn money, to buy better parts for you ship or a different ship altogether so you can survive against higher level enemies.I have an alright tolerance for this but got fed up after about 30h and just wanted to finish the game. It's possible I spend to much time in the first system(s) and maybe could have been more efficient to go to different systems earlier for more lucrative quests. Your mileage may vary.If that isn't a problem for you, this is the perfect game for you!			"

												Fantastic, absolutely worth the $20 I paid for it and then some.It's the gritty, space cowboy vibe of Starcraft and Firefly with some deep combat that you [finally] won't want a friggin' flight stick to enjoy.+Soundtrack is almost worth the price alone. Hint: use an .ogg file converter.+Cool ship design and some fantastic depth to the gear+Simplicity of movement thanks to no verticality (you don't need to fly up or down, just left, right, or forward)-Combat is satisfying as all hell but some of the nuances could be explained better. It took me a while to figure out how flak cannons work, for instance.-Some kinds of gear, such as engines, have more of a bland linear progression than a matter of preference and variety.-Game only saves at space stations-Some achievements are busted. (ex: my achievement ticker says I've killed a space pirate lord or whatnot, but the tracker for killing 10 says I haven't gotten a single oneTLDR: It's the space sim you want without all the complicated crap that would push you away.

												How is this supposed to freely support various growth path? Story is non-existant, trading is weird and underwhelming at best, mining is an awful/dull experience (and the mining laser is awkwardly hidden at the bottom of a weapon list somewhere you'd never check if not told). This leaves you with combat as the only real way to get ahead, and there are better (free) space combat games. I'll admit the graphics are good (most space games are since it's relatively easy to do) and the music is interesting. But that will keep you going for less than 2h, which is - thankfully - how long you have to ask the refund.  "

												This game is Grindy, ok. But grinding in this game is SO MUCH FUN.you take command of a capital ship here, and engage with broadside type of engagement. The plane is 2D (game is 3D but you cannot go up or down), its not bad.Game is vissibly ported from Console, however, PC version doesn't seem to have any downsides than sometimes tricky controlls. At least on my rig.Music and setting is great. You end up in 'Western like cowboy rouge sector, with only your ship to count on. It gives you a great feel about dangers of space. Will you answer this distress beacon? It might be a trap !Faction system is also good, however they could merge citizents and militia to one faction, otherwise, you might have funny situations where merchants hate you cause you pirate them, but Navy still likes you. Well, that might not be a downside but dunno.Fighting with enemies is pure satisfaction. You get to kill ships in dozens, broadside or not (turrets&missiles are available)Simply get this game if you like capital ship solo-like west gun blazing game.			"

												I'm in two minds about this game.My greatest concern is the way it was ported to PC.  Firstly flying in a limited 2D plane of motion.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more freedom.  Secondly is the context-sensitive button and that practically everything is mapped to 'qweasd,' making both combat and UI awkward.  It is impossible to use a joystick.However I'll still give it a thumbs up because I played the buggery out of Freelancer, which has a similar feel but the battles are 1,000% more hardcore.  Sick slide guitar soundtrack, too!  Someone cross this game with Dreadnought, please!!			"

												Do you like Firefly? Do you like flying around in a ship and blowing stuff up? Then buy this game.Play as a pirate, smuggler, merchant, miner, mercenary, soldier or any combination you like!The story is nothing to write home about, but this is mostly a space sandbox anyway. The game itself is absolutely gorgeous and an incredible pleasure to play. There are many different ship types to play around with and different weapon combinations to keep you interested for a good while. The little dinky tugboat you start out with isn't much, but it won't take you too long to throw some bigger guns on it and start slugging it out with the bigger ships.Ship flight is arcade-style and takes place in faux-3D space: that is to say smaller ships like fighters and bombers (which you don't pilot) fly around in 3D, but the bigger ships, from corvettes to dreadnaughts, stay on a 2D plane. Ships have turrets and you can pick up a hireable strike-craft to help you out, but most of the firepower is concentrated in naval-style broadside weaponry.Difficulty is mostly linear and is determined by the tier of your equipment, not the size of your ship, so you're not forced to play a huge, sluggish battleship if you don't want to (or don't want to save up for it.) Some people have complained about the ""risk estimate"" for certain missions being a little inaccurate, but I haven't really had any issues with it provided I upgrade my equipment properly and am not afraid to bug out when the going gets tough.Default soundtrack is great - a pleasureable selection of hard rock music that fits the tone of the game. You can add your own music, or replace the whole soundtrack altogether if you want. Controls are smooth, with the occasional futzing required with overlapping cargo containers (protip: use your targetting scanner to lock onto the container you want.) Graphics are absolutely stunning and the sound effects are top notch.Definitely worth picking up this gem!			"

												The game gets boring pretty quick. It starts out fun, but it turns in to a terrible grind real quick. After awhile you are forced to take on the same missions over and over just to get enough cash to upgrade. Even then, the upgrades don't offer much variety. It's mostly going from MK I to MK II to MK III etc...After that, it's more grinding for more cash. The missions aren't even all that fun or memorable.The combat doesn't even require a whole heck of a lot of tactics, especially since the game only allows movement on 1 plane in what should be a 3d world (outer space and all that).It's a good game if it were cheap, but I wouldn't spend more than 5 space bucks.

Saving at portsThis last point would not anger me so much if the game didn't have Scaled Enemies. "

												This game is Grindy, ok. But grinding in this game is SO MUCH FUN.you take command of a capital ship here, and engage with broadside type of engagement. The plane is 2D (game is 3D but you cannot go up or down), its not bad.Game is vissibly ported from Console, however, PC version doesn't seem to have any downsides than sometimes tricky controlls. At least on my rig.Music and setting is great. You end up in 'Western like cowboy rouge sector, with only your ship to count on. It gives you a great feel about dangers of space. Will you answer this distress beacon? It might be a trap !Faction system is also good, however they could merge citizents and militia to one faction, otherwise, you might have funny situations where merchants hate you cause you pirate them, but Navy still likes you. Well, that might not be a downside but dunno.Fighting with enemies is pure satisfaction. You get to kill ships in dozens, broadside or not (turrets&missiles are available)Simply get this game if you like capital ship solo-like west gun blazing game.			"

												this game was great.  lots of action.  The ship designs were really unique and cool.  The colors and special effects are really nice too.  Its way more of an arcade space game,  not very simulation.  Thats what i like about it.  You pretty much spend more time fighting and blowing up ships than doing anything else.  Really fun to play			"

												Do you like Firefly? Do you like flying around in a ship and blowing stuff up? Then buy this game.Play as a pirate, smuggler, merchant, miner, mercenary, soldier or any combination you like!The story is nothing to write home about, but this is mostly a space sandbox anyway. The game itself is absolutely gorgeous and an incredible pleasure to play. There are many different ship types to play around with and different weapon combinations to keep you interested for a good while. The little dinky tugboat you start out with isn't much, but it won't take you too long to throw some bigger guns on it and start slugging it out with the bigger ships.Ship flight is arcade-style and takes place in faux-3D space: that is to say smaller ships like fighters and bombers (which you don't pilot) fly around in 3D, but the bigger ships, from corvettes to dreadnaughts, stay on a 2D plane. Ships have turrets and you can pick up a hireable strike-craft to help you out, but most of the firepower is concentrated in naval-style broadside weaponry.Difficulty is mostly linear and is determined by the tier of your equipment, not the size of your ship, so you're not forced to play a huge, sluggish battleship if you don't want to (or don't want to save up for it.) Some people have complained about the ""risk estimate"" for certain missions being a little inaccurate, but I haven't really had any issues with it provided I upgrade my equipment properly and am not afraid to bug out when the going gets tough.Default soundtrack is great - a pleasureable selection of hard rock music that fits the tone of the game. You can add your own music, or replace the whole soundtrack altogether if you want. Controls are smooth, with the occasional futzing required with overlapping cargo containers (protip: use your targetting scanner to lock onto the container you want.) Graphics are absolutely stunning and the sound effects are top notch.Definitely worth picking up this gem!			"

												Playing the original Wing Commander as a kid, I can say that this game is at least less aggravating than that flustercuck of getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in space, thanks to this game's native third person view, nice targeting systems, and limiting player movement to an invisible, flat ""surface"" in space. In other words, you can't point your ship ""up"" and fly that way. You drive through space like in a car, only turning left and right. This might be a point of contention to some, but in combat and while exploring, I found this to get on my nerves in Wing Commander, so I honestly prefer Rebel Galaxy's handling of this.The music in this game is pretty darn cool. Just watch the trailer on Steam if you want a taste. It works really well and keeps comabt and exploration more enjoyable. That said, it's ""more"" enjoyable thanks to the music; never really enjoyed the gameplay myself. Everything feels like a big fetch quest, even when the missions aren't fetch quests. You go to a space station, spend money to upgrade your ship, talk to an alien, get a mission, and go to another nav point which requires a couple of minutes of flying in one direction with nothing to do, before reaching a fight that involves whittling down enemy shields and hull, one by one, until they're all dead. Then you fly back to the space station again and repeat. I only played for 3 hours, and I got bored during that length of time.What's worse, if you die, there is no quicksave or checkpoint system while you're away from a space station, so be prepared to repeat lengthy 2-3 minute space travel segments and 5 minute combat segments all over again, just to get to the part you died on before. Everything has a grindy feel to it: earning money, upgrading the ship, the combat itself, etc. I cannot recommend a game that appears to require many more hours to complete, but which left me bored and wanting to play something else within 3 hours' time.

												I'm in two minds about this game.My greatest concern is the way it was ported to PC.  Firstly flying in a limited 2D plane of motion.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more freedom.  Secondly is the context-sensitive button and that practically everything is mapped to 'qweasd,' making both combat and UI awkward.  It is impossible to use a joystick.However I'll still give it a thumbs up because I played the buggery out of Freelancer, which has a similar feel but the battles are 1,000% more hardcore.  Sick slide guitar soundtrack, too!  Someone cross this game with Dreadnought, please!!			"

Grind to top armor -> grind to top weapon -> jump to next system -> repeatAlso game is giving very poor informations of mechanics and have VERY simplified controls of a ship.It really hurts to give a ""no"" to that game... add a random loot, more ship customization, crew, more quests and random events, real stats of components and ship status. - just make it Path of Exile mixed with Starfleet Command 3 and... and Rebel Galaxy 2 will be a jewel woth of 50€(easy to say... i know) "

												I can't think of anybody I know who would enjoy Rebel Galaxy in any way that I do.For me there's just something incredibly moreish about crusing around space in a big metal tub. All the pew pew lasers on the space ships just triggers something in the pleasure centre of my brain.For a normal human being, there isn't much to the game, you just kinda cruise around from point to point, wait for your turrets to auto-kill everyone there, and collect your money so you can buy a bigger space ship. I'm pretty sure everyone I know would hate that, but I think it's great. It's the exact sort of game I want to be playing.			"

												How is this supposed to freely support various growth path? Story is non-existant, trading is weird and underwhelming at best, mining is an awful/dull experience (and the mining laser is awkwardly hidden at the bottom of a weapon list somewhere you'd never check if not told). This leaves you with combat as the only real way to get ahead, and there are better (free) space combat games. I'll admit the graphics are good (most space games are since it's relatively easy to do) and the music is interesting. But that will keep you going for less than 2h, which is - thankfully - how long you have to ask the refund.  "

												The game gets boring pretty quick. It starts out fun, but it turns in to a terrible grind real quick. After awhile you are forced to take on the same missions over and over just to get enough cash to upgrade. Even then, the upgrades don't offer much variety. It's mostly going from MK I to MK II to MK III etc...After that, it's more grinding for more cash. The missions aren't even all that fun or memorable.The combat doesn't even require a whole heck of a lot of tactics, especially since the game only allows movement on 1 plane in what should be a 3d world (outer space and all that).It's a good game if it were cheap, but I wouldn't spend more than 5 space bucks.

												""I'm a cowboy! On a steel ship I fly! I'm Wanted, WANTED, Dead or alive."" - Me everytime I start this game.Seriously, if you like the idea of doing what you want with your own ship in space then this is the game for you. Graphics look great. The story is cool but most the fun comes from modding out your own ship to fit your play style. I've seen people who like to snipe with their ship, people who like to get up close and personal, and everything inbetween. The game does get a little repetitive at times and I do feel like I am grinding missions just to get the money to make my ship great but with a soundtrack like this who cares? The soundtrack has a rock/blues/country/ feel to it and really fits the game. If that isn't your style you can always port your own music in and play to the beat of your own drum.The character models are reused often and if that's what it takes for this small developement team to make a great game then I am perfectly fine with it.

It feels very much like a sea game in its dynamics only allowing movement in the 2D and fireing with broadsides, but the game is not brought down by this but enhanced. I have only had an hour with the game so far but first impressions are great, with a well presented main story, as well as random encounters I can tell I am going to enjoy this game.

												This game seriously came out of no where!!  Last I heard about the devs was back when they parted ways from Runic soon after Torchlight 2 released to form Double Damage just over a year ago, then they fell off my radar and now BAM! they're back with a pretty solid space sim in a really short space of time. I'm so impressed by that, well played indeed!As a space sim enthusiast,  I have to admit I was initially a little put off by the fact there was no 3D space flight and it was all naval style combat but soon after I got into the game I found broadside combat to be really engaging and a lot more fun than I originally thought it would be. I'm not very far into the game yet but I've been enjoying mining, trading, fighting pirates, the typical space sim activities and apparently, it's possible to join the pirate faction with its own storyline, pretty cool. Rebel Galaxy is easily worth the full $20 price tag.			"

												If you like the idea of EVE / Elite:Dangerous but tried playing both and thought... I can't be arsed. Then play this instead.Basically it's like an Indie Freelancer, this would be the closest game you could compare it to. Yes it is not a 'space simulator' but what it does give you is turrets that you can just give targeting orders to... which i think is awesome and a suedo tactical battle if you use the scan function to effectively pause the game and think out a strategy. I have played this game for several hours and have many more hours of gameplay left. Mining is... well mining but it has been done quite well. Battles are fun but it is a bit of a 'I have bigger guns and better shields' fight more than anything. Trading actually works!Basically if you enjoyed Freelancer buy this, if you are drawn to 'Elite' type games but ultimately you've tried things like X, Elite:D and EVE and just couldn't be bothered with the time investment and complication then buy this. If you like to wear a long brown jacket and insist that your girlfriend calls you Mal... buy this.I personally would just plain recommend you buy this!9/10 - Could be more variation with stations and objects. Music is great but repetitive. Wish I could have a fleet not just one ship.			"

												The atmosphere this game delivers is amazing.  The Music is a BIG plus.  It makes me feel like I am in a pseudo-firefly universe.  Game play is simplistic enough.  Space battles and navigation is very 2D, but done so in a manner where the game still feels expansive.			"

												Massively under-rated game. Basically, this is a much more approachable version of Elite: Dangerous and the X:Rebirth series. Those games are more of a project, whereas Rebel Galaxy is more of an actual game.One thing to realize about the game is that there is no z axis, which means that you don't go up and down. Yes, the fighters are going to swarm around you from all angles, but you don't aim your broadsides up and down... the computer does the up and down for you. The broadsides take a little getting used to, but once you do you'll be blasting fools in no time.Super highly recommended			"

The music is really sweet and fits the whole adventure theme of the game. My first battle outside of the tutorial I got stomped though fighting 3 ships which was kind of annoying although I did escape wihtout dying by some miracle and warping to tthe awesome sountrack. Combat is broadside style in the spirit of AC:3/4 and is quite fun. Looking forward to really diving in but didnt want people to miss the 50% off sale. Refunded SPAZ 2 for this lol			"

												Got this game after being disappointed with the perma alpha star citizen and the buggy elite dangerous. I figured it was just going to be a fun waste of time. 40+ hours later, it has consumed my life. This is a mix of the greatest parts of Privateer, Freelancer, and even Firefly. I was sad to complete the last story mission, but the rest of the galaxy is still available and the random missions are still fun.I hope that they release some more content, even if it is just new ships, as I would buy it in a heartbeat.

												""I'm a cowboy! On a steel ship I fly! I'm Wanted, WANTED, Dead or alive."" - Me everytime I start this game.Seriously, if you like the idea of doing what you want with your own ship in space then this is the game for you. Graphics look great. The story is cool but most the fun comes from modding out your own ship to fit your play style. I've seen people who like to snipe with their ship, people who like to get up close and personal, and everything inbetween. The game does get a little repetitive at times and I do feel like I am grinding missions just to get the money to make my ship great but with a soundtrack like this who cares? The soundtrack has a rock/blues/country/ feel to it and really fits the game. If that isn't your style you can always port your own music in and play to the beat of your own drum.The character models are reused often and if that's what it takes for this small developement team to make a great game then I am perfectly fine with it.

												It's a decent game, reminiscent of Wing Commander: Privateer.The only issue I see is that the controls are somewhat simplified due to it being a console port (ok, I'm fairly sure it's a console port) and there are a number of options missing.   Not being able to zoom out from your ship, not being able to go 1st person, not being able to check your inventory in flight or dump cargo...But otherwise, it really is a decent game which kept me hooked until the end.7.5/10			"

												What a blast! Didn't know I was craving Rock'n Roll in space. Now I need more of that ludicrous alchemy: Dubstep Gothic, Minimal House Fantasy, NewRetroWave Sword and Planet...Rebel Galaxy profits from some tightly focused game design that does exactly 2 or 3 things really well without resorting to needless filler. Consequently its approach is very much arcade, so don't expect a lot of simulation here.The missing vertical axis works surprisingly well and I didn't feel restricted by it. Presumably many people will be put off, though.+Flair: Like an issue of HeavyMetal magazine.+Soundtrack: +150% cool. Also easily replaced with your personal flavour, if needed.+Action: Fast and Fun.-Exploration: Nice visuals but basically just background for some gunfights.-Variation: After a certain point it's more of the same².

												This game IS awesome! The game is quite fun. In this game you are a nephew looking for your aunt. Pretty much the story summed up in a single sentence.... from where I am. This game is kinda like how people play fallout 3 or 4.... you explore and forget what you are doing. Soundtrack- Its a mix of country music and rock and its just awesome! When you first go into warp the music start getting faster then right when you warp the music kicks off and you feel like a total badass! 10/10Graphics- This is an extremely pretty game. 8/10Story- The story is pretty decent but its just a way( this is how I feel) to get more money and such also to get you to explore other systems. 7/10Gameplay- Its like a 2D game set in a 3D world. While you cannot go up or down the AI can. Its very world of warships stle but is very different. You get broads sides and the AI on your ship actually fires by itself or you can control them yourself. 9/10Overall- Its a very fun game and is very addicting when you go around being a kickass bounty hunter and mowing down hundreds of fighters and capital ships. If you love spaceships and rock & roll then you'll love this.			"

												I really like the Idea of this game. Battleship combat in Space witha variety of weapons and enemys. Solving Missions as Mercenary for hire or Merchant or whatever.The game IS fun, at least in the first 15 to 19 hours. Thus i still would recommed this game, even for it's full price. However, after 19 hours the gameplay really runs thin on me and is still the same as it was at the beginning, just with a little bit different and statistically better weapons.If there is more variety further in then that iks bad because after 19 hours the game should have put on it's best gameplay pants.  Overall it doesn't really do variation that well.These are the reasons why i coulödn't keep going any more.Equipment/Upgrades are more or less superlinear: There is no sense in choosing a weaker weapon because you perhabs like the look or how it's mechanic works, if it's of a lower damage and a shorter range then what you actually can get you won't bother because of it's downsides.This counts for every aspect of the upgrades, everything is rather a linear upgrade because the best things to get will be (numerical as well as trough testing them) only the best Broadsides, Turrets, Shields and so on.On top of the the lack of variation also comes from the game having not enough actually usefull or rewarding... well rewards. drops of items or weapons. In my 19 hours with the game it dropped maybe 5 Items one of wich i then actually took on till i stopped playing because it was just the best. Or at least i think it were drops because the game sure as hell didn't really tell me.All the thiongs that the enemys let fall is really boring loot that is also really cumbersome and stupid hard to collect. Because for some reason you can lock on to dropped cargo but if the Tractorbeam just doesn't want to collect the more viable ressource and instead insists on picking up the♥♥♥♥♥♥Nuts and Bolts then there is nothing you can really do about it aside from collectting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing drive it elsewhere, throw it into space over there and then come back to repeat the same thing until... NO THANKS after a short while i just didn't bother with most of these drops. Good equipment and weapons you only get in stations. That is not a bad thing per se but it hurts the gameplay fun. Why don't we have a slvage mechanism where we can salvage broken enemy ships?Samey and thin Mission/Story: The Story is okay. Nothing really to write home about. It gives you a direction to go for but much more then thin context for the mission it ain't. Not even the Main Ones. Every Mission is more or less the same. No matter what the description or story behind the Mission. You go somewhere, bla bla happens, enemys are there or turn up, you shot stuff, perhabs you have to deliver something and that was it. Go there, pewpew, done. Well, there WAS one mission that was a escort mission. But that was an instant death of mission target thing. Not that i really could have done something against it. Wich incidentally feeds into the next problem.The combatsystem is flat: And i don't only say that because in stead of real space you actually just move on a single layer, an invisible ""surfeace"" in space. That in itselfe i don't mind at all.The promisse of the combat system is really interesting at first. You have braoadsides, like a battleship should :-) , and with growing ships you own more and more turrets on top of it. In the Pause menue you can then give the different turrets commands like, only attack fighters , or that rocketturret is only suppossed to shoot at Capital ships. You can also take control over the different turrets youself but that doesn't really make much sense. With increasing Equipment you get the feeling your tactical possibilities grow. But they don'tAside from limiting missille turrets for the bigger ships the best strategy is to give all turrets the commando only to attack what you actually lock in with the trageting system. THIS is thousand times more effective then let different turrets do different tasls. You then skirt around the edges of the battlefield picking of the enemys piece by piece because it makes no sense to charge in and do risky stuff. That will just get you killed or addled with immense reparicosts. It doesn't bring you really much to use cover. You can hire ONE additional mercenary but those aren't much more then the turrets you already have. There is nor real strategy to the combatAnd that is a problem because it is boring as hell. Okay that's a lie, it is fun in the beginning, i wouldn't had spend 19 hours in the game otherwise, and testing the different weapons did that. But in the end it is always the exact same. And that very same lack of real strategy was also was cost me that one Escort Mission.With no viable tactics that i could have stopped the different enemys from attacking my charge. There are no weapons that do much beyound damage. There is no REAL variety.But instead of hammering on that point i will tell you what i WISHED it had:First off, give me more bigger ships that i can hire with different real gameplay roles (Give me a tank, a repairiship, a ship that can confuse or disrupt(e.g. debuff) enemy systems with AOE Explosions.Let me give them a strategy and a DIRECT choice of target or missionparameters. Like the repairship´is to reapair (du) us but keep away from capital ships. The tankships is to stay close to me to catch the really heavy incoming fire in my flank. Do the same for the enemys and that would give me an incentive do actually dive into enemy ranks and aim for their specific ships.Do the same for the weapons. Gve me a variety of functions. How cool would i have been if i could use point defence flak against missilles, streams of bulletts flying away into the sky with a chance that they miss one and some get trough. How about those same guns don't just affect missilles that attack me but an area around me. Or that ramming shield, make that actually DO SOMETHING. Because as far as it stands there is no real gain from ramming your ship into others with it, the name is totally useless in that case.In a escort mission i would stay close to my charge together with a Tanking ship and my possibilitys would have been much greater.It also would have given far better tools for the overall mission variety just by playing with the enemycombinations.  It would have had the chance of getting me much deeper into the frau riskl something, drive me to the edge and i imagine how i in a last bit for taking down that pesky Carrier how i ram my ship into his and win day...or something.As it stands the game is good for the first ten to fifteen hours or so then it becomes really samey same and uninteresting.From the fact that i unasked loose my ship when i buy a new one over the mission to the weapons and gagdgets it simply lacks the depth to carry me further. Wich is sad because i feel this could be more. Perhabs next time. :-P			"

												This is a very well made game. An almost Freelancer style game with simple mechanics that make learning quick and fun. The missions you take can be legal or illegal - bounty hunter, merchant, smuggler, miner, thief, and so forth. Combat is satisfying and engaging, though a bit over the top at times and occasionally downright impossible until you have had further equipment upgrades. Once purchased though, the difficulty lowers.The commodity system was great! This was one of the most satisfying games for being a merchant I've ever played. Watch for starvation and run them food from an agrarian planet. Take water from one system that is rich in it to a more barren system and earn 200% or more than what you bought it for. Took a little getting use to, and I still don't understand it all, but the overall mechanic is satisfying once you get an idea of it.My only gripe is it needs more content. After the main story is over, you have the biggest Dreadnaugh, and you are fully upgraded, doing missions is a little pointless. The devs should open it up for modding. More ships, weapons, equipment, systems, etc., etc., and this game would be more than a hoot.Definitely worth the $20. The game is great and a definite recommend, even if it's for a few story runs only.			"

												Rebel Galaxy was initialy hard to play, the controls felt wierd and until I got my settings right the framerate wasn't great, but after fixing the settings and about two hours this became one of the best games I have ever played. Top five for sure. Basicly think of what it would be like if Empire at War's space battles weren't RTS, or if Battle Star Galactica Online wasn't for wallet warriors and wasn't unbalanced. The locked plane and broadside combat keeps the game simple and exciting and totally un-clunky, although sometimes the menus can be a bit difficult.The ship designs are great too, especially the underated Sorcerer dreadnought (my personal favorite ship, by far) although sometimes the AI targeting gets confused due to the ship's geometry, which was fixed with the sorcerer for the main part but makes the McKinley my least favorite ship so far.Aliens in this game also have good design by being Lovecraftian fish people or rad badger dudes and they all feel Star Wars inspired and combined with the hailing system also add a sort of Star Trek feel.Overall, the game is initially daunting and difficult to get used to, but after you've given it a chance it is absolutely great.

												This game is fantastic.  I rarely play indie games because, I admit, I like the polish and eye candy that comes with the big studio titles.  But Rebel Galaxy has plenty of polish and eye candy.  The combat is fun, upgrading my ship is fun, and the sound track is out of this world.  Really great value!			"

												Think Biker gang meets space sim, it was a great play through. its in space but Very easy to navigate... think Biker gang meets broadside navel combat in space. be an outlaw or military and earn your way up the ladder. I highly reccomend this to anybody who likes the genre. it can take full advantage of a high end video or still look good and play smooth for the casual player.  I for sure don't feel cheated out of my time.			"

												This is the game I've been looking for since Freelancer. Combat takes place on capital ships, so don't expect to be pulling off sweet manuevres or Luke in the Death Star trench stuff. The whole premise of the game is that you're looking for pieces of a puzzle first introduced by your enigmatic aunt, along the way you undertake missions and♥♥♥♥♥♥off all the pirates in the sector to the point you can't dock anywhere any more. I came to this off the back of Elite Dangerous, and have been completely satisfied. High risk missions pay more money (hauling huge munitions cargos into the middle of a siege is immensly rewarding), and you have full freedom to do whatever you want and explore the galaxy. Combat is usually pretty fluid, though learning to balance your weapons and deflectors takes a little practice, and the broadside based combat may not be everyone's cup of tea.			"

												What a blast! Didn't know I was craving Rock'n Roll in space. Now I need more of that ludicrous alchemy: Dubstep Gothic, Minimal House Fantasy, NewRetroWave Sword and Planet...Rebel Galaxy profits from some tightly focused game design that does exactly 2 or 3 things really well without resorting to needless filler. Consequently its approach is very much arcade, so don't expect a lot of simulation here.The missing vertical axis works surprisingly well and I didn't feel restricted by it. Presumably many people will be put off, though.+Flair: Like an issue of HeavyMetal magazine.+Soundtrack: +150% cool. Also easily replaced with your personal flavour, if needed.+Action: Fast and Fun.-Exploration: Nice visuals but basically just background for some gunfights.-Variation: After a certain point it's more of the same².

												This game IS awesome! The game is quite fun. In this game you are a nephew looking for your aunt. Pretty much the story summed up in a single sentence.... from where I am. This game is kinda like how people play fallout 3 or 4.... you explore and forget what you are doing. Soundtrack- Its a mix of country music and rock and its just awesome! When you first go into warp the music start getting faster then right when you warp the music kicks off and you feel like a total badass! 10/10Graphics- This is an extremely pretty game. 8/10Story- The story is pretty decent but its just a way( this is how I feel) to get more money and such also to get you to explore other systems. 7/10Gameplay- Its like a 2D game set in a 3D world. While you cannot go up or down the AI can. Its very world of warships stle but is very different. You get broads sides and the AI on your ship actually fires by itself or you can control them yourself. 9/10Overall- Its a very fun game and is very addicting when you go around being a kickass bounty hunter and mowing down hundreds of fighters and capital ships. If you love spaceships and rock & roll then you'll love this.			"

Posted: March 26, 2016
												I really like the Idea of this game. Battleship combat in Space witha variety of weapons and enemys. Solving Missions as Mercenary for hire or Merchant or whatever.The game IS fun, at least in the first 15 to 19 hours. Thus i still would recommed this game, even for it's full price. However, after 19 hours the gameplay really runs thin on me and is still the same as it was at the beginning, just with a little bit different and statistically better weapons.If there is more variety further in then that iks bad because after 19 hours the game should have put on it's best gameplay pants.  Overall it doesn't really do variation that well.These are the reasons why i coulödn't keep going any more.Equipment/Upgrades are more or less superlinear: There is no sense in choosing a weaker weapon because you perhabs like the look or how it's mechanic works, if it's of a lower damage and a shorter range then what you actually can get you won't bother because of it's downsides.This counts for every aspect of the upgrades, everything is rather a linear upgrade because the best things to get will be (numerical as well as trough testing them) only the best Broadsides, Turrets, Shields and so on.On top of the the lack of variation also comes from the game having not enough actually usefull or rewarding... well rewards. drops of items or weapons. In my 19 hours with the game it dropped maybe 5 Items one of wich i then actually took on till i stopped playing because it was just the best. Or at least i think it were drops because the game sure as hell didn't really tell me.All the thiongs that the enemys let fall is really boring loot that is also really cumbersome and stupid hard to collect. Because for some reason you can lock on to dropped cargo but if the Tractorbeam just doesn't want to collect the more viable ressource and instead insists on picking up the♥♥♥♥♥♥Nuts and Bolts then there is nothing you can really do about it aside from collectting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing drive it elsewhere, throw it into space over there and then come back to repeat the same thing until... NO THANKS after a short while i just didn't bother with most of these drops. Good equipment and weapons you only get in stations. That is not a bad thing per se but it hurts the gameplay fun. Why don't we have a slvage mechanism where we can salvage broken enemy ships?Samey and thin Mission/Story: The Story is okay. Nothing really to write home about. It gives you a direction to go for but much more then thin context for the mission it ain't. Not even the Main Ones. Every Mission is more or less the same. No matter what the description or story behind the Mission. You go somewhere, bla bla happens, enemys are there or turn up, you shot stuff, perhabs you have to deliver something and that was it. Go there, pewpew, done. Well, there WAS one mission that was a escort mission. But that was an instant death of mission target thing. Not that i really could have done something against it. Wich incidentally feeds into the next problem.The combatsystem is flat: And i don't only say that because in stead of real space you actually just move on a single layer, an invisible ""surfeace"" in space. That in itselfe i don't mind at all.The promisse of the combat system is really interesting at first. You have braoadsides, like a battleship should :-) , and with growing ships you own more and more turrets on top of it. In the Pause menue you can then give the different turrets commands like, only attack fighters , or that rocketturret is only suppossed to shoot at Capital ships. You can also take control over the different turrets youself but that doesn't really make much sense. With increasing Equipment you get the feeling your tactical possibilities grow. But they don'tAside from limiting missille turrets for the bigger ships the best strategy is to give all turrets the commando only to attack what you actually lock in with the trageting system. THIS is thousand times more effective then let different turrets do different tasls. You then skirt around the edges of the battlefield picking of the enemys piece by piece because it makes no sense to charge in and do risky stuff. That will just get you killed or addled with immense reparicosts. It doesn't bring you really much to use cover. You can hire ONE additional mercenary but those aren't much more then the turrets you already have. There is nor real strategy to the combatAnd that is a problem because it is boring as hell. Okay that's a lie, it is fun in the beginning, i wouldn't had spend 19 hours in the game otherwise, and testing the different weapons did that. But in the end it is always the exact same. And that very same lack of real strategy was also was cost me that one Escort Mission.With no viable tactics that i could have stopped the different enemys from attacking my charge. There are no weapons that do much beyound damage. There is no REAL variety.But instead of hammering on that point i will tell you what i WISHED it had:First off, give me more bigger ships that i can hire with different real gameplay roles (Give me a tank, a repairiship, a ship that can confuse or disrupt(e.g. debuff) enemy systems with AOE Explosions.Let me give them a strategy and a DIRECT choice of target or missionparameters. Like the repairship´is to reapair (du) us but keep away from capital ships. The tankships is to stay close to me to catch the really heavy incoming fire in my flank. Do the same for the enemys and that would give me an incentive do actually dive into enemy ranks and aim for their specific ships.Do the same for the weapons. Gve me a variety of functions. How cool would i have been if i could use point defence flak against missilles, streams of bulletts flying away into the sky with a chance that they miss one and some get trough. How about those same guns don't just affect missilles that attack me but an area around me. Or that ramming shield, make that actually DO SOMETHING. Because as far as it stands there is no real gain from ramming your ship into others with it, the name is totally useless in that case.In a escort mission i would stay close to my charge together with a Tanking ship and my possibilitys would have been much greater.It also would have given far better tools for the overall mission variety just by playing with the enemycombinations.  It would have had the chance of getting me much deeper into the frau riskl something, drive me to the edge and i imagine how i in a last bit for taking down that pesky Carrier how i ram my ship into his and win day...or something.As it stands the game is good for the first ten to fifteen hours or so then it becomes really samey same and uninteresting.From the fact that i unasked loose my ship when i buy a new one over the mission to the weapons and gagdgets it simply lacks the depth to carry me further. Wich is sad because i feel this could be more. Perhabs next time. :-P			"

												It's a decent game, reminiscent of Wing Commander: Privateer.The only issue I see is that the controls are somewhat simplified due to it being a console port (ok, I'm fairly sure it's a console port) and there are a number of options missing.   Not being able to zoom out from your ship, not being able to go 1st person, not being able to check your inventory in flight or dump cargo...But otherwise, it really is a decent game which kept me hooked until the end.7.5/10			"

												This game likes to stretch itself out. Normally i don't mind a game that takes me a long time to complete. I like feeling as if i got my money's worth. Good games (like Witcher 3) do this by giving you hours upon hours of enjoyable content and interesting plot. Rebel Galaxy stretches itself out by creating a vast emptiness between everypoint and making your speed very very slow. I get it, it's space, there is supposed to be an emptiness, vast distances between places. So what's the point of giving me a warp drive (one that no matter how much you upgrade still seems slow as hell) if it's still going to take me two minutes to reach anywhere i want to go, and that's only if i'm lucky enough to not get stopped by a group of pirates or an asteroid field. I've spent 17 hours playing this game, the majority of it was spent in transit. All the tension this game gave me was not from space battles or plot development, but instead the worry of wether or not i would reach the next objective anytime soon.If you want to pretend to be a space trucker hauling cargo for days on end, just to afford better gear to slowly move the story forward. then this game is for you.If you're looking for fun, and excitement, look elsewhere.

												A game without any need for a player. You make no decisions- just follow a waypoint indicator to the next mission. You don't aim, your weapons autoaim and some of them autofire. There is no terrain, occassional asteroids dot the map but they don't effect combat much. Every set of enemies feels identical - there is no variety whatsoever. The game is played strictly on a 2d plane. The only tactic I ever had to use was kite enemies from long range if I was overwhelmed (which was very rare).  Weapon variety is low and upgrade progression is linear. The music quickly becomes dull, mostly twangy country music. Not a lot of variety. The graphics are nice and ships show damage decalls when hit. There is a big variety in ship size and appearance. It would be nice if a ship 10 times my own ship's size was intimidating at all I guess.Perhaps most telling is the components present in the game. There's a lot of opportunity here, perhaps there could be a part that doubles your speed and halves your shields. Instead all of them give marginal benefits to your ship (like a 10% increase in turning speed). These components are all expensive, requiring more than a dozen missions of farming to get. The entire game is a grind with no need for a player. Why couldn't you find something for me to do Rebel Galaxy?			"

												The lack of autosave after completing missions makes playing this game tedious and obnoxious. There's no way to run a string of missions and save in between each finished mission. You either have to dock at a space station, which could be very far away, or you have to exit and then restart the game. Why this game saves on exit but allows absolutely no other means to manually save this game is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and play a different game that won't constantly rollback all of your progress.			"

												First game in 11 years on Steam that I've requested a refund.Contrary to what you may read from the starry-eyed youngsters spamming out blue thumbs, this is not a scion of Privateer.  This is a fourth generation knock-off of Privateer designed for the ADD crowd.  The combat is simplistic, mindless, and confusing.  The map scale is tiny.  The... well, if you loved Privateer, you know where I'm headed here.On the bright side, the developers do understand something that most designers of modern free-form space combat/trading games often miss entirely:  Privateer was a huge success because of its atmosphere and ""you are there"" feeling.  They nailed that part.  Too bad the rest of it sucks skunk sacs.Rather than spend cash on this thing, just give it to Chris Roberts to work on his latest game.  You'll get a far better return on your investment			"

												Was really excited about this, and feel a tad let down. At it's heart is an ok game. Just...  ok. A few good moments strung together with lots of crappy travelling around (I would love to hear the designer's view as to why asteroid fields stop warp speed.... seriously. It sucks). Samey missions, more travelling, and more than a few ropey balancing issues (you often get whacked as the step ups between enemy levelling is steep. It's not a big deal.. it just means, yup.. more travelling.).  Overall, it's not the new sliced bread, or Freelancer or Elite, or.. You know, actually, it's just a ok-ish game. One to pick up in the sales.			"

												Naval style combat is good and fun, and it works... if you have a top down view. Unfortunately with Rebel Galaxy it's not a top down view and you can't ever seen where you are aiming or where the enemy ship is. So you never get a hit, you always miss. And by the time you realise you wasted money buying this game, your ship isn't a ship anymore, it's space debris. So fun! Not. Simple design mechanics are overlooked by the developer of this game. They clearly didn't test the game before they went into it and are trying to break even before anyone who doesn't own the game yet realises it's too hard to succeed for a casual game to be fun.			"

												It's pretty and has this neat ""firefly""-feel to it, but it falls short on a number of points. There are alot of other games you can get for 20€. Any prospective buyers should know the following:- While the combat is cool and all at first, there's no variety whatsoever and not alot of maneuvering going on.- The same tracks play over and over again which gets stale real quick.- The missions and side-content in the game is very repetetive and soon just feels like a grind. - The story is not a redeeming quality.

												The controls respond very awkard with my logitech xbox style controller.  I got stuck in free look with one button and move with another and couldn't re-center the camera, when earlier i wasn't in that mode.  The d-pad wouldn't respond to change in and out of broadside.  Otherwise the combat is awkward if and when you can switch modes from front guns to broadside mode.  Even with ""tutorials"", the game doesn't play nearly as intuitively as similar games like Starpoint Gemini.  The graphics are decent and the station repair/upgrade/bar gossip places are fine.  All in all avoid this game unless you don't mind fighting the controls.			"

Excited to see how much there is to explore!Pros: Lots of freedomSoundtrack is amazing!Easy controls, great UIVery prettyCons:I had to stop playing to let you know just how much I'm loving it.Edit: See a lot of negative reviews regarding the soundtrack getting repetitive. On the setup window you can set directories for your own music and even break it up into idle, combat, travel etc. They also have the option to mix the original soundtrack in with your own music. Also seeing negative for limited ships. I've seen at lease 20. There are special rep ships and different ships in higher level zones so there seems to be plenty of variation there.I will say that the side missions are starting to get a bit grindy. There are about 12-15 different variations sometimes with a bit of extra flavor like ""Destroy damaged pirate frigate, reports say port broadside batteries are down""			"

												Runtime Error. a new game of 10-20 minutes from double damage. in this game, if you can, you will encounter subpar voice recording; a map system that you cannot search because consoles don't have keyboards; and random game crashes [in existance since release] that affect a lot of people.seriously, this game crashes for tons of people; you get a runtime error and your graphics drivers crash. but before that happens you'll enounter voiceovers that buzz from low quality microphones, others that echo from being recorded in rooms with little, to none, sound baffeling. you may even get to use the poorly ported games map system which leaves tons to be desired from.got problems? well double damage is so poor they have no forum, so clicking on any links steam provides won't take you anywhere so you'll have to search google and find their page which redirects you to steam after it redirects you from double damages unexistant studio page(yaye for godaddy placeholders). you will find that the dev mostly engaged in futile redirections for your issue, and sure enough, failed to fix the issues probably because his little nestegg was designed to farm consoles for a quick buck and he has no real skill at diagnosing the problem; indeed the game doesn't even file error reports.i'm sure loads of you will have no problem, you'll most likely neg my review; but i can't recomend a game i can't play for more then 20 minutes, one that only saves in stations, one with poor quality sound, an epic level of underdesign(freelancer, yeah, right), and one in which the dev obviously is another indy wallet farm. there is plenty of games from active developers, i'm just going to get a refund. but if you're feeling lucky, go ahead.

												There is one part of this game that is so frustrating it forces me to not reccommend it. The escort quests. Their randomized nature means that your route can, and occasionally will lead through the thickest part of an asteroid field or a massive battlefield of dreadnaughts. What was supposed to be a simple mission can become insanely difficult or mind-numbingly tedious as you have to slaughter your way through monsters or slowly atomize mountains. Ugh.			"

												The control scheme and game mechanics for combat and controls are very cumbersome.  This game is not a first person simulator but forces your camera view to behave like one.    You can't exactly lock your camera to a top down view  and still hope to actually do any fighting at the same time since it is heavily dependant on your camera to be swerving around to the sides of the ship to enable attacking/aiming/shooting.The 'rpg' adventure aspect is very shallow/empty.  It's just one big fetch/delivery/grind with no depth to the world.			"

												So I've had this game for a couple of days and have a dozen hours on it or so and my overal impression is 'meh' with a side of 'boring'.I found the start of the game very infuriating, the controls didn't work on a laptop (although they were fine when I reconfigured them). But combat is still a pain, many of the actions you can perform while flying demand the camera to be facing a certain direction and you can't steer you're ship while simultaneously aiming a broadside. But that's kind of OK, it just means that the game is aimed at beginers of this genre. It does do somethings well, like having shields and armour go down on different parts of the ship independently. Would be nice if they could also be upgraded independently.Which brings me to my biggest gripe about the game. Upgrading your ship is dull. You have only a handful of options per part, which then go from Mk1 to Mk2 to Mk3, etc... Doesn't feel like an accomplishment to have my top speed under boost increase by 10%. Add to that that every battle feels the same (unless there are some unseen possible tactics I haven't come across) and the world is bland.Basically, when ever I played this game only one thought crossed my mind ""Why am I not playing X3: Terran Conflict ?"". It's not a perfect game by far, but it has all the depth that Rebel Galaxy lacks. It's not that it's a bad game, it just isn't interesting enough for me to make it fun. Perhaps the plot could have rescued it, but after 10h it is also boring and repetitive "

												The vast majority of reviews are quite decieving for this game, in that they paint a picture for this game that makes it seem like more than it really is.The 2D naval combat and the camera that's way too close makes the game feel extremely small and claustrophobic and makes combat a nuisance at best, and on top of the terrible camera, the heavy amounts of aim assist make it very dull, tracking your shots hardly matters since your shots effectively home in on the target so long as you're in range and have charged your broadside shots and the turrets are literally an autolock and fire themselves when you're in broadside mode.The controls and functionality are very off-putting as well, this game was very obviously made for consoles and wasn't properly ported to PC, there are no options in game, only a settings launcher that pops up before you enter the game so if you want to change anything at all you have to restart the game before you can. Keyboard and mouse controls feel pretty slip and slide too.Finally there's all the comparisons to Freelancer I want to put to bed.I played Freelancer for hours, probably hundreds of hours, I absolutely ADORED Freelancer, it was the ideal space sim for a plebian like me, nice and simple and really pretty while still feeling like it's in space.This however is no Freelancer.The combat is way too basic, the movement is way too restricted, the world is far too claustrophobic. Everythings packed and squeezed into this tiny 2D space where the concept of up and down are alien to the player character.Sorry Freelancer fans, you're gonna have to keep going without.Overall this game's pretty naff.It should have been a Naval game.

												Even biying this game at discount price, I cannot see the reason for this game. Can you get a refund because the gameplay is terrible?Your vessel is limited to movement in 2D, howeer, your cnnonn fire, your enemies and otherr objects occupy a 3D space. This might not be so bad except the camera is extremely poor and seems to mostly cater for your 2D plane.Also, what the heck is this broadside nonesene? It might make sense in open space, but getting attacked in an asteroid belt, trying to use broad sides seems to involve crashing into obstacles. Stupid!Talking of being attacked, warping to low risk missions at the start seems to often involve running into enemies far superior to yourself. If you cannot escape, you are screwed. This is even more annoying when you have just completed a crappy mission.Talking of crappy missions, they are mostly that, crappy. Fly to point A, destroy stuff, job done. In the beginning, there seems to be very little variety to these missions. Maybe the odd colletion job, more yawn...All the positive reviews seem to come from players whi have played this a number of hours, while the opposite seems true for the negative ones? Is it the intro \ early game which is so poor? I will try to give it some more time.			"

												A shallow main story coupled with repetative side missions make this game a stinker. Side mission types: take this here, take this guy here, kill that guy there. Bigger ships just get more turrets, broadsides, and nigh useless, expensive and selectable components. A small corvette feels the same as a giant cruiser. There is about 15 different weapons with more expensive ""Mk"" versions offering slightly higher damage or cooldown buffs as the game progresses (Blaster Mk.1, Blaster Mk.2 ... ad nauseum). You get stuck on story missions due to enemy difficulty; go grind so you can do the next main mission. Repeat. The limited ship customization, boring weapon choices, and repetative tasks make this game a snoozefest. There may be life out there in a galaxy far, far away, but it isn't this one. grindfest/10			"

												I really wanted to like Rebel Galaxy. Being a Space trader? Check. Decent graphics? Check. Mostly voiced characters? Surprise Check. And there seems to be a pretty good game in there. BUT...I was not able to play the game due to the clunky ""Broadside""/action sequences. I would have liked an option to turn on an A.I. ""Gun crew"" to handle all combat as an RPG player. Even the Broadside. As it turned out, after I bought Rebel Galaxy, Steam had a ""similar game"" recommendation at the bottom.  It is a free game that was more of what I was looking for playstyle-wise. So now I play that and Rebel Galaxy sits untouched. I rate it 2 stars out of five for potential I was not able to tap.	 "

												Freelancer singleplayer beta.. really this game just feels like a crappy singleplayer-only version of freelancer... all the items are terribly balanced, difficulty is way too easy all around. The combat isn't skillful at all, everything is auto-aimed it feels like a screensaver a lot of the time. Music is great tho.			"

												Pointless game. The controls are mystifyingly difficult to use. There is no obvious purpose to the game. It seems like someone wanted to mix a space arcade game, with a sandbox game and a story-driven RPG. This game manages to hit no good notes on any of these fronts, and the space arcade part is extraordinarily terrible to boot. Skip it and save your money.			"

												Fun game, awesome concept thats been executed very well.Only issue I have with this game is the random difficulty jumps. I am still in the starting area moving between super easy quests in my little ship that im proud of. All of a sudden I get dropped out of light speed next to 3 MASSIVE ships with 10 fighters each. I die in about 30secs. I cant run away because you cant go into lightspeed with enemies around so you just get shot to pieces. The game goes back to main menu and you load in your last save which will be the last space station you visited. That could be 5mins prior or like the 5th time for me 30mins prior.There is no way to avoid these random encounters they have been happening all over the place for me. I dont mind too much its just really time consuming doing the same section over and over again.			"

												I really wanted to like Rebel Galaxy. Being a Space trader? Check. Decent graphics? Check. Mostly voiced characters? Surprise Check. And there seems to be a pretty good game in there. BUT...I was not able to play the game due to the clunky ""Broadside""/action sequences. I would have liked an option to turn on an A.I. ""Gun crew"" to handle all combat as an RPG player. Even the Broadside. As it turned out, after I bought Rebel Galaxy, Steam had a ""similar game"" recommendation at the bottom.  It is a free game that was more of what I was looking for playstyle-wise. So now I play that and Rebel Galaxy sits untouched. I rate it 2 stars out of five for potential I was not able to tap.	 "

												Probably the closest thing to a Firefly game we'll probably get. One of the most remarkable things is how much freedom you have. Wanna be a roaming lawbringer helping traders and the local Militia? You can do that. Wanna be a smuggler sneaking contraband under the nose of the local authorities. Go right ahead! Hell, do you wanna make money shrewdly analyzing market prices system wide and raking in the profit. Then take it its yours! Granted you will sometimes run across enemies that can spank you from here to the end of the galaxy and have to run and to be honest I'm just fine with that. It makes you feel like you're really part of this larger galaxy, you're not the end all be all, just another spacer wandering the galaxy.

Dont buy anything from STEAM.  Their pathetic return policies clearly show that STEAM does not do well enough a job standing behind what they sell or represent.

												I am actually surprised that a low buget game like Rebel Galaxy can have so much content in one go. Trading, Pirating, Distress calls, Even random events that affect the local markets or station access. The world is yours to toy with but you still need to pay attention to what is going on. You dont want to slam straight into a space station where there is a invasion going down. (Unless you are planning on clearing it up of course)The combat is different that in other space oriented games. As you are flying Capital grade ships you cant fly UP or DOWN. Sounds bad but hang on. Fact is you dont need to. With some work your ship becomes a flying fortress. With plasma !BROADSIDES! and enough turrets on it to wipe out a fleet.As for valuing defense and offence its your call. Personally i like being up close so i took some fast acting cannons for close quarters. More damage, less range. The game is FULL of tradeoffs when it comes to arnament. So you need to pick your method carefully. Personally i HIGHLY recommend this game to any game progression enthusiasts with a limited budget. The game is cheap, VERY long if you want to play all the way, and there are enough tactics and explosions around for a great experience. 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

												Mixed feelings about this one. As a mouse-and-keyboard PC gamer, the consolification of the interface and ship combat feels awful. The zoom is weird, the interface manipulation is weird, all the usual problems you'd expect on the interface of a console port.On the other hand, the game evokes strong memories of Freelancer and even Freespace (god those beam weapons are gorgeous). It remains to be seen if the latter can overpower the former for me, and it also remains to be seen whether the game's interface will ever be de-consolified for the proper PC interface. As it stands right now, I just can't overlook the way the game handles.			"

												First mission, with tutorials - controls: E/Q for engines up/down, W/S for speed boost/brake, A/D for turning left/right. So how do you change your pitch? You don't. That's right, this space sim is completely 2D. Everything is in the same plane - tars, planets, stations, ships. You can't even roll your ship. That's because combat is ""naval"" style - with broadsides! With the freedom of 3-dimensional space and with the technological possibilities of a spacefaring civilization, the best solution is to fire your guns from the sides of your ship, in the general direction of the enemy. Like sailships.Why didn't you make an actual sailship game? If you wanted alines, you could have made it in a fantasy setting, rather than Caribean, but your battle mechanics would make sense. Here, they just suck.Also, what good is my sensor system? I can scan other ships for cargo and battle strenght, but only after I'm so close that they actually attack. So scan that ship, see that it's too powerful, take a wide detour? Not happening. This is not a space simulation. Don't know what it is and don't want to know.			"

												Does not start on Mac OS Mavericks. Many people who do not want to upgrade to Mac OS ElCapitan for valid reasons have reported about this problem since early October 2015 and until now, 8 months later, this is not fixed. There are some hacks in some forums that helped some people but not all of them (including me). This is really bad service, as the problem seems to be quite simple to fix from the producers' side (make their launcher start in full screen without using the most fancy ElCapitan methods to do so). It is just about the launcher, not the game itself. This should be a simple task. However, without the launcher to set the game options, the game itself starts only in not-playable configuration. A catch-22 for the end user who has paid money for playing it. So, thumbs down from my side.			"

												This game is everything I had hoped Elite Dangerous would be. Structurally, both games are very similar: you hop round the galaxy trading, mining, exploring, bounty-hunting and doing various missions, all the while earning credits so you can upgrade your ship and equipment. The main difference being this game removes all the tedium that ED insists you go through repeatedly and infinitely. Elite's station docking was fun for an hour or two, but after the 1000th dock, you just wish they'd just remove it...Rebel Galaxy removes this and you just insta-dock! Elite's 5 minutes with absolutely NOTHING to do while you warp to another station was never fun, and RG condenses this to a 10-30 second jump where you actually have some dodging and janking to do. Design decisions like this might make RG a more casual game than ED, but for me it also makes it 1000% more playable.This brings us to the combat. Purists will frown on Rebel Galaxy for it's 2-D implementation of space versus Elite's glorious 3D, but at the end of the day the combat is arcadey in both games, and RG's combat simply manages to be much more FUN. And certainly more epic. 30+ ship battles while you blast fighters with your short range turrets, broadside their capital ships and unleash homing missiles at everything else are far more epic than anyting Elite managed to throw my way.So my final description is that Rebel Galaxy is Elite with all the tedium removed, an actual story added, way better missions, and with considerably more fun combat. Which is what I've wanted in a space game since I racked up hundreds of hours of the original Elite on my Spectrum sometime back in the 1980s.TLDR: 8/10* this game is everything Elite Dangerous should have been* I would give this game 9/10 but for one annoying feature....you cannot view the local station map while docked. This means that you cannot easily plan the best cargo to buy or the best missions to take because you cannot see the optimum routes around the sector without seeing that local map. It's a quality of life thing that proves more frustrating than it might sound. If they fix that, this is a solid 9/10.			"

Purists will frown on Rebel Galaxy for it's 2-D implementation of space versus Elite's glorious 3D, but at the end of the day the combat is arcadey in both games, and RG's combat simply manages to be much more FUN. And certainly more epic. 30+ ship battles while you blast fighters with your short range turrets, broadside their capital ships and unleash homing missiles at everything else are far more epic than anyting Elite managed to throw my way.So my final description is that Rebel Galaxy is Elite with all the tedium removed, an actual story added, way better missions, and with considerably more fun combat. Which is what I've wanted in a space game since I racked up hundreds of hours of the original Elite on my Spectrum sometime back in the 1980s.TLDR: 8/10* this game is everything Elite Dangerous should have been* I would give this game 9/10 but for one annoying feature....you cannot view the local station map while docked. This means that you cannot easily plan the best cargo to buy or the best missions to take because you cannot see the optimum routes around the sector without seeing that local map. It's a quality of life thing that proves more frustrating than it might sound. If they fix that, this is a solid 9/10.			"

												Never asked for a refund before, and I usually avoid giving bad reviews.The game itself is not bad, I've played for one hour and realized the rpg potencial on it...But I couldn't stand the ships controls and navigation.It hurts my head to fly through space and not being able to move vertically or do a barrel roll.Worse, having your enemies flying around you, why the hell I can't do that?I understand the idea of the ship working like a vessel, maybe if the game was set up in a weird steampunk ocean world or something it would be amazing.But it's space, it should feel free and limitless. It feels clunky and awkward instead.General interface for that map is weird too, the radar, locking on targets, dodging asteroids...If you don't mind these problems, give it a go.			"

												This is a game that starts out incredible and quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The more I played it the less I enjoyed it. I was immediately pulled in with a fantastic soundtrack and interesting gameplay. However I realized very rapidly that the bit I got at the start was basically all there was. There's retrieval, protection, and shipping and those are your main mission types. You can mine for some ore to trade and you can buy low and sell high based on random events in the system you're in. It very quickly feels hollow because who cares if planet z is having problems so they need more of y item that you can buy elsewhere. None of it matters at the end, the issues resolve regardless of what you do. The main quest seems interesting enough but the quests are the same ""blow up the bads retrieve mystic object"" nonsense that the side quests are.Overall an interesting idea but not deep enough.			"

												Although I can't recommend this game, I did not hate it. It was all right and the price is fair. The main problem in my opinion is that every combat situation is basically the same. While the combat is OK it gets old really soon.The main story is hardly the centerpiece, as everything else in this game it's (just) OK. The last mission was quite dissapointing, as a matter of fact I didn't even realize I was in the last stand off against the main baddies until it was over.Even though finished the main story I only visited 1/3 of all solar systems, partially bacause the story didn't take me there and parrtially because there was no reason to go there. In fact all systems are basically the same (the third I saw). The second biggest problem after the staleness of combat is that the ship design isn't varried enough. There is little reason to buy the smaller faster ships. You basically buy the biggest ""mobile weapons platform"" smack a bunch of guns on it, park it in the middle of an eneny fleet and light them up.Buying defensive upgrades soon is the best investment, esspecially an early mk5 shield and plating. Unfortunatelly it makes the combat even more drab, because you bassically cannot die (for most of the game).			"

												2d space combat?  What a joke... 3 dimensions are always better than 2.  Graphics are pretty iffy... controls are even worse.  Combat is slow and painful.  And to top it all off you spend alot of time just fly around. Game balance is all kinds of bad...  I have an ammo limit, but the enemy has unlimited missiles, ya that's real fair... it takes so long to kill larger ships that they can easily throw 30-50x more missiles at you then u can at them all because of a stupid ammo limit...  I'm not sure what's the point in having shields, they get torn to  shreds within seconds of jumping in, but the enemie's hold firm, and if I hear the ship ai say force shields down one more time...  And to top it all off the most effective weapons in the game are the turrets that auto fire for you making any agency you bring to the game as a human player mute!!!The music is great, and it's like 80% of the reason i got this game, it was all fire fly esq, but the game play and it's mechanics are just so bad... This game reminds me of all the time i wasted grinding away at eve online, it's just a plain waste of time to play this game.			"

												I\'m only posting this review because this game is on sale. So far, I love this game and intened to pour hours into it. It\'s my favorite space game I\'ve found yet. It\'s just fun to play. The combat is challenging, yet interesting, The soundtrack is great, but I wish they had added more songs with more variety. Sometimes I feel like I\'m on a five song loop. Still, a great game and more than worth the sale price. I would even recommend it for regular price. That\'s what I paid, and even though it went on sale a few days later I still feel I got plenty of game for the amount. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy if you buy.			"

												--Additional update---I just finished the main storyline. What a fantastic game!!! It's been a long time since I have played a game that hits that special spot of enjoyment that makes me just want to keep playing. I love this game...--UDATE--Having finally made it to the second system, I can say that I am absolutely pleased with this game. The next sector has bigger and better ships, weapons, and modules to fit with. I also went into the third sector and saw that the ships get even larger, with even better gear. Unfortunately, I was totally unprepared for how much herder that new system was, so I had to go back.Man! This game is awesome!I haven't played it for a very long time, but what I have played, I certainly like. The ships all feel different, the progression feels substantial, and getting new weapons and systems for each ship makes everything feel a lot more visceral. One of my favourite things about the game is that you can fit up your ship with some new gear and truly feel a difference in power, making you feel like a real space bad@ss. Certainly worth the asking price, in my books.			"

												The game starts out as a kind of Southern Rock response to Firefly - which sounds awesome! If you like space sims with a variety of play options, you may enjoy this. I gave it a thumbs down for two reasons.First, everything is a grind. Getting a ship strong enough to compete and survive beyond the first sector costs millions of credits. You'll spend hours of gameplay chasing bigger ships, which do not seem to significantly change or develop play. Missions, trading, mining, piracy, pirate hunting... it's all the same thing over and over again. The story is alright, but not good enough to warrant a game that is all grind.The main reason I gave it a thumbs down is that there's a line in one of the main songs that loops over and over again that is EXTREMELY sexist (talking about a woman who is a ""sleaze"" and not worth a man's time). It's really gross that they decided to include something like that in an otherwise ok space sim.			"

												4/10Seriously, just get a Scarab, keep your turrets maxed out, and outmaneuver or out gun every ship in the game. It's just as combat effective as bigger ships, and much cheaper, since you don't pay a mint to replace 10 turrets whose coverage doesnt even let them fire.Pro:ShinyQuite controllable with mouse and keyboard once you get used to itVery SimpleCon:..Excessively simpleNo replayability due to every 'randomly generated' system being the same, with the same 7 factions, ships, stationsShort campaign with no feeling of resolution or urgency due to functioning as normal combat missions, only with voiceovers.Vastly underdelivers due to excessive positive reviews here.I'd say buy this game if you really want a playable space game, but frankly, you're going to get 6 hours in and say, ""Is this IT?!"" like I did. Maybe less.			"

												This is a wonderful open-world space game with a lot to offer, but my hours are low and I'm giving it a thumbs-down because I just can't get past the horrid UI.The UI for this game is very obviously designed for consoles and not for PC, but even after plugging in a controller and trying it that way, I found myself getting frustrated.  Some things that I don't like, roughly in order of most irritating:Waiting for information to cycle.  When looking at commodities, whether on the commodities screen or on the map, instead of having a scrollable list, pages/lines will cycle every 4 seconds or so.  This creates a) a lot of waiting and b) you can't stop the cycle when your item comes up and actually read it.All scrolling lists and menus move one item at a time.  You can still select something with the mouse if it's on the screen, though, assuming you can see it or figure out what it is while it's grayed out.No way to display the sector map while docked.No way to create multiple waypoints, meaning you can't plan out routes that navigate around hostiles or asteroid belts.No way to zoom your camera in/out, resulting in a lot of screen space always being occupied by your (albeit gorgeous) ship.No speed indicator on the HUD, for you or your targets.If the UI gets fixed, I'll likely dump countless hours into this game and come back and rewrite my review, but until then, I can only say that it feels like a really clunky console port.

 Interested in No Man's Sky? Dissapointed in No Man's Sky? Just get Rebel Galaxy.  It has pretty much everything that that game has, but it also has a lot more. Here's a list of features: More world types (Sand, gas, etc... Can't land on 'em though) Large battlesA jobs boardShip renaming, Distress signals, Mercenaries, Bigger ships, Exploration bonuses Unique factions Faction affiliation, Randomly generated worlds You can be a trader, mercenary, pirate, soldier, miner, etc... You can actually negotiate your way out of battles! Space looks lovely, and the lighting and sound design is epic. Battles are absolute chaos, but awesome.  And all this paired with some great music! Whilst it is singleplayer, and is on a 2D plane (with 3D models, think Assassins Creed Black Flag Ships), it is much better than this game. You can travel across multiple star systems (not a whole galaxies, sadly), and each planet is randomly generated. Each planet has their own specialities (Mining, war-like, trading, prison planet(!), etc... Some are gas planets, some are barren, etc...You can't land on them, but that is pretty much my only gripe with this game. I bought this before I heard of No Man's Sky, so I was not dissapointed. But the game is still pretty as f###Raiding a trade ship can actually ruin the prices of a planet's economy, which you can then exploit. Selling munitions at a planet that is at war can get you more profit. There are multiple factions. Pirates, civilians, the militia, the mafia/crime bosses, or just be a merc! Small note to Angry Joe: You can scan any ship you want, see their race, freight, ship name, etc... ;) Also, it's 20 F###### DOLLARS.﻿  "

												Excellent potential, but the save system is hands down the worst implementation of saves i have experienced.  Without the ability to manually save the game, if you make a single mistake and getting into deep trouble and the system auto-saves you in that state, your game is ruined and you have to restart.  I played for nearly two hours and lost everything because a red marauder team caught me and I couldn't escape.  A no win scenario that effectively destroys your save game isn't a 'challenge', its a game killer.  I refuse to devote more time to a game that doesn't give you the ability to protect your progress with a manual save option.  Until then, this is a game wiating to frustrate you to the point you uninstall it.			"

												I understood this game wouldn't have the real kind of depth I was looking for, but felt it would be good enough as a simple time killer.  I like the 2D plane naval style battles.  What I don't like is not owning multiple ships with different setups.  Mining is really more complicated than it should be for this type of game.  If my mining laser is on the bottom of the ship, good luck hitting an asteroid above your ship.  Scanning for asteroids gives no information of what you are mining for and as far as I can tell there is no item that does.  Certain weapons seemingly fire through your ship even though vision is blocked.  Really it's not a terrible game, but it's not a particularly good one.  Galaxy On Fire has more depth than this game.  The combat is good and interesting, the story is good and even the voice acting is good.  Graphics are fine.  Some small details were missed and the game was dumbed down more than it needed to be.  If you are looking for something really simple, then this game is for you.  It's on Galaxy On Fire's level.  If you are the type who likes the X Series or was into Eve Online and you were looking for something kind of in between in the single player realm, you will be slightly disappointed.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  Reading other reviews and watching videos reminded me of Escape Velocity: Nova, a great Ambrosia game from oh so long ago.  I thought that this game could capture the same magica that game possesed but with the updated flare of almost 20 years of gaming advances.Unfortunatly, I was wrong.Combat in Rebel Galaxy feels dry, leaving you endlessly flying in circles trying to keep fighters on screen.  Capital ship combat, while entertaining for the first 20 minutes, comes down to trying to land as many broadsides as possible which, once again, leads to flying in circles.The 2-d movement that was great in a top down space trading game like Escape Velocity is restrictive and unnatural.  At no point could I suspend my disbelief and imagine that I was piloting a space ship.  Any sense of immersion is ruined by this element.With all that said the game isn't bad looking and the price is pretty low.  That might be enough to make this game an enjoy able experience for some but it didn't make it worth it for me.			"

												(Review based on preview copy provided by developers)Rebel Galaxy is a Space Opera with some pretty legendary names behind its creation, and it definitely shows. There's no question that it's worth the asking price of $20 USD - though it does have its pros and cons worth considering if it's the perfect fit for you, as well as some gameplay aspects some people will enjoy more than others.----Important Notes:- This game involves trading, mining, and most of all - combat. - Combat is based on Naval combat, not standard 6-degree space combat, you will be using broadside cannons, ramming, and turrets for your capital ship on a horizontal plane (non capital ships use the full 6 degrees of freedom, but you don't get to fly those :P). This leads to interesting, yet still very satisfying, combat.- You have access to a lot of control with your ship, a lot of choices, including what tools you employ and how your weapons behave in battle - and they definitely have an impact on how you play.-You also have the ability to toy with alliances and factions, to change the system (improving/destroying your relations with different factions changes how you play the game)- Combat, either through Bounties, Missions, or Random Encounters will be your fastest way to gather resources and progress - though Trading/Mining are definitely still somewhat viable options.----Pros:- Good visuals, with satisfying explosions, weapon fire, etc. And visible damage on your ship.- Amazing audio assets (and the ability to customize the audio if you want). Voice Acting is ""good"", not stellar, but the explosions, music, etc. are insanely well chosen.- Combat caters to both the casual captain and the aggressive player ( you can hang out on the fringe of battles, letting the automated turrets do the work, or you can dive in ramming/blasting with your broadsides, while ducking and dodging through swarms of bullets)- Solid story, while it won't win any awards, it's on par with Blizzard storylines ( ""Okay"" campaign story, Great universe )- Lots of freedom of choice... and travel. Aided by procedural generation of the sectors - so no 2 playthroughs are the same.- Fairly well optimized (sad that I have to note this, but compared to a lot of other games with similar visual fidelity lately - this one barely taxes my system at max settings)----Cons:- Can get repetative after a while (go to point a, Kill stuff, get money, repeat) - but this tends to happen after the 10-20 hour mark for me. It does follow a formula similar to Diablo/Torchlight/etc. in that regard. - Can be slow paced at times, especially when a mission spawns more than 5000-6000 sm away, there is no fast travel within a sector, and while warp is fine for medium length trips, you will sometimes run into the issue of ""staring at the back of your ship twiddling your thumbs"". - ""Out of Game"" options menu... each time you launch you have the choice of changing the options, but you can't really change them in-game - so you might be restarting a few times to find the settings perfect for you.----Works well with a controller or mouse & keyboard, despite their recommendations.

												[HUGE VALUE - Buy This Game!] To relate this to another game - It's like that new Mad Max game [Sandbox Game with Huge Amounts of Sidemissions along with a Story to Push the Game Forward] - but in space and with naval combat. Your ship has turrets - one on the port side which you typically wanna aim with and the rest automatically shoot at what you want them to shoot at. The game is way big and you'll find yourself grinding missions and being immersed in the experience. Devs have worked really hard at making this the best game it can possibly be.

												The game balance is all kinds of drunk. The side missions, of which you'll do a whole load, have Risk estimates next to them. These estimates are entirely useless. You can get face melted in a Normal, and never even notice your shields getting touched in a Very High. The power boost between gear levels is also really large, more than 50% boost usually. This means you're going to get melted often when heading into a new area whilst you try to scrape together the money to make your ship competitive. This power difference pretty much kills the immersion as well. Why are two systems, right next door to each other, at such differences in weapon tech? Why doesn't a single ship from the high area go to the low area and just take over? They'd be completely untouchable?			"

												I was hoping for Mount and Blade meets Firefly. What I got was neither. This game has so much potential, but is hugley hurt by a number of things.(If you're wondering why my play time is so low its because I plan to get a refund and because the glaring problems are obvious from the start.)Firstly the thing I noticed first that bugged me was that, you ARE LOCKED TO A SINGLE PLANE OF MOVEMENT!(sounds small but it is SO annoying) Now if this were top down, this wouldnt be a problem, but the view is thrid person, making it painfully obvious how limited you are. What makes it worse is that other ships (including those you fight) can fly freely, making combat confusing and disorienting.Second, the graphics, nice enough at first (tough not at all cutting edge) but the problem there isn't poorly done graphics, it's OVERDONE graphics, I am being entirley honest when I say that the lens flare/ lighting effects during (one dimensional)'flight' actually HURT to look at.And finally, parts of it just feel....off. Little things, like a cramped UI in stations with loads of wasted space, or dialogues with characters (which are admittedley quite nicley done) feeling far too zoomed in and with no ability to use the keyboard for dialouge choices (up, down, enter or even 1,2 and 3).It's a nice idea that wasn't done badly, but its just not quite 'right' to play. I cant honestley recommend it.			"

												Space exploration game. It's like a super dumbed down Elite: Dangerous, which would be amazing EXCEPT combat is impossibly frustrating. Why? The whole combat system is based on side cannons, like a pirate ship in space. Only thing is, you cant move in a 3D space. Not so bad, except for your enemies can. Still not the worst, seems like it's ok, until you realize you can't aim your side cannons up or down. So the whole time, if you have unguided cannons, you're missing. You get 3 hits on a guy, deplete their shields, and then they fly below you. You can't aim at them, your turrets miss majority of the time, and by the time you can hit them again their shields are refilled. Awful combat system, making the game so frustrating that large fights become impossible.			"

												While it might win you over with a Firefly-esque vibe, Rebel Galaxy is a lot rougher than one would think. Customizing your ship and engaging in space combat sounds cool at first, but it is shallow and unintuitive. The non existent story and lacking presentation doesn't help matters either. Rebel Galaxy could have been so much more, but instead it settles for mediocrity.			"

												i would recommend the game but it just so happens that for some unexplainable reason the game started lagging on even the lowest settings. it used to around 60 fps on highest setting so i tried uninstalling whitch did not solve the problem. so because of the around 10 fps the game runs right now around half a year after purchase, it renders the game unplayable.

												I wanted to like this, but the combat is just too ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you are dragged into a fight, you can't flee, and you can barely do any damage. The only way i can get in damage is if im right next to it and just spamming broadsides. The groups they fly in are just too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpowered. There are tons of fighters attacking you in this group and you can't kill any of them. This actually sucks to me because you are just a sitting duck that is poking the enemy.			"

												I quit the game right before being destroyed, just to save a few seconds and avoid the respawn at last checkpoint. But it autosaved there.So now my save game only goes to a place where I get blown up, and can't escape.I think it's telling of my feelings about the game that I kinda decided, ""oh, well, I guess that's the last time I play this game."" and shrugged my shoulders.I was 37 hours into that game. I'm sure when I was younger I would have burned down the developers. But really, my apathy towards never being able to play that game again probably is as harsh a burn as I'm capable of delivering at this point.The first dozen or so times you do each mission are fun. Then it's just endless grinding. I'm not going to ever play this game again, because I'd have to start a new game, which would be a ton of grinding to get to where I was, which was a part of the game that involved grinding. I think the price is fair, but I can't say that it's actually worth all the time required to beat it. If you play it for a dozen or more hours and have a good time, just stop when you don't like it any more. It will not change or get better.			"

												Just a few minutes into the game and i'm telling ya, its so worth it.I love almost everything about this game. The soundtrack is dope, the voice acting is fitting, the controls are good enough. Though nothing beats the combat style in this game. Classic naval style combat! First hostile ship i ran into felt a few volleys of my broadsides and he legged it, though not before letting his puny shields and deflectors soak some of it up. And i was like, ""Wow, really?"" as i finished him with a few scatter laser shots. Heh, good times.Makes me wonder how 2 blokes managed to come up with something like this. It would take a helluva lot of effort to come up with this, even for the big time developer companies. Its quite astonishing that they managed it, enough to make me feel like i should pay for the full price of this game.So far, i haven't found anything bad about this game. So as for now, i'll give it a 10/10.Also, get the soundtrack once it comes out, if you want. Just think of it as a gesture of gratitude for the developers.			"

												Awful, brutally hard, no help, long winded and boring space on a single axis. I've tried preparing a weapons stack for each mission, enemy makes it up. I've tried just mining for ore to make money to upgrade, I get shot up by fighters every time I try to return to a base. Camera controls are so bad. You have no idea what's happening as barrage after barrage is landing on you. Everytime you die you lose everything, NO ♥♥♥♥ING SAVESThe soundtrack is fantastic, but that's the only good thing about it. Utterly hate this game.  "

You can choose to do the story line or some of it (which i recommend) or you can go be the space trucker you always wanted to be! You can explore the whole map and do all the side quests before doing the story. But the music does get a bit repetitive.			"

The deal breaker for me is the absolute CRAP control scheme .HOW do you make a space game like this ........and put it on a FLAT plane .NO 360 freedom of space movement . It feels like you are sliding a toy car on a glass table . That and the wanna be Assassins Creed Black flag naval action that does not translate well IN SPACE.Maybe you will like it if what I mentioned does not bother you .

												I've logged 34 hours into the game as of writing this review.The game has been nothing short of an exceptional experience. From the very moment you start the game, you get a good sense of what you're getting into. The music sets the tone to this sort of grungy, rockabilly space Western. It's full of character has a good sense of ""space"". All this despite playing like a sort of ""World of Warships meets Elite: Dangerous"" hybrid between space exploration and naval combat. I highly recommend buying this game.Pros:Full controller support (including optional Playstation layout).Tight Mouse&Keyboard controls.Very pretty graphics and effects.Visible modular ship damage.Many graphics settings in the launcher.Superb soundtrack.Optional custom soundtrack to replace OR supplement the original soundtrack.Fluid combat mechanics.More lasers than I sometimes know what to do with.Unique and lively NPC interactions.Moderate learning curve.VERY attentive and responsive developers constantly patching reported issues.Cons:Enemy dialogue is sometimes repetitive.No vertical travel (2D movement only).Objects (like Cargo) sometimes block docking or other actions.Slaves (Cargo) have no clear way to be saved other than forfeiting to Militia (-4 rep penalty).Single-player only (for now).

												Game is fun, but limited. This game is Sid Meier's Pirates LITE. You have no major interaction with any factions, and can not partake in major game map changing ways. It's essentially the combat of Sid Meier's in Space, with nothing close to SMP's metagame. It's the very definition of shallow. Everything will one way or another end up with a blaster in your face. You want to trade or mine? Good luck. You'll be needing a good turret.Ultimately I don't recommend this game despite the fact that I know a lot of people may enjoy it. I respect it's sea-naval intentions, but I just am TOO much of a fan of proper scifi stuff and not arcade based games to enjoy this.My ideal Scifi games are along the lines of Nexus, and Homeworld. I find this to be very simplistic, to it's own detriment because it gets CLUSMY quickly with combat. It's not hard to stay oriented, but it is HARDER than it should be. Camera + controls (really, gamepad optimal, who are you kidding) + enemies + lack of distinct options controlling your own weapons makes this game a hassle. Added on top of it, that it's a big ol'grind fest in a single player game, and you lose my interest quickly.That said, there aren't a lot of good scifi options these days, so a lot of people will find the 20$ entry fee to be acceptable for the amount of entertainment within.

												Save your money..... worst of the space sim group.PROSCool music and easy to navigate, ship upgrade path straight forward. Overall game had promise, until...CONSTERRIBLE combat broadside junk aiming mechanic, ruins the game play. It takes literally forever to hit anything with the lazy aiming system. Hold right mouse until you get a yellow path to aim, left to fire.  Misses everytime or does little damage. I really can't say enough bad things about how poorly thought out this part of the game is. Funny, that most of the game is about combat interactions and this part failed so badly. It's a shame because otherwise it seemed unique, but is unplayable due to this frustrating design idea. Sailing ships in space, no thanks!Overall a waste of $20The solid reviews must be rigged from devs. Too bad Steam doesn't give refunds on this trash indie stuff. Fix your broken core mechanic and allow weapons to hit something and maybe the game could work.Starpoint Gemini 2 is 1000x times more playable.			"

												The game is pretty fun but lacks much content to be a $17.99 game. There needs to be more complexity with ships, turrets, etc. Large annoyances include being pulled out of warp when coming into contact with unavoidable things like asteroids. I havnt put much time into the game but from first impressions these are my thoughts. I think the game should have been released as an alpha game due to the lack of content. What is put together now is bug free but there isnt much here. One example is that in all 6 hours i played I saw maybe 3 unique avatar/voices of enemy ships. There are a total of 3 turrets for broadside, 6 if you include the 2nd tier which is the exact same just more speed and damage. Id be happy to pay 17.99 for a game with alot of content but this seems like a sub $10 game in its current form.			"

												I should have trusted the reviews that stated the combat in this game was horrible, as it is.  I love the music, the idea of reliving Privateer, etc.  However, the game is nothing more than go from point A to point B and back and fighting as if you are in a ocean vessel in the 1800s.  It seems the developers are much like human race from centuries ago in that they think the world (in this case space) is flat.Let me download the music as a soundtrack and at least the money would have been worth while.  Short of that, this was a lesson in reading and believing reviews.			"

												Do you like to get ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥and pay for it? well you will love this. It promised us an open world with a large amount of missions and an awesome soundtrack what we got is a lazy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥which sends you from one place to another to shoot some stuff and get some points. Your flying is rather more driving since you cannot fly up or down. The hole map is flat with nothing exiting and if your as unlucky as i am you will probally never get a refund. if the soundtrack alone is enough for you to buy it you got ♥♥♥♥ing tricked or your ♥♥♥♥ing dumb because the ""soundtrack"" is the same ♥♥♥♥ing song over and over again till you would rather pay some one to shoot you then playing a moment more of this piece of gaming♥♥♥♥♥♥ If there is one reason i would kill myself it is so i could forget this forever. 5/7 would ♥♥♥♥ing burn if i had the physical copy.

												This game starts with a fantastic promise: Getting something between Wing Comander Privateer and X³. The first impression is great, the graphics are impressive, the cut scenes / chats with characters appropriate. Only the fact that a Flight Stick is not supported seems to be a little bit sad.Then you start to manouver your ship for the first time you realize there is something broken. Checking the Settings turns out: This game is a 2 dimensional space shoter.The idea of space is to have 3 dimensions but here there is only a third dimension for the blow-flies. What distroys any immersion from this point on is, that there is no reasonable explanation for this 2D-space-fake. Why?			"

												Not a bad game, but not all that fun.The controls are just okay, if a bit messy. M&KB works but feel lacking. I honestly don't feel in control of my ship a lot of the time. The music is pretty annoying. And for me, being restricted to a 2d plane, sucked all of the fun out of it.All said and done, its similar to Starport Gemini 2, which I think is better to the point where it was hard to justify having them both.

												OS X review below:--Game is nice, especially soundtrack – sets the mood perfectly and is very pleasant to listen to.There is however a major problem on OS X – XBox controller is not supported. Game controls and menus are clearly optimized for gamepads, but mouse look is laggy and has too much inertia. Lining up broadsided are a pain (inertia is OK with analog sticks, with mouse it is annoying as hell), turret control is just horrible (see above).FOV could be wider (or adjustable) – your ship taking 1/4 of screen at all times is very annoying, especially on ultrawide screens. And it's not pretty on big screen, textures are console-quality and look muddy.P.S. Regarding gameplay – warp! It is boooooring. You undock, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. You fight, you win, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. Rinse, repeat.I won't recommend this game to Mac users – game is designed for gamepad, gamepad is not supported.			"

												Disappointing to say the least, basically its similar to Eve but without any p2p or pvp. Very vanilla economy. Super generic quests, you can literally have multiple instances of the same quest. You can go ratting. You can go mining. Would not recommend going trading. Single pane (no up/ down) essentially no 3d movement in a space game??? Why???  Pretty I'll give it that. Broadsides are nice but its gimmicky. Sound track is good but it is a short soundtrack. So after the first hour or less you will hear the same songs again and again and again. Pointless. Targeting sucks. to interact with anything you have to get pretty darn close which is just dumb. Travel between quests takes too long, you can upgrade your travel speed but it’s still pretty darn slow.  I want to like it but meh boring...			"

												This game evolves from games like Star Flight, Star Fleet and Freelancer with the interface and game play being most like Freelancer(almost a re-write).  I liked Freelancer and must've played through 3 or 4 times.   The graphics and UI from this game most resemble Freelancer.For me the whole broadside pirate style of battling is confusing enough that this game likely has not much time left on my hard drive.  No story line to speak of, no character developement, same 4 options to get a mission on each planet/station/location.  I can live with everything except the battle perspective issue, it would've been much better to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥pit view of battle like other flying games.  It would also be nice of while flying around you could choose between first and third person views.  Also annoying game play plot issues like can't pick up debris cargo withpout a tractor beam but you have to run earand missions to earn enough to get one, should be part of the base ship configuration, same with weapons, start with nothing being the target for every bandit who wants to shoot you down.Had I played a demo of this game I would not have purchased.  I wish I had gotten the new Defender instead of this game.			"

Because in the distant future weapons are so incredible advanced that they absolutely can NOT be mounted on the front. And that's so much fun I immediately requested a refund.What the hell guys, as if anybody would ever complain about having some action and fun in a game. Just what happened to the whole Descent / Freespace / Forsaken genre? Nowadays we have such great graphics, the technology, the processor power, so many potential and possibilities, and developers decide to throw everything over board and make something like THIS?Wow.

What it does and how it does it,  it does very well,  but it just doesn't push any particular aspect far enough.  Further, while I found the soundtrack nice at first, it wears very quickly. It really doesn't sound like a space sim or futuristic at all and I struggle to understand why they chose the musicians to begin with when it doesn't gel with the rest of the game.

But there are two audio issues the kept me from being able to enjoy the game:1) There is a constant popping sound coming from the game. It stopped in menus, but was otherwise constant.2) The music is AWFUL. It is painful to listen to. If done subtly, it could have given the game a Firefly, space western vibe. Instead, it's akin to being agressively poked in the ear by a Alan Jackson wannabe's demo tape.			"

It feels like someone had an interesting idea for a game and perhaps pulled together a working prototype of a concept and then proceeded to paste minimal elements of a game around it. Menus, models, story... all seriously lacking.The space physics don't feel good at all. You can bounce your ship into things and well.... and nothing, it just bounces off. I don't mind that it is on a 2D plane but the models for ships, asteroids, space stations... all look like they were made 10 years ago.And the story is awful. really really awful. Again, it feels like the bare minimal to move the player forward into... something. I would like to say these feels like beta but that would be too generous. This feels like a early access alpha build. shame.			"

												Disliked that there is no manual or much of a tutorial in the game so good luck with all the controls.  I learned in the forums after a kind soul let me know that there are videos/links to videos in the game if you press esc/start button and look for them in the menus there.   Never would have thought that the equivalent of the manual? i guess would be in the menu.Most of everyone else was busy saying the equivalent of 'man up', so not the greatest community if you are looking for any kind of help.The game might be fun but you will have to put up with non-intuitive controls until the developers improve them or actually give more information to the players.  So at this point the game seems more to be in EA state rather than released state.  I say EA because games in those states are the ones that I expect with no manual/minimal explanation of controls when control scheme is not intuitive.Also becareful since some of the reviews mention that it reminds them of other games space games like freelancer/(insert awesome space game) but they fail to mention that the game movement/combat is in 2D like Starpoint Gemini.So TLDR; Gamble: might be good but be warned that controls aren't the best and community not the most helpful.  This game is more like an enhanced Starpoint Gemini.Edit:The review mentions community as since the 'tutorial' to basic keys is lacking then it means that the users have to rely on 'community'. On the plus side though the developers seem to be good though so there is a future.CONS:- Controls not all intuitive- Tutorial, according to other players you have to play > 15mins before you actually get to it.- Aweful community (don't expect help from 90% of it and have a thick hide when asking).- Universe is 2D like Starpoint Gemini (some people like this so if you are ok with it then you good).PRO:- Devs seem to nice and involved so a few weeks or months the game might become much better.- Possible gem in the future, so maybe hold out until later.

												I almost didn't buy this because I read that space was 2D.  That turned out to be the best feature.  It makes the combat ridiculouly fun.  The music got me looking into the credits to find the groups.  The only problem I have is that you can run through the story line and max out on technology very quickly.  Still, GREAT game.  A+ for music, A- for gameplay, B for story line, C for the rather limited sandbox universe.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is pretty addicting but is painfully short.  My first, and likely only, run through was brief.  You don't need to max out your ship and equipment to beat the game.  It's nice that anything you buy you sell for the exact same amount.  This really means you can try out everything without consquence.  But because of that there is no real need to play through more than once.I had considered going again just to try out being a pirate but the main story just wasn't interesting enough.  The side missions are a grind for money and they aren't that fun.  You either can win a fight or there is no way to win it  till you get a better ship or equipment.The economy is pretty easy to figure out and that can allow for you to earn money way to fast for the game to be a challenge.  I'm glad I played it but I'd be pretty mad if I had paid more than $10, which I didn't.Wait for a sale.			"

												This game was a blast.  I loved every minute of playing it and the music is great.  I actually only originally got interested in this game from catching a video on youtube and hearing the music.  I only wish they would put out some DLC or a sequel.  Fun game, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.			"

												This game tries hard to emulate Freelancer or Privateer, but sadly fails. 1. The look and feelLooks ok, especially considering this is an indie title. Especially the spaceships have a cool touch to them.2. ControlsInstead of freelancer or even EVE controls, they decided to do some strange console like UI navigation & flight controls on a 2D plane orientation (in space?!?). They felt clunky and unintuitive to me.3. Combat and space gameplayThis is in my oppinion the biggest issue - the broadside combat might be a good idea in theory, but not how it is applied here - since the ships often behave more like fighter craft than behemoth ships shooting broadsides at each other, it is highly annoying to control. And most of it is strangely semi automated with snapping auto aims etc. - I get the feeling this was ""consoled"" down.Why not just do something classic like freespace or freelancer? Free movement and skill aiming in a full 3D environment, not on a 2D plane with strange autoaim and clunky movement?4. Strange camera behaviorReally annoying was the camera, which would zoom in and zoom out during screen switchens (and interpreting this as a warp)5. Story I guess 15 years ago, it was quite ok to receive storyline quests from some shady guys in a spaceport bar.  Transfer it to today in a slighly better 3D look instead of pixel characters, and it no longer is so cool. Especially since the writing does not hook you. 6. Who put the afterburner on ""W"" and not on ""tab"" - seriously :)FacitSeeing all the positive feedback, there are defenitly pilots who will like this game, and it is probably not a bad game. From the previews I thought i would like it too. But after really playing it - it just doesn't feel right. Guess waiting for a reboot of freelancer then.			"

												The game play is fun. After awhile, I got used to the 2D/Broadsides combat, and it doesn't feel like I'm missing as much as I feel I should. But, it's not as fleshed out as it could be either. Otherwise, it's a great modern freeform space sim that lets you live the life of a spacer with a clear mission to work on in the meantime.The best thing for me, though, is the soundtrack. It's rare to find a game that completely nails it to the point that the soundtrack becomes so crucial to the game that without it, it starts to fall apart. I made the mistake of trying to customize the soundtrack... I thought I could mix my own flavor of dirty-guitar, bluesy rock, etc, and I should have just left it alone. When you hear friends talk about how great the soundtrack of Fallout 4 is and how well it helps define the game... that's the level of audio immersion in atmosphere that comes to mind here. Parallels to Firefly have been drawn a thousand-times over already, and the soundtrack is as responsible for that relationship as anything else. I rarely care about game music, and often turn it off, but here... I'll never listen to a space sim the same way again.			"

												It's a good game with lots of room for improvement. There is an option to play your own songs while on board as well! I feel that the random distress beacons should have been more rewarding. Variety is there but you need to grind alot to get the good stuffs. At war ports, you will see ALOT of enemy ships flying by while at peaceful ports you will only see a handful of militia ships. It doesn't make the game feel alive ya know? Would be better if you can see a large amount of active npc ships warping in/out and docking at port stations to simulate trading, life in space, etc. Right now it feels like space is full of corrupt officials, bandits and runaway aunties.

												The men who built Rebel Galaxy, Travis Baldree and Erich Schaefer, have a damn good record when it comes to making enjoyable games. Diablo, Fate, Torchlight; these guys seem to make games for gamers. With Rebel Galaxy they have proven to me that they just flat out understand how to make a good game. The sci-fi atmosphere is a mix between Star Wars and Serenity and the ship pilot gameplay fits in perfectly to the overall feel of the game. The story missions are interesting and voice-acted pretty damn well, though you can ignore them for the most part if you wish and start your own trouble within the local system until you're ready to get back to it.The ship buying and customization is implemented in a way that everything you do is working towards your next upgrade, so you do not feel like you are wasting time or money on anything. Your upgrades either transfer over to your new ship, or can be used as credit towards better weapons and ship parts, so your progress actually feels great the entire time. The trading and smuggling aspects of the game are well made and rewarding with a lot of care and attention put into them. The combat feels like a naval combat game and serves its purpose well. While primarily taking place on a 2D plane, the combat mechanics certainly takes advantage of the 3D environment with action and attacks happening all around you. The weapon variation is nice and even some of the basic weapons feel heavy-hitting, so I am sure that the badass factor on the later weapons will be awesome.If you're looking for a fun space sim with satisfying progression and rewarding mechanics, Rebel Galaxy will scratch that itch. For $20 it is definitely a steal.			"

Y U NO Y AXIS?!It does run quite nicely, the mechanics aren't all that hard to get used to, and it's kinda pretty...ish  While the game works well, I can't get beyond the 2 dimensional travel in space.

												This game is like a beautiful koi pond: Full of wonderful, graceful behemoths swimming beneath the surface, distracting from the  shallow, muddy bottom.Pros:-Fun Combat, lots of naval pew pew. The effects of having capital ship grade weapons blasting all over the place, dodging lasers, photon torpedos, and whatever; Pretty awesome. -Beautiful visuals: OooooOOOoooooh-Great Atmosphere: Everything felt great, I felt like a space cowboy the whole time for better or worse. -Plenty of quests with multiple factions.Cons:-The quests are inconsequential:They exist only to get mechanical advantages in bigger, badder ships. Which would be neat if the different factions gave  additional things to do but as they stand, it is a grinding quest for rep for a big ship which is comparable to the civilian models. -Shallow, uninspired story.-Illusion of character influence.-Only one reliable way of getting large amounts of cash with any speed.The Trading and Pirating actions are garbage. Even if you destroy every single ship you see, you'll only get something worthwhile once in every ten ships. Stations rarely have enough goods for a trader ship to make worthwhile runs for any reason.For the same amount of time, you can just get ""Destroy X"" or ""Protect Y"" quests to get four times the amount of money you'll make for even the most advantageous trade. From ANY station. The game is pretty and boring. Unless you played EV nova just to grind for hours to get the big ship and swing your massive dreadnought wang around, you're gonna have a bad time. I give it a 6/10, mostly for visuals and atmosphere. Being forced into a very specific playstyle due to the economics of the game is annoying and takes the tiller fully out of quality's gentle, warm hands, and into the dead fish limp fist of neutrality and disappointment.

												Rebel Galaxy is the space sim that many have been waiting for, allowing them to live out their Firefly fantasies out on the edge galaxies. In that regard it delivers much of what is expected of it having all the trimmings that is expected from a game in this genre. The combat is unique however it suffers from a few key problems which quickly turn the challenge into tedium. Its open world nature is likely to appeal to many however the lacklustre campaign left this reviewer wanting. All in all Rebel Galaxy is a solid game, one that’s sure to delight both Freelancer and Firefly fans alike, however it’s not a great game like the ones it seeks to imitate.Read my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/11/06/rebel-galaxy-firefly-and-freelancers-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-child/ "

												Just think Firefly + Cowboy Bebop = Rebel Galaxy.Didn't know what all to expect when watching the trailers, so I thought ""What the hell, I'll give it a shot.""  Then I gave it another...and another...and another, and before I was done, pirate fleets were torn asunder and floating lifeless in the cold, empty void of space.Overall:+ Put in close to 12 hours so far and still in the first system.  In many AAA-titles released these days (I'm looking at you CoD), the main part of campaigns can be completed in 5-20 hours, depending on how much content there is.  For a $20 game to beat out $60 games is a damn shame. It shows that bigger studios often care too much about profit, and not enough on a great experience like they used to.+ Sometimes takes on that addictive ""just one more mission"" quality+ Tight, responsive controls+ Again, for $20, the AI can be surprisingly good+ Like many have said, it's not a space sim, which, for me at least, was a good selling point.  No need for ultra-realism after seeing pretty pew-pew lasers and lots, and LOTS of explosions.+/- The soundtrack can be kind of a mixed bag.  It isn't terrible by any means, but after hearing the same 6-7 songs repeated over and over again in some sequences, I disabled the music in the settings and began listening to music downloaded from YouTube.  Yet if the developor can periodically update the game with new tracks, it'd be an added bonus. + Got to name my ship the Cowboy Bebop10/10 - See ya later space cowboy!			"

												Great game, especially for the money. Enough RPG elements with ship upgrades and lots of ships to choose from. First, there are some negatives: the late game doesn't offer much in the way of excitement, one you have the best gear, there isn't much that puts up a challenge anymore. It's fun to feel godlike when firing 20 broadside cannons and killing ships that used to give you trouble in a couple of shots. This wears out pretty quickly though and I find myself wishing they would throw more at me to match the level of my ship. Once the storyline is finished I don't feel there is a lot of replayability, there's no real ""other"" way to play the game except as maybe an outlaw, which will severely limit the number of stations you can visit and missions you can take. The positives, I think, far outweigh the negatives. As I said above there are plenty of fun customization options available to you and each battle needs to be approached with tactics in mind: lots of fighters?  Stay back and let your turrets work and fire some well-aimed broadsides. Big badass dreadnaughts? Take down their shields and get in close so you don't have to charge your cannons up and take them down fast. I haven't played a game with this much value for dollar in a long time, not being able to travel on the X axis isn't a bother as the game still feels big. Worth the $!			"

												It's good. Really, it is. It's not, however, amazing. The short: The storyline is... cursory, at best. The game would lose virtually nothing if it weren't there at all. There are some annoyances in missions and travelling, and you need to be comfortable with the need to grind for gear, but all in all it's a very enjoyable space shooter.The long:As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, there's an almost consistent misrepresentation of the mission risk. Low? It could be, then again you could also barely make it out with an inch of hull left. Other times you end up against a ship you literally do not have the damage output to even touch the shields on. High? It could be. It could also be a milk run. It just doesn't make any sense.You do learn to recognize them, though. Some mission types seem straight forward, but will always end with you having to deliver something to a station that's under siege. Skip those. Escort missions are a pain, as in pretty much all games, Fancy waiting 2-3 minutes while your ship lines itself up for the escort? Fancy doing that numerous times as the journey is interrupted along the way? How about inside an asteroid field, where your ship keeps getting stuck on rocks, adding another few minutes. At first, I learned this was a perfect time to go fetch something to drink. Or check email. Or read a page or two of a book. Later, I learned to just save my sanity and skip them. Eventually I did learn a set of mission types I could reliably predict the difficulty of, and I just stuck with those and ignored everything else.There's a fair amount of travelling required, which is to be expected. Space is big, after all. What isn't fine is how often your travels are interrupted. There are countless asteroid and junk fields littered about, and odds are you'll be pulled out of warp a handful of times on most journeys. Which means you then need to crawl along to the edge before you can get back up to speed. If you pay attention you can spot some of them and go around. Not going in a straight line from one place to the next, also seems to help. Then there are the random enemy encounters, which have the same effect of slowing you down. You can spend time fighting them (if they are ship types and numbers you can handle), for loot worth next to nothing most of the time, or turn your tail and boost out of there. In most cases that'll have you on your way again in 30 seconds or so.So why the heck am I recommending it? I guess I must really like spaceships. And lasers. I had great fun, despite the above mentioned drawbacks. Enough so that I put 40 hours into it. After finishing the story, I kept going until I had the best ship fully upgraded. I then went back in a few more times to just fly around enjoying being invincible. For entertainment value, it was a bargain for the price.			"

												This game is great fun!The graphics are really well done, without it being particularly strenuous on your system. The game play is sound, offering an augmented version of a space flight sim that primarily uses 'broad-siding' as its main form of combat. There is a fair amount of progression to be had in the game upgrading ships and weapons. Even when you get to the point of maxing out your character, you will still find it a challenge taking down the end game enemies. The soundtrack is also awesome!You can easily put between 30 to 40 hours in a single play through, and because of the faction reward system you will have a quite a different experience choosing an opposing path.The only negative I can think of is that is heavily optimised for a controller/gamepad. *sigh* You can try with a keyboard and mouse, but you will find the experience a little skittish!Overall, I can thoroughly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a semi-casual space adventure!

												This game was a huge surprise for me, and I only ended up getting it after watching a favorite streamer of mine play it for an hour or so. For me, this game is like the perfect marriage of complex space battle/trading games like Freelancer and old simple quest-based space games like Solar Winds. I was able to easily start playing this and get a grasp for how to survive and have a blast within a couple hours. I was originally turned off by the fact that you are pretty much on a 2D plane and it isn't full 3D navigation, but the game hides it well during battles and it really makes it a lot easier to figure out exactly what is going on in any situation without needing the added complexity of a 3rd dimension. It took me awhile to get used to the limited information provided by the HUD, but I definitely enjoy the fact that my screen isn't cluttered with useless information all the time. If you have bandwidth restrictions, this game is a surprisingly small download, and the soundtrack is fantastic and really makes you feel like a Space Cowboy. Two thumbs up!			"

												A game that plays kind of like Wing Commander Privateer with a naval battle twist can't be wrong, you get the Mercenaries guild, the merchands guild and who knows maybe some alien stuff.Very entertaining, sometimes a bit grindy but hey, getting expensive gear and ships is not cheap, the main quest is quite interesting to follow also and when the mercenaries guild chick calls you, just say yes!Battles are very interesting and you can get the most of your tactics if you choose your turret slots wisely. Also there can be many different battle tactics depending on the choice of weaponry you use, laser, projectile, mines, etc.Mining is a bit rudimentary but still it plays well, I usually don't go mining on purpose unless I found about a juicy spot.I have spent quite a few hours and I have many more ahead (just visited 4 systems).If you like space battles and if you liked Wing Commander Privateer, just buy it.

												Picked up this game while it was on sale, I probably wouldn't have bought it full price. I definitely would've missed out. This game is easily work 20 bucks, but if it's on sale definitely grab it. It kinda feels like if you mixed Firefly and Star Wars. The atmosphere and music screams Firefly, but the space battles definitely feel like Star Wars. I've only put 5 hours into at this point but I can easily see myself sinking over 40 with repeat playthroughs. The soundtrack is awesome but I do think it might get repetetive after a while, but the devs have it set up where you can play your own music through the game. Or you can play pandora in the background like everybody else. It's kind of a bummer that you can't fly up and down, only side to side. It's kind of good though, the devs did it to keep the learning curve for flight low so you can focus on shooting in battles. The actively changing trade markets at the different ports was a really nice touch. You can literally do almost whatever you want. Wanna be a space miner? Go for it. Wanna be a pirate and attack the innocent? Do it big. Wanna be boring and just play the story? Waste your money. The game isn't too hard to pick up and beat, but it's not a cakewalk either. You don't have your hand held in this game, if offers tips but doesn't stop you from running into high level pirates if you're not careful. That being said, it isn't too hard to earn money and upgrade your ship or buy a new one. Overall, I highly reccomend this game to anybody that's ever wanted to pilot their own space ship.			"

												I don't enjoy every space game.  EVE Online while amazing was just too much of a headache for me to enjoy.  My personal favorite back before most folks reading this were born was Sundog.  You had it all, mystery, space, little rpg, ship repair, space and planet exploration.  While Rebel Galaxy doesn't have some of those things it has the right feel.   It is fun and challanging.   Highly reccommend!			"

												I have no problem giving a thumbs up on this title.  A lot of people say it has a ""Firefly"" feel and they are right.  The soundtrack, universe and choices you make are what gives it that feel.  Will you stop for that distress call?  Or is that cargo too important for you to be a big damn hero.  The games story has been decent so far.  Combat feels like ""Star Trek Online"" where space is....flat.  Naval style broadside battles make you manage your sheilds as you try to stay on an enemies weak side.  Mercenaries are waiting to be hired at every space station for a price.  They'll fly with you until you dismiss them or faithfully until they die.  You can outfit your ship with a fair amount of upgrades or buy bigger ships.  Each ship has its own benefits depending on what you want to do.  Do you want to smuggle and run trade routes to make money between missions?  You'll want cargo space and speed?  You want to hunt down bounties?  Better go with weapon hardpoints and hull strength.  It's pretty open.  The game has an economy that is ever changing so goods might be cheap here but are selling higher on the otherside of the system giving you a chance to make a buck.    I've read people giving a thumbs down because it takes too long to travel from A to B on occasion.  All I can say to that is ""Flying through hyper-space ain't like dusting crops, boy...""  My only complaint is that the pirate dialog is pretty skimpy.  You hear the same ""well, well.  You most be lost..."" quote too many times. If you're a sci-fi junkie and want a space game that's not overly complex but still has substance then pick this up.  $20 you can't go wrong.  You'll get your $ worth.  You can be a leaf on the wind too!  Just watch how you fly...			"

												tl:dr: If you are looking for a simple, fun space game with loot etc in the vain of Freelancer this is the best choice at the moment. The 2D limitation of movement seems annoying at first but it actually simplifies navigation a lot and combat still feels dynamic enough. Voice acting makes the universe feel alive.The main framework of the game consists of typical space sim quests a la ""kill those guys"" ""bring that there"" ""protect this ship"" etc, nicely packed into flavour text and a fully voiced main Storyline which after 6 hours is fun enough to follow while not very original.While most space sims focus around dogfighting and smaller ships this one is all about capital ships and broadside combat. Different sections of the ship can be controlled manually while the remaining turrets fire automatically, mercenary wings can be hired to offer additional support.Aiming is secondary to navigation and tactical ship placement.The universe is made lively and colourful by voiced cutscenes and radio chatter. A nice amount of very nicely designed ships in various sizes is availableAll in all this is a great game for people who don't have enough time for Elite:Dangerous (or simply find ED to be too boring and monochromatic) but still want the Space Exploration experience.Also the soundtrack is very nice and the game makes adding custom music very easy.

												Rebel Galaxy is a great game that has plenty of good balance to it, though granted I had to remind myself it wasn’t Freelancer* with all its similarities. With the constant reminder that your piloting a 2 dimensional ship through 3 dimensional space that makes use of primary functions for broad fire tactic’s while combatting fighter vessels that can fly in any direction was easy to notice the uniqueness Rebel Galaxy Possess in standing out from the rest of the space games to hit the market. One thing that would keep me engaged as a Gamer is the really good work with the Music Que’s between combat and Station Menu navigation. Yes you still get the option to customize your own music to the game, but speaking as an Audio Editor, there was some really good work into allowing the music to que into the combat scene’s. The music is so good that I even had the pleasure to find the list posted by Travis Baldree on the dev’s website Sound Track List**. Granted I enjoy my gameplay and found myself wanting a bit more in the way of controls, but I constantly found the fact of the simplified combat and turret options in ship to ship combat well simplified. I partly wished I could have been able to explore the stations or board the ships that constantly threatened me to get sucked into space, so as only to just see that I could do it, but still we wouldn’t have had such a well-planned out 2 Dimensional controlled 3D Space Combat game. Pro’s:•	Short but worthwhile story•	Simplified Ship controls•	Great Music Selections•	Persistent Markets when selling commodities – even gives a history on the price of the item, and system average for the entire System you’re in.•	Great Map Design and navigation assistance though lacks a little in cross coordination with other implemented features of the game.Con’s:•	Not Exactly Merchant Friendly: Always a hassle trying to find a price for a single item between all known locations that buy and sell commodities of a certain type. Would have like an option that allowed seeing at a quick list of last known prices at all stations for a single commodity.•	Stellar Mass often times stopping warp while not even in the way of the travel.•	Not all ships are available, can’t truly pilot a fighter or gunship.•	Not able to change direction up or down to evade Stellar mass in a direct collision course•	Not able to properly map Cone of angles for the turret systems being applied to the ships. (Kinda handy when attempting to do mining to know where the laser fire can reach.)•	Limitation to the Components that can be installed on all ships.•	Not able to easily pull up the map when needing to make a quick reference to a station or asteroid mining location when getting info or finding merchandise while in space.•	Limited to a single Mercenary Hire, can’t recruit an armada of Mercenaries.

												Nice polished game for those that love space sims, but don't have the time to deal with the learning curve associated with most.  Game is intuitive, from combat to the mission system, but still allows for challenges if you are looking for them.  Best part is you can really kind of go at your own pace and explore.  You can pick up a side mission, and suddenly find yourself in a blockade or find a distress signal. so you never know what will happen when going from point A to B.  Did I mention the game is polished?  Alien language voice acting and all, it truly has character.			"

												This game is rad and my only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. You can accomplish just about all of your light sci-fi fantasies, become a bounty hunter, a smuggler, pilot a dreadnaught warship, and more! I personally focused on building the fastest ship possible, swooping in picking up items, delivering them into hostile territory and getting out before anyone catches on was so thrilling and something no other game of this type does nearly as well. To top it all off the art style is inspired and the soundtrack is excellent and customizable. Can't recomend enough for anyone who wants to cruise through space.			"

												I recommend this game because its twenty dollars you get a lot for twenty bucks. I just completed the main story line but you can continue playing after this. My only real problem with the game is that the story wasnt that great and it felt really grindy after about halfway through. I think the game would be a lot better if they lowered the grind on the later portion of the game, because the real highlight of the game is trying out new weapon loadouts and ships and if it takes you forever to get those youre going to lose interest. I almost quit playing and uninstalled at the end but i stuck it out and completed it. Wasnt really impressed with the ending but all in all it was a good game. For twenty bucks or if you can catch it on sale even better i say pick it up and give it a shot.			"

												You have to get this game! $20?! It should be $50! It has an engaging story line, the ability to conduct trade, choose loyalty to different factions through missions, great graphics, and a nice variety of ships. I was certainly not expecting a game of this quality for the price point.Some people might think this game repetitive, in that the frequent combat might be, but learning new fighting styles by changing up your weapons types keeps things fresh. It is derivitive, games like this have existed before, but it has a nice user interface and I know that I'll get more than my money's worth of enjoyment from it.AGAIN: snatch this game up, especially for the $20 I paid!Cheers			"

												Take AC: Black Flag naval combat... Make it 10x better, stick it in space and add a wicked soundtrack, you have Rebel Galaxy. The combat is action packed, the ship customization system is awesome, it is easy to pickup & play and most of all, if you like the idea of naval combat, it will keep you entertained for a while.The only major drawback is the game is short. The main story line felt short, majority of my playing time was spent on collecting credit through side missions. Another minor drawback was the amount of customization. The way you upgraded the ships was awesome (buying/selling prices were equal, you could easily upgrade or downgrade between ships) however, there are only a limited type of weaponry to choose from.None the less, besides these drawbacks, if you enjoy space & naval combat, this game will give you a good fix. Personally I've spent 60 hours playing and enjoyed it.			"

												Absolutely great fun, especially for $20. I'm a huge fan of the old space sims like Privateer and Freelancer, and this is the first game in years to really replicate the feeling they gave me. I think part of it has to do with its fun ''space truckers' aesthetic, but it helps that it's also fast-paced and arcadey, as well as beautiful.Also, the fact that things are locked to a 2D plane really isn't a problem. There's plenty of room for tactical positioning, and it makes the broadsides on your ship useful and interesting. If you simply cannot stomach the thought of a space sim without full 3D flight, then give it a pass, but c'mon - open yourself to new things!			"

												This is a great game and tkaes hours to completely play through it.For 20 bucks I would say that this game is worth the cost and should get a best value award for the content that it brings to the table for the cost.To sum the game up you are a called in by your Aunt to go to the nastiest part of the galaxy and you have to fend for yourself. You find a relic that you repair and eventually you collect parts to repair the AI's memory. The AI then decides to sacrifice itself for the greater good and that's how the storyline rolls.As for the game play you'll find yourself warping throughout space fighting all types of spaceships and different situations which I found really fun to do.The game has a high difficulty curve so be warned, this game isn't for those really really casual gamers and is geared more towards those who can think on their feet and react quickly to different situations. If you need to remember to press your scanning key which is TAB by default to freeze the game and analyze the situation.I did 2 play throughs of the game one as a good guy and one as a bad guy. Both were pretty satisfying but it is really hard to be a bad guy. The storyline gears you toward being a good guy and to earn bad guy rep to actually enter their ports takes a long time. In the meantime you have to not♥♥♥♥♥♥off the civilians otherwise you'll have no ports that you can call your home and all you'll meet there is your end. No worries though missions will help keep your rep up so that shouldn't happen unless you get reckless.The game also does not limit you in what you want to do. I skipped the storyline and worked my way towards the endgame before coming back to complete it. By the time I finished the storyline on my first run through I already had a blackgate that was decked out with MK 5 pulse turrets that decimated anything that strayed within their range of fire. On the second play through I bought a quick ship (the Icarus) and rushed towards the end game areas and did adrenaline rush dead drop missions for hundreds of thousands of credits to reach the end game faster which felt really satisfying to do.Overall I loved the graphics of the game, it has a good soundtrack which you can make your own custom soundtrack as well, and the sound quality of the game is great as well. The only thing I am waiting on now to see if they will release DLC for the game or make a second sequel to the game which I will be more than happy to buy. If you like flying spaceships then give this game a try I promise that it will be worth your money.			"

												Just think Firefly + Cowboy Bebop = Rebel Galaxy.Didn't know what all to expect when watching the trailers, so I thought ""What the hell, I'll give it a shot.""  Then I gave it another...and another...and another, and before I was done, pirate fleets were torn asunder and floating lifeless in the cold, empty void of space.Overall:+ Put in close to 12 hours so far and still in the first system.  In many AAA-titles released these days (I'm looking at you CoD), the main part of campaigns can be completed in 5-20 hours, depending on how much content there is.  For a $20 game to beat out $60 games is a damn shame. It shows that bigger studios often care too much about profit, and not enough on a great experience like they used to.+ Sometimes takes on that addictive ""just one more mission"" quality+ Tight, responsive controls+ Again, for $20, the AI can be surprisingly good+ Like many have said, it's not a space sim, which, for me at least, was a good selling point.  No need for ultra-realism after seeing pretty pew-pew lasers and lots, and LOTS of explosions.+/- The soundtrack can be kind of a mixed bag.  It isn't terrible by any means, but after hearing the same 6-7 songs repeated over and over again in some sequences, I disabled the music in the settings and began listening to music downloaded from YouTube.  Yet if the developor can periodically update the game with new tracks, it'd be an added bonus. + Got to name my ship the Cowboy Bebop10/10 - See ya later space cowboy!			"

I will warn you that it gets grindy at times but its nothing to hard. I was able to log 45+ hours just with trying to finish up the story. It's just one of those endless games where you can still play side missions infinitly. It even is able to through in some allusions to some famous si-fi movies. Plus the little humor and the AMAZING sound track (which can be messed with and added to) makes for a great game.I just hope theres another one coming sooner rather then later.			"

												Holy Amazing!Ok so reading all of these reviews may build up a bit of hype and while the game is great, its not necessarily the greatest game ever. It is one of the best game values for your money, some sort of a story line (searching for your aunt?)  is at least present but, most importantly, it really is best described as AC Black flag with space ships.Customization is great as far as equipment and such.  I do wish there was the option to paint your ship assuming I'm not an idiot and didn't miss that.The soundtrack is great with that meaning its along the lines of rock/classic rock which makes keeps your energy up.  My experience comparison is to that of Sins of a Solar Empire... the music alone could make me stop playing the game.  To me its more like, I'm a badass! With a space ship!  Come get some! and lets rock out to that!not, oh hey... could you pass me that mozart cd so I can sit blowing up stuff with some somber tones running in my head...zzzzAnyway, this is as close as it gets to feeling like you're really out in your battlestar galactica or star wars destroyer taking on the skum of the universe.  There is some travelling but the space is populated and plenty of things to run into or die from on your own.  I have a knack for running into red threat levels and practicing reloading the game.The earn money and upgrade your ship works really well, you do need to do some main missions or use your map to find missions.  Flying in a particular direction works too however, you may find you run into near or sudden death encounters with ships you clearly underestimated.  Another way to describe this game is, its like FTL but you dont see through your ship and in order to jump, you best run like hell to reach a safe warp (jump) point!To summerize:Pros:Easy to play and get to the action (and die lol)Thank god its in 2D because handling a 3rd direction would probably make me sick and be overwhelmed (may be a con for some)Very good graphics to the point where it looks great and is playable on lower end systems.It still plays beautifully and perfectly smooth at 4k with a 980 Ti.  Simple but robust upgrade options.  Targeting is pretty easy, the AI can manage some of your guns as well.The universe is alive, even if you did nothing but fly around you run into stuff and/or cool planets with bases.Theres a story at the very least.Awesome sounds and an upbeat sound track.  Your ship makes most of those cool sounds you want to hear when you change directions or power up your warp drives.Great Value/Price makes this hard to beat!Cons:Limited view options (may not be a con but locking the view closer or further would be nice).Just to add in case a developer reads this, if there was a cockpit view I may have to change my pants every time I play.  That would be amazing and with using the broadsides, having the camera switch to whichever side you're moving your view stick to would be an idea.Unable to paint or color your ship.There are a lot of ship choices but I wish there was a variety of each class (not a big deal).While there is a story its not the most elaborate story or intriguing.  Something more along the lines of a mysterious cosmic disturbance was felt among the universe and a new alien race or super weapon is rumored to be the cause.  Among the warring factions and those at peace, spontaneous attacks from a new enemy emerge and along with your journey between the factions in space, do you suddenly run into unexpected encounters from this new weapon or race.  . . . . just my thoughts, some pulled form mass effect which was great up until they ruined it.  There is just more there to be desired but I'm happy to at least have a story.No multiplayer...not a big deal but would be fun to do missions or visit solar systems with a buddy.  Doubling the enemies per additional player would seem sufficient.Final Thoughts:  If the developers are still paying attention (hoping their sales numbers are great or better than expected), this is a great game and starting point that so many others try to achieve and simply fail at.There is a lot of potential here and simply adding more star systems with harder difficulty and additional story would hopefully not be too much trouble if DLC becomes a future ambition.  I was bored or at least overwhelmed with EVE and it really wasn't enjoyable having to basically learn how complex the game was...especially when you only have a few hours to play periodically.  This game strikes a great balance and at the limit of 2D movement however, I think it was a perfect choice because you can focus on battles! and Blowing stuff up!I am very pleased with this purchase and with so much room to add on or improve (even when it is already done so well already) I think it is something worth expanding on.None the less, you will have a blast if you go into this game expecting a space game with simple controls a little travelling here and there (typically no more than 1 minute in the first map), and small battles that grow to epic as the game progresses.Considering fast indoor go karting costs 20 bucks for 10 minutes.... this gives you a whole lot more with some speakers and a subwoofer .... you will be the next Han Solo in your SS Pea Shooter as I named my ship.Enjoy!

												Well first impression is this.  Its in space, sweet, but you cannot manuver on all 3 axis.  only left and right. very planer view.  but its recommended use of gamepad, may mean I'm missing something, but I don't see any options for pitch or roll. Ok so be it.  its not a true space sim in that sence.  It still seems kinda fun.  the first space battle due to story line was very reminecent of Pirates!,  alot of circling and broadside attacks.  the auto turrets take care of those pesky fighters or you can take over and blast those little buggers yourself. kinda fun and the percision mode adds some targeting skill.  the only thing I do not like is the lack of ZOOM.  you cannot zoom out.  so your ship takes up most of the screen. (I was constanly scrolling my wheel trying to get a better view)  so manuvering around objects around becomes a little panicked when proximity sensors pick up something and you have to attempt to steer around and fight at the same time.  due to fact you can only view what direction your pointing the camera this can be a little challanging. but the camera swivels like a top and is very responsive.   kinda curious to see if the scale changes when I can afford the larger ships.  or am I going to have a screen full of my ship. Now this is only my first time playing for approx 30-40 min.  overall graphics,ambiance,and backgrounds look pretty good it looked great on my 40"" 4k monitor at full res and high settngs.  I am definently going back in to play.			"

												This is easily the most addicting game I have played in a long time.  Wide variety of ships and equipment, both offensive and defensive, each with it's own pros and cons, and great music library.  Speaking of which, if you want to listen to your own tunes... you can.  When you launch the game, you can have the game look in certain folders fo combat, ambient, in-station and menu music, with another option to mix your selections in with the default music library.  This is the first game I've seen that allows you to do this.Anyway, that's enough typing, gotta get back in the game :)			"

												If you are a fan of ""Star Trek"" ish combat (a.k.a. dealing with shield facings,hull damage, and broadsides) then this is the game for you. I have spend over 35 hours and not even that far into the main game because of how fun it is. It is ""repetitive"" sure, but that's like saying Mario is repetitive because he is always jumping and running. The game IS a little ""mainstream"" and simpified, which could turn hard core PC gamers off, but if you are interested in a space combat/trading type game and have not experienced more in-depth games of that genre, than this is a perfect game to get your feet wet.10 out of 10, would buy again.

												Highly addictive game. Although there is a bit of grinding needed to get all the best stuff, there is a huge variety of ways to go about it.You can be a trader, go mining, work for different factions, or just go and shoot bad guys.Combat can be a bit tricky at times, I found the broadside hard to work at first until I realised they are not really for shooting down fighters, and you can switch to turrets to kill them. Once you start fighting bigger ships, the broadsides come in very handy.Some of the storyline missions can be a bit tedious, especially the escort ones, but all the other stuff is just too much fun for this to annoy me for long.

												The good:It's a game that focuses on the fundamentals and does them well. Everything is pretty simple, but makes sense and provides a decent enough challenge. The moment to moment gameplay in this is simply fun. The artwork, soundtrack, and just general feel of the game is great. For how much it costs this game provides spectacular value.The bad:It never really goes much deeper than what it starts as. Customization is pretty limited, and you do eventually end up running the same missions over and over just to raise money for your next ship or the next tier of equipment which is just a numerical boost to what you already have.Overall:Fun game to waste time with. It scratches that spaceship itch pretty well. Not really a particularly deep game though, the main motivation you'll have throughout is just getting a cooler ship.			"

												Been waiting for a game like this to scratch my space trading/rpg/combat itch for some time! If you ever loved games like Freelancer or Escape Velocity, this is the game for you!Pros:- The 2D plane gameplay environment works great with the captial ship theme. Naval battles in space!- Said combat is extremely satisfying, and deceptively nuanced. Many types of weapon classes, defence types and equiptment mods provide different ways to go about your battles. Brute force with a dreadnaught with massive broadsides? Stay on a foes tail with a nimble turret frigate? Somewhere in between?- A good story that provides some purpose. More depth than Elite: Dangerous!- Awesome Firefly style space western theme and music!- Beautiful!- Awesome devs that listen to the players and repond to your questions FAST!- It costs TWENTY FREAKING DOLLARS!!!Cons:- Can't change video settings on the fly, uses a laucher where you set them before starting, old school style. Not really an issue for me at all, but I'm sure there are people with lower end systems that need to experiment, and this makes it a little inconvienient.Kinda con but not really:- Mouse camera and aim movement has a negative acceleration issue, where faster mouse movement equates to slower in game response, and vise versa. HOWEVER, as stated above, the devs are AWESOME and responded to my concerns on Twitter within minutes, and even asked me to tell them what I think of the patch with an experimental option for it that came out within hours. Still not quite fixed, but it's obvious that they really care about their game and what people think of it. As a matter of fact, this probably doesn't even qualify as a con! Especially since I imagine most people use a contoller, and its easy to get used to the mouse issue. I'm gonna move it to a ""kinda con"" category. There we go, much better.In short:The game is awesome. The devs are awesome. The price is awesome. BUY IT!			"

												So this game takes a simplistic naval combat style and puts it in space which may seem weird at first but it's actually a lot of fun. The AI for your ship's turrets is intelligent and the enemies are not always a cakewalk. Good variety in ships and weapons. The game has a lot of polish. It's a solid all around good game to play. For $20USD it's under-priced as well. You'll likely get more than 20 hours out of it and most of that will be fun, non-grinding entertainment. Overall this game is a solid 8/10 with an intelligent and responsive developer. You'll get a lot of bang for your buck and have fun doing it.			"

												The nice graphics, cool effects, solid story and an awesome soundtrack make up a great atmosphere. Combining a the great atmosphere with a fun combat system with some random systems and a premade storyline, and you get a very fun game.There are elements of ARPG with being able to tweak your ship setup, which alter the way you do combat. All the ships looks cool.The game systems has some depth that you can use to your advantage, as an example I saw some people complain that debris can break your warping speed. But you can actually evade some of them by going around them, or even just shift to the side slightly if you are quick and skilled enough.Combat is fun while not being to difficult to learn. Some people will not like that its not full 3d combat with HOTAS support like Elite Dangerous. I don't mind this as it looks like this isn't aimed to be space flight sim game.I'm at 2nd system and has played ca. 18 hours. Been distracted quite a few times with some trading and mining.EDIT: The game runs SUPER smooth on my i5+nvidia 560. 3 years old system.TLDR; Great atmosphere, solid story, fun gameplay.

												I enjoy the game a lot and really appreciate the work the developers have put in post release (Two patches in the two days it's been out).While Linux is not supported (though the developer has mentioned it's a possibility, someday) between patches and trial and error it's pretty stable through Wine and runs wonderfully. The game is extremely scalable, looking great on my Intel HD 4500 work PC and my GTX460 PC at home.The game is a lot of fun as well. If you want Freelancer or Freespace's dogfights and 3D twisting through space combat this may not do it for you, but if you want cruisers and capital ships larger than city blocks to pull along side each other and let off a broadside volley while your flak cannons evaporate fighters buzzing around you this is it.

												If your a fan of the t.v series ""Firefly"", you will adore this game. Space meets the wild west of america. You can pretty much play however you want to really, either as a pirate, a merc, a bounty hunter, a trader, a do-gooder, a member of the system milita or anything else that comes to mind. Factions are present in the game and you can change your relations with the vast amount of them. The milita, citizens, red devil cartel and others are the major ""players"". There is a lot of replay-ability in this game and each playthrough offers a lot to do. Any valuable free time?, prepare for it to simply cease existing.There are quite the variety of ships to choose form each with their own playstyle and role in combat, ranging from corvettes to huge dreadnaughts bristling with firepower. Also, RAMMING SPEED! is completley viable when you get the right deflector shield. >:DIn terms of preformance, the game is pretty well optimized and I havent experienced any FPS drops nor crashes or glitches in the game so far. The only real issue is with the set up for the graphics being done out side of the game before launch. Other than that the game has rebindable keys for those wanting to change their keyboard set up and is also usable with a game pad as well.Finally lets get some of the ""meh"" points out of the way: 1) such as only being a 2D plain which really isnt to much of a problem (unless your a 3D space I WANNA GO EVERYWHERE fanatic) but a 3D plain would be nice but the game still works great with just 2D, and 2) being only a singleplayer experience which is great but the concept of playing with friends in co-op or being in a large server with many others effecting the world of rebel galaxy together. The possabilites are pretty big. Think player made factions and guilds fighting wars for resources or player made pirate groups raiding player escorted relief convoys that will effect economys in the game and the major factions relations and standing in the world.Overall I would very much recomend this game to anybody who is a fan of si-fi and or western drama with its beautiful world and fun gameplay with a large choice of options and intense ship on ship combat.I hope to see you all out there in this mad galaxy my fellow starship captains! for profit! for reputation! and for being the greatest badasses that this galaxy's ever seen!

												Lots and lots of grinding, if you like repeditive grind, this is a game for you, otherwise I'd give it a pass.It's pretty though, and it has a neat soundtrack. Unfortunately the space combat is boring (and there's a lot of it), your ship is tied to only moving in a 2d plane. Your opponents don't have any such restrictions, they will fly around you while you realise that you can only hit opponents with your cannons when they're roughly in the same plane as you.			"

												This game is absolutely off the walls amazing.  If you like the space cowboy theme of shows like Cowboy Bebop, Firefly/Serenity, or even the insane and wild adventures of Space Dandy, Outlaw Star, and Star Wars (specifically Han Solo), GET THIS GAME.  A warning though, YOU FIGHT LIKE A SHIP IN THE SEA which means broadsides and stuff, BUT IN SPACE!  This means no going up or down or even do maneuvers like rolling.  Remember, you're a larger ship and not a light fighter or gunship.  Other than that, you can do so many things that aren't missions, such as cause a food shortage in a station and sell food for higher prices, indirectly cause wars by killing off a diplomatic ship, and other such activities (not going to spoil it).  Yes there is a story to it, but I think this game is better for those who like to make their own as they play.			"

												TLDR: It’s awesome, but I have some nits to pick. I finished the campaign in an Arcturus with level 6 defenses, a mix of level 5 pulse turrets and particle lasers, and level 6 neutron beams in about 21 hours (net worth just under 40 million). My equipment level was such that the final set of missions was pretty easy (I don’t think I lost shields once during the final battle, and the mission itself was listed as low risk).Liked:Combat: I read some comments before purchasing the game lamenting the fact that it didn’t allow full 3-D motion. While I initially held some of the same concerns, I very quickly fell in love with the navel style combat system, which would have been difficult if not impossible to pull off well in a fully 3-D environment. From the carefully aimed long range broadsides to those exhilarating moments when you slam the side of your ship into your opponent and scream “Fire at Will!” as you pull the trigger as fast as you can, combat is an absolute blast.Movement: As an addendum to combat, the movements system in battles, especially when you reach the higher levels of boosters, is amazing as well. The sudden acceleration you see while surging along the side of a much larger ship trying to avoid its broadside feels like it should by squeezing you into the back of your seat. This, plus the broadside mechanic, combine to make combat absolutely enthralling.Ship Design: I really like the types and variety of ships available to captain and kill. From the industrial ships of the common citizen to the more refined combat ships of the militia to the strange and futuristic designs of the alien races, there is a very nice variety of ship designs in the game. There hasn’t been one ship that I’ve looked at and haven’t said “Oooooo, I wanna fly THAT!”Ship to Ship Scale: I really like how ship scale progresses in the game as you earn enough credits to purchase larger and larger vessels. You start off as a small ship trying to make it in the big leagues, desperately firing your boosters in an attempt to avoid a larger vessel’s broadside while keeping him under fire from your own. Later on you become that larger ship, trying to turn fast enough to keep that pesky fly in your sights before his constant fire wears through your shields. Seeing ships I used to pilot seem as gnats compared to my current ships really hammers home the progression I’ve made in the game.The 'Risk' System: It may seem minor, but I really like the risk announcement. Hearing ""Threat Level: Red"" made my booster finger start to itch almost uncontrollably.Music: Makes it feel like I’m playing Firefly the Game. Enough said.Didn’t Like:Warp Inhibition: Warp inhibition by stellar mass seems to be a bit finicky. I often found myself being inhibited by smaller asteroids when I had a clear path through a field, getting back into warp, and then later in the trip having to jerk to the side to avoid a much larger asteroid whose surface I would barely skim while remaining in warp without a problem. I overall like the inhibition system, but it seems it could use some tweaking.Emptiness: I wasn’t exactly sure what to label this one. Basically, it felt that systems lacked traffic where you would expect it to be, and as a result the game felt a bit emptier then it should have. For example, I never encountered another ship around a jumpgate (except for the last story sequence, of course). Freelancer had a very good system in this respect, in that jumgates always had traffic moving through them, sometimes even enough that the player had to wait in line! Some of my best memories of that game were running from an enemy I couldn’t defeat and hoping that I would avoid the dreaded “entering queue” and be able to complete the jump sequence before my hull failed. Speaking of which…Ease of Escape: I felt it was a bit easy to escape from enemies that outclassed you. Shields recharging under deflectors combined with the fact that broadside don’t fire forward by nature meant that it was trivially easy to escape any situation. I think I died a total of twice in the 20 hours I played, and that was only because I made a conscious decision not to run when I knew I should have. I really feel that there is a missed opportunity in dramatic escapes here.Story: The story had an interesting premise but fell too quickly, in my opinion, into ‘save the world’ mode. I had hoped the story would focus more on “space wild west” type themes, like the conflict between the civilized core worlds and the wild frontier or between an expanding colonial power and those resisting that expansion. I could see hints of the latter in the story, but it ended up feeling more like a mass effect type overarching plot, which I felt fit the lore and feel of the game less well.With all that said, I want to reiterate how much I really like Rebel Galaxy. It’s a fun, fast paced game with an awesome soundtrack and even better combat. I’m really interested to see where the developers take it from here and will almost certainly be purchasing whatever they create next.			"

												I have long been a fan of Freelancer to the point I have spent years lementing the fact that my system no longer supports it. I have played more games then I can honestly count, here I have found some thing of that long lost love. This game gives yopu a huge freedom of movement and choice, an interesting story where you actually effect some of the outcomes, not to mention addicting combat. One of the best parts is taking on random jobs as a no-name Merc trying to build up your ship and reputation. Just when you think your ship is bad♥♥♥♥♥ and your a king of the stars you find out that the Galaxy is a much bigger place then you first realized and that you are little more then a fly in space. Don't be discouraged because this is part of what makes this game amazing, it evolves, it challanges you, it makes you work for what you want without just coddling you like so many games. The learning curve isn't too extreme but starting out you will find sooner then later that you need to make money if you want to survive and it gives you a number of options to achieve this ranging from saving beligured stations, rescue Merchants who are on the short end of luck, There are also the Merchant and Mercenary guilds that give you a huge oppurtunity to expand your reach with jobs, equipment and ships. All the while you have to decide which side of the law you are on. Are you a Pirate? Smuggler? A devil may care merc, or a hero, or are you some kind of mix between. If you want a game that is strangely addicting, well made, with a good sound track (honestly the best I have ever heard) It is like Firefly meets Freelancer. If that doesn't impress you then you have no soul, if it does, strap in for one hell of an inter-stellar ride.			"

												This game is awesome! You fly a spaceship and can be a trader, a smuggler, a mercenary or a pirate. The music is sweet and it gives you the feeling of Wild West, exploring the frontier. Some people claims it gets repetitive after a while, but I was addicted to the combat and upgrading my spaceship. The 2D natvigation and the 2.5D actually work very well. There are enough games doing space dog fights, and broadside battles are more fun in my opinion.			"

												This may be an odd referene, but when I play this game I think of Sid Meiers Pirates! ... with spaceships and NarcoCola. And that is a good thing!It is a niche game in the aspect that you need to love in order to get hooked;1) Captal Ship gameplay (lots and lots of guns in a 2.5D gameplay)2) Extensive Carrear options (Trade/Pirate/Hunter)3) Telling Aliens where to put their hat (hint - not in a kind place)Having sunk a lot of hours into the game, I have found myself hooked. It has a good wave between getting easy to frustrating and back to easy again, it doesn't fall off either cliff completely and I find the grind to be rather well balanced, which is an absolute must in this genra of game. A good perk to it is that the AI isn't derped or broken like I have seen in simular games (where a ship plants itself into a wall and doesn't get the IQ to turn around).My only big knock against it is that the camera angles are at times borked out pretty badly, and requires its own learning curve to figure out and compinsate for. I would like if the broadside gunner views were pulled back by double to give a better line of sight, or give an option to have a gunners-seat POV.For its price point, it is a must for any Space-sim action game junkie!

MOO1, MOO2, baulders gate franchise, eternal pillers, planscape torment, hell even privater, wing commander, and freelancer.. etc etc.people just want to play a decent game at decent prices that comes out on time it does not have to be...PERFECT!   Who wants to wait 3yrs and pay nearly 100mil for a game that never comes out...hint hint Star Citizen? given a choice between 3-4 years of promises of the perfect game which if it does come out is a let down due to all the hype...or a dirty efficent, less than perfect but has heart game which comes out early and exceeds expectations all for 20 dollars...well....that in my tiny oppinion is the game for me.GO GET THIS GAME....!its only 20 bucks made by two firefly fans...no way to loose.

												I have no problem giving a thumbs up on this title.  A lot of people say it has a ""Firefly"" feel and they are right.  The soundtrack, universe and choices you make are what gives it that feel.  Will you stop for that distress call?  Or is that cargo too important for you to be a big damn hero.  The games story has been decent so far.  Combat feels like ""Star Trek Online"" where space is....flat.  Naval style broadside battles make you manage your sheilds as you try to stay on an enemies weak side.  Mercenaries are waiting to be hired at every space station for a price.  They'll fly with you until you dismiss them or faithfully until they die.  You can outfit your ship with a fair amount of upgrades or buy bigger ships.  Each ship has its own benefits depending on what you want to do.  Do you want to smuggle and run trade routes to make money between missions?  You'll want cargo space and speed?  You want to hunt down bounties?  Better go with weapon hardpoints and hull strength.  It's pretty open.  The game has an economy that is ever changing so goods might be cheap here but are selling higher on the otherside of the system giving you a chance to make a buck.    I've read people giving a thumbs down because it takes too long to travel from A to B on occasion.  All I can say to that is ""Flying through hyper-space ain't like dusting crops, boy...""  My only complaint is that the pirate dialog is pretty skimpy.  You hear the same ""well, well.  You most be lost..."" quote too many times. If you're a sci-fi junkie and want a space game that's not overly complex but still has substance then pick this up.  $20 you can't go wrong.  You'll get your $ worth.  You can be a leaf on the wind too!  Just watch how you fly...			"

												If you are looking for a new Freelancer, this is as close as it can get. Of course, the broadside combat and the 2D space navigation is a bit strange at first, but after you got your first new ship and finished a few missions, the gameplay flow really steps in.Yes, it is a bit grindy between the story missions, but so was Freelancer. Also, you can simply ignore the whole storyline if you want and just go out there and fight or trade for the milita, merchant guild, mercenary guild or the pirates of course.For this low-end price, it is well worth the money!

												After playing the game a bit longer I have to unfourtunately change my review score. The reason is that there isn't really much to the game except doing same type of missions over and over or follow the rather uninteresting and lacklustre story. So you can get maybe 20-30 hours of fun gaming out of this but after that it gets repetetive and boring.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is a beautiful space opera with story and open world elements. The combat is fun and engaging and there are tons of ships to upgrade too. However I feel the game gets a bit repetetive after a while but still well worth buying. However one would wonder what kind of game would be made if this game, with awesome graphics, was combined with Beyond Sol, which has innovative and fun gameplay but mediocrea graphics.			"

												I love this single-player game to the point I made a video game guide to help new players.Sure the game is repetitive, same could be said of grinding with pokemon.Only instead of leveling up, you buy some cool gear for your ship to the point every enemy in the game can't do anything to stop you. And if you don't like to play the same missions again, you can play as an honest trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, a member of the law or a merciless pirate.The game can also be Moded, expect some cool mods in the near by future.For now the best mod I can recomend is the Miner mod by Philpw99 (changes the prices on the market and improves the cargo crates).The game was made by 2 developers with love, it's cheap and plays like one of the many good AAA titles.Show some love for this game, you won't regret it.[If you hate repetitive gameplay (like pokemon grinds) avoid like the plague.]			"

												This game is simply amazing.This game is the natural evolution of a 2d space scrolling shooter like Tyrian or Galactix.  It's a wonderful mix of those games, your standard space-trader game, based on Tradewars 2002, and Firefly all rolled up into one giant explosive ball of awesome.  Many spaceship games now-days require days or even months of tutorials and online reading just to fit your ships properly, position your ship, what you can take on and what you can't, etc.   Rebel Galaxy you can just jump into and be blowing stuff up in minutes.   While i love a good space sim, The attention to detail and realistic physics in those games makes the learning curve incredibly difficult. Keeping this game on a single flat plane, and then creating the game around that plane is a stroke of sheer genius. I've even put down playing Fallout 4 for this.   "

												Thouroughly enjoying REBEL GALAXY. It even runs on my 2009 MacBook (stripped down of course). The plot keeps things moving and the simple controls take the Flight Sim element out of the equation which, after slogging through games like X3: reunion and Elite: Dangerous is quite refreshing. The difficulty is just right for me, not being the kind of person who is willing to dedicate massive amounts of time to mastering a video game. I consider them a form of entertainment not a means to exercise obsessive compulsive tendencies. So A+ for Rebel Galaxy! I finally found a replacement for Galaxy On Fire 2 HD.			"

												I had been undecided about buying this game, because on one hand I love space-games, and on the other I hate 2D games (especially in space) and that I the idea of flying on a 2D plane within 3D space doesn’t appeal to me. I watched some videos and thought it would be worth a try, after all space RPG’s are not too common. I found the game to be quite entertaining, although not very immersive. After getting some decent upgrades it also wasn’t very challenging. The spaceship components did not feel like they had enough variety in them. Sooner or later you will end up going to the overpowered beam turrets. The game-play is still fun and the graphics are good considering the game’s 2D limitations. The dialogue scenes offer nice visuals which was a great addition. The main story felt somewhat short, and written for a younger audience.On a scale out of 10:Graphics: 8Story: 6Immersion: 6Gameplay: 7			"

												This game is really fun.  I'm not sure it has a tremendous amount of replay value, but I really like it.  I've been looking for something similar to MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries for years and this is pretty close, just in space.  You are essentially a rogue captain on a journey to learn what happened to your sister.  This is the main story, but there are a lot of side quests and events to do.  Trade runs, save people, attack rival factions, quests, attack militia, contraband, etc..  I like being able to upgrade my ship, as well as, the armaments of this ship.Also, hands down, this game has one of the best sound tracks ever.  Look it up on YouTube... a lot of really good songs.

												I enjoy it because I enjoy space games like this, and that's why I recommend it. If, from the trailers, gameplay videos, whatever, you think you won't like it, don't get it. It's a lot of grinding, with a poor, unengaging story. But there's a lot to be said for making your own stories, even if you have to make up a lot of it yourself and the game provides very little to support that.The gameplay's pretty fun (though it's basically a sea/navy battle in space on one plane) in my opinion. The options and variety of weapons, shields, etc. are nice, though it would be nice to be able to customize your ship to make it more ""yours"".Overall 7.5/10 for being a solid game, but doing little to distinguish itself from the crowd of other space games. Also grinding. ♥♥♥♥ing grinding.			"

												Negatives:- Lack of innovation. This is a copy of the (working) Wing Commander Privateer formula, albeit in two dimensions.- Balance issues when it comes to weapon choice.- Minor progression spiking issues. For example, there are times when you find one salvage item that is worth more than your next 10 entire missions.- Lack of end game. Basically once you have Mark 6 shields and pulse turrets the game is over.- The decision to make this a 2D game makes little sense to me. It takes away from the astrobatics experience and simplifies gameplay.- Some tedious game mechanics with warp travel. Finding an asteroid belt with some salvage seems meant to be a nice surprise, but in reality it's just annoying because it drops you out of warp and the only salvages (as far as I know) which give high-credit equipment rather than commodities are the ones you take off of ships. The number of times I had to veer just to the right or left of an asteroid and use thrusters to get back into a safe state to use warp drive was far too many.Positives:- Provides good value for $20, especially if you are a huge fan of the series' that it takes from (Privateer, Dark Star One).- Stable. No real performance issues.I know the negatives list is longer than the positives, but I would still recommend the game if you are a space exploration fan just looking for a remake of Privateer without the daunting depth of X3.

												Okay, this is a great game, ive got a fair few hours into it and am far from being bored. However, the game has a lot of things which need to be fixed:- The difficulty system, please oh please fix the difficulty system. For those of you that don't know, when you accept a mission the game tells you how difficult it is based on your ship, which is great. Except it's horrifically broken right now, i have absolutely dominated ""hard difficulty"" missions and been absolutely rekt on easy difficulty missions, the system, to put it plainly, is pointless in it's current state-Fighter class ships, they are supposed to be these little craft which acompany larger ships to help them in fights. However some missions you get only fighter class ships, and they are hilariously overpowered. In a fight of me vs 7 normal sized ships(roughly my own ships size) i can win if i use tactics, a bit of luck and a lot of guns. But in a me vs 7 fighter class ships? Heck no, i get dominated like a david and goliath fight. Let's not forget that these are supposed to be small, relatively weak ships which fight you AS WELL AS regular ship, it makes some parts of the game completely impossible, such as a mission i went on recently. The mission was simple- destroy a chrono relay and any response squad you encounter. The relay was easy, the response squad? 30 fighter ships surrounding my ships on every single direction. They closed in and there was no way to get through them without ramming through one part of the blockgade they had formed, which i did and i was unsurprised to find my shields and hull drop faster than call of duty's sales. Basically the message is this- NERF THE FIGHTERS FOR MY SANITY'S SAKE PLEASE I CAN'T GO THROUGH ANOTHER FIGHT LIKE THAT-lastly, mercenaries randomly dying is a problem, i'll warp from a civilian base and suddenly the mercenary death sound will play and it will give me the message ""your mercenary, sparrow, has ejected"" this glitch costs me 30,000 credits every time i get it so i would be very grateful if you could fix itThose are the only major issues i've found so far, other than that, an amazing space game with huge potential			"

												Really enjoy this game. Relaxing and fun. Only sad thing is this: No Trading Cards on Steam. What beautiful things that could be plaved in my messages and profile page if there had been Trading cards. Seriously though. Love the game. Nice to play in a casual pace.

												Great game for the price. It has a plot but not a very interesting one. Luckily you can skip the dialogue. This game is all about grinding and leveling but the combat is fun. The gameplay is repetitive but solid, and getting new weapons and ships is a lot of fun. The space battles feel pretty epic during the height of the action. Pros: -Gameplay is fun -Leveling is fun-Music is weird but coolMeh:-Graphics OK but nothing interesting. Very average. I was about to run in at 4K though with DSR and it ran perfectly sommoth on a geforce 760Cons:-Plot not interesting enough to care about-Cant free space slaves! "

												Great game.... Just missing one thingA MODDING COMMUNITY This gametype is famous for its modding community, look at freelancer,♥♥♥♥♥♥is still running hot because new mods keep it going, Mods also breath new life into the game as you could make the solar systems look nice rather than dull and non distictive, with 50 hours in I feel there should be more content and modding would satisfy that. The developers though do not want to release tools to mod the game, i imagine they will in the future go ahead and release some tools but it seems like knowing this type of game and the community that follows it would want to use that population boost to get the game a bit more known and possibly forever added to the list of best space combat games.Recommend it, worth every penny "

Rebel Galaxy blows up everything real good but your wallet, it's more immersive than the deep end of the Mutara Nebula, and if its 2D maneuvering and broadside combat systems are unrealistic for anybody but Han Solo or L. Sprague DeCamp, they're more addictive than ketracel-white.  Space opera fans, rejoice, two great game developers have gone rogue.			"

												Ok, so I generally do not write reviews, because I like what I like and do not expect others to like it. However, this is a game that I would not have initially considered, and it has turned out to be a diamond in the rough.First, it is simple. It is naval combat...in space. Sure you can run cargo missions, or rescue missions, but in the end you will be fighting some faction, and it is simplistic in its approach. When I say simple, I mean it takes away some of the more complex aspects of gameplay and makes navigating and aiming the most important. Everything else is handled automatically or assumed for you. I like not having to think about complex aspects of a game. I like knowing where to go for a mission, and how much to repair my ship, and knowing that when I buy a new ship everything I previously purchased gets moved to my new ship.Rebel Galaxy has done a great job in making a game fun to play, whether you are a hard core gamer, or a casual one.I highly recommend this game.

												Holy crap it is a boatload of fun to explode enemy ships, this is like every naval and navallike combat-game control should be like. Giving the enemy a broadside is hellafun, but it only get really satisfying when you install the Dumbfire Launchers wich have no targetting help.This is how space combat in EvE Online should have been like.There are a few cons to consider.Lack of depth, the game doesn't feel as immersive as you could hope for. No real connection to the characters for me.The User Interface during conversations are clonky and for most part, pointless in my opinion. I would really wish for an option to just press ""B"" on my controller to get out of conversations without having to manually scroll down and choose whatever answer i can to get out.The smaller ships you can buy quickly become pointless it seems, as a bigger ship with bigger guns and heavier armor is so far the only viable choice.Those 3 things are for me, the most negative issues this game have. But for just around 20 euro, i without doubt would buy it again. Hint: The game becomes even more alive, awesome and responsive if you can get your hands on a controller with vibration.			"

												Rebel Galaxy brings naval-style broadsides combat to space, alongside a surprisingly deep comodities trading system in a procedurally generated universe. Developed Blizzard alum and industry veterans at Double Damage studios, their decades-long vision of a space game has finally come to fruition. The dirty delta blues sountrack, along with a built-in custom sountrack tool, adds miles to the used-future aesthetic of many sci-fi favorites such as Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and Star Wars. The devs are also highly engaged with the community here on Steam and on /r/RebelGalaxy, regularly responding to questions, concerns, and balance issues.			"

												I have long been a fan of Freelancer to the point I have spent years lementing the fact that my system no longer supports it. I have played more games then I can honestly count, here I have found some thing of that long lost love. This game gives yopu a huge freedom of movement and choice, an interesting story where you actually effect some of the outcomes, not to mention addicting combat. One of the best parts is taking on random jobs as a no-name Merc trying to build up your ship and reputation. Just when you think your ship is bad♥♥♥♥♥ and your a king of the stars you find out that the Galaxy is a much bigger place then you first realized and that you are little more then a fly in space. Don't be discouraged because this is part of what makes this game amazing, it evolves, it challanges you, it makes you work for what you want without just coddling you like so many games. The learning curve isn't too extreme but starting out you will find sooner then later that you need to make money if you want to survive and it gives you a number of options to achieve this ranging from saving beligured stations, rescue Merchants who are on the short end of luck, There are also the Merchant and Mercenary guilds that give you a huge oppurtunity to expand your reach with jobs, equipment and ships. All the while you have to decide which side of the law you are on. Are you a Pirate? Smuggler? A devil may care merc, or a hero, or are you some kind of mix between. If you want a game that is strangely addicting, well made, with a good sound track (honestly the best I have ever heard) It is like Firefly meets Freelancer. If that doesn't impress you then you have no soul, if it does, strap in for one hell of an inter-stellar ride.			"

												TL;DR: Space travel, big ships, little ships, weapon customization, trading, mining, pirating, enjoyable broadside combat ONLY on one plane (no up or down movement by your ship). Story is so-so, but not what the game is about. Graphics are beautiful, runs smoothly, 8/10 I would recommend for the 20$ asking price, definitely worth it on a good sale.Rebel Galaxy. Now here's a game I bought on a total whim, thinking if I hated it I could just refund it. Well I put about an hour into it, and honestly, that refund looked more promising that enjoying this game.HOWEVER. On I played, and I'm glad I did.Rebel Galaxy story is alright, but I didn't honestly pay it much attention, and it lost my interest quickly, becoming much more interested in ammassing large amounts of money and upgrading my ship. Yuo start out in this dinky little capital ship that seems hopelessly outgunned when compared to some of the other faction ships. But get enough credits and start upgrading, and suddenly you feel like you rule the galaxy. Your ship can be customized not aesthetically, but through a diverse set of broadside turrets and mounted turrets, as well as thing slike cargo hold space, shiels, boosters, engine, armor plating, etc. Buy bigger ships, they're slower and less manueverable but covered in turrets and a hefty broadside arsenal. Smaller ships have less bang, but move and manuever like a charm, boasting high top speeds to simply work around your opponents.Briging me to the combat. As before mentioned, your weapons consist of mounted turrets and a set of broadside guns, with the number of each depedning on your ship. Different turrets excel at different things, from taking down enemy fighters, disabling shields, or blowing the armor plating clean off a capital ship. Your broadsides are meant to be capital ship destroyers, with you circling your opponent in naval-esque fashion and bombarding them from one side or the other of your ship. Although combat only taking place in one plane, it is very enojyable and rewarding to watch your turrets anihilate enemy craft like mere flies.Now not being able to move up and down may feel like a real let down, being stuck only moving fowards, backwards, and turning. But really, it isn't, once you open your mind to it. Space is still a very big place, and I can understand how adding upwards and downwards movement may be too much for some people.As far as space itself, the races have no real lore or background of any sort, and the game is definitely not one to get you any extra information on any of them. However, there is much, much to do, from pirating, to mining, to trading commodities between various stations that can be in various states such as economic boom or famine, driving various prices of various commodities up, or down. You could also just hunt various bounties in each system, or perform various types of quests for the different factions in the game, such as the militia or merchant guild.Lastly, I greatly enjoy both the graphics and the sountrack. I often find myself staring at the various stars and planets in the game, even being mesmerized by the movements in an ice field. For the sountrack, the twangy rock style fits perfectly into combat or encounters whenever it is triggered, fading in and out at appropriate times seamlessly.Overall, I would say this is an easy 8/10, with my only qualms being that sometimes long journeys in space can be a bit dull, with the only breakups being enemy AI that are far too willing to jump into combat they cannot possibly hope to win, and it is incredibly annoying to be halted from light speed because you came just BARELY too close to a stray rock in an asteroid field. Well worth the money I spent on it, and a truly great deal if you can ever catch it on sale. "

												Man, eat your heart out Han Solo!  Space adventure and star-RPG action not seen IMHO since the likes of Freelancer.  Great soundtrack, lots of gratutious space battles, arcade-like control, plenty of alien races to blast into the next dimension.  The controls, while a bit awkward at first to me, after a while they became intuitive and better than I'd say Freelancer's was...  And I'm an old sk00l die-hard Freelancer fan.The star systems are beautiful and actually laid out like a real star system, orbit paths shown and all,(via the map mind you) something I always wished Freelancer had done, instead of being static planets laid in a ""small"" star system.The attention to detail of the ships is great and you can even see ""scarring"" of battle damage done to your ship in realtime.  These things really give the feel to the game to make it truly a space sim.The dynamic economy and persistant universe features are also great features I loved from Freelancer are well done here also.  There are many many things done in Rebel Galaxy I had always wished Freelancer would be, but sadly it's no where near the depth and ""size"" of it.So with that said, the game is not without flaws though, It's story line is interesting and engaging, but also very short.  There is only a total of 14 solar systems in this game to explore, last I remember vanilla Freelancer had about 40-50 of them, some mods had an upwards of over 150 systems! (Crossfire 2.0)  Far too small of a universe to explore IMHO.While you do eventually upgrade to bigger and badder ships, sadly IMHO the name of the game is speed in these space battles and most of the big boys are far too slow to stay alive.  To me the only ""big ship"" to upgrade to is the Blackgate, (the biggest dreadnaught there is!) anything less and if you're overwhelmed, you simply won't be able to weather the assault or run from them.  Your upgrades, defenses and weapons are far more of an important factor in survival here as well as your tactics.(and hire a friggin' Merc fighter pilot!)As far as the BGM, I did enjoy the soundtrack at the beginning it eventually began wearing thin on me and I finally ended up muting the BGM.  Don't get me wrong, I love Blues Sacrenro and the songs are some of the best on a game's soundtrack I've heard in a long time, but listening to it for weeks on end?  Ahhhh, thanks but no thanks... In closing, the game has ALOT of great things going for it and I truly see it as a ""spiritual"" successor to Freelancer.  However, I can only assume due to the abbreviated schedule of the Double Damage team limited them to  what they were able to cram into the game is that sadly it's nowhere near of the likes of it's predecessors like Eve Online, the X series, Freelancer and so forth.  Therefore I feel you'll get your money's worth, but this is only if you're looking for something ""entry level"" in a space sim as this game is very approachable to casual gamers I'd say.  Try it for the space sim, stay for it's ""arcade-like"" action. "

												That was a nice 20 hours experience. :-)   Not less, and no more.+ Simple gameplay, nice combat mechanics. You're flying in 2D on a med to large ship. So fight mechanics is like a sea battle. You have broadside weapons you have to aim with, you have turrets / torpedos / mines. You can also ram opponents with a special deflector (buy fast thrusters and a fast ship for that!). It is up to you to change the ship and fight dynamic and distance.+ Nice music (you can set it to your own music if you wish).+ Bright and colorful space. I know that this is unrealistic. But this is just the thing I wanted in X3 and the thing I've enjoyed in Freelancer. You can freely travel among a few systems with a warp  jump drive. Driving during a warp jump within a solar system is cool!+ The space exploration is a nice part of gameplay. Although, it's not very rewarding. You'll find some bounties, stations to be hacked, save a lot of miners from pirates (or the other way). But you won't be able to find any true gems / hidden space stations (the thing I've enjoed in Freelancer).+ Trading looks nice. However, never tryed that. Just like the feeling that I could. Newsboards, station switching states. Lively (not very lively, still nice).+ Pirating ability and ""change the side"" possibility is also a nice part of the game.+ Something original world setting. Looks a bit like Warhammer (edge of it) - you're trading with religious tracts! It's shame that they didn't say more about it.- Few (only one) side quests. Quests from mission board sometimes challenging (take ""hard"" and ""very hard"" only!) but, you'd get dull after 20-30 of them.- You do not really influence the solar system state with your action. So.. No stategy here. I think it would be nice to take stations from one side to another and do some other sort of global things (like in Pirates or in Space Rangers / Seadogs).- Bad keyboard mapping and froms GUI. At least for PC users. At least during first 2 hours of gameplay. You'll get used to it and it would be OK after an hour of gameplay. In general, the fight controls are nice. But....  First, there were no presets for some important buttons, so I had to manually select some buttons. Then I changed the whole mapping since some of the presets were awful. Then I figured out that I am not able to use my Thrustmaster gamepad here (so what is ""full controller support""?). it took me 3 minutes to figure out how to close the tutorial message. It took me 2 hours to find the right spot where to click ""sell this good"" in the commodities market. After 10 hours I've figured out that I can use arrow keys instead (which I set to do nothing in game settings), not with WASD keys (wich I used). After 3 hours of gameplay I've figured out how to use map (press 1 and use the mouse wheel). After 17 hours of gameplay I've figured out that there is a menu when you're in space where you can switch between missions / cargo (here's how one drops the cargo!) / AI turret preset (wow! but still this wheel widjet works strange). And it turned out that I can change pages only right to left. Not the other way (there is ""Esc"" button assigned to it wich should change the page, but closes the window).- One button to rule them all: collect cargo with tractor beam, warp jump, receive incoming hail, close windows. Everything is done with holding the same button. Most of the time it's ok. But I hate the moment when I want to collect that damn cargo and talk to the pirate instead (for 10 times in a row, having him in a long range). Or want to jump and hear only ""the ordinance is full"".- Buy the I still do not understand how to sell ordinance. Took something in the beginning of the game and now I cannot collect any more and sell it. I do not use rockets / mines, though.So, this is a nice arcade game. If you like arcade games that took place in space, you'll gonna enjoy it. If you prefer solid-like games (like X3 or Elite) - than you'll probably get bored at one point.			"

												This game is simply amazing.This game is the natural evolution of a 2d space scrolling shooter like Tyrian or Galactix.  It's a wonderful mix of those games, your standard space-trader game, based on Tradewars 2002, and Firefly all rolled up into one giant explosive ball of awesome.  Many spaceship games now-days require days or even months of tutorials and online reading just to fit your ships properly, position your ship, what you can take on and what you can't, etc.   Rebel Galaxy you can just jump into and be blowing stuff up in minutes.   While i love a good space sim, The attention to detail and realistic physics in those games makes the learning curve incredibly difficult. Keeping this game on a single flat plane, and then creating the game around that plane is a stroke of sheer genius. I've even put down playing Fallout 4 for this.   "

												Not X5, Not freelancer, much better then most space games. Think Firefly, with bigger ships, minus the ground stuff. Its pretty neat. Its a testament to how a sound track can make a game.I have not finished the game but I am getting there and I love it so far here are my thoughts, maybe updated when I finishPros: Lots of ships- It seems like the two main factions have 8 and then there are a few more. Lots of parts for those ships- All sorts of interesting mods to your standard ship stuff, Cool things like deflectors that make enemies take damage when you ram them!Decent Combant(read in cons)- Cool combat system, it changes up the standard sit and shoot captial ship fightsGreat Sound Track- speaks for itselfOk StorylineCons:2D movement, yea its not a deal breaker but its sucks when  you need to get around as asteroid. I get that it is alot more work to do but it would of helped a lot about the game.Horrible voice overs for some characters, some are great but most are ehh, maybe you should not of gotten your friend. In particular a few of the mercs you can hireCombat can be finicky, things like bad feed back, infinate missles from opposing ships when you can only carry 20 or so and the like is annoying.Artifical scaling, when you get stronger suddenly most enemies do too. It makes it hard to progress as often your upgrades feel a little meaningless.Overall-Get it, for the price it is great. It could be better, I hope it is open to mods as there is a lot more that could be done with this game. Particularly a randomized universe expansion. It isn't X, it isn't a dogfighting game it is its own thing.			"

												I loved this game. You can cry about the story or how ""shallow"" it is. It's not complex and its not for 3 year olds either is what I would say. I feel that this game was very close to the Freelancer experience, dare I say better in some ways besides the graphics obviously. Developers are active and support is very prompt as well. I had an issue with a mission not being able to be completed because of the NPC not warping with me to complete the objective....that was my only issue. Awesome game hope to see the next one soon.

												Prior to the praise, let me say this.  I eagerly await SOME form of update or additional content to bring us...well...additional content.That being said, after spending a few days with this gem, I'm blown away!  This is exactly what I've been craving in a space/flight game.  I have tried and tried to gain proficiency piloting in Elite Dangerous via keyboard and just can't get it down.  With this game, you navigate on a single open plane.  This is a nice simple navigation and ""broadside"" battle setup that you will not find overly complicated.  If you played Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and got relative enjoyment from the broadside battles at sea, then you should already be downloading this game.Although the battle is not overly complicated, it is by no means simplistic.  There is plenty of strategy to the battle and the biggest payoff is in how you outfit your ship (Black Flag again).  The main story keeps you going, no dullness yet. Also, extra big kudos to the soundtrack.  I could fly around the various systems picking fights and hauling cargo all day long with this music jamming!I truly hope the developers push this a little further with maybe some deeper missions or stories to pursue.  It is, after all, a REALLY big sandbox.  Also, if it's not to much to ask maybe a tad more complexity be invested in the space stations.  It's not a game breaker like some whiners say, but I can see where a little more polishing could help.  Frankly, I'm in and out of stations in the blink of an eye so I don't mind copied and pasted stations.  I'm more eager to get back out there and destroy something!Space Truckin' On    8 of 10			"

												Rebel Galaxy goes for the western in space vibe, and it succeeds at it. The soundtrack and characters definitely feel reminescent of Firefly. One thing I particularly enjoy is that the game puts you in control of massive capital ships instead of tiny fighters like most games. You start off with a smallish cruiser, but can work your way up to massive dreadnaught vessels that feel great to pilot.The story is nothing special, but I enjoyed it. The side quests can get repetitive, but if you don't mind a bit of grinding then you probably won't get bored of it. I enjoyed the combat, so the side quests remained engaging to me.The combat is quite simplistic for a combat game, but enjoyable never-the-less. It's inspired by naval combat, and takes place on a 2d plane. Every capital ship has an assortment of broadside cannons and turrets. You're turrets are enough to take out most smaller vessels, but for other capital ships you'll want to get along side of them and use your broadsides. There are a ton of different ships, items and upgrades to unlock. There is also a good variety of side grades, allowing you to pick a unique playstyle. As for actual in game activities, there are story missions, delivery runs, dead drops, trading, mining, bounty hunting, and various other mission types.Highly recommend if you're a fan of scifi/space combat games. It's more of an arcade game then a sim, and you can only fly on a 2d plane though. "

												So far, i have a really good feeling about this game.Somewhere between an arcade shoot em up and a space sim, i just love the space western cowboy touch. It reminds me of Starcraft and Firefly. Now, i found the music excellent, kinda stoner rock close to QOTSA. Though with a few hours of play, the music gets repetitive so i put it down to 4%.The gameplay is ok, you fight horizonnally so you can't pitch and roll, not like a real dogfight anyway. Broadside weapons, laser beams, mines, flak canons, if you've watched Harlock or Yamato anime you'll understand what it's about =). While you choose one set of weaponry, the others will be auto attacking, i personnally prefer using only turrets with shieldbursters. It gets really strategic at some point, because going melee won't work all the time. You have port, starboard, front and rear shields and hull, so go for a mindful plan of action. You have boosters and speed control for a reason. Also i love those warp animations !You can also mine, trade, hack things ... It's not as complete as Elite Dangerous but it's totally ok for me. This arcade game won't consume your entire life.			"

												I have played through twice now and am certain I will again and am hoping for an expansion/DLC.  The combat runs smooth and is very fun and great to watch.  One of the nicest things about this game is the music, and even if it's not your favorite - you can setup to play whatever tracks (.mp3 for example) you have of your own!The galaxy is ""procedural"" so that it looks a little different in how the planets and systems connect to each other, however the main story line is the same.  Player choices make slight differences as you go, however there are no major plot twists or endings.For me, this was a great thing to sit down to after a stressful day at work, listen to great music while blowing things up in space.

												A good Space RPG though a bit grindy. The game looks pretty good on the graphics side and the music fits the game pretty well. The game is kind of like a simplistic version of Elite Dangerous in a lot of ways minus the size and RG has a story/ The story is a bit short and just ok. Like i said in the first sentence its very grindy. You will spend a lot of time doing side missions for cash to upgrade your ship or buy a new one. Which the game has a nice selection of ships and wepons and other gear you can equip. The SHip to Ship battles are a lot of fun and you can get in to some insane battles with tons of ships all around you. there is a Nice feeling though once you get that Dreadnoaght and have it geared the hell up and you mow them down like insects. It would have been nice if you could have built up a fleet of 5 or more ships to command. You can hire one back up ship to help you. Though having a fleet of dreadnoaghts rolling with you would have been sweet. Its not a complex space game if your looking for some thing more sim like say the X games or Elite Dangerous but its a fun game and worth the $20 asking price. there is a good amount of content in the game .

I couldn;t really get into any of the X3 games, Elite Dangerous seems not for me, but this one... this one is something else. It is definitely not as complex as X games which is fine for me. I can fly around, trade, do some missions, shoot some space pirates - what else one needs after a long day.Definitely a recommendation.			"

												This game is giving me everything I WANTED from Star Citizen.Heading into an iceteroid (ice asteroid) field at high speed, drop out, surrounded by Double Jack a-holes, with my Trigun soundtrack blazing (it lets you add your own music to  the already excellent soundtrack).  Take out a few small fry, then scream around a giant iceteroid to sneak up on the big gunship, unleash a swarm of missiles in its face, then a couple broadsides and it explodes, taking out the iceteroid with it. My wingman helps clean up the trash.It's 'only' 2D, with 3D graphics, but it works really hard to make you feel so f#@$ing epic.Remember those old Ambrosia games like Escape Velocity (and of course Star Control)? It’s like that except 3d engine and you’re right down behind the ship and that makes things a lot more badass.			"

												As I look back fondly at Freelancer and how I could spend nights hunting pirates and trading illegal goods in the edges of the galaxy, I noticed Rebel Galaxy hit steam and thought, wonder if this is going to be one of those “trying to hard” games or actually good.Well it’s actually good.Now I’m not going to call it a masterpiece, but I will say it is very entertaining in this day and age where everyone is trying to do something new and innovative. I suppose the kinda new thing is how the combat works, closest example is probably world of warships, but in space and even that comparison is not giving it justice.--Movement and Combat.--The ship that you pilot is on a horizontal axis so you can only move back, forwards and sideways, this makes it easier to pilot the ship and aim your guns to your target. Targeting is automatic in a sense that the target you are directly aiming at is your primary target.The ships you pilot have broadside ports on both sides of the ship and the number of them varies on the ship you pilot, The Broadside is your primary weapon as you can’t set it to automatically fire.Your ship also has turret spots, however your turrets can be set to automatically fire at set targets and you can choose the primary target for each individual turret. You also have access to a secondary armament slot that can be outfitted with different armaments ranging from flak fighter/rocket countermeasures to mines and missiles.--Ships and components.--As you would imagine, you can buy and outfit a wide array of different ships, each with their own unique specialities. This also means some ships are more heavily armored than others, or boast more potential firepower.Most things on the ships can be upgraded to a better variant, like more armor plating, better shields, thrusters, engines, bigger cargo hold and so on, you get the general idea.--Stations and trading.--Each solar system that you can enter and explore has stations and these stations, mostly, can be used as a hub to repair, refill and outfit your ship to your liking. However, that is not all you can do. You can visit the bar to get the latest news from the news board that gives you an idea what is going on in your solar system, this is an ever changing system, some stations might have a tech boom that bumps up the price of technological trade goods, making it more lucrative for traders to sell their goods to that particular station, this mostly means you.You can also pick up different missions from the mission board, that all range from, go and kill this dood, defend this dood from being killed by this dood, pick up this thing that this dood lost and so on, you get the general idea.As you would imagine, one of the easiest ways to earn money is to work the market. Buy a bulk of trade goods for cheap from a back end station and take it to a prime trade port to get the most out of your goods, rinse and repeat.I remember making convoluted trade routes in Freelancer to earn millions in a few hours simply by working the market, flying from system to system, buy goods that are cheap in that system, fly to the nearest highest bidder and sell the goods and repeat the same thing. I can imagine this tactic would work here and even slightly better because of the ability to steer your ship during warp.Like I mentioned earlier, stations are not solely for trading however. Some stations are designated as guild bases, like for example the first system you start in houses a merchants guild that offers unique ships and components unique to that faction.--Interaction.--What I mean with interaction is just the general interaction with other pilots that you come across while flying around in space. Your choices matter, not much, but they matter. The same goes for your story missions, like for example, one mission in the beginning you have the chance to bribe a pirate to make themselves disappear or just kill him like you’re asked to. These sorta decisions keep popping up all along your adventures and even in random encounters while exploring, like for example, you just saved a trader from pirates and scanned his cargo hold to find some very expensive materials, do you kill the guy or let him go?--Verdict.--I would imagine that Rebel Galaxy is very good for what it is trying to do, it’s deep enough to keep people of different moralities happy. Sure it’s not the most beautiful looking game out there, but it’s not a game you want to put a paper bag over either. Combat is nice and simple and offers variety of what weapons you can and want to use, same goes for ships and other components. For people looking for a slightly more casual space sim, Rebel Galaxy is your game.And let’s not forget the bloody music, oh my gawd the music. So Firefly, So Firefly.

												Competent mix of Freelancer, Elite & co for the setting, AC:Black Flag for the broadside naval combat (in space!), and Sid Meier's Pirates for the scummy yet light hearted mood of the world and storyline.Very easy to get into, no complex controls or pages over pages of keybinds - just a controller works awesomely.Those of you who love the complexity in 6DOF games like Wing Commander or, more recently, Elite Dangerous, might find the restriction to plane space (2DOF) frustrating though - I did too at first, but its a different kind of game, suited for a different set of mechanics.Love it.

												To get it out of the way, this is a great game. It is not without its problems but at its core it is, as I said, a great game.So, what makes this game great?- Great soundtrack- Great combat- Great universe- Do what you feel like. Trade, be a merc, go bountyhunting etc etc. - Big galaxyNow, with that said there are some things you should know. First, this game is played on a 2d plane. Imagine it like a naval game and you are not far off. You broadside enemies and there is no moving up or down, just forwards, backwards and to the sides. This has turned into a big issue for people who bought the game and expected Elite Dangerous, so consider this a heads up. (How in the world you can buy a game ""in the dark"" today what with Lets Plays and beta reviews being everywhere is beyond me). Secondly, the game has its issues, escort missions for example are horrible due to very odd pathfinding. The friendly AI tends to get itself killed more often than not. Finally its quite easy to break the game early on. There is nothing stoping you from (ones you buy the jump drive) to trade around in the starting system, get a lot of money and then jumping to a late game systemto buy the best weapons, ships, mercs etc. Anyway, if you like Firefly, Star Wars and games like Freelancer and Elite Dangerous be sure to check this game out!

												Great game. Reminiscent of Starfleet Command (for space & combat mechanics) with a dash of Freelancer thrown in (for trading and reputation mechanics), but with more fast-paced action and fluid gameplay than the first.Highly recommended for those on the fence, with two caveats - one, like the vast majority of sandbox games, it can get grindy. Two, don't expect much in the way of meaningful dialogue choices - there aren't as many of them as trailers suggest. That said, boy is it a fun ""grind"" and has yet to get old after 10 hours of gameplay for me - that's well worth those 4 lattes.""Negotiated"" with pirates, militia, aliens, and people who look at me funny. Would ""negotiate"" again.			"

												If your a fan of the t.v series ""Firefly"", you will adore this game. Space meets the wild west of america. You can pretty much play however you want to really, either as a pirate, a merc, a bounty hunter, a trader, a do-gooder, a member of the system milita or anything else that comes to mind. Factions are present in the game and you can change your relations with the vast amount of them. The milita, citizens, red devil cartel and others are the major ""players"". There is a lot of replay-ability in this game and each playthrough offers a lot to do. Any valuable free time?, prepare for it to simply cease existing.There are quite the variety of ships to choose form each with their own playstyle and role in combat, ranging from corvettes to huge dreadnaughts bristling with firepower. Also, RAMMING SPEED! is completley viable when you get the right deflector shield. >:DIn terms of preformance, the game is pretty well optimized and I havent experienced any FPS drops nor crashes or glitches in the game so far. The only real issue is with the set up for the graphics being done out side of the game before launch. Other than that the game has rebindable keys for those wanting to change their keyboard set up and is also usable with a game pad as well.Finally lets get some of the ""meh"" points out of the way: 1) such as only being a 2D plain which really isnt to much of a problem (unless your a 3D space I WANNA GO EVERYWHERE fanatic) but a 3D plain would be nice but the game still works great with just 2D, and 2) being only a singleplayer experience which is great but the concept of playing with friends in co-op or being in a large server with many others effecting the world of rebel galaxy together. The possabilites are pretty big. Think player made factions and guilds fighting wars for resources or player made pirate groups raiding player escorted relief convoys that will effect economys in the game and the major factions relations and standing in the world.Overall I would very much recomend this game to anybody who is a fan of si-fi and or western drama with its beautiful world and fun gameplay with a large choice of options and intense ship on ship combat.I hope to see you all out there in this mad galaxy my fellow starship captains! for profit! for reputation! and for being the greatest badasses that this galaxy's ever seen!

												You are a young budding pilot who recieved a cryptic message from your Aunt Juno, leading you to strike out and find her. Find her you do, and along the way you will mine asteroids, scavenge wreckages, deal with aliens and battle space pirates. Are you a do-gooder? A shifty privateer? Perhaps a crafty space trader? I'll bet you land somewhere in between.It is easy to see how you could play this game again and again. You are given the option to comply, bribe or even double-cross agents, regardless of their faction. You have the ability to be a good guy, or a despicably seedy character, like you see in so many sci-fi stories. Perhaps you want to replay it and see how quickly you can get through it. Others may want to amass the greatest weapons available, and go pick on squadrons of smaller fighters. There are several reasons you could find yourself coming back to Rebel Galaxy.Check out my full review @ Brutalgamer.com: http://brutalgamer.com/2015/10/17/rebel-galaxy-pc-review/ "

												Early review. its not actually a bad game, haven't found anything wrong in my opinion it is a great game.. when it comes to space games it can be a hit or a miss. which we all know. and this hits right on the bullseye-_- in my opinion. anyways it a great space game for people that want a little bit more ease when it comes to maneuvering in space.. here its like forward, left and right, and your good. and the weapon system is quite enjoyable its nice to command any gun i want. think of the combat style as a battleship and will be firing on your broadside alot, while having the smaller turrets on the top and bottom taking care of the smaller to hit ships which help alot, but if you want to, you can manually use them yourself. and theirs different factions to go towards to get different quests, different outcomes and ships....YES. so its good to know that once i played it through one time, i can do it all over again, but going to do something different. graphics are really good, the music in the background remind me of Cowboy Bebop which is pretty awesome and the combat is so engaging and fun and easy to learn that no one should have any difficults with. so in this case for this game being only $20 and on sale for $18 is a must buy product, and you will do alot of missions, before the 2 hour mark. so have fun within the two hours then return. or keep it..... its up to you.10/10 would warp speed into a fleet of pirate missile ships and die:(, Again..

												This is easily the most addicting game I have played in a long time.  Wide variety of ships and equipment, both offensive and defensive, each with it's own pros and cons, and great music library.  Speaking of which, if you want to listen to your own tunes... you can.  When you launch the game, you can have the game look in certain folders fo combat, ambient, in-station and menu music, with another option to mix your selections in with the default music library.  This is the first game I've seen that allows you to do this.Anyway, that's enough typing, gotta get back in the game :)			"

												This game was sold to me as Firefly/Serenity the game but a more accurate description would be Sid Meier's Pirates in Space complete with trading, factions and pirate lords. The soundtrack as well as the eccentric characters you come across made me realise why people were calling it Firefly the Game but that's about it. Only a few hours in and it seems to hold up quite well although, I would like some more customisation options for my ship instead of just the weaponry. Overall a great indie space title and definitely worth the purchase.			"

												8.5/10 - Great game to have specially with any discount.A fun game, little bugs still (mostly pair warp issues), but mostly a reliable game.It is impossible not to compare to one of my favorite games all time ""Freelancer"", but i will try to keep it as independent as possible.The battle system I think was supposed to be simpler than Freelancer one but in my opinion failed in the fun aspect, i have 20h played so far and only had battles in full turret mode.The ""2D"" maps make the universe simpler but in my opinion it is a little weird to think that 100 planets in 10 systems are all in the same surface.Big sized map that could easily increase by adding more jumpgates.Many guns and ships options too.Some must have improvements for further patches:1. Auto-move implemented (and please make the pair warp faster, 2 min for a ship to stand aside another is unbearable).2. A ""rear gear"", sometimes would be very useful and i don't think it would cause any trouble.3. A better ""Esc"" menu, one that is easier to check any aspect without having to go trough every other item.			"

												I like it.The 2D thing doesn't bother me.  When playing games like Starpoint Gemini 2 I generally had my ship operate on autopilot anyway and used the mouse to look around to shoot things.It is MORE of the same with this game doing that so it's not a big deal.  In fact I think it is less demanding on my computer than SG2 was without the true 3D, and yet it retains some of that 3D immersion with the enemy fighters still flying about in 3D while the capital ships square off.I like the Firefly/Serenity idea with a strong western vibe yet space, a sort of frontier thing now where aliens and robots are plentiful.  The mystery is cool too.  I like how the conversations flow and have a humerous touch. "

												I just beat this after mainlining the last half of the story. It was very hard since my ship fell behind in upgrades and required some pretty fancy flying. I would say a more resonable completion time would be around 30 hours.This isn't an immersive space sim, it's more of an arcadey game than that, but I had a wonderful time and plan on going back in and playing another character. Graphics, music, and the flight model are all great. 2D flying really was the right decision here. The only complaint I have is the lack of variety of non-story quests, but there's enough to do out there to last 20-30 hours for sure.Well worth the price paid. I found it more entertaining than the recent releases in the Elite or X series. "

												So, this game is awesome. A really well made title, the graphics are bright, colourful and convey the lay of the land easily. At no point have I felt confused by an overcluttered UI, or even a lack of a helpful one, the UI is designed *just* right as it conveys what you need to know and what is useful to know without hiding important information.The ship design, while by no stretch unique, is striking and follows easily identifiable paradigms, no matter the faction A Frigate is A Frigate is A Frigate, so to speak, which allows for easy identification of targets and thus target priority.Weapons are cool, different types are covered; Projectile, Laser, Pulse, Missle, Flak, EMP, Mines, any combination of them is allowed AND the controls for them are simple (certainly on a controller, which I would recommend.)Overall I've found, so far, that this is a solid game with a nice twist on the Space Sim genre, no longer controlling the fighters and the one man craft, this is the big leagues! Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Haulers, Dreadnaughts, Battleships, Cruisers.My only complaint is the lack of a player based Z-axis, so while the enemy craft and allied ones) dance around you, up and down, you are stuck on the planetary plane, but honestly there could be much worse faults!

												Excellent space sim!  Reminds me of Privateer but completely redone and updated.  Robust commodity market, diverse ships, and many factions to interact with.  And honestly, after thinking about it, the lack of 3D movement is not a drawback at all.  In most other space sims most people stay in the ecliptic anyway as there is nothing to see or do out of the eclipitic.  A good idea to keep people where the action is - why complicate matters?  Did I mention - it has wingman that don't die instantly and stupidly?  Best space sim in many years!  :)			"

												My only regret is that i played this game trough too fast. Story is decent and the game mechanics are fun, if you are ok with two dimension navy space ships. Voice acting is little awkward at times which makes it quite endearing in my opinion (tired of reading 10 pages of quest text? anyone!?) and it's nice change from constant reading (what happened to VOs??? Devs do it more!+++). Finnish alien language sounds too hilarious so +.+ Solid mechanics (turret mode could be better if you like to manually use them)+ Very good music.+ Voice-overs (yes, in my books this is huge plus)+ Some randomness to each playtrough (sector map is random dunno what else)- 'E' does everything, and i mean everything, and it constantly tries to do the wrong thing, ""warp away, mmmnope, have a orion slave girl that was floating in space for no apparent reason""- Too fev music tracks (after 40 hours it gets repetitive).- No highspeed collision damage (sublights full to a meteor? Don't worry we have your back with our military grade undestructeablemonumnumnum)- Boring last boss (i literally just stood still in my speedyspeedycorvette, and shot him full of holes)- Could use a co-op for a friend, mercenaries suck :D I hope they expand on how each playtrough is unique, like more trell passive skill choises, which have direct effect on how you build your ship. more weapons, ships, modules, more everything.This was the first game in a long time, i didn't have to grit my teeth just to play it trough, and after the main story, it left me wanting for more, so here's hoping for more content!Random thought during playtrough ""if this game and eve online had a baby, i wouldn't stop playing it, even if i would starve"" scary...

												Great Game! It's sort of like mixing some of the gameplay of Freelancer with the asthetic of Firefly. It's also a bit reminiscent of the ship to ship combat in Black Flag. This is not a very complex game. It seems to favor simplicity over complexity vs other space games, and focuses on providing alot of fun action that's easy to get into. Similar to other space games, it provides the ability to trade, mine, and salvage (sort of). To me, however, the most fun in this game can be had bounty hunting and doing randomly generated missions, both of which get me into a combat. For context, I usually end up trading or mining in other space games because I usually don't care for the combat. The game provides alot of carrots to chase through ships and equipment upgrades. The story aspect of the game is serviceable but nothing too deep. Personally, I'm kinda ok with that. Another nice plus is the price.It never ceases to put a smile on my face every time I play.			"

												do i use the refund for this game?NOI played this game for a little 1h+ and i like it. These are just my first impression--- NEGATIVE* The only disappointment for now is the realization that you are not able move your ship in 3D space. The similarity to ships on water is not just for the fighting, but also for the movement in space.    You are not able to move your ship up and down. Which is ok, if you get over the initial disappointment if you were expecting otherwise+++ POSITIVE* freelancer / cowboy bebop vibe* soundtrack (dunno yet if it gets too repetitive ) * you can upgrade weapons / buy new ships , to get more bad♥♥♥♥♥br>* fun "

												After two hours, first impressions are everything and this is very polished for an Indie... In my opinion this is the closest, so far, to Privateer. Bearing in mind I have just started to play it, not very far through but so far it's blowing my mind. What set's it apart from the X games , and what i missed most about privateer, is the whole landing on the station/planet interacting with the bar/shipdealer etc. Combat is pretty fun , the sound track is brilliant, it fits the game so well. I would say if you like Privateer, get this, if you liked the X games with the intense trading and diplomacy etc, might be a little too simplified for you. All in all, for the price this is a bargain. Hope these guys do a squel or similar and spend a bit more cash because this has so much potential. The only thing that may be a downside, is that space is not a 2D landscape, except in this game. Minor gripe , and I can see why the did it with respect to the combat style of the game. Love the whole broadside thing, like oldschool naval ships giving it to each other. Graphics are good without blowing your mind (on ultra), sound is pretty good. Did I mention it was the closest to Privateer that i had played in a long time.... Loved that damn game....			"

												I'd say this one delivers the bang for the buck. The random maps and some other things make me think there is probably some good replayability, but I'm thinking even if I just finish a single play through I'll get more than my money's worth.Great production values for a $20 game. The voice work really adds a lot to the game to make it feel alive. There's more depth in just about everything than I expected. Except the actual flight... it is 2d. But that's just fine by me and it may even work to the game's advantage. The broadside naval-style combat works and seems pretty good.I haven't noticed any technical issues in the two hours I spent with it so far. Seems like it might be bigger/longer than I expected. I'm not out of the first system after two hours and I think there were around 10 systems when I looked at the map. I haven't kept the pedal to the metal for progressing the story but I haven't screwed around a ton either. I also see very expensive things to buy I won't be able to afford for quite a bit longer without major windfallsTravel can seem a bit slow, but I have yet to play any space game where more time than I liked wasn't spent just getting where I want to go and it isn't very bad here.The bit of the story I've seen so far is decent. 8/10 - Only because I haven't played enough to *know* it doesn't have any major shortcomings.

												Best space\space ship simulation game to come out in a long time! Reminds me of Freelancer with the look and feel and the combat is fresh and AWESOME!! Still learning the game but the developers REALLY put a lot of thought and heart into this game. First purchase I have been excited about in years!!The combat is VERY different than any other space game I have played. Different from ANY other game where you control a craft that fires projectiles except maybe an age of sail game! It is broadsided firing mixed with controlable turrets mixed with system components, like the deflector which absorbs incoming damage on activation, and a bunch of other features. You have to actually ENGAGE in combat, even more so than a typical arcade shooter system!! Its intense and the feeling of popping another ship, even a fighter, is satisfying!!The other features of the game are astounding so far. HUGE systems to explore, random encounters, the feeling of actually EXPLORING space! I cannot wait to get home tomorrow so I can get back into this gem!!Thank you Double Damage, for making a game that takes traits of previous great games, improving upon them and adding a TON of more great stuff to it!! I would have paid $60 for this game and $20 is a STEAL!!			"

												This game is AMAZING! It's a space-faring game that incorporates space piracy, shady dealers, and mercenaries, which gives it a wild west feel. The graphics are gorgeous at the lowest settings, and the soundtrack adds a sense of adventure. The game does away with third dimension travel, which lessens the complexity and doesn't hurt the game at all. The combat is naval style, meaning your main weapon is your broadsides. This is really difficult to master but its super fun. I would recommend this game for anyone with a mild interest in pirates, or anyone who likes to be evil/troublemaking, because in this game you can become enemies with anyone. You can shoot down trade vessels and steal the cargo, or recieve distress calls and destroy pirates. Or both. The only people I wouldn't recommend this game to are players looking for a deep, complex space sim, because that is the one thing this game isn't.			"

												Very Firefly vibe - what's not to love about this?!While there are some buggy AI behaviors, overall the game feels very well polished. I was very skeptical of the 2D-plane in space mechanics, but it works very well. While I have not played A.C. Black Flag - I can completely understand what other players reference with the Broadside combat mechanic. I fought them at first, but it is - in a sense - what the combat is built around and quickly learned to embrace the combat style (and learned to love it).If you are looking for a solid game with some openness to it - pick up Rebel Galaxy. You know, until that other space-exploration game comes out --- what's it called... No Man's Sky? Will be a great time-killer, but will also likely want to come back for more after the initial play through.			"

												Great 'beer and pretzels' single player starship game.  If you want something fun, without a zillion buttons to press, and challenging, this is it.Except...the game can lock up your rig; and, game saving is done automatically by overwrite...you get 1 dynamic save per 'character', so it reverts your pc to the status of a console.  On top of that, your save files can be corrupted, and they can disappear...I lost 33 hours of play through losing a save file, and had to restart.Edit/update:After several further restarts, and freezes resulting in the game not recognising the save file (sometimes they disappear, some times the game just doesn't recognise they exist), I gave up and went off to play something else.I still think it's a good game, just that the save system and its' bugs killed it for me.

												This game is better then Eve online.  1) I don't have to deal with real players that have been playing soooo long that your toast before you set foot into 1 ship.2) I like the fact that it's a single player game and it allows me to progress at my own pace.3) I can finally afford time to play the game and buy a dreadnought in a month vs eve online 6 months to get in and 1 year for max skills. for that ship.4) I don't have to worry about replacing a ship after I get destroyed,.  This game is like the old privateer but better.  I Played privateer years ago and my only thing I wanted is to buy a bigger ship in that game and continue playing with better weapons.  This games offers that.  Even tho once I max out, I will have an issue with what ship to use.  I am hoping that even at end game that mk 7 weapons drops out in space or found in distance part of the galaxy while scanning or flying around out in untravel areas of the star system.  We shall see.One last thing, my thanks to the game makers for not removing game play from youtube.  Without watching those game play, I would not have gotten this game at all because of the uncertanity of what this game is about.  Trailers are good, but watching gameplay is better.  In addition, please allow the sites to play the music.  You may find having other players show a game play of your game may bring in more buyers.  I did and I like the way it played so I bought it.I did get blown up a few times but I was able to start up where I left off from the stations.  Kudos thanks.  At least I do not have to start all over again or that far back.  I am very happy about that.  I did learn from it. I do have a request if your reading this,  Can we get a trade computer.  If its already there then I must of missed it.I hope to see future expansion of this game further into the galaxy.   If you need help with idea, just ask the community.  We have plenty of idea.  I even have a nasty idea in fighting around a black hole...			"

If it was based in minutes it would be better and with a buyable component that would let you see the prices all the time. the only thing i would add is a way of sending people over to another ship in battle to take it over much like nexus the jupiter incident . all in all tho its a great looking game that is totally worth the money and i will be playing it for some time.

												What a great game! I really found it quite addictive even though its a little repetitive, there is nothing like getting the biggest guns you can and annihalating every enemy on the map. Word of advice though, I found it much more challenging to stick with a corvette ship (the faster the better) and complete the full storyline in that. When you get to the end of the story you should have it pretty much fully kitted out and as the kit you buy stays with you when you swap ships the hard work will have been done. I then amassed some cash and got the largest ship I could just to have some fun and see what trouble I could get myself into.(The main reason for doing this: when you get the really large ships they are really OP which in my opinion takes a bit of fun out of the main storyline).Again the game is well worth the money, its very easy to play, really good fun and you get many hours of enjoyment from it. I'm looking forward to any expansions these guys may bring out too.Have fun!			"

												So, this game is awesome. A really well made title, the graphics are bright, colourful and convey the lay of the land easily. At no point have I felt confused by an overcluttered UI, or even a lack of a helpful one, the UI is designed *just* right as it conveys what you need to know and what is useful to know without hiding important information.The ship design, while by no stretch unique, is striking and follows easily identifiable paradigms, no matter the faction A Frigate is A Frigate is A Frigate, so to speak, which allows for easy identification of targets and thus target priority.Weapons are cool, different types are covered; Projectile, Laser, Pulse, Missle, Flak, EMP, Mines, any combination of them is allowed AND the controls for them are simple (certainly on a controller, which I would recommend.)Overall I've found, so far, that this is a solid game with a nice twist on the Space Sim genre, no longer controlling the fighters and the one man craft, this is the big leagues! Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Haulers, Dreadnaughts, Battleships, Cruisers.My only complaint is the lack of a player based Z-axis, so while the enemy craft and allied ones) dance around you, up and down, you are stuck on the planetary plane, but honestly there could be much worse faults!

												My only regret is that i played this game trough too fast. Story is decent and the game mechanics are fun, if you are ok with two dimension navy space ships. Voice acting is little awkward at times which makes it quite endearing in my opinion (tired of reading 10 pages of quest text? anyone!?) and it's nice change from constant reading (what happened to VOs??? Devs do it more!+++). Finnish alien language sounds too hilarious so +.+ Solid mechanics (turret mode could be better if you like to manually use them)+ Very good music.+ Voice-overs (yes, in my books this is huge plus)+ Some randomness to each playtrough (sector map is random dunno what else)- 'E' does everything, and i mean everything, and it constantly tries to do the wrong thing, ""warp away, mmmnope, have a orion slave girl that was floating in space for no apparent reason""- Too fev music tracks (after 40 hours it gets repetitive).- No highspeed collision damage (sublights full to a meteor? Don't worry we have your back with our military grade undestructeablemonumnumnum)- Boring last boss (i literally just stood still in my speedyspeedycorvette, and shot him full of holes)- Could use a co-op for a friend, mercenaries suck :D I hope they expand on how each playtrough is unique, like more trell passive skill choises, which have direct effect on how you build your ship. more weapons, ships, modules, more everything.This was the first game in a long time, i didn't have to grit my teeth just to play it trough, and after the main story, it left me wanting for more, so here's hoping for more content!Random thought during playtrough ""if this game and eve online had a baby, i wouldn't stop playing it, even if i would starve"" scary...

												Great Game! It's sort of like mixing some of the gameplay of Freelancer with the asthetic of Firefly. It's also a bit reminiscent of the ship to ship combat in Black Flag. This is not a very complex game. It seems to favor simplicity over complexity vs other space games, and focuses on providing alot of fun action that's easy to get into. Similar to other space games, it provides the ability to trade, mine, and salvage (sort of). To me, however, the most fun in this game can be had bounty hunting and doing randomly generated missions, both of which get me into a combat. For context, I usually end up trading or mining in other space games because I usually don't care for the combat. The game provides alot of carrots to chase through ships and equipment upgrades. The story aspect of the game is serviceable but nothing too deep. Personally, I'm kinda ok with that. Another nice plus is the price.It never ceases to put a smile on my face every time I play.			"

												Excellent space sim!  Reminds me of Privateer but completely redone and updated.  Robust commodity market, diverse ships, and many factions to interact with.  And honestly, after thinking about it, the lack of 3D movement is not a drawback at all.  In most other space sims most people stay in the ecliptic anyway as there is nothing to see or do out of the eclipitic.  A good idea to keep people where the action is - why complicate matters?  Did I mention - it has wingman that don't die instantly and stupidly?  Best space sim in many years!  :)			"

												I just beat this after mainlining the last half of the story. It was very hard since my ship fell behind in upgrades and required some pretty fancy flying. I would say a more resonable completion time would be around 30 hours.This isn't an immersive space sim, it's more of an arcadey game than that, but I had a wonderful time and plan on going back in and playing another character. Graphics, music, and the flight model are all great. 2D flying really was the right decision here. The only complaint I have is the lack of variety of non-story quests, but there's enough to do out there to last 20-30 hours for sure.Well worth the price paid. I found it more entertaining than the recent releases in the Elite or X series. "

												This game is amazing.I've been waiting for a game like this for a while now. I thought Elite:Dangerous was the best that I could get, but I was wrong. It's a shame that there aren't more quality entries in this genre.First things first, make no mistakes: this is a game about you being the captain of an old wooden tallship as a merchant/privateer/pirate/whatever you want to be. Except with all of the boring parts of that cut out; your tallship is a spaceship because if this wasn't a space game you'd be sailing along at 7-8 knots (which would be SO boring) so instead you get to warp everywhere because space.Some people are complaining about this being limited to left/right forward/backward movement; these people do not realize that this is a game about boats. Space boats. So grab some alcohol and your xbox controller and go be a galactic naval badass.Highly recommended - one of the best games I've played in a while. Strikes the perfect balance in space-boat simulation.(Fun fact: do you know why ships in sci-fi always meet face-to-face? Because if one if pointing straight-up and tilted 37 degrees it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. I didn't realize it until now, but 2 dimensions is all you really need in a space game. And honestly, the enemies and such go up and down above/below you so it's not like the game is on a grid or anything. It is done really well.)			"

												Hello SteamersAfter giving the storyline a fast once through i decided to give my review of Rebel Galaxy.  First off great work to the creators of this little fantastic space game.  Finally these guys had the balls enough to put Rock Music in a Space Game and it really ramps up the excitement , I got all the dust cleaned out of my Bose speakers on this game and nothing but a big smile on my face when the explosions started from my missles  firing out the sides of my ship.  Sure there are some things that an older player might sqeem at as far as the cartoonie characters you meet but it's not a far trade off from Jaba.  The ships are superb in design and id have to say they look better than a few of the top rated space sim games on the market.  They give you plenty of mounting options for Lasers,Rockets,Missles,Mines and Mining Lasers that can be used for fighting aswell. There is a Storyline to the game and it's good...... I'm glad there is a storyline here some of the bigger space sims decided to leave out storylines and there games feel like there is somthing always missing even in the missions they have.  Rebel Galaxy seems to understand this and always has some npc in the game coming on screen to talk to you about your next mission or a character trying to make a deal with you.  You are not alone in rebel space there is always someone around to greet you rather if it's good or bad.  This i'm sure is a trail space game by Double Damage to see how it does and all i can say is please give us more we like it.  Well i do any way, this is a great space game to play for a few months and you can't beat the price.  score 86/100			"

												Its Firefly meets Cowboy Bebop meets Battlestar Galactica. Rebel Galaxy is a good-looking and fun space action game with a kickass soundtrack. It plays more of an arcade game rather than a space sim so for those looking for the latter might want to look somewhere else. What this game has is a procedurally-generated, sandbox solar systems set on a 2D plane where the player can explore right from the start.For starters, the player's ship can't roll, pitch, or yaw (sorry, no Crazy Ivan manuevers here) - only forward movement, and left/right turns. This is because the game’s combat is designed around the broadside naval engagements similar to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Basically, you line up your ship (think of it as a space boat) against the enemy ship for a firing solution, and then unload your armaments to see some fireworks. It might sound easy but it has its share of tactical positioning and maneuvering - each side of your ship (front, rear, port, and starboard) has a hull and shield rating. After you eat through a ship’s shield face, you start hitting its hull to do some serious damage. You can spin that damaged side out of the line of fire to regenerate your shields and retaliate or simply retreat and fight another day.The game has a decent selection of weaponry, ships, and ship upgrades. You can also choose to align with different factions but sadly, they have no personalities to speak of outside of the nicely animated talking avatars they have.There is a main quest you can follow, or ignore it and set out in any direction you want and be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, or space pirate. You can get missions from space stations that can earn you currency to buy ships/weapons/ship upgrades, as well as alignment points to factions. The said missions can get pretty repetitive after a while, but the gloriously huge space battles keep me coming back for more. Exploration in this game is fun and is rarely dull. It has the same relaxing feel as doing cross country delivery jobs in Euro Truck Simulator 2. There are asteroid fields, floating space junk from the ruins of some old battle (which may contain some sweet loot and military grade weaponry), nebulae of different swirling colors, planets, moons, and of course, stars. It will take a few minutes to fly from point A to point B, but there’s usually some unidentified signal, a distress call, or just a random fleet of space bandits to keep things interesting. The game’s soundtrack is really good. It exudes the same vibe as Firefly with its guitar heavy tracks with twangs. The devs also included the most phenomenal custom music support I have ever seen in a game. There’s nothing like Want It All Back from Cowboy Bebop kicking in as I enter combat. I have Cage the Elephant, Clutch, Johnny Cash, Darren Korb (Bastion OST), Queens of the Stone Age, Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop), Vitaminless (Cowboy Bebop), and Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica) on my custom playlist. You can sort and assign them as combat, idle, or title music. Your custom music can also be merged with the game soundtrack for more variety.I definitely recommend this game.			"

												If you loved Freelancer and have been waiting for a similar game to come out, I suggest checking this one out. The combat is great and might take some getting used to if you are used to 3D space games. The ship design is some of the best I've seen in science fiction. The galaxy is constantly evolving, making it feel like a real place and not just some static level. You also get to live out your space ship capatin fantasy, whether that involves piracy, smuggling, trading, mining, rescue, is all up to you. I can't really think of any negatives. Rebel Galaxy is a must play for any space or sci-fi enthusiast.			"

												Buy it if you like space combat simulators without the 3d flight aspect. Buy it if you like hours of game play for the 21$ price tag. Story and non linear; mesh well giving you freedom to choose what you do when you do it. Combat is fun and rewarding. There are a few draw backs but they are not even worth mentioning since they dont reduce the games playability in anyway. Good game wouldnt give it a 10/10 but 9/10 is still good enough.			"

												Amazing game. Little short as I beat the main game in about 8 hours but TONS of replayability since I basically only did story missions  back to back. Could have used a little more plot with the merchants and mercenaries guilds but hopefully they come out with some DLC. Ship equipment seemed a little scimpy compared to the 21 playable ships. Basically my only complaint is I want more.			"

Perhaps it's nostalgia since this what this game is at heart, is a gritty darker-themed, third person evolution of the Escape Velocity game series.

												8.5/10 - Great game to have specially with any discount.A fun game, little bugs still (mostly pair warp issues), but mostly a reliable game.It is impossible not to compare to one of my favorite games all time ""Freelancer"", but i will try to keep it as independent as possible.The battle system I think was supposed to be simpler than Freelancer one but in my opinion failed in the fun aspect, i have 20h played so far and only had battles in full turret mode.The ""2D"" maps make the universe simpler but in my opinion it is a little weird to think that 100 planets in 10 systems are all in the same surface.Big sized map that could easily increase by adding more jumpgates.Many guns and ships options too.Some must have improvements for further patches:1. Auto-move implemented (and please make the pair warp faster, 2 min for a ship to stand aside another is unbearable).2. A ""rear gear"", sometimes would be very useful and i don't think it would cause any trouble.3. A better ""Esc"" menu, one that is easier to check any aspect without having to go trough every other item.			"

												I came to the realization that this game isn't worth sinking hours into, after killing 3 capital only to be presented with Nuts an Bolts and Green Whiskey. I can't recommend Rebel Galaxy because it lacks mechanics. Examples: Broadside combat is lame,  it's just static turrets on the side of your ship, Wooo....fun. Even though the combat looks great it's repetitive and ships don't have critical points. No point in becoming skilled pilot because what a player can do after 500 hours of playing this game, a beginner can do the same after the tutorial. The trading mechanic are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ No economy, as the values seem to be randomly generated after some time. Since the people who made rebel galaxy also made TorchLight, I was hoping for interesting loot. But all we get is a linear upgrade system where the best weapons are plasma laser hands down and High Capacity Shields. I’m not even going to mention the story because I started skipping dialogue after meeting a gay Australian bartender.			"

												Its like assassin's creed black flag without the assassin's creed. You pilot a flagship, trade, take contracts, hunt pirates or militia or a number of other different faction, mine, and all that good space stuff. Here's the special part about Rebel galaxy, you move on an X Y axis, no up and down here. This really tightens up the game in my opinion. your ship has turrets, and broadside weaponry, which is why it is comparable to the naval combat. So if you loved the sea faring and could do without the on foot part of black flag, go ahead and grab this game, you will love it. Also the sound track is bomb as hell!			"

												This game is the sandbox space sim we've been waiting for since Freelancer. Elite: Dangerous too fiddly for you? Loved AC: Black Flag for the ship combat? Enjoyed Firefly? Tired of waiting for Star Citizen to get to a release?Then you're gonna love this game.You fly a capital ship in a somewhat open universe. Trade, pirate, privateer - the choice is yours. Fighter pilots? Pah! I fly a ship that launches broadsides, son, and obliterates your little X-wing knockoff with my Flak.The country and western soundtrack and Southern accents for some of the characters bring the Firefly references in so nicely and casually without explicitly resorting to Firefly-like dialect or setting, making it a subtle, valued tie-in.The game suffers from the procedurally generated fault of being a 'lifeless'-feeling open world. There's also some minor Quality Of Life issues with trying to be a trader - finding out (last known) prices is a bit fiddly. Free trade is also unfortunately not very lucrative, compared to the Mission Boards (which will post trade missions that ironically make FAR more than you could shipping the goods without a contract, after you've gone into the game a bit). But at least the mission boards make the Trader path remain viable along with the plainly-intended Privateer path.You also navigate and fight solely along each systems ecliptic and ignore the third dimension, to a much larger degree than Freelancer or its other wannabe successors. But let's be honest with ourselves - this genre was never about the third dimension.This game is also very well optimized for the technical side.Get this game. It's the game we've been waiting for, and it came with no fanfare.			"

												Like Space? Like Assassin's Creed style Naval Combat? Like Grungy Country Music? Then this game is a pretty good bet.The levels are procedurally generated and the visuals are fantastic, but this isn't Elite Dangerous. While set in space, the combat functions on a 2D plane, similar to naval combat. It works similar to Black Flag, with broadsides being your main form of defenceWhile set in space and with similar mechanics, this is not a space sim like Elite. Elite is a massive, slow grind, and while R.G. offers tonnes of replayability and endgame content (that I haven't gotten to yet) the game is nowhere near as big or complex as Elite. I do think the combat is more fun, but that's probably just because I'm better at it than Elite.It's definitely not going to live up to Elite, Star Citizen or even No Man's Sky in terms of scope, but it's a pleasant and worthwile investment with a fun gimmick.

												Great music! Good concept. Good graphics. Crucially flawed gameplay. The key problem is the mouse interface. Whenever you touch the mouse (I tried several), to do things like aim in a firefight, it automatically zooms in to a top down view of the ship, so you can get a closeup of your ship taking damage and do nothing useful to change things. To get the view up, you must scoot the mouse about four feet with max sensitivity to see who is attacking you and keep scooting the mouse to aim or get a glimpse of the object you're about to run into. It's basically a FPS where it defaults to looking down at your feet and you have to scoot like mad to glance at the enemies.  I can't believe they actually released a game where the mechanics of gameplay fundamentally don't work.Addendum: I'm on a Mac. The fix to the mouse control largely fixed the issue. Broadside aiming is still quite difficult because the camera still pans down automatically, although it is much, much easier to compensate for and the ship still often obscures the view of the target. I find I'm still guessing where the enemy is and firing blind, although often accurately. While clunky, it is now playable.			"

												First things first.I like this game. The pricing is fair and alright.But stop saying this is Freelancer. It is not. Star Systems and trade are a common in any space game. It has a random quest/mission system and a main story line like Freelancer and this is were they start to differ. The broad fighting system makes this a whole another experience.Another thing are the drops like shield boost you got in Freelancer. Ships in Freelancer were Dog Fighter, fast turning, front fire arc and you had to fire them manually.This game doesnt have this concept. Anyway some pros and cons:Pro:CombatGraphicMusicRandom SystemsWingman/woman/xeno/robotCon:Gameplay elements (will explain further down)2D (fully aware when buying, will explain futher down)One Button for: Docking/Warping/Looting/Acceleration (Context sensitive)So the two cons for me, which happen to drag down the fun quite a lot are this.The gameplay elements i dont like are enemies with missiles/mines/torpedes.See, you have a limited amount of them. Limited like under 24 for the first you can buy. The enemy isnt limited. They will spam this♥♥♥♥♥♥like no tomorrow. I am not exaggerating. I tested an enemy frigate, after i shot down all of the smaller fighters. Five minutes into the fight it was still spamming Hornets and Heat Seeker. The complains about 2D ties someone into gameplay. See, there are fields of debris and asteroid everywhere. The systems are rather big, but while ""warping"" (Fast Travel, has to be engaged after a build up time of 3-5sec), you will be dropped out by enemies, debris, asteroids. And because its 2D , you have to fly around them, if you want your warping. I dont mind it happening sometimes. But it gets old rather quick. Warping, dropping out, killing/avoiding stuff, build up time, warping, dropping out...you get the idea. Tl;drGood naval space game for time killing with some unlucky gameplay decisions.			"

												So this wil be the first time i will be writting a review so bear with me. The combat in thisgame is pretty good for a spacecombat game, i particularly like the fact that they try to not make it overcomplicated, Then there is just the feeeling of freedom that you get. You get to go anywhere you want at any point. The feeling of vastness of space is also beautifully achieved, without making the travel times to long. The game has a lot of ships to updrage to and a lot of upgrades for these ships. The story could be better, but that is not what this game is about anyway. The combat system is excellent. There is great music and athmosphere within the game.Now for some of the negatives, the most glaring thing that i am missing is an experience system either for the crew or the captain. This could have created another interesting dimension to the game. Also the fact that you cannot assemble a fleet isquite disapointing, (you can hire a mecenary but only one at a time). All in all this game is one of the more enjoyable games i have played lately and i would definetly recommend it for everyone.			"

												This is pretty much the space game I always wanted to play.  Not overly complicated with way too many systems to learn, just having fun flying around a beautiful galaxy, trading materials, destroying space pirates, and listening to an awesome Firely-esque soundtrack! The game takes place on a 2D plane, with an emphasis on broadside combat, but the option for other forms of attack such as turrets, lasers, mines, etc. exists.  Basically, if you've ever played Assassin's Creed IV, the game plays very similarly to the boat sailing and combat, only more responsive and more entertaining.  There are 21 ships available to purchase and fly, as well as many items for customizing them, including weapons, defense, and more!Pros:-Runs perfectly with little to no slowdown.-Beautiful graphics with plenty of options to change.-Great music, with an easy option to add your own music in a number of areas, such as battle music, ambient music, etc.-Big universe.  While not nearly as big as other space games out there, it's still plenty big.  I've played six hours so far and haven't even left the first galaxy that you start in, and there seems to be at least 10+ to explore.-Price: $18 at launch ($20 later) is a steal for this game.  It runs smoother and I haven't encountered any bugs so far, which is more than I can say for many of the AAA games that I've payed $60 for recently.-Most importantly: FUN! Cons: -One of the only cons I would say is that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of a damage model for ships.  If you ship is severely damaged, you may see a few minor explosions and fire going on around it, but you aren't missing any chunks of your ship or anything like that.  Pretty minor in the long run when compared with all the pros.-Possible con is that many of the side missions are similar, so you could get burned out after a while.  The positive is that you can do the story missions which offer a bit more variety, or take a break and play something else for a while!-Not really a con, but you can only save when you dock at a space station, which can be a bit annoying if you need to leave suddenly, but there are plenty of space stations, usually less than a minute away, and the game offers an easy option to find the nearest space station.Overall, if you're looking for a fun game with a cheap price, look no further than Rebel Galaxy.

												I must say I am a bit surprised i'm giving this game a go. I found myself at the 30min mark having a bit of fun then stopped to play something else. Come back to it now at the 1hr mark and I realize something.....this game seems to be getting a bit tedious. I stop again to resume another game and come back later. Looking at the Rebel desktop icon I come to the realization that even at this early of a start I can already see how this game will get boring quickly. Without even feeling bored I can already see it coming. I pause and think and decide to give it the ol college try and make it past and still nope. Combat was ""eh"", mining I swear was going nowhere (and still don't care for it), trading wasn't a very good option since at the start if you so much as pebble your mighty ship was full in an instant and it all seemed so....not that epic? can't think of a good word. Literally came up on the 2hr mark and the time to decide if it refund or keep. I literally stopped playing for a day and pondered it because the game seemed like it had things going for it. Was absolutely lovely once I got the graphics settings right (gave a different resolution for some reason), combat was simple but effective, everything was flashy, the music and sounds were nice but it just didn't click. But I decided to take the leap and just go with it, and I don't regret it. I believe it was completely my thinking of the game. It's a relatively small download seeming more arcady and simple then anything so maybe I came in with a ""rush, rush, faster"" mindset. Once I put that aside (and a bit bored) I just pushed through and the game opened up for me. Combat although really simple can be as deep or remain as simple as you want it. With ships having multiple turrets areas it's completely possible to play it smart or just brute force a lot of things.  Set some of the turrets for specific enemies or bigger ship armaments with targeting priorities. Play the smart way with shield specific turrets to take down protection then batter them down with the heavy guns. Get extra protection with deflector shields and anti missile armaments because lord knows there will be lots of missiles being shot at you. Outmaneuver enemies and separate them for easy pickings. OR do like me and just go in guns & lasers blazing allowing anything to target anything in a blaze of bullets, lasers, explosions while taking control of certain ones when needed. Now this may all seem glorious and may be revving your engines and fingers to buy but as I said before, combat can be as simple or deep as you want. There's mining but I mean it's mining so it's not rocket science. Although there are ways to help produce better results but I have personally not dipped too much into it. I will say blowing up space rocks is flashy and hasn't gotten old yet though. Trading is simple and straight forward, buy low sell high with different possible events happening to effect said prices.At some point depending how fast you are you will be somewhat at the top of the food chain in not that long of a time but you can still get stomped at times if you get reckless. There are quite a few ships to get some feeling different then others and some unlocked later by doing or becoming apart of...things. Random map events, battles etc and small touches and details that I won't ruin. Overall I think this is a good game that hopefully gets better and in all honesty at some point will wear thin. This is no surprise as the space warrior can only go so far BUT the time getting there has been enjoyable for me at least. Getting that next ship, getting more turrets, better fire power, being able to go right into the fray just tanking everything and watching your lasers just shoot, blow up and just rip apart many a small ship as you focus on the big ones is a beautiful thing. Or just cruising paying no mind and seeing a kill happen all because an enemy got too close and looked at your turret funny.I believe this game is good and worth a buy and what can ruin it is coming in thinking or expecting something it's not. This game isn't ultra deep requiring big management nor is it as shallow and simple as it seems at 1st. The best way I can think of this game is it's like the ""Civilization Revolution"" of the lot. Just deep enough to seem familiar and can get you to think a bit but not so overwhelming to put off more simple people like myself (although I do enough a deeper game at times). Do you research, watch a few vids, take it out for a quick spin cause i'm sure some of you will enjoy it.ALSO! whatever you do, do NOT do swarm missions or things with the words ""swarm"" in them. If your not coming in prepared those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will rip you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ within another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥~			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a game about space ships, shooting, economics, exploration, and more shooting- but I expect if you saw the trailer you probably already knew that. Here's how I have reacted so far to the game in general:What I like:-Battles are an intense and addicting affair with a good deal of variety to them-Controls feel very solid and responsive-Music fits the game really well-The economy of the trading system is both rewarding and highly dynamic-Quality character modelling and voice acting-Random encounters and discoveries when using the warp drive keeps travelling interestingWhat I don't like:-Little to no lore or interesting background details on any of the stations you visit-The universe in general feels empty at times, as if nothing interesting happens when you aren't directly involved-Most of the ""new"" items you can purchase as you progress are just duplicates of weaker items with improved stats-Escort missions are incredibly slow and frustrating due to stupid AI-Enemy fighters at close range are difficult to target due to how much of the screen is taken up by your shipOverall, Rebel Galaxy is hardly a perfect game but has that magical charm which made me a fan of early space exploration games like Escape Velocity. The fact that I haven't grown bored at all despite the endless barrage of missions required to progress speaks a lot about how fun the combat in this game is. I'd definitely recommend trying this out if you're a fan of the genre.			"

												HelloI've waited so long for something like this game. I love stories and couldn't care less about multiplayer and big honking spaceships just make my day. The story and side mission could use a bit more depth and variety but the game play is great, simple and very fun and visually impressive.If any additional story content was released I'd probably snap it up as soon as i saw it and any sequels would be on my wish list.Thank you very much for this really good game :)			"

												The game is effectively 18th century naval combat in space, which everything that implies:- Two dimensional movement.    Even though in space, your ships can turn right or left, but can't pitch up or down.  - Broadside combat.    Sidle up to your enemy and let fly with side mounted cannons.Even though having a space shooter pinned to a single plane was jarring at first, the game is incredibly solid and polished to a shine, with obvious influences from Firefly, Honor Harrington (even to the point of a having a ship named Manticore), Elite, and Freelancer.  .... and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the game has THE best soundtrack I've heard in years.

												Rated as a buy because, imo, I got enough out of it to justify the cost.That said I uninstalled halfway through the game. Your milage may vary but I had reached the point of feeling no incencetive to contine grinding.The PositivesSound, visuals, and play are all solid.The Neutral""Ship of the Line"" playstyle. As stated elsewhere you, and other dominate craft, are restricted to the X axis. Everything except small fighters are built around this orientation. I wasn't bothered by it on the whole but there are moments when the limitation can be frustrating.The NegativesWhile not everyone will find this a negative Rebel Galaxy is, at its core, a power creep grinder. The process is as follows --- complete requested or accepted jobs in the flavor of bounties, transport, or escort >>> Get paid >>> Buy a new ship and or uprade the current ship systems in .X version increments of essentially the same type >>> Jump from system to system facing simiarly and incresingly upgraded ships >>>  Spend the time inbetween traveling from and to all these various points. Rinse and repeat /// The rest of the content, including trading, factions, and story, are very thin.			"

												Great ""simple"" space sim in the tradition of Freelancer and the like.  I honestly enjoy the game greatly, and have been wanting something like it o come along for a very long time.  Its very ""sandbox"" in feel, and very ""free form"" in the choices you have to advance your character.  Both of the mentioned features are ones I look for and love in a game.Honestly, if they made expansion packs with more stories, more ships, more star systems to explore, and just plain MORE stuff, I would happily continue to hand them money.As many have said, the game is a little ""shallow"".  But, honestly, I think that is because the developers are only getting started; and have yet to show us what they can really do with the (hopefully crosses fingers) Rebel Galaxy franchise.This is a great start to what I hope becomes a epic series of expansions, DLCs, and hopefully additional titles down the road.

												a lot like privateer but much shorter version in the story and quest.  Only goes to level 6 on weapons and ships where as privateer went to level 10 and the drama with the alien presence was much longer on privateer.  It appears they could add higher levels up to 10 a least.  Once you conquer the enemy you can continue to accumulate space credits but you cannot buy anything with them.   You can go on to complete missions for the other factions and raise your rank but to no avail since that achievement really do not get you anything extra.  The should add to the story and increase the number of ships available.  Otherwise was quite fun but much to short and a disappointment for someone who has played privateer.			"

												Before I knew it I got about 30-40 hours into the game.I`ve been having a blast cruising around the different systems, listening to the music that gives me the biggest Firefly feels. Escorting, doing runs, and just blasting enemies left and right.There has been a few glitches with the escort missions here, like one I had to escort to the other side of the system. He had one of the fragments that Trell needed, and I decided to escort him instead of taking it from him. We paired warp, and he brought me to the station under attack in sublight speed, it took AGES. Then we blasted all the enemies in the area and he just flew by in zig zags. By then I had enought so I started to shoot him where 3 Militia Destroyers rekt me.Second run, he actually warped us into a big enemy armada that rekt us.Third run we got to the station, and everybody in the area was out for our blood.Fourth time, another enemy armada.Fifth time, we reached the station and I just sat back to watch him get destroyed so I could take the fragment and run.But I`ve had a blast through this game tho.Only real complaint is that I wish the Dock and Tractor button was different buttons. On cargo runs when there`s a war going on around a station and a lot of things floating around, I`ve been killed a few times because my ship keeps tractor beaming stuff instead of docking.Other than that, great job ^^			"

												This is one of those very rare games that gets EVERYTHING right. It's an instant recommendation to anybody with even a passing interest in space combat/trading games. 10/10.Gameplay: Starting out with a peice of junk spaceship/peashooter, you fight and trade across a number of solar systems, buying upgrades & better ships as you go. Combat is really good fun - like Sid Miers Pirates! on steroids. Configurable turrets, loads of cominations of weapons with different stats, shield arcs, subsystems damage, free for all and group battles. Basically everything. Trading is really fun too, with supply/demand, random events, and smuggling. You can get hidden weapons and ships by joining guilds. The controls also deserve a mention - perfect with an xbox pad. Presentation: The game is gorgeous, both technically and in design. The devs have nailed the space cowboy/western trope. The ship and station design has a good rugged industrial feel to it, and the space environments are spectacular. Beautiful blue nebula, fading atmospheres extending up from the surface of planets, and searing white heat from stars have all been rendered perfectly. Charachter models in stations/via-comms are excellent too, which is nice considering they're not the main focus. The devs clearly know their way around the graphics API because all the shiny bells & whistles are implimented to good effect and in the right places.Sound: This should be under ""presentation"", but it deserves it's own catagory because it's so good. SLIDE GUITAR. Good grief I love slide guitar. If there soundtrack were an album, it's one I'd actually buy, which is something I've never thought about a game before. It changes dynamically on the situation too, which is great. The music really cements the feel of the game and it's a big contribution to the success in nailing the space cowboy theme. Content: I'm 20 hours in and I'd guess I'm around 1/3 of the way through the game. That's plenty of content for the price. The placement of stations and missions are procedurally generated too, so there will be some variation if you want to have more than one playthough. You'll get your moneys worth out of this game.Technical: I run the game on max settings on 3 year old hardware, with no issues. The devs are actively pushing out patches and post on the forums. Good job.Overall: 10/10. The devs nailed this one and they must be delighted. Buy it.			"

There are lots of weapons ans stuff to add to your ship and in this way you really can customize it. The story is not so much immersive but you can do missions as you want. You are totally free in the world and you can feel it.I strongly recommand it !			"

												First review, mostly because I'm all about some space sims these days and I think this is an interesting game that needs some clarification.So first of all it's not that deep.  It does get grindy.  The missions, while there are a few variations, do find pilots (captains?  Do you pilot a Dreadnaught or captain it? Whatever.) doing basically the same few things repeatedly.  You can't get out of your ship, you can't walk around your ship, you can't go down to planets, etc. etc.  You can't even fly up or down.  Yeah, true.  But you won't really notice after an hour, I promise.What you CAN do is blow stuff up.  A lot.  And it's pretty damn fun about it, too.  You can also put in your own music that plays in game, which is better than just having a music player on in the background because the in game music fades when you need it too, and if you have a large list of music added you get moments when the perfect song plays for the perfect fight, and it's awesome.  So I recommend this game, especially at the 17-ish bucks I bought it for.  It's pretty,  the combat is quick paced and fun, and if you're like me and waiting for even the beta of Star Citizen or for Elite Dangerous to actually have sand to go in its massive sandbox (Right now Rebel has more variation and more fun moments than Elite, but Rebel is not getting expanded for the next 10 years, so), this will scratch the pew pew itch.  Not going to be spending months and months on Rebel, but it's a fun game that might warrant a couple play throughs if you want to try going through with different factions.Almost forgot:  This is not a starfighter type of game.  You fly naval style big ships with broadside cannons and auto turrets (you can control them, too) that you angle in and open fire.  And when you unload full broadside and watch that other ship explode...I gotta say it feels good.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is not a simulation, nothing like Elite Dangerous or Starpoint Gemini 2 (both great space-sims); if you want to compare it you best go with Freelancer. The story, tone and visual presentation are very different from Freelancer; where the good old piece of gaming history served a more serious tone and a sci-fi-thriller plot Rebel Galxy offers more upbeat space-western; mysterie and discovery are still here but it feels nothing like what Freelancer showed.Yet Rebel Galaxy is very coherent; no matter if it`s the main storyline or the world your traveling in it all breathes Firefly.Visual presentation is top notch and despite what images and movies might suggest not very demanding, i`m running the game on an older rig and it looks and runs like charm. The whole galaxy your exploring, ships, effects, planets, stations, etc. are just filled to the rim with detail, colors and a unique art-style. Sound-design and music are some of the best i`ve ever seen, the soundtrack (western, space-rock) just hits the nail on the head, voicework is fitting, weapons, ship engines sound impressive. Just like Freelancer you`r free to do what you want (with more options); -explore and find valuable cargo, minerals, equipment-pirate trade-convoys (including a news-flash in stations giving you hints)-trade-bounty hunt-do countless randomly generated missions for various factions (tons of different missions types: escorts, deadrop pickups, breaching blockades, getting certain trade-good and the list goes on)and than there`s a mainplot which starts of rather boring but gets traction very fast and serves the space-western picture perfectly.the game offers tons and tons of different ships to fly, gear to put in your loadout (weapons, shields, engines, subsystems and and and), mercenaries to hire (one at a time) and as a unique twist: your flying the ""big ships""; starting with corvettes, frigates you soon hit capital ships like destroyers, etc. .the game is not centered around smaller fighter/bomber craft vessel dog-fights, but on you sitting in a massive turret filled capital class ship ditching out broad-sides (similiar to naval combat) while turrets and your mercenary do the busy work).....and it feels and plays amazing!the games does not offer the whole 3D space, but a 2D plane your flying in, which takes some time gettin used to, but it enhances the arcady gameplay by alot.controls and interface are very very slick and tight, especialy with a gamepad the whole UI and control-scheme feels spot on; it`s hard to describe, but every simple action (from hailing other ships, docking, pulse-scanning, scaning, operating different weapon-systems, to shield managment, etc.) goes just natural. Rebel Galaxy is a very polished, colorfull, space-western, sporting freedom and content...great visuals, amazing music and very non-simulation fun gameplay. the price is very misleading, this in no way feels like a low-budget, indie game, but more like a big-release tripple A game offered for a real bargain.

												If you are a fan of Firefly or Outlaw Star or Cowboy Bebop, you will find yourself right at home on this game.  I have enjoyed it greatly so far.  Why?  Well, let's talk about that.Pros:Fun, hectic combatDifferent ways to tackle a problemTrading system is funThe solar system feels livelyDifficulty; some missions are rather challenging at pointsHigh production quality.  SFX(including VA's) and GFX are both spot on.  Good soundtrack as well.Naval style combat is fun and well doneThe feeling of being an outlaw(or not, if you so choose)Cons:You really make the best money by killing stuff.  By a considerable margin.  This in itself is not a con but if you wanted to do something other than blow stuff up be prepared for the cash to flow in slowly.Difficulty; the difficulty ratings for a mission can be rather ambiguous.  I found myself flying into dire situations thinking it was going to be easy.  Maybe that's just me... I don't know.The entire game is 2D but fighters(non-Capital ship class vessels) and missiles move in a 3D space.  This makes sense but is a con for me as I do prefer three dimensional ship combat.Story could have been delivered much better, especially in the onset of the game.  Suddenly you are given a near derelict craft from a relative but I guess you graduated from flight school or something cause apparently you're a natural and know exactly how to handle this vessel.  Now go kick some space outlaw♥♥♥♥♥All in all this is a very fun game with a unique flavor and at this price point is a good choice for the sci-fi naval combat fan to have some fun.Bang!  See you, space cowboy.			"

												Very cool western themed space game with naval ship to ship combat. Excellent value for the money. Great graphics. The game got campaign story, missions, ship combat, npc escorts you can hire, random events, scanning, mining, upgrades, different ships, trading, different aliens, animated characters for the story, and lots more. And it's made by two veterans (other contractors contributed) that previosly founded Runic Games and made Torchlight 1&2.Ok, you don't steer in 3D but I don't mind as the game is designed around the mechanics of a naval broadsides battle. There are tons of other games with real 3D space mechanics, this game gives the space genre more diversity. "

												Recommended, with some caveats. While very pretty, the game feels to lack a lot of polish. My turrets almost destroyed a ship I was supposed to be escorting trying to hit a target on the other side of the escortee. The menus were very obviously designed for consoles, with no work put in for them on PC. Mouse has little functionality in the menus, and you are forced to use the keyboard for all inputs. There are plenty of ships in the game that you won't be able to actually fly, which is a shame because they're some of the best looking ships. It doesn't matter what your reputation is with them you can't buy them, and there's no ship capture mechanic. The really disappointing thing about not having a way to capture ships is that you are forced to do very repetitive missions over and over in order to upgrade. Ultimately, its a ""blonde"" version of Starsector: pretty and fun, but, in the end, a shallow experience.			"

												Having just finished off the main quest, I have to say that I fell in love with this game over the past few days. Now? Well, it's still a good game, but its starting to wear a little thin. I'm glad the main quest ended when it did.If you've ever played any of the Escape Velocity games, you're in for a treat here. This is basically what you would get if you threw Escape Velocity into a 3D world (though you can only move in a 2D plane, hence the comparison).In Escape Velocity you had turrets and spinal weapons. Here you have turrets and broadside weapons. I would prefer the option to mount weapons along the spine of the ship, but broadsides are what the developers were going for, and they did it well. The combat in this game is good. It's really damn good. It's challenging and exciting and didn't feel like a chore over the past 23 hours of gameplay.My biggest complaint is actually a pretty small aspect of the game. Mission indicators felt like they were getting in the way of my UI. If I could perhaps turn off the main story's mission indicators, I would have taken this game a little more slowly.			"

												If you liked Freelancer, you wil love this.Take on missions, fight enemies, upgrade your ship, jump into about 14 large sectors. It is only one plane of movement (left and right, no up or down) but this helps to keep things simple enough, as during battles, you have so much to do and keep an eye on, that you'd be grateful for it! Having separate AI for separate weapons is fantastic, allows you to preserve your more precious ammo for the important things, and to focus your smaller/ammo-less weapons on the smaller guys.I am loving this game and highly recommend it.

												This game is the sandbox space sim we've been waiting for since Freelancer. Elite: Dangerous too fiddly for you? Loved AC: Black Flag for the ship combat? Enjoyed Firefly? Tired of waiting for Star Citizen to get to a release?Then you're gonna love this game.You fly a capital ship in a somewhat open universe. Trade, pirate, privateer - the choice is yours. Fighter pilots? Pah! I fly a ship that launches broadsides, son, and obliterates your little X-wing knockoff with my Flak.The country and western soundtrack and Southern accents for some of the characters bring the Firefly references in so nicely and casually without explicitly resorting to Firefly-like dialect or setting, making it a subtle, valued tie-in.The game suffers from the procedurally generated fault of being a 'lifeless'-feeling open world. There's also some minor Quality Of Life issues with trying to be a trader - finding out (last known) prices is a bit fiddly. Free trade is also unfortunately not very lucrative, compared to the Mission Boards (which will post trade missions that ironically make FAR more than you could shipping the goods without a contract, after you've gone into the game a bit). But at least the mission boards make the Trader path remain viable along with the plainly-intended Privateer path.You also navigate and fight solely along each systems ecliptic and ignore the third dimension, to a much larger degree than Freelancer or its other wannabe successors. But let's be honest with ourselves - this genre was never about the third dimension.This game is also very well optimized for the technical side.Get this game. It's the game we've been waiting for, and it came with no fanfare.			"

												Its like assassin's creed black flag without the assassin's creed. You pilot a flagship, trade, take contracts, hunt pirates or militia or a number of other different faction, mine, and all that good space stuff. Here's the special part about Rebel galaxy, you move on an X Y axis, no up and down here. This really tightens up the game in my opinion. your ship has turrets, and broadside weaponry, which is why it is comparable to the naval combat. So if you loved the sea faring and could do without the on foot part of black flag, go ahead and grab this game, you will love it. Also the sound track is bomb as hell!			"

												Dont believe any negative reviews on this game, most of them are nit picky or misguided. This game is tons of fun, lots of replayability and allows you use your own music. The only gripe I have is it switches songs too quickly. Game is 100% worth the money.			"

												If you're like me, you might have looked at this and said, ""Hmm, could this be like EVE Online?"" The answer is yes and no. While it certainly is easier to pick up than EVE, there are some aspects that could really use more explaining, such as ""If I switch weapons, does that mean the AI will handle my broadsides while I plink away on turrets?"" It also can be rather difficult to concentrate on aiming boardsides, piloting, keeping an eye on shields, and trying to figure out if you should break off your current target and take on the guy plinking you from ""behind"" your camera. A scrollable camera would be quite helpful for that, or a larger HUD radar. Despite that, it's been rather interesting so far.			"

												Okay, so I just finished the main quest and feel like I'm ready to give my 2 cents. First impressions are good! Great soundtrack, the early space battles have a nice intuitive rock-scissor-paper-feel (probably got them in the wrong order). Mid-game, I'm kind of grinding for credits. I need so and so many million to reach tier 6-weapons and to maybe fight the big battles and come out on top. I don't know if I made it too easy, but I went for the fast ""Barracuda"" so I could out-maneuver and out-run my enemies and then pick the fighters of off in bite-size chunks and move in to the ""blind spots"" of the capital ships and just wear them down with ma lazers..  Where was I.. yes the grind! It came to a point where my strategy was sound, but I still didn't feel ready to further the main quest. Lots of grinding later I had my weapons and went in to the much to short late-game and now I'm the hero. And still don't feel like I care about my aunt! I mean, for a game that has the plot-hook, that I want to find my aunt and help her, then they should have focused more on the story-line and flesh out the characters of the game. Most of the missions where fun the first 25 times I did them, except for the escort missions, they NEVER became any fun. While you're in the middle of fighting capital ships and fighters, your escort-buddy up and killed himself. Poor form! The funniest side mission was when a discreet gentleman needed my assistance to reacquire lost items. When I get to the pick up, the cargo is pin-up monthly magazines! The gentleman was shipping dirty magazines and suddenly I understand why I was under oath not to tell his wife. Those kind of quirky side-missions makes me smile. I don't know who that man is, but I instantly like both him and his wife and I'm curious about their relationship and his business enterprise. It's like the developers have good story-writers but they are put on writing up side-missions instead of making sure the follow-through for the main story is solid. If you want 10+ hours of fun, go get it! If you another 10 hours of grind look no further! It's good enough game and I give it my dubious thumbs up. =)			"

												CLICK BUY RIGHT NOW!  Rebel Galaxy is a VERY good game.  Fun to play, surprising in its depth, and overall a great value for the money.Gameplay is pretty simple, the story is there and some of the fights can be very tough.The only negatrive thing I've seen so far relates to the mercenary guild.  The mercenary guild (which has a station in each system after the first) gives out random kill/protect contracts - just as the merchant guild does.  After playing through several of these to rank up my standing with the mercs so I could buy a new ship, I noticed that I get a lot of missions that pit me up against system militia and other 'good guy' factions, with no warning in the briefing whatsoever.  On one mission in particular in the second system, the enemies generated for my mission were also mercenary's guild - which resulted in a huge net loss for faction for completing an assignment from that guild.  This makes ranking up the mercenary faction very difficult and frustrating - after tweeting the devs on this, I heard back that it's working as intended, and the only option to get around this is to abandon the mission, fly all the way back to the source, and get another one - which may or may not present the same problems.So I would wholeheartedly recommend Rebel Galaxy - but with the caveat that if you do pick it up, save yourself the frustration of trying to rank up with the mercs and just go with regular civilian or merchant class ships instead.

												Fun as hell.  If you liked Joss Whedon's Firefly show, you'll love this game.  You start with a hunk of junk and an eccentric aunt's quest.  You can choose to fight or flee, depending on your ship's gear at the time.PROS:  Open ended gameplay, space cowboy music, lasers, missles, big ships, blowing stuff upCONS:  Flat plane of maneuvering.  No reverse.  Some hard to locate items (Okay, it's space...it's big).OVERALL:  BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Instead of writing a longwinded review, I'll just write plainly what this game most reminds me of.Assassins Creed 3.No, not all the assassination business, but all the Yarrr Piratey stuff, where you sail a ship and fight battles.Except that this is with Proton Cannons, which I do admit is a slight difference.

												Very Addictive game.  Just want to keep grinding and upgrading.  Just made it to the second  ""stage"" ...grabbed some new gear, went back to first stage to get revenge on all who jammed a missle in my exhaust port when I was a weak noob.  Wish it wasn't 3:30 in the morning ....so I could play a few more hours.  Worth it, good graphics, open world, good upgrades, good voice acting, decent story so far.Play with gamepad....much better than mouse and keyboard			"

												Hello SteamersAfter giving the storyline a fast once through i decided to give my review of Rebel Galaxy.  First off great work to the creators of this little fantastic space game.  Finally these guys had the balls enough to put Rock Music in a Space Game and it really ramps up the excitement , I got all the dust cleaned out of my Bose speakers on this game and nothing but a big smile on my face when the explosions started from my missles  firing out the sides of my ship.  Sure there are some things that an older player might sqeem at as far as the cartoonie characters you meet but it's not a far trade off from Jaba.  The ships are superb in design and id have to say they look better than a few of the top rated space sim games on the market.  They give you plenty of mounting options for Lasers,Rockets,Missles,Mines and Mining Lasers that can be used for fighting aswell. There is a Storyline to the game and it's good...... I'm glad there is a storyline here some of the bigger space sims decided to leave out storylines and there games feel like there is somthing always missing even in the missions they have.  Rebel Galaxy seems to understand this and always has some npc in the game coming on screen to talk to you about your next mission or a character trying to make a deal with you.  You are not alone in rebel space there is always someone around to greet you rather if it's good or bad.  This i'm sure is a trail space game by Double Damage to see how it does and all i can say is please give us more we like it.  Well i do any way, this is a great space game to play for a few months and you can't beat the price.  score 86/100			"

												Its Firefly meets Cowboy Bebop meets Battlestar Galactica. Rebel Galaxy is a good-looking and fun space action game with a kickass soundtrack. It plays more of an arcade game rather than a space sim so for those looking for the latter might want to look somewhere else. What this game has is a procedurally-generated, sandbox solar systems set on a 2D plane where the player can explore right from the start.For starters, the player's ship can't roll, pitch, or yaw (sorry, no Crazy Ivan manuevers here) - only forward movement, and left/right turns. This is because the game’s combat is designed around the broadside naval engagements similar to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Basically, you line up your ship (think of it as a space boat) against the enemy ship for a firing solution, and then unload your armaments to see some fireworks. It might sound easy but it has its share of tactical positioning and maneuvering - each side of your ship (front, rear, port, and starboard) has a hull and shield rating. After you eat through a ship’s shield face, you start hitting its hull to do some serious damage. You can spin that damaged side out of the line of fire to regenerate your shields and retaliate or simply retreat and fight another day.The game has a decent selection of weaponry, ships, and ship upgrades. You can also choose to align with different factions but sadly, they have no personalities to speak of outside of the nicely animated talking avatars they have.There is a main quest you can follow, or ignore it and set out in any direction you want and be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, or space pirate. You can get missions from space stations that can earn you currency to buy ships/weapons/ship upgrades, as well as alignment points to factions. The said missions can get pretty repetitive after a while, but the gloriously huge space battles keep me coming back for more. Exploration in this game is fun and is rarely dull. It has the same relaxing feel as doing cross country delivery jobs in Euro Truck Simulator 2. There are asteroid fields, floating space junk from the ruins of some old battle (which may contain some sweet loot and military grade weaponry), nebulae of different swirling colors, planets, moons, and of course, stars. It will take a few minutes to fly from point A to point B, but there’s usually some unidentified signal, a distress call, or just a random fleet of space bandits to keep things interesting. The game’s soundtrack is really good. It exudes the same vibe as Firefly with its guitar heavy tracks with twangs. The devs also included the most phenomenal custom music support I have ever seen in a game. There’s nothing like Want It All Back from Cowboy Bebop kicking in as I enter combat. I have Cage the Elephant, Clutch, Johnny Cash, Darren Korb (Bastion OST), Queens of the Stone Age, Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop), Vitaminless (Cowboy Bebop), and Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica) on my custom playlist. You can sort and assign them as combat, idle, or title music. Your custom music can also be merged with the game soundtrack for more variety.I definitely recommend this game.			"
