												Hi everyone. I've been part of the Crea community for a very long time now and I finally got around to updating my review. I'm going to go through the features of the game and talk a little bit about them so you know a little about the game beforehand.Important Note: Since I wrote this review I've become part of the Crea development team. As such I won't be updating this review further as I feel that being part of the development team would result in a biased review. That said, this review was written at a time when I was not part of the development team. So the original review still stands in its integrity. It is worth noting that many things about the game have changed since the review, so it's no longer necessarily accurate.First of all, let's talk the game's origins. This game originally started with the idea of ""Terraria but moddable"" according to the dev. Since then it's changed wildly. The game is still a 2D sandbox game (and indeed to many people that's enough to make it practically the same as Terraria) but it has integration of RPG elements and a strong emphasis on exploration.Next let's discuss the combat. The combat in Crea is very dynamic, a lot of dodging and blocking, and with a lot of skills for you to use. There are even combos, and there are several different paths you could go in terms of combat. However it does take some getting used to which may be a downside for many people. The combat in the game has a different patterning compared to most other 2D games that makes you watch the enemy closely and react to their patterns in order to attack optimally. While not similar to Dark Souls combat, the difference between Dark Souls combat and standard 3rd person combat in video games is a good comparison. It requires you to engage enemies differently from any other 2D game I've played, and it requires you to think about what you're doing actively. This isn't for everybody, so just know what you're getting into, and know you'll have to think if you want to fight well in Crea.Next is the crafting. Crea takes a new approach to crafting compared to other sandboxes, in that you discover the recipes by researching the pieces of the items themselves. The end result of this is that finding a new recipe is more like a scavenger hunt than anything else, as you look for the piece that completes your recipe. Some people love this while unfortunately this comes off to others as grindy. I personally believe this is a presentation issue, and the developer has discussed doing massive changes to the crafting system to improve it, so that may see changes in the future.Next is exploration. Exploring in Crea is something that it often feels like there is a good reason to do, in fact, it almost always feels as such. While it doesn't feel like exploration is the core of the game (as, indeed, it isn't), exploration is rewarded, and required. The materials you need are not centered in a small place, they're all over the world, and should you decided to spend most of your time underground, the tunnels always feel more like you're spelunking, than anything else.The next big piece is modding. This game has possibly the best mod support I've ever seen, so in the future, there will likely be a wide range of different ways you can play the game, all through modding. Of course that does first require that a community forms, which is something to keep in mind, but if one does form you'll see modding content created much faster and more seamlessly than most other games out there.The next thing I'm going to talk about is my least favorite thing in the game, the primary toolbar. While many people like the strange toolbar that Crea opted to go with, my personal opinion is that it's not the best. The toolbar at the bottom has two modes which each have two loadouts. There's a combat and exploration mode. You switch between the modes with R and the loadouts with tab. It's clunky when you start but as you get used to it becomes efficient. That said, I'm a bigger fan of the simplicity offered by a single toolbar. I think that simplifying the toolbar would benefit the game greatly.Next is something I feel I should discuss in this review. This game had a rough launch. I'm going to briefly tell the story of what happened though from my perspective. Leading up to the launch the game looked very stable. The developer was looking for bugs and encouraging people to test it, but none were showing up (or rather no one was reporting them if they were). I know this since I was (and still am) a moderator of the forums. As far as the developer could tell, the game was stable. As such, he left early access. On leaving early access the amount of people playing the game increased a hundredfold. Literally the number of people playing Crea was about 100 times greater than it was during early access. Because of this many, many bugs appeared. For some people the game was refusing to run, for others it crashed often, for some the multiplayer was unplayable. It was a mess. The main developer was distraught and spent a ton of time fixing bugs. He was constantly working his way through a list of bugs for over a month after launch, and these weren't small bugs. For a couple of them, he had to do things such as completely rewrite the netcode for the game. Anyone who's even tried to program netcode knows that's no small feat. The developer several times worked from 9 AM one day to 3 AM the next to fix the bugs. The community watched him do it to, it's common for the developer of the game to livestream the development in order to interact more readily with his community (and contrary to some accusations I've seen, the developer definitely doesn't play favorites if people subscribe or donate. In fact I don't even think most of the people subscribed own Crea, they just like to chat as they code....) The game is now stable. Watching the reports, there hasn't been a crash report in a while. I won't say the game's perfect, it's a long way off. Getting the game stable is only now (July of 2016) getting close to wrapping up and after that the game still needs a lot more content and needs some systems reworked before it's full potential is available, but it will get there. I've been along as this game was developed for a long time and the developer has consistently shown he puts the playerbase first. He takes feature requests, he actively engages in solving bugs that only plague one person, he requests feedback on ideas before implementing them, he listens to player feedback and reverts changes that people don't like. If nothing else, I have confidence in what this game will become because I've seen the developer in action and he's exactly what most people wish the developer of their favorite game was like.Crea is not for everyone, but I think many people will enjoy it, if not now, then in the future.Anyway, long story short, I'd recommend this game (if you somehow didn't get that already).

TL;DR: As it stands, Crea is a Terraria clone with less content and way more bugs.This review is going to be quite long, so let's get to it.Crea caught my eye right along with Planet Centauri, but PC was (and still is) in early access, while Crea had just been released, so I decided to give it a go. The game is clearly a Terraria clone, so let's get that out of the way, and let it be clear that I'll be making comparisons between the two throughout the review.THE GOOD:Adds a few RPG elements to the formula;Every action you take gives you ""experience"" in that kind of action, unlocking upgrades as you level up each activity;Researching new items is interesting and makes more sense;THE BAD:A ton of bugs, glitches, crashes, freezes and so on;Despite not having seen everything there is to see, it clearly has less content than Terraria;More expensive than the game it fails to improve upon;Its Dungeons aren't really worth it at all, and their procedural nature ends up creating a frustrating and annoying result;Boss fights have no ""epicness"" to them, they just feel empty and silly;It's hard to tell whether you're progressing towards new unlocks and discovering new things, or just mindlessly grinding;It's pretty damn hard to tell what you need to do in order to discover new things (more on that later);Skills and upgrades are poorly developed/designed and often feel like something your character should start with instead of having to grind to unlock;Combat is very frustrating, especially melee;Now, it's clear that the Good vs. Bad list gives you enough reason not to buy the game, but keep on reading as I elaborate on some of the bad aspects and later explain why there's a chance I may change my recommendation someday.About discovering new things:It feels like the game forces you to do what it wants you do to, and if you don't, you don't progress at all. In a sandbox game, that is obviously terrible, but it gets worse when you take the fact that you have skills to level up into account. Their balance ends up getting screwed and your character will have tremendously high levels of certain skills, while they will be lacking in others, and that just feels pretty bad. It doesn't help that, sometimes, no matter how much you explore you'll end up not finding anything new, as all chests suck pretty bad, no matter their quality, and since you're not doing what ""the game wants you to do"", it just gets frustrating and boring.About the combat:Fighting in this game is not fun, is not intuitive, and most important of all: it's not fair. It is designed in such a way that enemies' attacks are not telegraphed, most having instant cast times and no warning that they're coming. Yes, after a while you learn what certain enemies do, but that doesn't stop them from being completely unpredictable and unavoidable. Sometimes you end up just overwhelmed by a bunch of enemies who don't take their time crushing your health bar, while others leave you silenced, stunned and snared, while still dealing damage to you, all from a single enemy and all that at the same time! It's TERRIBLY designed in my opinion, and fighting them is not a joy that you also get xp from winning, it's a grind that you hope you don't end up dying midway.FINAL AND IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:The dev for this game clearly loves it and its community, and he is working day and night to fix every last bug the game has, and releases almost daily updates with a bunch of fixes. I am really glad when an independent dev is this transparent with the community and is passionate about bringing a good experience to the players. He even livestreams his development and fixes issues people report in real time.That said, in the end it all comes down to how good the game is, and currently this game is in a state I DO NOT recommend people to buy it. The bugs are just too many, the content is just too little, with most of it repeating itself only with bigger numbers, the combat is boring and frustrating and exploring is not really rewarding at all, as you only see and collect more and more of the same, with a few changes here and there. What I see in this game is a lot of POTENTIAL, but potential itself doesn't make the game entertaining or unique, it's just what it could be, but may end up never becoming. In conclusion, Crea is not worth it right now. Go play Terraria and check back later.			"

								Crea is a sandbox exploration and building game, much like Minecraft and Terraria. Unlike Minecraft, it's 2d and doesn't suffer from 3d camera troubles, and unlike Terraria, it's multiplatform, so it can be played Linux native.  It also adds RPG elements so you can level up, focus on your skill sets and chose between various different armor and weapon types depending on your play style.  Weapon classes: Each weapon class has it's own upgrade tree that branches off towards the top into a variety of top tier weapons - Sword/melee: Your normal hack and slash.  - Pike/melee: Stabbing from a slight distance - Wand/magic:  Sling spells without using MP - Bow / Range:  Plink away out of range.In addition, there's magic, which can be used alongside your weapon which comes in both offensive (fireballs and the like) and defensive (healing, shielding, etc)  Armour types have a similar branching tree that the weapon classes do.  There's basic armor, then it branches off to give the choice of 3 top level armors.   Weapons, armor and mining tools can all have bonuses, something that you can put your skill points into improving. Like in an RPG, not all items are the same, which means you can almost always make better equipment as you continue to level. This gives a nice feeling of progression to the game.Like Terraria, there is a boss battle that changes up the world a little.  However, this is mostly an upgrade without the race against the clock aspect battling the Wall of Flesh gave.  A new ore is peppered through the world, and a new category of drops is added to the mobs, allowing for higher level equipment.The monsters in the game scale to your level, rather than being procedural. A low level character will always encounter lower level monsters and vice versa no matter where in the world they happen to be.  As a benefit to exploring, Crea has a built in fast travel/teleport system. Way crystals can be set as spawn points and as long as you carry a shard with you, you can always teleport back home.  Way crystals are in random locations across the world and under the surface, making it much easier to get back to digging through the cave system. Crea is also very easily moddable.  Items can be created, the game files tinkered with, near anything you want can be done.  The official forum has a section for people to swap mods and get advice on how to make their own. Even with almost no programing knowledge, it's pretty easy to look at the source files and fiddle with things until you get the result you want. Crea is still in beta, but it's a very active beta with a very active dev and decently active community that's pretty good at pinning down the bugs and coming up with possible workarounds until the official patch comes out.  Most bug fixes are pretty swift it arriving, especially when they're big ones.  It's very playable as is. Multiplayer is still a bit wonky as of this review, but it was recently given a complete overhaul and I assume will be fixed up as the dev has a very good track record in that respect. Overall, a very enjoyable addition to the genre and very worth getting.			"

												Crea is a project developed by two very passionate people; Jasson McMorris (Programmer) and his wife, Kelley (Artist/Animator). Ever since discovering the game in early 2014, Jasson has been more than open and honest with how updates are coming along and has never left followers of the game in the dark. He's even constantly live streaming on Twitch, showing himself working on the game and taking feedback from his viewers in real time (he streams under the name SiegeGames). Jasson is also quick to fix both big and small bugs reported by users.SiegeGames is a damn good development team that truly cares for both the product and its fans. Crea is addicting, containing hundreds of hours of content (crafting, building, extensive player/skill leveling, researching, exploring, boss fights, different ecosystems with their own unique enemies and resources, multiplayer, randomly generated dungeons, speeps, etc). Jasson is great at Public Relations, is hard working and respects his fans who have both positive and negative things to say, the music is catchy to listen to (Props to Clark Powell), the enemy and boss designs are unique and well animated (Props to Kelley) and the updates and bug fixes just keep rolling in.Honestly, take the dive and enjoy such a wonderfully crafted game. I've only partaked in the singleplayer experience (3 different character playthroughs throughout the development of the game), so I can assure you that it's still very enjoyable playing alone. Hell, it's nice to just listen to a podcast and relax while escaping into the world of Crea.Also, there's no blowfish that chuckles at you when you start up the game everytime, so that's a huge plus.EDIT: Others who have reviewed the game, both positively and negatively, make much more thoughtful and indepth points relating to the game itself. Please check them out before making a final decision.			"

								This is a pretty standard Terraria style game.  The only differences are that you craft NPCs and in order to learn new recipes you need to find a material and then research on it.  You can craft from chests, which is really nice.By far the biggest downside is the bugs right now.  They simply make the game no fun because you're constantly losing items that you crafted, losing characters, having skills get bugged etc.  Give it 6 months or so for them to fix all the bugs and then it'll be worth it.

								I don't write a lot of reviews, or a lot of anything, so bear with me.Crea is a very fun game. Combat, mining, building, and crafting in a 2D world. It's similar to Terraria, which is what interested me, but far far from a clone. It's early access, so expect bugs. Luckily, the developer is very active on the forums. He is very helpful, and I've personally watched him solve three or four bugs on his twitch stream. I believe he spends hours every day with his stream up, and anyone can come in and inform him of difficulties they're having. I also think he has promised to release updates every week, however some weekly updates might only be bug fixes.In Crea, your character gains xp on each monster kill and levels up. Each level up gives 2 stat points, and you can spend them on health, stamina, attack, defense, intelligence (matk), mind (mdef), agility (ranged), and luck. I would say the coolest thing about Crea is the talent system. You have a talent tree for Arms (swords, axes, and bows), Syle (magic), Gathering (mining), Crafting, and Exploring (double jump, lockpick, inventory boost, and other noncombat boosts).Combat is, like I said, similar to Terraria. At least the controls are. Left click to pew, but with each click of an attack or use of a skill, your character's stamina will drain. If you allow your stamina to reach zero, your movement speed is reduced and you cannot act until it reachs about half. So always stop attacking before you reach zero. Currently there are swords, spears, bows, and wands. Each weapon style has a standard left-click attack, and then each weapon has the possibility of dropping with an element (earth, wind, water, fire), as well weapons can have secondary attributes (piercing bow, lifesteal sword, damage buff on kill axe, ricochet bullets, etc.).Two very important commands would be the ability to block and dodge. Dodge causes your character to roll forward or backward with invincibility frames. Blocking reduces the damage you take from an attack. Combat also has skills, unlike Terraria. Active skills such as fireball, shield stun, triple shot, protect, raise (multiplayer), heal, etc. Passive skills include stat increases, weapon power increases, shield power increases, move while charging, move while blocking, etc. Passives are boring, but useful.Mining is mining. Grab pick, mine ore, build better pick, mine better ore, etc. It works. Currently I've discovered the ore progression bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Not sure what's after gold, or how many ores come after gold. I've heard people mention Corium, which I believe may be the endgame ore. I'll skip over the building aspect, since it's never interested in me.Crafting is fairly simple as well, at least the act of crafting is. You just open the window, click a recipe you've unlocked, and clicked craft. Where Crea sets itself apart from others is the act of unlocking recipes, which is very in-depth, but also pretty annoying at times. Recipes have a crafting level I believe, but you can't see what level they are. Whether or not you gain crafting experience is dependant on the level of item your crafting. You have to research recipes using base materials. So if there was an iron pick, and it required wood and an iron bar, you'd need wood and an iron bar. You would also need to be a high enough crafting level to unlock crafting iron picks. Then you'd approach the research table, and it would say that you can currently research iron bars and you can research wood. You research with the wood, it tells you you've learned part of the iron pick recipe. You research with iron bar, it tells you you've learned the entire recipe for iron pick. Then you can craft the iron pick.If you have half of a recipe unlocked, you can view it in the research table and you'll see a dark shadow of the other items required. You might recognize them. If you don't feel like hunting down or finding out what else is required, then you can spend Scraps to finish the recipe without researching. This will unlock the recipe. Scraps are obtained when you research normally.Another awesome aspect is the dungeon system. You can sometimes find portals to dungeons in the world, and sometimes they spawn when you break a monster spawner. Another method is to unlock the Dungeoneer NPC, and paying him in currency and stone to send you into a dungeon. You can pick and choose the dungeon difficulty, size, and modifiers, or click the random button. Dungeons are awesome for finding loot you haven't unlocked and for grinding experience.Gripes:I can't seem to unlock the next tier of wands, and I don't know if it's because I don't have the materials or because I don't have a high enough crafting level. I can craft better swords, bows, and axes than I can wands, and I'm playing a mage build character. Without crafting levels displayed on the crafting window, I don't know what items to even craft to level up my crafting. Magic, melee, and range do not seem to be very balanced. I haven't managed to use melee successfully at all. Magic is decent, but pales in comparison to similarly leveled range (range is 3-4 times more powerful, for sure). However range requires the crafting of arrows, and I have a hard time crafting enough to keep up with my dungeoneering (as far as I know, feathers only drop from birds one at a time, and I don't see them very often). Stamina drains very very fast, but you get used to it. It's a real bother when fighting the plants that multiply if you don't break the eggs in time.Silver seems to be more rare than gold, as I have found way more gold than silver on two different characters in two different worlds. Five ore per bar is not a big deal with bronze and iron, but at the silver and gold levels it feels like way too much. Character leveling (not talent) feels a bit too slow. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. It's not very expensive, and it's definitely very fun. I will be putting way more hours into Crea.			"

												Don't get me wrong the game is great. But...- It's a poor Terraria clone: less content, less items, less enemies, less bosses, less crafting;- There are skills, but... too few skills, some are totally useless;- Craft here is based on recipes and they don't drop, this lead to allmighty 50 lvl character with everything maxed in 32 lvl gear... sigh...- No need to build anything, same sickness as in Starbound, all you need is few craft stations and a lot of chests;- Tedious inventory management, there are so many reagents (multiplied by 4 tiers) stacking those in chests manually is really annoying.- Crafting is progressive (low level item is upgraded), but craft UI is terrible, it's constant scrolling up-down to find manually which item you have to craft first, which second, etc..End-game is basically running dungeons with 65-lvl mobs (you are lvl 50). It's very quickly become boring. When skills are maxed there is no progression anymore.. apart from trying to find recipes. Clearing 50 horde realms to find 1 (!) recipe is pretty much tells about RNG in this game. I wanted to do all achievements in this game, but after seeing this I just gave up.It has 0 replayability. Random world? Well, the smallest word will hold all content replicated several times. Another character? There will be no difference, because stats do too little and gear is again all the same.This game need another year of development to become something what Terraria already is.			"

Early Access Review
								Having played multiple games of this specific genre on Steam, I can definitely say that Crea offers the most enjoyable and creative experience of them (Terraria, Starbound, Edge of Space). To fully enjoy this game, however, you must like the genre first (""sandbox""), and you will need to adjust your habits from similar games.---Terraria started (well, maybe not just Terraria, but Terraria was among the first) the craze of (2D) sandbox games, but the game cannot be truly called an Action RPG as well. Game progress, including all the equipment and weapons you get, is defined solely through crafting and picking up items. Even health is determined mostly by finding Life Crystals. Weapons themselves become the measurement of progress, too. (That is to say, you probably won't be using a Minishark in hard mode, but the Megashark is conveniently there.)In Crea, your progress and effort also define growth of your character in the form of skill points (experience). For every action that you take that is either appropriate or hard for your level, you gain experience. In fact, Crea becomes more of an RPG, because each character can level skills to their benefit. Even special skills become bound to your character, that were otherwise items in Terraria, e.g. Hermes Boots. I suppose I didn't realize how limited Terraria's design was until I saw (before I discovered Crea) how little space I have for everything. On a similar point, using equipment is straightforward; unlike the three aforementioned games, you can put those on your character's equipment screen and use the appropriate skill. For example, you can change your harvesting tool (which can harvest like an axe or pickaxe by the way) and not need to change your hotkeys.---In Crea, not many enemies exist, but each is uniquely designed. Specifically, each enemy attacks in a different way, may be influenced by the time of day in some way, and exists in different biomes (with some possible overlap). Generally, you cannot just rush into enemies and make it out alive; by comparison, Crea is much harder than Terraria but more reasonable than Starbound (looking at you, tier 10 planets) and Edge of Space (when I played it; apologies if I'm wrong now). You need to carefully attack enemies, because running out of SP (energy meter) may possibly result in your death. Many of these enemies also have alternate attacks that are deadly. I'm glad that the game is challenging but not ""cheap"" either. Without spoiling the content, I can confirm that the bosses are also very specially designed. The game is unfortunately vague sometimes, so you may not have the right idea about accessing a boss.---Many of the gameplay issues I encountered awhile ago have been fixed. These weren't necessarily game-crashing glitches but more or less how you play the game. Thankfully, researching materials has become easier since you can use a fairly common item called Scraps instead of the item itself. Other things were changed, too, but the thing I'm most grateful of this game is that it's being very actively maintained and updated, considering the size and resources of the developing team. I don't want to stress the developers, but they've really made the game enjoyable as each update passes.---In other thoughts, Crea has a very distinct yet nicely done art style. It doesn't look quite as ""pretty"" as Starbound's, but it's much nicer, especially considering the detail and relative sizes of objects. For example, several crafting stations (like the Ingot Mold) are tiny, but they are very nicely drawn and detailed too. For that, I consider the sprite work excellent. Additionally, the color palette is nice on the eyes and yet distinct - I can spot ore that is different, for example, so that's a plus.---With that said, I fully recommend the game.			"

								tl;drThe game is solid and if you've been wanting character progression in games like Minecraft or Terraria that extends beyond just gear, this will scratch that itch. It's got a kink or two for me but most of that is based on personal taste.Leaves are money/10Long version:Crea satisfies a lot of itches I have about games. It has an EXP system that actually means something first of all, so all that ""self defense"" actually gets you something.... which is better self-defense outside of gear. More than that though, there's more to it than just combat.Spend a lot of time gathering? You get gathering XP, which can level up gathering talents; make your tools better, get a chance of getting multiple resources, it's all quite satisfying. Spend your days crafting? Get better at that, make better things with bigger stat bonuses. Which brings me to the stat system, another rpg element that I've missed in similar games. It's pretty standard as far as rpg-stats go, having your bread and butter physical-and-magical versions of attack and defense. You can bump up your health and stamina(used to attack or cast) as well, or your luck, but I haven't felt that the game railroads you into building up one stat or another.The combat is split nicely between melee and magic, both of which have some ranged and melee options. Some players go mixed, others dedicate to magic or melee only; like many other things it's up to the player.The building reminds me of Terraria, but with more furniture. Nightstand/10, would craft again.The crafting is... interesting, as it's mixed with a research system where you need to essentially figure out what you'd need to make something. It consumes the material items or ""scraps"" that are produced during research, and you can't craft a given item until you've researched all it's components. It makes crafting things a bit more satisfying, though it can be tedious if you don't know what the next item is based on the siloette or where to get it. The NPC system is based on putting outfits on figures. This brings the figure to life as that NPC, which can be ""collected"" as the outfit to then move base. Personally it kinda freaks me out that my base is full of wooden figures walking around, pretending to be human like I don't notice they're ♥♥♥♥ing made of wood, but that's just me.My only two problems with the game are perhaps personal, but they may or may not resonate with you. One, for the longest time the game would randomly lag and be borderline unplayable. That seems to have fixed itself, so I may have missed an update where this was addressed. Secondly, it has Minecraft syndrome.I don't mean it's trying to be Minecraft. I mean there's no real direction at first and it's left to the player to figure things out. It's not spectacularly complex, certainly not to the point you can't figure it out, but I've found myself feeling a bit lost at points. The best thing I can tell you is to set small goals for yourself; you can do a lot in Crea, and having a plan helps. Build a house, shank a slime, dig a tunnel, cast some spells, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed in by a Harvester, you do you.			"

												Ok, so...There are a lot of starbound, minecraft, terraria clones out and about these days.  They involve hours of endless grinding for materials and ""exploring"".  Some of them have interesting quirks like an advanced crafting systems for gizmos and gadgets or a semi-sophisticated battle system.  Both of those things exist in this game which create depth and playability, but the game lacks soul.  What I mean by that is the world is rather repetative, enemies are boring and forgettable, gathering materials drags out for hours and there's limited to no explanation for how to accomplish certain things.  I mean I get that the idea is to explore and discover how to construct and craft different things, but it feels more like a drawn out scavenger hunt without clues to the locations of the things you need.  The game is in early access, and we all remember how terraria and starbound were at this stage, so we'll see how the devs do with creating more interesting content.  For now, I'd recommend holding off on purchasing.			"

												I'm not really a writer, especially not a review writer, so this might be a little rough.This game obviously takes heavy inspiration from Terraria, which is probably why you're checking this game out, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This game does have many elements to prove it isn't a straight up 'clone' as many people have put it.Positives:+ Adds RPG elements such as various talents (skills) and leveling. + Various skills you unlock as you level up different skill trees as well as new armor and weapons you can unlock help alleviate the grind to a point where (personally) it is practically unnoticeable (I have only played up to about level 30, which is a little over the halfway point).+ Melee and ranged skills aren't necessarily OP compared to the magic skills, and vice versa.+ On that note, there's a good variety of combat skills.+ Every action you take, including running around the world, gives experience towards its respective talent, with each branch (melee, magic, crafting, gathering, explore) giving unique skills to use.+ Researching various crafting recipes is interesting and rewarding.+ Dungeons are interesting and there are many different modifiers that can affect how you play through the different floors.+ The main dev (Jasson) is very involved in the community and very passionate about his game, he's personally helped me and a friend with a few pretty big bugs, some of them game-breaking, and we have since solved them and they are no longer an issue.Now, regrettably, on to some of the bad:- Researching is cool, but it can be unclear as to how to progress through some of it, such as when a boss needs to be defeated before you can research higher level stuff.- Boss fights are kind of boring and too easy, and it isn't made entirely clear how to access the fights (though the wiki is quite helpful). The first boss in particular has this problem, and it is not made clear that you need to fight them at all to continue.- This might be a personal thing, but I would like to know what weapons and armor upgrade to whichever next tier without needing to do in-depth research on the wiki to figure out which sets I want/need to craft specifically (such as what armor leads to a dead-end and which armor goes up to the max tier).- Starting out can be quite difficult, confusing (with so much stuff to do), and therefore a big pain unless you push through and get a few skills unlocked and leveled up, but hey, it is an RPG.And two neutral things:+/- First is there's definitely less content here than in Terraria, the game's inspiration, but I will defend it by saying that this game appears to have  much more content than Terraria did when it released over 5 years ago, so to give it a comparison in that regard, this game is coming along quite nicely. Also I want to mention... that game has been updated for a good 5 years. It should be more fleshed out than a game that released just over six months ago. This is a neutral point for me because I still wholeheartedly think that it's fully worth its price.+/- Second thing is the chaos crafting. This is where you can craft either a better version of a weapon or piece of armor, or more of an item you need than you can make by just pushing the craft button. Personally I'm a huge fan of this system and it's quite enjoyable and rewarding, however, some people may not appreciate it as much. It can be pretty confusing to someone just starting the game, as it is kind of complicated and strategic as you unlock higher quality levels.+/- I moved melee combat to a neutral point because in the beginning it's very difficult to get accustomed to it, but at the later point in the game you can actually begin to facetank some enemies, but there is still blocking and strategy involved inside of that.All in all, I've enjoyed this game as much as I did Terraria when I first played it, if not more than I enjoyed Terraria. There's tons to do, and I'm a sucker for the leveling, crafting, and research systems that have been implemented here. The devs are very vocal and friendly, and not only open to suggestion, but they will also help you as best as they can with any problems that you may run into when you play. They really do care about this game and their players. This game is an easy recommendation from me. I'd be happy to answer any questions people may have if I am able.			"

Early Access Review
								To be clear, I never really review games, but due to the low amount of reviews for this game in particular, I figured it would help to write one myself. Furthermore, I'll try to be as clear as I can concerning what I've experienced in this game in the short amount of time I've played it. I'm not going to do a pros and cons, so the review might be a little long. I'd rather discuss what the game offers and leave it at that. If you don't want to read a long♥♥♥♥♥review, skip this one entirely. Lastly, one thing to note, keep in mind that this game is in Early Access. This means there are some bugs, but none of them are gamebreaking from what I've experienced. For example, I entered a dungeon and was suddenly unable to grapple and another time could not jump to the left or right, only up and down. This was fixed by restarting the game. Overall Appeal:I think a lot of people will get into this game because of its similarities to other titles, such as Terraria and Starbound. I personally have played only a little of Terraria and quite a bit of Starbound. To put it simply, the things this game does have in common with those is that it's your typical sandbox: you can build, craft, and fight things, all on your own accord. In the meantime, Crea offers a little more variety than I experienced in the other two, with its skill and crafting system, which seem to have more thought put into them, as well as more freedom. I'll cover this later, but in any case, I believe that this is a worthy alternative to the other titles. I had a lot of fun playing and enjoyed all aspects of the game equally, some more so than I did in Starbound/Terraria. The look of this game, including its UI, might not appeal to everyone, but I liked it a lot. Skill System: The skill system is one of the big major upsides to this game, imo. This allows more character based progression, putting aside what armor and weapon you have equipped, and allows more of a rewarding experience. Differentiating from the titles mentioned previously, this game allows you to obtain experience and TP. TP is then used to level up skills and obtain new ones, similarly to an RPG.  It includes categories for Arms, Style, Gathering, Crafting, and Exploration. I'll explain each below:Arms includes weapon skills, focused more on melee attacks, weapon proficiency, shields, and archery. Style is for those of us who like to use magic, including spells, wand proficiency, and the potency of your damaging spells as well as your heals. Gathering is pretty self-explanatory. It includes skills that make your tools more effective by increasing the power, pick-up range, as well as how many blocks you can dig up/gather at once with a tool. Crafting is also pretty self-explanatory (except maybe not really). I'll cover how the crafting system works in its own section.Exploration includes skills such as ledge grabbing, double jumping, lockpicking, and sprinting. It also allows you to level up stats such as your Stamina and Luck. Crafting System:The crafting system is different from both Terraria and Starbound, in that you need to gather materials and research them to discover recipes. This means, for example, you pick up a material, use your Research Table to research it, and discover a new recipe. Under Recipes, you will see the recipe, as well as outlines of the other materials needed. If you can tell what they are, great. You go get them, research them, and learn the recipe. If you don't, then it's a matter of finding them as you progress through the game and discovering the recipe via researching those materials. As well as this, every time you research, you gain scraps, which can be used to skip finding the undiscovered materials of a recipe and discovering it ahead of time. They can also be used to avoid spending your materials researching.Furthermore, there's also a Chaos system I haven't really explored yet. I might update the review when I understand it more, but from what I gather it allows you to use skills (obtained via the Crafting category) to increase the quality of items you make via a separate crafting process that is optional when making items. I'm guessing that this is mostly used when making Armor/Weapons in order to apply stats or status effects. Again, I'm not sure, but it's worth mentioning in order to emphasize how intricate this system is in particular.Gathering System:I only want to cover this because I've seen a handful reviews saying that gathering/digging is too slow. I don't know if these people just didn't get far enough in the game to figure out the skill system, or if they're saying it's too slow no matter (which is kind of pushing it). I want to clarify that gathering is slow in the beginning, but as you obtain new tools and gain TP in Gathering, then use it to level skills that increase the power/reach of your tools, it gets much faster. No problem here unless you're just too impatient to level it up.   One thing to note before buying: I got this game for myself and my boyfriend, who doesn't have that great of a computer (to be honest). Neither of us experienced any lag, issues getting the game running, or setting up multiplayer in the beginning. However, as time went on, the game became unplayably laggy for him. We believe this is due to the large amount of processes this game runs in the background for its UI, called ""Coherent UI host"". I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's supposed to do this, but by the time it was running 10 or so of these processes, he could not move or use any skills. I, on the other hand, had no issue playing for long periods of time and have yet to encounter anything other than the occasional stutter when the game autosaves. In other words, if you have a potato for a computer, it might be a little risky to get this game right at this point in time. I say this because the devs said they would update this game early June, which might fix it. Have to keep in mind the game is still in Early Access, so this doesn't affect my opinion of the game overall and I still had fun playing.			"

Early Access Review
								So long have I waited for a game like Starbound and Terraria...Crea fulfilled my wish! While using already known elements, Crea also throws a great recipe research system into the mix. Innovative, crazy creatures and beautiful surroundings, many treasures to find and randomly generated dungeons.I have to confess, even after reading the developer's note about buying Crea on official release, I couldn't wait.Since that's the Early Access version, I will not complain about, but merely mention some negative aspects:- Before reaching ~lvl 10, the game is incredibly difficult (for a casual player). The monsters are a bit over the top. Especially, if you leave the starting biome too early, you will be confronted with permanent death.- High level requirements for items: even IF you manage to outrun and kite all the dangers, you might find a chest with very cool weapons...for level 20+. That is, if the chest is not locked in the first place. (In that case, you have to boost your explore skill high enough to enable the lockpicking perk. You will be pleased to find out that you have to craft lockpicks, plus, they have only a certain chance to open chests. Or look for a key within a dungeon)- the dungeons come with random parameters everytime you enter one (Awesome mechanic). But, you have to figure them out by trial and error. No explanation is given on how they actually affect you or the enemies. This is a minor issue though, because crafting the Dungeoneer buddy will help you sort through the different dungeon modifiers.- last but not least: at this point, the bowels of the planet ( volcanic fields) are pretty much empty, except for some stray teleporting monsters, who wanted to end their life by blinking into the lava.As mentioned before, this is absolutely acceptable for an Early Access. And these points don't make Crea a bad game, at all. I fell in love with it. And if you're into exploring, digging, building and crafting, you definetely should give it a try.Today, the 1.0 build should be released and I am looking forward to it. Get this game, ladies and gents! Support the devs, they created something beautiful, here.			"

												9/10, very enjoyableI'm not too far in, only 7 hours, but I have to say I'm enjoying it so far. Everyone goes into this game comparing it to Terarria, so I will make my points comparing the two for those of you, whom like me, want something worth playing in the same genre. The crafting system does take some getting used to, but i like the combat and RPG element.  The more the use particular skills, the more points you get to level up the tree those skills are in.  It's a neat system that encourages you to use whatever playstyle you like without having to rely heavily on gear for modifiers.  I've seen people complain that it can be grindy, but I don't see it anymore in this game than in Terarria (which i put EXTENSIVE time into, about 800 hours).  Sure, you have to grind out some baddies to get materials, but i remember building grind traps in Terarria and sitting there for hours on end collecting mats.  I like that you can customize your toon into a class build without having to rely specificly on armor sets, something I did not enjoy about Terarria.  The collecting/gathering is done well.  You can upgrade your gathering skill and collect large amounds of tiles at once, instead of having to chip away 1 at a time, another thing I am enjoying over Terraria. I do prefer Terarria's highlight mode, which will allow you to auto dig tunnels in a diagonal fashion to form easy stairs up or down.  This is something I haven't quite been able to perfect in Crea yet. They have mini-instances which you have to go into and complete objectives in order to escape.  They also have spawn rooms where you have to vanquish all the mobs and spawners, then you receive a huge loot stash.  So far, I feel both of those elemnts are rather rewarding.  There are random chests and ore to stumble across, and even spells that will light up  said chests/ore for a brief period of time so you can better see them.  I did hate having to rely on Spelunker potions in Terarria, and those spells have made me incredibly happy so far.  The higher you level them up, the higher grade ore/chest will be highlights. They also employ a waypoint system which makes traveling around a lot easier than having to build minecart tracks all over the entire map.  Overall I think its pretty good.  I enjoyed Terraria. I am now enjoying Crea.  When i get toward end-game content, ill re-review and let you know if anything changes.  As of right now, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of gaming.  Just remember; It's not Terarria. It's Crea. Terraria was fun, and so far, Crea is fun ;)Edit:  5/10 fun to start, but flops in the end. Alright. So after putting in about 20 hours, I have some new opinions.  One thing that Terarria does well which Crea does not is events and bosses.  When the goblins spawn for the first time, or that first night when the Eye of Cthulu attacks, it's crazy exciting, and gives you an objective to complete.  Kill those baddies.  It may mean you need to get some better gear, change the layout of your house, enlist the help of a buddy, w/e.  Crea is dissapointlingly lacking in this department.  Around the 15 hour mark, I found myself just looking for the next set of gear... then realized... why?  There is no main objective.  I don't have a supreme being to kill, or waves of monsters to defend my home from.  It just becomes the same 20 monsters that you need to kill over and over w/o any pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  In short, it gets boring.  I have not even needed to dig in the last 10 levels.  Everything you need can be obtained from monsters, spawners, and dungeons.  So I have this massive world, but have only explored 1/4 of it ( ran through the entire map to see the different biomes/monsters) and feel no reason to even bother checking out the rest.  I read up on the bosses to see if/when they would spawn, and it seems all of them are non essential to progress in the game and can be avoided entirely.  What started out as a really interesting game has, after a few days of play, fallen flat.  If you enjoy mindless repetition and have no desire to accomplish and ""end"" to a game, then Crea is for you!  As for me, not so much.			"

												I am not going into differences/ similarities of this game with Terraria, others have done that and have done a great job explaining. I am just going to tell you why I like Crea:- looks great and runs fine on my old labtop- great RPG and leveling up mechanics; this was the main reason that made me buy - lots of skills to learn and master!- fun one-way challenge dungeons and battle arenas- lots of treasures to discover and areas to explore- every enemy has a different attack strategy and you have to learn those and figure out how to beat it- there are actually enemies that only attack when you do, so you can actually spend some time doing your own thing without something trying to kill you every 10 seconds. BIG PLUS for me- relaxing music- so far no zombies- great active, enthusiastic and friendly developerBe warned- this game is addictive. Just played 8h straight, just thinking ""only going to level up one more skill"" and ""collecting some more ore for a new sword"".If you like 2D exploration, crafting, building and adventure games, you should give this a try. Very much recommended.			"

												I really want to like this game, but many aspects of gameplay bother me.Researching to create crafting templates is fun the first time through, but once I know how and what I can create it turns into a horrid grind if I ever start a new character.Being unable to move while breaking down blocks or interacting with objects make movement feel slugging and hindered.Again, I really want to like this game. Crea takes RPG aspects that add great value to gameplay that are simply not found in other version of the same gametype; such as Terraria.UPDATED REVIEWI was asked to re-review this game, so here she is!To be honest, it felt more or less like the same game. There was more content, which is awesome. The workshop which is amazing, and excellent addition to a game such as this, even the controls felt better than I remembered. So in essence, almost everything I complained about in my previous review is either fixed, or generally better.But still I cannot recommend this game.This may be simply because the games RPG elements stand out compared to a lot of other game within this niche genre, but doesn't hold up to what I expect out of those RPG elements.It is nothing personal, I just don't feel like the game goes the same places I would like it to.

Early Access Review
								It reminds me of the things I liked about Terraria; it doesn't have too much complex graphical detail, it's not hard to learn, and it has transferable characters in sandbox worlds! Though this game holds different things I like, for example the random dungeons spawned from crystals and learning recipes using different resources. Also, while Terraria does allow upgrading one's health, mana and accessory slots, this game extends on the ability to power up your character however you see fit.			"

												EDIT 25 October 2016:- http://steamcharts.com/app/280520 - game is never played, IE dead- Bugs still not fixed-- Can play a 50gb Deus Ex Mankind Divided on Ultra settings, but this game lags after an hour of play, still not fixed- Proof the developer gave keys for good reviews: http://i.imgur.com/FKot7Or.jpg--Don't buy, do not get scammedOriginal Review June 2016:I feel like I should review this game as a warning before you buy the game. There are still a lot of bugs in the game and probably should still be in Early Access. I specifically wait until games come out of Early Access before I buy them (I hate the idea of Early Access). This one fooled me by coming out of Early Access before it was time.TLDR: Game should still be in Early Access because of the bugs, otherwise would be a pretty good game (6-7/10). There are a few downsides that will never make it a great game, including level scaling. Read below for more information.Me telling my friend why Crea isn't good yet: https://www.twitch.tv/impalatv/v/73697872 (contains spoilers)My Impression:I love every type of creation game from Terraria to Slime Rancher. They all have their own personal touches that make them different from one another. I am not going to compare them since most reviews cover that, I will write this review as a warning before purchase. Also to note, most of the reviews are from people who received free press copies and reviewed it positive. I challenge you to go through the reviews and find someone who received a key for free with a negative review. They basically are giving free press keys for good reviews.I don't like the posts by people of ""Hey give the developers a chance, they are trying. Crea will be good when they finish with the bugs."" A good example of a successful launch by 1 man was Stardew Valley. Positive:+ RPG system added an innovation in the 2D sandbox genre (lots of skills, leveling, adds replayability)+ The usual Terraria style environment and world (Large/procedurally generated worlds)+ Menus are movable (I can move my inventory anywhere on my screen)+ Really good music, nice and relaxing+ Developer is somewhat active in the forums+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading cards+ ModsNegatives:- BUGS, tons of them. Current Issues by developer ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/280520/discussions/0/357288572119003683/ ) Huge memory leak issues ( https://steamcommunity.com/app/280520/discussions/0/357288572119430553/ ). It uses CoherentUI_host.exe. This is used in other games and almost every game it is used in it causes severe FPS and LAG. Google search CoherentUI if interested. It also opens 8+ processes that you will see if you view task manager in Windows. Also, let it be known that this is a <100mb install and still has huge memory issues.- Unusually long loading times- As someone else mentioned, starting a new character can be quite the grind with the learning recipe process. I wouldn't normally mind this but with the frame drops, my hardcore character has fallen. I should also note that with the randomly generated worlds, I happen to get one that spawned almost on top of a slime hut. I think Terraria has a way to avoid this.- Lack of menu options, such as the zoom feature is nice to zoom it, but you cannot zoom out. There is also a lack of video options and windowed borderless bugs out every so often.- Online multiplayer is not hosted by steam (I don't play multiplayer so it wasn't a problem for me, but I saw some confused people in the discussions)- No ladders/rope, makes moving around your ""home base"" much more tedious- Level scaling of monster and bosses (very tedious, lazy programming)- Great summary of things that are a downfall of Crea ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/280520/discussions/0/357288572133823227/ )Decent Game: 5/10Helpful review of Crea that has a recommend for it. I definitely agree with their points and even they admit that there are a lot of bugs ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982914211/recommended/280520/ )Helpful negative review ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/Docdra/recommended/280520/ )Best review ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006884898/recommended/280520/ ) You shouldn't have to watch a dev stream on twitch where he gets donations and subscriptions to get a bug fixed.

												I was going to start another game of Terraria when I decided that I have played that game so much that maybe a similar but fresh experience was in order. That's what I was hoping to find with Crea. Here is what I found:The leveling system seemed like a nice addition but quickly starts to feel formulaic when you realize that you are just fighting the same few monsters with the same strategies over and over as they level up along with you... until you learn how to abuse the quake spell to kill things from a distance. This may sound like a cheap solution but it is pretty hard to fight against enemies, some of which can do scummy things like hide and shoot at you from in the walls among other things that you have to avoid while combattng the most difficult enemy in the game: THE LAG. This game lags so much that I often find myself staring at the screen waiting to regain control of my character.In addition to the lag, this game is full of bugs and issues that should have been caught with even a minimal amount of playtesting. Sometimes I log in and am spawned in complete darkness in the ground. I defeat a dungeon only to think I'm trapped until I realize that the crystal needed to exit is hidden in a lava lake. Items randomly get deleted from my inventory. The mod system is a mess and easily breaks your world.If this game were in early development, I could understand all the issues and I might have even looked forward to seeing how it came along but as a game that had it's full release over half a year ago, I can't recommend buying it. I guess I'll start that Terraria world after all.			"

Product received for free
Crea is a sandbox procedurally-generated crafting game with really nice graphics and interesting mechanics.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:The principle is the same as in most other similar sandbox game: you have to kill monsters, gather resources, explore, craft and other things all in order to survive and make progress. Since there are many other similar games of this genre, the quality of the game is really important in order to beat the competition and this game certainly has the potential to do so.Pros: Graphics | The first noticeable thing is of course what this game looks like. It sure does look nice, I especially liked the little windows for crafting, researching and inventory. Also, when the night comes, torches emit warm light which truly looks amazing. Leveling | For most actions, you get some experience points and, after a while, you can level up in the action you were performing. For example, chopping down a lot of trees gets you a higher level of Gather. You also get a point to spend on your stats, such as Intelligence or Stamina. Researching and Crafting | Before you can craft anything, you have to research it first. I found this really enjoyable, since I got that ""what am I going to get now?"" feeling every time I was going to research something. This also adds another great thing, which is uncovering the items gradually and this helps the player get familiar with them at his own pace. When you feel like you need some more items, you just do some research and hopefully, you get something you like. Two Modes | So, you basically have two loadouts: one for fighting and one for ""friendly"" activities, such as gathering resources and placing items. In my opinion, this is a really good idea, since in some other games you have to switch to specific items manually and it can be quite confusing, but here it's as easy as pressing a button (literally) to be ready for a fight.  Exploring | There is a surprising amount of content waiting to be discovered in this game. There are portals, hidden chests and a lot of other things. This is another one of those things that make this game better. Singleplayer and Multiplayer | You can play alone, but if you ever feel like you need some company, you can find yourself a server and play with others. Both are good. Steam Integration | This game has Trading Cards and Achievements. It also has Cloud and Workshop support, which is really awesome. Availability on Different Platforms | Crea supports all three major operating systems. Nothing else to add, it's just good to see that devs are actually caring about that.Cons: Lack of Dedicated Servers | There aren't any ""official"" servers in existence right now, so you have to do some work yourself to find a community-ran server you can play on. This should be fixed, since not everybody has enough patience to find a server manually. Unfriendly to Beginners | You don't get many things explained in this game, you mostly progress by discovering things yourself. This can be really hard for some people (read: me) and it may present quite a barrier for people who are trying to get started with Crea. This a common problem with games of the same genre, I guess they just assume that we know everything from similar games. Resource Usage | This game really requires a long time to get itself started. I can sometimes hear my computer struggling. However, I have never seen any lags or FPS drops, so I'm not sure what to think about this.The final verdict:Crea is most certainly a wonderful game. It looks good, it's very interesting and really entertaining. Although it may be hard for some people to get started, the enjoyment afterwards certainly exceeds the hassle at the beginning. If you like sandbox games, to give Crea a try, in my opinion it's worth it.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

												Your first reaction may be that this game is a ripoff of other games.I loved Terarria. I loved Starbound. I love this game even more.WHY?The combat and levelling system. It brings the game style to a whole new level. Do you like to craft? Your skill improves as you use it. Do you like to fight? As everything else, you get better as you progress. Also, some variety of enemies make the game more interesting.HOWEVERThe game runs slow for many, much like Starbound, including myself. I suffer through it, as I think its worth it, but you may not be so inclined.BUT...The developer (who is quite active) has narrowed the problem down to the UI, and is completely re-doing it, not a small task. It will take time... BUT when its done, I'm sure the game will be so, so, so much better. And then this game will really shine.SHOULD YOU BUY IT?If you liked the aforementioned games, and are intrigued by the levelling system, then by all means, you should give it a go. Keep in mind the optimization issues... but if the game is too slow for you, you will know right away and can request a refund.Also, if you're new to the genre, I would recommend this game the most out of the three. The game does have a tutorial that introduces some basics, and the rest isn't that hard to figure out. Still, if you're having problems, the Crea community is friendly and helpful, so don't be afraid to check out the discussion boards.All in all, I recommend this game over the other three, not only for the content I touched on, but also because this game has the most potential of becoming better.My final suggestion: if you're adventurous, give it a try now... you can refund immediately if you have issues. But when the update comes (eventually, be patient), this game should be a must have on your list (if it lives up to the hype).Anyway, I'll try to remember to update this review when the game is updated, and let you know of my performance difference.Suggest you read the discussion board ""What Makes Crea Different?"" if you're curious.http://steamcommunity.com/app/280520/discussions/0/357288572117808789/ "

												Having played it from the start for a good amount of hours and having lots of experience with 2D Sandbox games as a whole I would like to share my thoughts with you folks!Crea is a truly refreshing game that goes in a lot of different directions , most notably it's very much an indepth RPG game compared to others in the genre like Terraria/Starbound where most of your character relies on what gear you're wearing. In Crea however you'll be leveling up your character through lots of different means , by crafting , combat , exploring , magic and gathering too. This works nicely as you're always working towards something on your character and you can't just rush it down in no time , the progress you make feels meaningful and thus your character ends up being a lot more valuable and unique , especially as you'll be able to divide up 2 points to stats per character level up. This allows you to tweak some stats your way as much as you want , want to be more tankier? Get more health and so forth.The research system is also a thing of great fun and really allows you to start from scratch in this game and just work your way up , you don't really have to check wikis or anything like that instead you'll research materials and gain new items/gear to craft that way. It really makes for a good incentive to gather new items , to find new biomes and to kill to new monsters and bring that all back to base to see if there's anything new hiding within the drops!I love the crafting system aswell as you're able to in a very similar fashion to Final Fantasy XIV take part in a crafting minigame for pieces of armor/weapons to try and make the quality better , to give it a better roll in stats and potentially lots more stats. You can also just craft the old fashioned way and hope RNG smiles in your way , so either way it's a very nice bonus!The aesthetic to Crea I've loved from day one , especially since I spotted the first boss , to me it has a unique style that differentiates itself from other 2D Sandbox games superbly. Music wise it's such a relaxing damn game , especially the main theme just tinking away in the background as you go mining or just walk around this strange world is a great joy. All in all I very much enjoy Crea and really wanted to do my part and provide my side of why I dig the game and whaat makes it unique. If you want to see something further indepth on it I'll include the video I made on it originally down below , thank you guys a lot for reading and hopefully it wasn't a terrible read!

												Crea offers compelling exploration, gathering, crafting, building, and character customization experiences. Unfortunately, it also offers a poorly explained ""chaos"" system that may or may not pertain only to crafting and terrible controls. Be prepared to unexpectedly fall and to be overrun by enemies while switching item and spell sets or trying to use your grappler.Combat is rarely fun regardless of weapon choice or enemy type and it is often very difficult, like when ghost-like enemies called Harvesters move and shoot through terrain in a tight cave system, killing you without much of a chance. Some monsters seem to trigger a jarring player-character teleport like what happens in some network games when players have network latency issues. I did find a boss or something rather boss-like that seems to be invulnerable until one figures out how to drop its shield or does so by accident, but I haven't yet defeated it because it and its minions are better at attacking me than I am at fumbling with Crea's controls.The user interface could use some work too. For example, the set-switching feels clunky (especially while in combat), it looks and feels strange to have placeable items hovering at the mouse pointer when I just want to gather or harvest, and after picking up a spell or item icon there does not seem to be a way to cancel dragging the icon (e.g., the escape key, which closes overlays). On top of all of that, overlays just kind of end up all over the place, blocking the view of the game environment. It would be nice if they could be more neatly arranged and controlled (e.g., auto-arranged, snapped, and toggled in sets) and perhaps translucent.Hopefully Crea will improve in time. I am sure many people will enjoy the game as it is, but it stopped being fun for me long before I could discover all it has to offer.			"

Early Access Review
								After 20 hours of gameplay in 3 days, it's well past time for me to give some feedback. Please note that this may contain spoilers for newer players.Combat:The combat system is intricate and diverse. You can go from being a magic-wielding battlemage to a deadly archer to a brutal melee character, with no long-term effects if alternating between different playstyles. You have a lot of unique skills that can be used to kill enemies, defend yourself, or heal yourself. There are 4 different weapons; bows, swords, spears, and magic. Bows are the most powerful of the 4 in terms of damage. The ammo is fairly simple to get assuming the player isn't using the bow for every minor encounter. Pros:Easy-to-get ammoHigh damage outputCons:Occasionally on shooting, the trajectory is a good bit off of what one would expect. You can more easily see what I am describing when shooting down at enemies. Swords are the next weapon and the better of the two melees. They are dangerous to use in comparison to other weapon types.Pros:Infinite usageCons:Limited to ground or low-flying enemiesDangerous to use, even with melee armorMagic is the third strongest of the 4 in my opinion. It is diverse in terms of skills, simple in terms of weapon types.Pros:Ranged attacksUtility and damage skillsCons:Wands have short ranged attacks that make them difficult to useLow damage outputSpears are the final weapon. They are not very good at all.Pros:Cons:Hard to use; aiming at enemies that are in you is practically impossible.The combat weapons are interesting as there are a lot of them to use. Swords will limit players' abilities to button mash as there is a better way to swing that involves timing and precision rather than button-mashing. The stamina limitation is understandable but a little bit unnecessary for attacks, in my opinion. The magic wands and skills drain stamina rather than mana or something else of the sort, which makes little sense. Although this avoids confusion, it isn't very realistic.Crafting:The crafting system is clever and fun. Crea has modifiers just like Terraria, however these modifiers are applied to weapons via a system called Chaos crafting. After playing a short minigame, the end quality that you score is then used to determine the quality of the modifier you receive. The system is interesting and better than Terraria's reforging system as it doesn't involve mass amounts of currency and the end quality of an item can be controlled through skill progression. In addition to Chaos crafting, the other notable mechanic of crafting is research. Researching a recipe is necessary in order to craft it, and the researching is done by consuming crafting ingredients. The system only allows you to research items that for sure are used in something, and as far as my experiences go the consumption of an item guarantees you are on step closer to the end of a recipe. This system is a great way to create progression and it is a clever one overall. Bosses:The bosses in Crea aren't the best in my honest opinion. Although they are unique, the actual implementation is lacking.Sano:Sano is the first boss you will fight, generally speaking. The fight involves you to bring down the shield around her by using her own attack on her, and then you attack her like crazy during the 10 seconds before she resummons her shield. The fight is fun and challenging. The part about her that I don't like is that there isn't a clear goal to go to after defeating her. Dormian:Dormian is the second boss in the game. Dormian is the opposite of Sano in that the goals after the boss fight are clear but the actual boss fight is poor. The reason I say this is because the boss fight comes down to attacking the right clone of him to bring his health down. The actual attacks he uses are balanced and fun, however figuring out how to attack him is very complicated. After already defeating him, I still don't completely understand the logic behind which is attackable and which isn't. It came down to a game of attacking random ones so that when they all shifted again one of the ones I attacked would lower the health of the others. Miscellaneous:-Numerous bugs are in the game, however numerous bugs are being fixes every single day by the developer. -Performance issues that include massive drops in FPS that happen periodically. Performance was greatly increased over Weekly Update #23, however.-A longer tutorial that detailed parts of the game beyond Chaos crafting (remnas, for example) would be much appreciated by newer players. This is especially important due to the lack of an up-to-date wiki. -The developer, Jasson is very active and friendly. Numerous bugs are fixed each day and the developer is very helpful on the forums. It is great for the future of the game to have such a developer working on it and helping its community.			"

												In its current state, I do not recommend this game. Definitely not to people to who want to play a game like Terraria and spend hours upon hours on it.There is simply not enough content.And when I played, there were so many bugs; to the point where I wondered how this game released as a finished product. It should still be in early access.Don't get me wrong though; Jasson is an awesome, friendly developer, he listens to his players & also streams development on Twitch quite often. He is rolling out very frequent updates & bug fixes for the game.This review should not defer you from buying the game. Granted, the game is not the best it can be at the moment, you should try it out for yourself as I believe it will be in the future. And you can definitely get several hours of gameplay in before it gets boring.tl;drThis game has great potential, but it needs more content & much bux fixing done until it can reach Terraria-level. However, It is not a bad purchase, so don't be afraid to try it out. "

												Thus far this game has exceeded ALL of my expectations! I came in expecting another build, craft, survive, game much like Terraria and Starbound...that's not what this is.The combat system feels much more skill based at times (timing combos for more damage, knowing the reach on your next combo swing, and even buffing prior to combat or mid combat). The crafting system is more along the lines of Starbound, you have to unlock the recipes, and you'll spend plenty of time unlocking all recipes. The building feels familiar, and while there are no impending threats (pirates, goblins, etc... attacking your base, or even zombies at night or even ANYTHING moving to attack you) there are plenty of enemies and they can certainly be difficult, especially when you're out numbered!The dev, Jasson, is AWAYS diligently working on the game and is very friendly and transparent! It's rare to find a dev as open as Jasson, and I definitely recommend checking his stream out on twitch sometime!10/10 Yes, play this one!			"

Early Access Review
								Crea it's a Sandbox RPG style with a interesting crafting system that you need to research to know a part of a recipe and receive scraps from researching any item you found mining, choping, killing monsters etc..The skilling sytem it's very good that gives you xp for each thing you do, if you chop, you get gathering, if you mine, you get mining, crafting you get xp that you can improve things and get better and better...The art of the game reminds a bit terraria but it's not a ""clone"" every game have they diferences but they have some equal too, the art it's simply and beaultiful letting us to enjoy the view of sunrise and the music are something to feel too.. And it has workshop Yay!If you like exporationThat is for youIf you like crafting system that you need to put in workThat is for youIf you like leveling upThat's for youit's worth			"

Early Access Review
								Crea is another entry in the recently extremely popular 2D Sandbox genre. However, Crea is unique in that it acknowledges the roots of all this popularity, Terraria, and tries to build off of that with unique new mechanics while still trying to retain that core gameplay that we all know and love (or don't; it's all up to personal preference of course).For those who may not be familiar with the genre, Crea plays like most other 2D Sandbox RPG sort of games. You walk around a randomly-generated landscape, clicking on blocks to collect them, killing enemies along the way. As you gather more varied and rare materials, you are able to craft various items, including weapons, armor, furniture, tools, and a few other miscellaneous items. To be able to learn how to craft most of the items however, utilizing the research system is necessary. To research more advanced crafting recipes, you need to use a small quantity of each material you find to discover what uses you can make of them. This system was pretty neat in my opinion and I would love to see it become a staple of the genre.There are essentially three different ways of dealing with enemies in Crea: melee weaponry, ranged weaponry, and magic. Personally, I love using magic to sit back and pick off enemies from a distance, There isn't a large selection of magic or weapons, but there's still an adequate variety of them to dispose of any monsters in your path. There are also ""Divine"" spells that help to assist you with positive buffs or give some well-needed healing in dire situations.From a glance, Crea seems to be actually almost a direct rip-off of Terraria, just with a somewhat different art style. This isn't really true though, as Crea includes some great new additions to the typical 2D Sandbox game formula. To start with, Crea includes the usual gear-based progression system of acquiring new, more powerful weapons, tools, and armor as you acquire better, more valuable materials. Something possibly unique to Crea is its ""talent system"", where as you engage in combat, use spells, craft items, or research recipes you gain ""TP"", which can be used to boost each of the previously mentioned areas a bit. The more that you mine for example, the more TP you are able to gain to potentially make mining just a tad quicker. One thing that did bug me a bit when I had first started was that mining seemed to take quite some time, but after I crafted a snazzy new pickaxe and upgraded my mining talents things went much smoother.One very unique aspect of Crea is the ""conflict"" system in place. If you don't actively slay monsters, they will continue to grow in strength and numbers throughout the world. This was very noticeable when I had played, as I immediately went on multiple mining expeditions early on and never really fought monsters above the ground until I had the gear that I wanted. When I finally had crafted all the gear that I wanted to take on (supposedly) anything in my path, I discovered that when I came back to the surface new ""Paragon"" enemies that were larger and more deadly than the previous enemies had appeared and were proceeding to kick my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Monster spawners had also appeared quite rapidly throughout my world, and these were generating more and more monsters to add to my growing problem. This system is quite cool in my opinion, as it creates a unique conflict for the player personally- do you sit safely in comfort and idly gather more materials, or do you engage the problem at hand before it becomes harder and harder for you to safely stroll out in the world? In addition, monsters actively level up as you do, so there's never really an overly easy battle in Crea. Bosses are also in the game I've heard, though I have not encountered any in my time playing so far.A fast-travel system is additionally in place in Crea. As you explore your randomly-generated world, you are able to find Way Crystals that allow you to travel immediately to another crystal in the world that you've already found. These Way Crystals can also be found underground, which is convenient if you're able to find one while mining deep below the surface and want to quickly travel between your home and your mining area.Two features of Crea that I didn't delve very much into are multiplayer, which is supposedly new and thus has some early issues, and the extensive modding support the game includes. I did join one multiplayer server I had found from someone who left their IP address on the forums, and it was a bit of fun, but the multiplayer system did seem to be in its early stages for sure and there was a few small problems. The game currently is still in Early Access of course, so there's plenty of time for it to be cleaned up a bit more. I would like to see player names not just in the chat, but also above the players or maybe if you hover your mouse over them, and perhaps a basic server browser for those of us who may not have friends who also own the game or want to go hunting for public server IP addresses. Concerning the modding support in place, I honestly haven't delved into it much so far, but glancing at the forums on the developer's site, they seem to be very active in assisting any players wishing to create mods for Crea, and the system in place seems to be fairly easy to make mods to do nearly anything in the game. So far, no major mods seem to be out yet, but as the game is still fairly new hopefully fairly interesting mods are released.The sound design of Crea doesn't seem to be a major focus, so there's not much to say about it. The sound effects are basic, but they work. While not overly prevalent, the music featured in Crea is alright. I would prefer to be listening to more active tunes, but the current set of peaceful, calming music is still pleasant to listen to.Graphically, Crea features pixel sprites very akin to that of Terraria or Starbound, but with a slightly more fantasy theme. Two things in particular stand out, to me at least: the designs of the monsters and the backgrounds when above the surface. The monsters all have a fairly unique look to them- to the degree that it's difficult to relate most of them to something we're familiar with. Sure, there's some scorpions, sheep (called ""speep"" in the game), and birds, but also some very unusual bird-like creatures, rodents, sinister slimes, and even odder things deep beneath the surface. Most of the monsters seem to fit in perfectly with the fantasy theme of the game, and it helps to increase immersion for sure. Now, while not overly incredible, the backgrounds as you move from biome to biome above the surface are pretty to look at, and help to differentiate different biomes as they gradually change to a new background as you move from left to right or vice versa.While others may argue which is the best of the 2D sandbox genre, it's important to note that most of the games are still in-development and can't be fairly judged. Crea is likely one of the youngest games in the genre, and so it's difficult to fairly assess it in its current state. As it is, I really did enjoy my time with Crea. I was able to build a small home after a few hours of mining. I had fun with defeating monsters of varying strengths and sizes, and exploring the vast world I was in. I don't think that I've even begun to dig deep into the amount of content Crea has to offer, and thus I'm not if I can safely say how much I might potentially enjoy it. The game is also still in Early Access as I write this, so the amount of content and features that are in the game currently can only increase as time goes on. The developers are extremely active, and seem to have a great knack for talking with the community very often and answering any questions people may have on the forums. This is a game with a lot of heart and soul put into it, and so it appears that any issues the game might have will quickly be ironed out.I give Crea a 8.5/10 in its current state. "

												Loving this game so far! I strongly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Terraria. There are some things that Terraria doesn't do well that this game improves on:-Research systems removes the need to look up recipes-Blocks/bricks and walls are the same thing which makes building much easier-Separate toolbars for combat and crafting is amazing-Each monster has its own unique attack pattern that isn't just to run straight at you until you're dead-No need to rely on loot RNG to get core abilities like dash and double jump(And if you don't know Terraria, think Metroidvania meets Minecraft)I'm sure there are others but I still need to play more. Don't be concerned about developer support, he streams his development on Twitch and is already working on updating the game.			"

								Nice clean graphics, a massive crafting system, complex and diverse, yet easy to understand levelling system. This game has come a long ways.  And I believe it is going to go a lot further. Whats more, the devs actually release patches, sometimes same day as a direct response to issues brought forward. Hard to ask for better support than that.One of a few EA's that I can truly reccomend.If you like starbound, terraria and the like, you won't be dissappointed.			"

												I'm going to be blunt and honest. This game is fun, it has a worthwhile system. Everything you do grinds towards experience, you have a combo system on weapons and you have some neat magic. But, at the same time, it's still only worth being called an ""Early Access"" game. 1.2? It should still be in beta!The resourcing on this game is horrid. I have a 3.4GHZ, twice the minimal, with 8 GBS or ram. My graphics is more than capable but, regardless, I never get above 30 FPS. And the 30? It's there for a second before dropping back down to ten, if not lower. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I played till I even had silver gear! But I can't do it, it's too laggy.The developers do have a good idea of what they're doing but, as a lot of people said, the 'bosses' aren't worth doing. Dungeons are bland. Once they improve on the content and performance of the game? It's worth getting. But as it stands you'd be better off buying Planet Centauri, and it's still in beta. But Terraria is even better.If you can get it for cheap, and I mean less than $5, then I'd say Crea MIGHT be worth it. Otherwise? You're be better off looking elsewhere.			"

It has a very hard learning curve, but after learning how it works its a a very fun system. It might still be in early access but the game is pretty good untill now.

												In a word: Disappointing.Crea is yet another early access game that was put on Steam way too early only to be released in a state so bad the game feels rushed and unfinished. Fact is, Crea has been in development for years yet still feels unsatisfying to play. The dev remains active but so what? He obviously can't deliver. Check out how many things are busted in this game...Hit detection - you will often hit enemies and do no damage.Combat lacks any 'oomph' or excitement whatsoever.Crafting is messy and unappealing.Tutorials are terrible, especially the one on crafting.Inventory management is an endless hell.Research mechanism forces you to hoard *everything* in the game to progress (per character). No alts in this game.Several enemies are bugged and will charge up into mid-air or drop no loot.You can kill enemies through walls but they can't do the same, making combat a joke.The skill system - you'll have too many points to spend, overall.NPCs are boring, unintuitive and close to useless.Death does nothing.Night time is the same as day time. Why even bother having the cycle?There is no threat, no driving goal and no reason to build a base.Base building is clunky as heck.Even opening a chest will make your ears bleed...			"

												Crea is a great mix of Terraria's sandbox, Starbound's combat and a unique system of Crafting, Researching, and adventuring!Each character has the option of branching into any of the skills available, so no restricting classes. And you can swap between different combat styles with a press of a button. Tons of amazing furniture and building materials to make crazy complex and realistic houses and buildings. Hilariously fun for multiplayer and tons of player to player skill interactions that make boss fights more interesting! A great rpg experience from the very start!			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review- version 0.24.0 authored 08/12/2015I've played Terraria and Starbound. I honestly like both. Terraria especially was one of those watershed games for me that got me really excited for something different than I had played before. Somewhere along the way, Terraria stopped development. Later, Terraria began development again, but the original team was different. Because of this, my personal opinion is that Terraria is missing that certain something that makes me both want to keep playing, and to play again. My personal opinion is that Terraria just never reached it's full potential (yet).So why am I talking about Terraria in a Crea review? Ultimately, we tend to compare things as human beings. Terraria is the single most likelt comparison when looking at Crea. So the foundation of my opinion is partially based on what I didn't like about Terraria, wheras listing the good things about Terraria is less germaine to a Crea review.Let's make some of the obvious comparisons between Crea and Terraria; both are side scrolling 2D sandbox action/adventure games. Immediately you notice that both require chopping down trees and killing slimes for a primary ingredient needed to make torches. So very quickly it's impossible not to notice near identical design choices. Beyond some of these simple things though, we start to divert from the earlier same-genre games and Crea makes it's own niche.The glaring differences of Crea are still under development and that's an important thing to know at this point. Things like crafting research, which is required to progress and craft, actually may change to a smaller or larger degree; that is the nature of in development software. Moving forward, it's still important to realize the design goals that differ in this game.I mentioned research that is required for progression and to craft. It's not my purpose to expose the full mechanics in this review. I also feel it's part of the enjoyment of this game to experience these things for yourself. Suffice to say that the research system puts the player on a path that makes progression inherent in the game, regardless of your play style.To compare and contrast with Terraria, for the most part the player would only need make or find certain crafting tools, such as a forge, in order to unlock all recipes of a certain type. The crafting and, indeed, the exploration of Terraria comes down to mindless time sink, especially the first time through. In Crea, the system is more robust. It can feel grindy, but the game is actually slowed down. Nice tools like teleportation (which I'll not spoil by explaining) are therefore not overpowered as they provide the nice time saving boost they should be instead of just speeding up and already fast crafting progression like in Terraria.I hate to gloss over very important features like the RPG style level up systems, but again I don't want to spoil the discovery a new game brings. Just know that your character levels up from a traditional XP system from defeating creatures and other hostile entities. In addition, there is a ""talent"" system where you gain separate talent points and corresponding levels for each of several categories, including arms (melee and ranged weaponry), syle (magic), gathering (mining, forestry, other gathering), crafting (both crafting and research) and exploring. All activities earn TP (talent points) that can be spent to buy active and passive abilities. Again, I don't want to spoil too much so I don't want to give much info out here. Just know that some things like how well your mining tool works is partially tied to your experience using such tools as gained through gathering talent points. So it's not just a matter of getting a better pick. A better pick helps, but your character improves through experience as well, which makes the game more enjoyable for me as I progress regardless of whether I've stumbled on enough of a certain resource yet or not. Also, mining some of that dirt and stone actually pays off as you occasionaly earn some TP for it!Crafting on it's surface is very generic to the genre. However, there is a still-in-development system called ""Chaos Crafting"" which is really a sort of boosting mini-game. It is off-putting to some folks. It is not required to craft. You merely have the option to invest more time and some special resources to try to improve your crafted items. I have only dabbled with this system and I don't quite get it, but I look forward to using it in the future to make better items as I progress. Again, this is another example of game mechanics that slow the game down a little bit, add some challenge, depth, replayability, discovery and... fun!Speaking of fun, ultimately we play our games for the fun we have. If you play Terraria and liked it, you'll probably like Crea. If you felt Terraria was just not what you wanted, and you want a more RPG style game that has a little more organized progression, you'll likely prefer Crea. If you want to zoom to the end of the game in Terraria and despise climbing the progression ladder, best to stick to Terraria. If you're just not sure. then it comes down to the cost.Just to touch on the cost, I always felt Terraria was too cheap to not buy. I agree that EA games that are ""too expensive"" are not something I generally interested in. That's all a discussion for another place. But, Crea's price at this point is certainly open to criticism. For what it's worth, I don't think the dev's are really pushing their product, I really think their actions so far have proven they really just wanted some dedicated people willing to buy in that will help development. With the features available so far and the development pace, I'm personally very happy to buy at the current $15 US price.			"

Review Written on Monday, June 13th, 2016 Review As a 2D sandbox RPG, it's hard not to compare Crea to Terraria. Despite a somewhat similar pixel-art visuals and side scrolling adventuring, Crea has a lot to offer to be it's own game. While not a huge fan of the genre, I have still found the time spent so far to be enjoyable.Crafting is done by learning recipes through researching the different elements  you gather from exploring, or that you craft from the base materials. It's also nice that you're using the same blocks to build the side and back walls of your buildings. Combat is dynamic and doesn't feel too one-dimensional with various creatures fighting you in different ways. Some of them are also peaceful and won't attack you unless they're getting attacked first. The leveling and skills are interesting and the points you gain to spend in there areas are amassed through experience. If you're mostly avoiding fights, don't expect to have much points to spend to improve your fighting skills.This can be a bit problematic sometimes because, in the case of fighting, it takes a bit before you can craft decent equipment so you might struggle with the wildlife when trying to explore the world in search of crafting material for research and building. It's hard to fight until you get the hang of it and some decent equipment ans skills, and it's hard to improve your skills and equipment if you're having trouble exploring and dying from attacks. Some type of monsters can only be found in certain areas so you sometimes need to grind for items that you need to explore a different area. (Like gathering wood and oil to make torches before doing some underground exploration.)While the game adds elements of lore that you can find through your explorations, the content feels a bit thin. There's also little to no explanation about some elements of the game (like teleport crystals) and you're left to find out for yourself what they're for.Overall, the game has enough to offer for fans of the genre. With the limited content, it's probably better to have people to play with to make the experience more enjoyable, but even as a single player game it's easy to sink quite some time into this.Rating: 7.6/10 Pros: Recipes are learned from researchDynamic combats which requires varied strategiesRPG elements with stats and skills progression.Relaxing music scoreAbility to mod the game Cons: Content is a bit thinA bit hard to get startedSome things are confusing and aren't explained.The GUI can get in the way at timesNo dedicated server for multiplayer Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games "

												Very good game for people who enjoy 2d sandbox games. Don't expect it to be just like Terraria or Starbound. It is similar enough for you to enjoy but takes an entirely different route when it comes to combat. The combat system is unique and smooth. The devs are great and respond well to feedback as well. 10/10 would buy again.			"

												In short, very disappointing. It's got some neat ideas and a nice theme, but as far as gameplay goes, I regret buying it. Combat is clunky, crafting is slow due to the way things are organized, and it doesn't feel like there's much to find aside from random dungeons.It might improve at a later date, but don't buy this as it is. If you must, wait for a really, really good sale.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing the Crea beta since the third phase started and Crea was available to all Kickstarter backers. The game has a lot of potential, and in a market that has spawned a lot of Terraria style of games, Crea manages to have its own unique style and feel that helps it stand apart from the crowd. Early game progress is slow, and the learning curve is a little steeper than something like Starbound, but once you've managed to get nice gear and delve deep into the underworld you feel as though you've accomplished something.One big selling point of Crea for me, that lead me to back the project on Kickstarter in the first place, was the concept of developing from the ground up for complete mod support. The code is all exposed so the community will be able to help shape the game long after the initial release.While Crea has run into some development issues in the past, Jasson and Kelley have been active in the community and open and forthright during the entire process.If you're a fan of Terraria and felt that Starbound didn't quite scratch that itch Crea might have what you're looking for. I've been playing the game on the DRM free version, so my Steam time played is deceptive. I've probably put over a hundred hours into various characters across the different builds of Crea since I started playing several months ago, and imagine I will find myself playing quite a bit more once the multiplayer functionality is a bit more stable. Multiplayer is where games of this nature, in my experience, really shine.			"

								This is a borderline recommendation for a game that looks and plays like Terraria and Starbound. However, this game does have some things setting it apart. The main difference is the RPG elements attached to it, where you can basically level up everything and even acquire new skills. Yet while the game has some neat features going for it, it also does some things wrong. And it is for that reason I can't recommend this game for everybody, so read on and/or watch my video to find out if this game is for you.


YouTube™ Video: Crea Quick Look

			Noble of Lost Pause plays Crea, a 2D sandbox game currently in early access. To put it simply, combine an RPG and Terraria together and you get this game.		

For those who want the basical summary, here's a concise pros and cons list of my thoughts.+The RPG elements of leveling your skills to make you fight, mine, and even craft better is very nice. You're not even limited on what path to take, so you can take every bonus you want for melee, ranged, magic, or building. It doesn't matter.+The sandbox world keeps you wondering what is out there and encourages you to explore. There is even plenty of caverns that lead into the depths of the world, so you don't have to mine everything over and over again.+By far the best feature I've seen from this game is the ability to use materials in nearby chests when you're crafting. No more sorting or looking through chests to find that one monster drop you picked up long ago. The game automatically senses you have it, and you just hit the craft button.+There's only one tool you have to upgrade that chops down trees and mines. You're not forced to choose between axes, pickaxes, or hammers.-The mining in this game is an absolute chore. It takes forever to mine out a path through the earth or ores, even after upgrading your tool a few times. It just drags the game out needlessly. The fact that it's only one block at a time and you have to set your mouse directly on it to mine doesn't make it any better either.-In order to craft things, you have to first research all the parts in order to make it. I actually liked this at first, but then my opinion changed after the first hour since the researching costs you the material, so you have to keep farming the same thing over and over again. Throw in the fact that you have to keep tossing away the same item multiple times for different recipes, and you're just gonna find yourself in an awkward place like I did where I was on the verge of making progression, but I either lacked a material to make the item, or I lacked a material to research so I could make the item. Combine it with the above negative and the fact you don't know what the item may be, and you got yourself in an annoying situation.-The monster spawn rate in this game varies way to much. Often times I never get a single baddie for ages, even when I'm mining deep down. This is terrible because you need a drop from a certain mob to make torches, but when you can't find it and run out of torches, you're forced to go all the way to the surface again and farm a monster that is sometimes a pain to find. But then there are times where my screen starts getting swarmed, and not with the mobs I wanted.-Some of the abilities are really underwhelming. I wanted to be a mage and maxed my fireball spell. Now while it did do more damage, the spell was just rubbish. It has cooldown of a few seconds that makes it really awkward to use. The animation finished in the blink of an eye, but for some reason, your dude can only stare at his enemy and let himself get wailed upon. Combine it with the paltry damage it does and the mana bar that limits its use, and spells become really worthless. Heck, the ice and fire spells both function the same to but only have a different sprite firing out. And when I found out my crappy copper dagger did more damage then my maxed spell, I just gave up on being a caster.-Because of the above, this game has a terribly slow pace. After 4 hours of playing this, I feel like I barely got anywhere, and it's not a good feeling.So yeah, you may be wondering why I recommended this game after the big negatives I listed. Well, it's because I still enjoyed myself somewhat. I wanted to explore more and find out what skills I would get and what the world had to offer. That's the mark of a promising sandbox game.But to be perfectly clear, I believe you can only enjoy this game if you liked a really slow, relaxed experience. If you want something more exciting, then I strongly suggest you go to terraria or starbound. But just keep in mind that this is early access, so maybe the devs will change the pace, or maybe they won't. So if you're still on the fence, it may be best to wait until this gets released. This has the potential to be up there with the big hitters, so I hope to see it go places.			"

												I originally gave this game a negative review, but that was a mistake. I found that exploring and terraforming (digging a lot everywhere) was my key aspect. The main developer (Jasson) was very kind and honest about asking me questions about my review. This game, however, is still progressing, but so far it is just amazing. Now, I will move onto the pros and cons that I have thought of.Pros: - Developers are very kind and nice, (I have read forums and I have seen Jasson and a few others responding, which I thought was very generous.) - Has a great RPG style, with its variety of abilities, armors, and weapons of choice. - Exploring and digging were 2 of my favorite parts about this game, because that's just the type of player I am in games. - Bosses are actually tough no matter how far you are in the game, which adds for a neat challenge, where you will actually have to strategically find the pattern of the bosses attacks and learn how to avoid them. - Game has much variety. (Ores, weapons, armors, etc.) - Weapons/Armor/Tools do not break, which got me about 11.50% more into this game. - Artwork is very cool. Cons: - Still in progress, just needs more bosses and enemies.  - Grinding sometimes takes a while and is lengthy, but the reward you get is great. - Game is a bit slow, in terms of framerate, but as long as it runs, I'm ok. - Researching is a bit tedious, due to having to use materials to research items that use those materials.Overall, this game is still progressing, but what it is with right now is just absolutely great. The developers and community are also amazing. Overall, just an amazing game as it is.8.7/10			"

												Crea is a cute sandbox RPG with procedurally generated worlds that is heavily inspired by Terarria; therefore, if you enjoyed playing Terarria, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this one too. Even more so, since Crea extends what Terarria offers with a few new features that are very entertaining and nice.One of the most important features is the leveling system: everything you do in Crea gives you experience points, categorized by what you do to gain them. The XP are not added only to your character level, but they're also split according to the action you perform: exploring will give you XP in the Exploration category, mining or cutting wood will give you XP in the Gathering area etc. In addition to that, there's a talent system - according to the level you have in an area, you can unlock passive or active abilities that make your character stronger or increases your gathering or crafting skills.The two main aspects of these kind of games are split in two separate interfaces - there is a setup for survival mode (combat) and another setup for the gathering mode (building); each of these setups comes with two separate toolbars that you can customize according to your needs. Switching between the setups or the toolbars is very easy (one key press). However, having this kind of design makes it a bit difficult during early levels to perform both combat and gathering during the night, since switching to combat mode makes you lose the only source of light you have, leaving you in complete darkness to fight with your enemies, unless you put down a torch every few steps. This problem falls away at later levels by the time you acquire luminescent weapons or a spell that conjures a light orb that follows you.The enemies are of various types and come with different fight mechanics: some of them should be meleed from behind, others can be killed easier using ranged weapons. This makes good use of the double toolbar setup for the combat mode, since you'll need to have both a melee set of weapons and a ranged one. I found the difficulty of the enemies at lower levels a bit too high, even on easy mode - they do a lot of damage; you need to parry or dodge a lot since the majority of them can kill you in 2 hits.Crea has Dungeons, how cool is that!!! Independent areas on the map, that despawn after completion, dungeons provide a lot of fun and... very cool loot(since you can snatch all the goodies and fill your house with shinies) :)The crafting aspect of the game is extensive; you can craft the plain old way, by one-clicking (oh and by the way, crafting with this method is instant, there's no progress bar or waiting time until you get your desired item). As an alternative to that, the game features Chaos-mode, which is a mini game that makes use of crafting talents gained through leveling in order to produce better or more items. The crafting recipes are discovered by researching but you are only able to research recipes you have mats for. On one hand, this limits your crafting possibilities to items that you have mats for. On the other hand, you can't see a full list of everything that can be researched; if you want to craft a fancy item, you won't know in advance what you need to gather in order to research it, unless of course you spoil it for yourself by consulting the Wiki.The clean interface features moveable windows, which is very useful while crafting, either for organizing your inventory and the needed mats or for comparing the stats between the crafted gear and the equipped one. However, even with these moveable windows, I found it quite annoying that I don't have any indication when a mob attacks me while having my screen full of these windows. I believe that a blinking screen or a red border would be very useful in this case.The basics of the game are summarized into a short and concise tutorial; the information that it provides is in my opinion enough not only to get you started, but also to make you understand the mechanics of the game; the rest is left to the player's own exploration.Apart from some small bugs that didn't disturb my gameplay enjoyment too much, I had only one problem with the game: it consumes quite a lot of PC resources despite the fact that it shouldn't; the lighting or having multiple things happening in the background is very CPU hungry, often causing spikes; after 3-4h in game my PC already starts to struggle with the high CPU usage and tabbing out doesn't help it at all. Since the developer is quite active in the forums, I have faith that this optimization issue will soon be addressed and fixed.I had a lot of fun playing Crea so far. I feel that it's a wonderful and well designed game that is worth the asking price. For the nice graphics, hours of entertainment, Steam integration with achievements and workshop, I highly recommend this game.Note: A key has been provided by the developer with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. My personal opinions about this game are not influenced by this.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

								As both an RPG fan and having put in quite some time in games like Terraria and Starbound, this game caught my interest; I've enjoyed the environment of the game combined with the status building of your character that you don't really see in the others I mentioned, and while the game is currently in early access, it's been a great time, and I have had very few issues with the game. A responsive developer is always a great bonus too; looking forward to the things to come in the future.			"

								I am someone who liked Terraria. I liked Minecraft a lot, too. I love open world games that are full of exploration, lots of things to do, and lots of loot to drown yourself in. 2d side scrolling games like this tend to be called Metroidvania games. I first got Crea many months ago and it was rough, unpolished and hard to play. I waited. MANY updates have come out since then so I decided to give it another try a few weeks ago. I am glad I did.Crea has an in-depth crafting system that actually takes a bit of thought to figure out. You don't just have materials, you have crafting methods. They call it Chaos Crafting. There's a variety of crafting techniques to apply while you are crafting something. It's up to you to find a combination that works well. If you do, you can get some amazing results. The enemies in Crea are likewise as well thought out. You can't just run up and whack and enemies like you do to Terraria's slimes. Enemies in this game have different attacks, but they all have certain patterns that you can figure out. What the game needs most is variety in what the player experiences. Once you craft that next tier of armor and weapons you're off to do more of the same, just in a higher level area, battling the same monsters who are simply higher level. The game does have biomes, but as of this review, they're only surface biomes that don't mean a whole lot at the moment. However, the game is solid enough and enjoyable enough that the $15 price tag is well worth it at this point. Combat is a blast in this game. Since development is still very much underway who knows what we might see for the biomes or maybe even new, different underground zones. Crea has a ways to go before it could be a contender for king of Metroidvania Mountain. It's not there yet. It's got a ways to go. But it's certainly headed in the right direction.			"

												Review Written on Sunday, June 5th, 2016 Review So, Crea is a 2D Sandbox rpg sorta like Terraria, Edge of Space, or Starbound. However it's not just another clone, it has similarity but has its own unique way of playing. So you start of with basic tools and weapons, typical stuff you'd find in these sorts of games. However, You have and attack and build/gather mode which you can swap in between. It takes some time to get used to that, tho is a really nice feature when you get down to it. You have a hotbar for both combat and build, so you don't have to have a gather tool or block in your combat mode bar. You can also have 2 hotbars for each mode, so you can have a different set of weapons and skills. That being said, you gain experience for each thing you do, like killing mobs gives you combat exp, crafting gives crafting exp etc. Once you gain enough exp you get talent points which are used for various things like new combats skills, or skills to help you mine faster etc. There is fair amount of skill, so I won't list them off. As you progress you character gains stats, standard rpg mechanics. You can add points for more health, stamina, strength etc.The combat, is well not the greatest but not bad either. You swing in a upward motion which is kinda odd, other then that its fine. You also get magic, which uses your stamina bar. I haven't done very much magic but it seems really cool. Combat could use a bit of work, tho. The sound effects for it are kinda lacking, however they are planning to add more in later.Now on to the crafting, pretty standard stuff here gather materials and build. However, you'll need to research items in order to build new ones. Some thing require, one item to research other take more as you discover items. Once you research and item you can craft it. When crafting you can also add modifiers to it, not sure how it all works yet as the tutorial doesn't really help much. There is much more to do, and much more I haven't discovered yet.Final thoughts, Its a pretty good game if you are into like Terraria and such games. However it does have a few bugs, and bad frame rate at times. Those are likely to improve as patches come out. The game releases soon so you can either buy it now or wait.Rating: 8/10Pros: Replay value, since you can build your characters differentlyConstantly UpdatedLots of contentSkill progression, gives the game more of sense of accomplishmentMultiplayerCons: Combat is okMissing textures sometimesBad frame rate dropsSome bugsCrafting and researching needs to be explained betterLack of sound effects, which they are going to add.

Early Access Review
								I don't usually write reviews, TL;DR at the bottom.From what I've played, It seems pretty great to me. The RPG/Explorer is a sucker thing for me. I love how the crafting elements is so immersive, you must research in-game to figure out how to craft new things. The combat system has multiple spells and it's own specific point system. (I.E Style has Style points and Craft has its own Craft points.)This may be odd, but I'm sensing a backstory on the whole world of Crea. For example, why is it when I hover my mouse across certain things, various letters are scattered, seemingly like they're missing? Who is Renma? Why is a feather a sign of forgiveness?There are 2 modes in this game, Build and Combat. You must press R to switch in between which is a bit annoying, but with time you'll get used to it. Also, the graphics are absolutely beautiful for a pixel game. Now, there are some bad things in the game. For example, the beginning enemies can be WAYYYY too diffucult if you're difficulty is set to normal. Most of the Ink-slime thingies are level 7 straight off the bat, while you're stuck at level 1. Other than a couple few annoyances (rarely happen), it's a well polished game.Also, kudos to the developer for being so helpful and responsive. I read about a guy who watched his stream, and the Developer was taking reports for bugs live on stream! I love it when developers feel like they're actually there, unlike most developers. *cough Chucklefish *cough*Another thing I'd absolutely LOVE is more in-depth on the story. How was the world of Crea created? Most of the ingrediants in the game have some lore attached to it. (I.E The Renma core or whatever it's called) Little notes scattered across the terrain or in caves would be absolutely amazing to have since it intrigues the player to discover and explore more.TL;DRWant an upgraded version of Terraria? Want a developer that actually gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Want a (somewhat) intruguing lore and backstory? Want a level-up system that actually matters? Want a combat system that lets you fight however YOU want to fight? Want a beautiful game?Then go for this. Prepare to be a little annoyed though at some bugs (I.E Character not showing on create screen), but it's in Early Access so it's alright. "

Crea is a 2D procedurally generated sandbox RPG. It finally left “Early Access” and I was excited to try it out. The game requires many hours of gameplay to be able to explore it fully. This is my first impressions review after playing for a few hours.Let’s start with the good stuff:Crea’s visuals can be described as “cute”. Colorful 2D pixel graphics. Everything is a little bit too tiny (I preferred to play with 150% zoom) but overall looks good. Music is nice and relaxing. There is a lot of content: a huge world to explore, tons of skills to learn, recipes to find and items to craft.Crafting system is pretty extensive but beginner friendly. There are so many items you can create and build. It is not available right off the bat. You unlock it by leveling up and researching recipes and materials.  Combat is challenging even when playing on “Easy”. Especially in the beginning before you get a chance to upgrade your character and find or craft better weapons and armor. Unique monsters with different attacks and behavior. Some are very aggressive and will attack the moment they see you, the rest will only attack if provoked.Developer is very hands-on with regular updates, progress reports and even Twitch streams. I recommend watching those if you want to learn more about the game and the people behind it.Steam Workshop support (modding is highly encouraged). Steam achievements, cards and badges. Here is what I didn’t like:My main problem with the majority of sandbox games (and that includes Crea) is a lack of proper in-depth tutorial. There are a couple of tips at the beginning of the game that only explain very basic mechanics. Everything else you have to learn on your own, usually by trial and error. Some quests or tasks on the early stages of the game would make learning process much more entertaining. This game needs dedicated servers for multiplayer or more convenient way to play with friends (or strangers). Right now you can only connect to someone else’s server by typing their IP address. Some minor bugs. I haven’t encountered anything game breaking. I am giving Crea a thumbs up. It offers fun and addictive gameplay with virtually endless replay value. If you like sandbox games, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed by this one.PC Specs   Hardware Type   CPU Intel Core i7 5820K 3.30GHz   GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 970   RAM 16GB DDR4   OS Windows 10 PRO  Disclaimer: A copy of the game was provided by the developer (Siege Games) for reviewing purposes. However, this did not influence my review in any way.  "

												This game takes the best from Terraria and Starbound and adds its own flavour with the talent point/upgrade system. I've been playing ""Terraria-like"" games for years but this is the first one that feels truly unique and refreshing! Pick it up, you won't be disappointed!			"

Review Written on Sunday, June 12th, 2016 Review This game is an open-world sandbox game, similar to Terreria, Starbound, and the like. You can get randomly generated small, medium or large worlds in single-player or multiplayer modes. Lots of effort went into the crafting and gathering portion of the game, as well as the world itself and all the monsters you can encounter. Sometimes I die too easily, but usually that's my own fault, I need to be more careful.I enjoy how much there is to do in this game, you can discover so many different monsters, items to gather, ways to die, and so on that you can play in one world for a good while. The music is pleasant and the sound effects aren't bad, kind of sparse though. The graphics aren't bad, and I like that even if you have a higher resolution monitor you can use zoom to make things easier to see, otherwise the world is way too small at the higher resolutions.I consider this game a well polished and interesting hybrid rpg/sandbox/open-world game in the same vein as others that came before it. If you enjoy these kind of games, it is worth the asking price for it. Also the developers are active after this game left early access, so they definitely care about polishing the game even further. Overall this game is well worth money and I highly recommend it. :)Rating: 7.8/10 Pros:  Great open-world sandbox gameplay, with lots to do and see. RPG style system where you level up and can learn different things to craft and gather inside the game world. Talent system to allow to level up all kinds of different skills and abilities you can use. A massive amount of content already in the game. I like the zoom feature with higher resolution graphic settings it allows your character and the world you are in to be bigger and easier to see.  Cons:  UI needs a little more polish, it seems that items arent well organized and quantity of items for crafting is not very obvious. On multiplayer, when I do an attack or receive an attack, it seems to lag for some reason, so the projectiles or melee attack stutter somewhat. I think this just may be related to a lagging server. Best to play this game on a keyboard and mouse. So far the controller is hard to use in comparison.Game gets a little repetitve after awhile, but it keeps it interesting with some variety.The craft system could use some more intuitive UI adjustments and polish, overall it's pretty decent though.

Review Written on Tuesday, June 14th, 2016 Review Crea is a 2D RPG sandbox type of game, the pixel style graphics are rather pleasing to look at although I would have love them to be a bit bigger but thats just me since it doesnt really change anything to the gameplay. You can choose between small, medium or large size world. Even the smallest one is quite big and has a lot to explore. Theres tons of things to do in this game, the crafting section has a lot choices. Like all game of this type theres two mode building and fighting (or survival). You wont see the time pass while you play this game, you can easily sink many hours into it and never get bored. The addition of Steam workshop add tons of options, the possibilities are endless. And since the dev are really active, I have high hopes that future update will add even more content. One thing I usually complain about is the lack of tutorial in those games, but not in Crea the tutorial is pretty good at explaining the basics, although I would have liked to see it explain more in depth. At the moment theres no dedicated server for multiplayer, so that might be a problem for some as its very much the kind of game you would want to play with others. Rating: 7.5/10 Pros:  The tutorial is covering the basis pretty well The integration of Steam workshop with modding will add lots of content and gameplay The RPG elements (leveling, skills, etc) add an interesting side to the game The procedurally generated world are quite big and theres lots to explore The devs are very active and theres frequent updates.  Cons:  Theres no dedicated server for multiplayer which in this kind of game is a downside Theres are still bugs, but the devs are pretty active, so it should be worked out The graphics are a touch small for me, it was hard to see details very well While the tutorial take care of the basis very well theyre still a lot of aspects that would deserve more explaining   Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor Asus laptop 17 inch 1600 by 900   Headphones Headphones   Keyboard Asus ROG laptop   Controller XBOX 360   Mouse Microsoft mobile mouse 3500   Microphone Microphone   Motherboard ASUS ROG laptop   CPU Intel Core i7 6700HQ 260 GHz   GPU gtx 960m 2b   RAM 16 gb   OS windows 8   HDD 1 tb  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege games "

												First off it's not Terraria but that's not a bad thing. This game has it's own style and it's an enjoyable experience like Terraria.  Another thing is that it's constantly being updated and improved which is a good sign for the title. I can see this becoming one of my favorite games as time goes on. So, buy the game or don't buy the game. In the end, it's not Terraria but it is a spectacular game that I would recommend to others.			"

												The game is ""neat"" but it feels like a clunky alpha of Terraria which is way better of a game at the moment. I see this game having potential to compete but as of writing this review I dont feel it's close yet. I've had teleport bugs where it wont let me move. I've had loot issues that dissapear for no reason. The game also feels limited in variety for building things. I do like the game, but can't see myself playing until another big content update. Maybe then I can give this game a better review.			"

												I love terraria and have been a long time fan, and I visually see similarities to Terraria in this game, BUT it is definitely it's own game. With that being said, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this may have more potential than Terraria. It has way more in the ways of leveling (the skill system is awesome), you can't just insta-overpower yourself (it takes time and work), and there is actually a sense of danger when exploring. The only issue I've come in contact with is the sound bug where i have no sound at all, but I understand games take A LOT of time and dedication, and this is developed by two people! Who are doing a fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic job might I add. Keep it up guys. Much love for this lovely couple. <3 Gaabbe			"

Review Written on Friday, June 10th, 2016 Review Crea is a cute pixel like game much akin to Terraria. You harvest items like trees and minerals and then research these items so that you can craft them into different objects. There's a lot of exploration to be done which involves walking on the surface of the world or digging below. Beneath the surface you will find creatures, different kinds of minerals and treasure chests. The treasure chests can only be opened with keys that you can find by smashing pots or even by picking the locks using a lock picking skill which can be acquired by leveling up. There are lots of other skills you can acquire in different categories. If you explore a lot then your exploration XP increases and you can spend those XP on different skills to do with exploring like jumping higher or running faster. If you fight a lot you can use the XP on different skills to level up your weapons etc.. I have started to enjoy this game now but I have to say that you need to be VERY patient and do a bit of research into how this game works. The GUI is a bit confusing when it comes to crafting and in my opinion it is just harder to craft things than it should be. Perhaps its because I have never played a game like this before but I found it really difficult to work out what to do to start off with.Some people like the fact that you have to work out what to do whilst others prefer knowing from the off how to do things. I had difficulties with equipping items I had created and found the whole crafting side very frustrating. After 5 hours of playtime I am starting to figure out the procedure. First of all harvest your items whether its by chopping down trees, killing monsters or digging the ground. Eventually you will have enough resources to craft a research bench. Once that is crafted you can research into the resources you have found which will give you recipes for new items i.e. better weapons, furniture,spellls etc... Once you have these recipes you need to craft a work station to build them. If your inventory is full and you craft the item then the item will fall to the ground! You can buy another inventory bag or craft a chest to put your things in though, however I havent found enough resources to craft one yet.I think there is going to be a lot of grinding in this game to get the resources you need to research and craft items to eventually explore further away lands. The further away you venture from your starting point the more difficult it becomes and you will find yourself being killed by one hit of a flying fishes tongue or something. Once you have upgraded your character and have better armor and weapons then you can expand your horizons a bit and even visit other worlds through teleporting through the crystals that are laid out throughout the world. The graphics are nice if you like pixel like sprites and the music is relaxing and calming. The game got released yesterday and Jasson the developer seems very nice and responsive to any suggestions you might have. Overall I would say that if you like these types of games then it is a very good example of one. It has a charm about it and you find that you can play it for hours and not get bored. Try not to get too frustrated with the crafting side of things. It may seem frustrating and baffling at the time but you soon get used to it and then you will find that you proceed quicker. Even though there is a basic tutorial system it is not enough to answer all of your questions I found and I had to research the internet or ask friends how to do things. This is an area I think can be improved on. The game is quite difficult to start off with and you will find that you wont be able to venture too far away from your starting point without leveling up and getting better weapons. With Steams refund policy theres no excuse not to try it out though just be careful that you don't accidentally play over 2 hours as this game has a habit of devouring your daytime. Rating: 7.5/10 Pros:  A good example of a Survival/crafting typed game with nice pixelated graphics and sound. This game has charm in buckets and there are loads of nice touches throughout which keep you amused and entertained. The developer is always releasing updates too! The discussion forum is lively. Good Customisation including character design and choices of worlds. Multiplayer or single player options The game has Controller support although sometimes this doesnt integrate well with the mouse and options.  Cons:  The Crafting system is over complicated and the GUI needs a little rethinking. A Lack of tutorials to tell you what to do. Controller support seems to be a bit glitched with menus and it is difficult to dig solely with the controller. I found I would use the controller to move and fight but would use the mouse to dig.

Review posted on Thursday, May 16th, 2016Crea might be summarised as a Terraria with light RPG features. Much like how Terraria was heavily inspired by Minecraft while promising major changes (and using a different engine), there are substantial differences from Terraria, including a different engine approach with Python-based moddability. The standout features are a leveling and research system with stat points and magic spells, and it includes the vast bulk of features players are used to from Terraria. The controls, crafting, fighting, digging and exploration make one feel right at home, and all the expected elements are in it and often expanded upon. Building elements and armor are largely the same, but different tool types have been simplified away. NPCs are 'crafted' too in an interesting system where you equip a neutral mannequin with a specific suit to assign a role to it.Unfortunately much like the afore-mentioned games this is inspired by, it's very much a game that hides many crucial details from you, forcing the player to play with out of game help like a Wiki. Whereas the initial items Terraria or Minecraft shipped with had very clear tiers, that isn't the case here. A bronze tool may have a specific upgrade part later on, while perhaps a bone one does not, and that isn't shown in the UI besides by mouseovering every known recipe.Experience gain is handled via a 'learning by doing' system, where fighting gives you combat XP, crafting gives you crafting XP; ditto for magic, gathering, exploration – and all of those have separate levels and unlocks (talents) that you pay for with points gained from leveling. Regularly these unlocks come in the form of active abilities for your quickbar, and you will quickly run out of space for them.For the combat, common RPG features like dungeons and mob spawners join familiar features like bosses, but unlike in Terraria and the like, you will rarely actually use health potions and mostly rely on a healing spell fueled by your combined stamina / mana bar (shared between attacks, dodges, spells and so on).Inventory management is once again a matter of coping with your very limited amount of slots, which themselves store an ungodly quantity of their particular items. One neat feature however is that you can craft using items stored in nearby chests, as well as use a forge you are not standing directly next to. In Terraria it's always a bit of a needless fetch quest to grab the materials you need to craft from your sorted chests and walk to the right crafting station. Another convenience option after a few hours of play is obtaining extra inventory space in the form of bags, which sadly then can't be viewed all at once.Crea is quite jolly for people who enjoyed Terraria, but isn't gonna win over those who didn't.Rating:7.4/10Pros:lots of perfectly functional contenthas everything people love from Terrariamoddable (warning: mods disable Steam Achievements)frequent updatesfree, non-grid item placement instead of only placing items in blocks""Terraria with a twist""Cons:not very original (""Terraria with a twist"")need out of game help or a lot of trial and error to cope with the crafting and progressiona good few graphical bugs and glitches remainpoor combat AI pathfindingHardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitorSamsung SyncMaster P2470SoundSennheiser HD 580 and Samson Resolv 80a SpeakersKeyboardMicrosoft Siderwinder X4ControllerMicrosoft Xbox 360 WirelessMouseLogitech G400MicrophoneKoenig Electronic CMP-MIC8MotherboardGigabyte X58A UD3RCPUi7 920 at around 4 GHzGPUGeforce GTX 670RAM12GBOSWindows 7 64-bitHDD2x 1TB RAID HDDA review copy of this game was provided by the developer.

												Disclaimer: i recieved this copy for free to write a review about the game. However this will not influece my review. Source of consideration: Siege GamesCrea is a sandbox rpg game with a lot of farming, digging, gathering and exploring. The graphic is simple 2D graphic, however its not bad.Heard from friends, that Crea is a Terraria 2.0 game. I do own Terraria, but my library pretty huge so not had time to play that game yet, i cant confirm that information.Crea allows you to level your character in many different ways. Your gathering, crafting, arms skills, spell skills and alone your hero get different experience and all these have different leveling system. Reaching next level on those experience trees unlock purchaseable abilites/boosts for your character. So you can see, character development is pretty deep in Crea.You cant craft any item you want right away. you need collect materials/ingerdients and then you need study those items, research them and then develop what could you craft from those. Sounds painful? its not, its fun, even if the research process destroys the item. New armors, weapons, building materials will be available as you progress through the game and as you research how to create those items, Crea offers a long and enjoyable gameplay while you build up your character, its house and clear hostile fauna.Sadly i not had much time to play Crea yet because of Euro 2016 and Copa America, but i allready love it and would recommend to anyone, its a pretty decent game for its genre, developer definetly spent a lot of time on it and one of the few games on steam what actually left early access and now officially released! Additionally, Crea has an affordable price which not much compared to the playtime this game offers.Pros:+deep character development+deep item research system+multiplayer available but you can enjoy single player just as much as multiplayer if you prefer that+the random generated worlds are huge, you have a lot to explore, monsters grant you hard, challenging figths+some might dislike this, but map shows suggested levels for areas so you can avoid areas where you would encounter much stronger enemiesCons:-i have some issues with combat. magic casting too slow, melee much faster and stronger, it might change later as character evolves, ill keep an eye on this and will update review.-i need to further investigate the reason but sometimes i have lags and performance issues what i shouldnt have as my rig much-much better than requirements.Overall rating: 8/10 for the genre however i not seen any better game for this genre yet.

												Honestly, wait until this game is more developed before you buy it. Mostly beacuse of the control layout. It is TERRIBLE (My opinion). You'll find yourself constantly dying in combat because you have to change to combat mode. And building is a pain because instead of having ten slots for the hot bar, theres two groups of five that you have to switch between. And the cursor will always have a block or item blinking on it like an eyesore. And your inventory is SUPER SMALL! and and and... Sorry Crea but you don't live up to the trailer at all. I suggest that you wait until the game is better developed to buy it. If you don't have a game like this, BUY TERRARIA!			"

												Not enjoying myself. Loved the first 2 hours and the inspiring music, all the good & fresh ideas but in its current state I can't recommend it as I got too lags in-game after a few hours of intense gaming.Regarding gameplay, combat feels clunky and boring despite the many skills (not visible enough in my opinion and not intuitive). Exploration is not rewarding, chests are greedy. Moreover the world feels empty. The idea behind the crystal teleporting you to instance locations are fun at beginning but it's always the same.I'm really trying to appreciate this game but mixing RPG elements with Terraria is not enough to me, the magic is not there yet.

Short Version:  *whistling* Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, it's off to work we go...We dig dig dig dig dig dig di---AHHH IT'S A FLYING ROCKET PIG!!! Aw nuts, it flew into the house!!  I *told* you not to leave that hole in the roof for 'easy jumping access'!  KILL IT! KILL IT NOW!     -- Sir Spud, Digger Extraordinaire and Slayer of Crea-an Rocket Pigs. Crea is a 2D RPG-ish sandbox game featuring digging, exploring, crafting, building, and fighting - all the usual sandbox shenanigans - with the addition of skill points to add a whole new layer of character progression beyond the usual gearing-grind. The game starts you off on a random stretch of a vast, procedurally generated world filled with multiple biomes, both on the surface and underground.  Each biome has its own set of dangers and rewards, containing scary monsters, hazardous dungeons, and all the shiny rocks you could ever want in order to build the castle of your dreams.Crea's main enhancement to this basic sandbox structure is a skill-progression system to improve your character (in addition to the usual process of finding/crafting better gear).  As you perform any activity in Crea, you gain skill points which you can spend to become even better in related talents - digging gives you points for gathering skills, fighting allows you to invest in combat skills, etc.  This allows you to improve your character over time, and also focus on whatever niche you prefer, be it a warrior, a magic user, or someone who just reeeeally likes digging holes.  Crea also features a few other uniquely nifty ideas to build upon 2D sandbox-crafters of yore, such as dungeon portals which can buff the monsters - or nerf you - in random ways to create a truly challenging experience.  There is also a clever research system to gain access to better tools, deadlier weapons, and snazzier furniture - which is a nice way to limit starting players to necessary items early on, while providing plenty of extra choices as you progress through the game.  While Crea has quite a bit going for it, there are still some issues to be aware of before you commit to that 'buy' button.  The natural downside to the extensive amount of progression that Crea offers is that the game is not exactly newbie-friendly.... at all. There is very little tutorial to go on, so you will likely need to make quite a few side-trips to the forum before you become comfortable with the game - or even to get familiar with the controls, which are not always intuitive. The game's visuals will also probably displease some users - the 2D sprites scream 'indie title', although in the end they get the job done just fine.All-in-all, Crea is a neat addition to the 2D sandbox-crafting genre, with plenty of extra features to make it stand out from similar titles.  If you're new to the genre, Crea is a fine way to spend potentially endless hours exploring, digging, fighting and building, though you should read up a bit on the game first to make the start a little more pleasant.  Meanwhile, for those simply looking for a game to fill that Terraria-shaped void in your life after playing it to death for the last few years, Crea will certainly do that and then some.  Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes. "

Early Access Review
								I don't usually buy games without discounts, but when I do it has some reasons. As a great fan of Terraria and similar crafting games I've noticed this one long time ago. Finally, I couldn't resist and bought it. Well... This is my next big thing in 2D crafting games. In my humble opinion Crea is better than any analog on Steam store (And I did enjoy Asteria, Edge of Space, Signs of Life, Darkout and others). I'm writing this NOT to review the game by spoiling all of the fun saying that this thing is done like this, and that stuff is like that. I'm writing this to tell you: ""If you enjoy crafting games - don't hesitate - buy this game. It is epic!"". Cheers!			"

I own just about (of the ones I know about) all of them, I can honestly say that Crea ranks in my top 3.  If you are a fan of Terraria, Starbound or other 2D games, Crea is a must buy, you will not regret supporting these devs.			"

												I will continue to update my review as I play.Crea came out of nowhere and blew past most of the games I've played. Don't miss out on this gem. The soundtrack is amazing and the art style is grabbing. So far this game has been VERY user friendly for me. The hud/layout is easy to navigate and butter smooth. The tutorial system as you play is very helpful and won't leave you blind. It's easy to get familiar quickly. You gain TP through different categories depending on what you do (fighting, magic, exploring, crafting, harvesting/mining I believe, etc.). TP can be used in each of these categories to purchase talents (active & passive). Also, you gain xp from creatures you kill. The combat is crisp but I wouldn't call it fluid. When you level up, you gain stat points you can distribute with about 7 or 8 different options (att, def, int, luck, agi, stamina, etc.) which I love because that's really what makes every character different (all talents can be maxed by any character but stats are unique). Anything and everything is destructable & craftable. The most similiar game to Crea is Terraria which I enjoyed playing.			"

												In may 2011, terraria was released, pioneering the 2D sandbox genre. At its time it was a pretty minimalistic game with no story and limited content, but over the years it gained more and more content that eventually made terrraria one of the most underpriced games on steam.With the success of Terraria, other developers began taking an interest in making their own 2D sandbox games. There were a lot of promising ones that went into early access, but they quickly found themselves unable to compete with terraria that already had a good headstart and was continously being updated. Those that did make it out of early access have all been failures.... that is until now. 5 years after the release of terraria, Crea has just become the first good 2D sandbox game to be released since terraria. Crea is better than terraria in some ways but also worse and I will explain in detail all theseHere is how Crea is better than terraria:- Crea has a backstory that gets revealed as the game progresses.- Crea has slightly better graphics.- Crea has a leveling up and research system that creates a sense of progress and pretty much eliminates the need for a guide NPC.- Crea has a tutorial that helps guide the player in the very beginning. luckily, the game is fairly intuitive once you get used to the new system in comparison to terraria.- Crea has better native modding support than Terraria.- Crea does not require a wiki in order to play and discover the world on your own.Here is how terraria is better:- Terraria is underpriced, crea is fairly priced.- Terraria has more content, although this could change since terraria has reached its limits whereas Crea will continue to get updates going forward.- Terraria performs better, lower PC requirements, more optimised code.- Terraria's music is slightly better.- terraria's controls are slightly better.All in all, if you are looking for a 2D sandbox with a more RPG feel to it, Crea is recommended over Terraria. If you are a fan of terraria who is looking for something new but similar, Crea is recommended for you. If you want more freedom in what you do in the game, dislike a RPG progression system, or want a lot of content then terraria is recommended over Crea.			"

												Crea is a game I really want to like.  I helped kickstart it years ago, and have been following along with the development.  It has a lot of good things about it, but plenty of bad, and right now, I cannot in good concience recommend this game.Of course, there are bugs.  Many of them, though I have only been stuck by graphical glitches, unlike some.  I expect the major game-breakers will be resolved in the next few weeks, so I won't ""mark off"" for that.  The major gameplay areas of concern for me are combat, research and the ""fun"" factor.Quite simply, combat is too hard and unforgiving.  This is related to both the monster-leveling, which makes the same mobs get strong and stronger as you move away from your base (and it does not take long before they one-shot you), and the odd combat upgrade system in general.  As there are no visual variations, an oil slime that you can easily kill in one area is instant death elsewhere.  This makes for frustrating play.  The intent is for you to level yourself and your gear, and grind to become better.  Unfortunately this is not obvious, and makes the game exceptionally gear dependant.  I could never add enough health, attack and defense via leveling to make up for the wrong tier gear.  The combat system itself seems to be more geared towards missile weapons and hopping and dodging, as even fighting correct level mobs is a 1 vs 1 affair.  The monster-leveling system ensures that facing a few mobs at a time is likely death.Research is the second major flaw in the game.  At its core, the idea is that you research items you find and unlock recipes to make things.  Sounds good so far.  The problem is that there is essentially no guidance or progression.  You're left to your own devices to randomly research items you find, craft random items on the off chance it is something that will be researchable and unlock something else, and stack up piles of items for potential future use, because even if you have already researched an item, you may need to use it again for something else when you level up your ""research trait"".  Overall it is a confusing mess, that doesn't add much to the game except situations where you have copper ore and a forge but cannot smelt it because... you need vines?  Multiple that by hundreds of item combinations and you begin to see the issue.It may be the above items, or something more subtle, but the game does not really feel ""fun"".  It is interesting for a litlle while (5 or 10 hours) while you figure out the mechanics of the system, but it's not deep enough or polished enough yet to hold my attention.  All of this said, I do want to like the game, and it is a far improvement over what it was like a year or more ago, so I have hope that the developer will take this sort of feedback to heart and the game will improve.  I'll keep my eye on it and update this review as patches change the gameplay.			"

												There's not a whole lot to do especially on multiplayer. You can only do two bosses as the rest won't spawn properly. But even then there's a very limited amount of things to do. On average there's like 20 hours of gameplay, which isn't that much given the other games like it like Terraria.			"

												I'll start with the obvious. Crea is a sandbox RPG, which has a lot of similarities to Terraria. Crea is more about the characters personal development through levelling up and talents, along with weapon and armour upgrades. Crea also has a really cool research system behind the crafting. You need to find the pieces of what you want to make and research them to discover the recipes they can be used in. You can also use scraps (that can be easily obtained from research) to discover parts of the recipe without using the components you have. The crafting system goes even deeper than that, by using ""Chaos"" to imbue your items.Crea feels good to play, the mechanics all work well together and nothing feels too clunky. There are a few inconveniences, like being unable to use skills unless you're in combat mode. However the trade-off for that one is that there is a toggle for combat and building/exploration, which is a huge quality of life advantage. The world looks good, and there is some good variety in the biomes, items and enemy types.Crea shouldn't be written off purely as a Terraria clone, it's a game that takes the fundamental idea behind it and produces a fantastic experience. Having said that, if you liked Terraria and want something similar, this is definitely your best choice.			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly this game isnt finished but it's still great if you're into the whole Terraria style game. I like this game more than terraria but havent played it as much due to it being early access and all. The heavier focus on the RPG system is what attracts me alot more. There are tons of ways to build your character with the TP (basically skill points) you get, the magi system has been taken down a notch, though I guess it was kind of complicated before. But like I said. You can be a mage, you can be an archer, you can be a fighter, you can be a tank wizard, you can completely avoid combat by just running fast and jumping high. I havent played very much this patch and I dont know if you can still do it, but I used to just stack defense and use the fire aura spell and things would kill themselves on me. The gear crafting is pretty interesting though I'm still not 100% sure how to get the best outcome of it. You an apply different skills when you make an item to give it better stats, but you can use them in different orders for different possible outcomes. There are a good amount of effects you can get on your items such as just raw stats, bonus damage/defence and things like life steal. I hope this gets added onto for things like effect procs such as ""x% chance to cause an ice explosion that slows enemies"" or ""this shield has a x% chance to block 100% of incoming damage"" ect.The combat felt kind of stale when I first started playing, but you can get better combos by investing skill points in certain weapons and what not, you can block which applies your shields defense somehow or another, not 100% sure how it works. You can dodge roll behind things when they try to hit you. But you have to moderate your stamina the whole time or you'll become exhausted and not be able to do much other than walk slowly and jump until your stamina refills. It's honestly a pretty good feeling system. Early game it might feel annoying if you get in a big fight but when you get some more stamina it's not so punishing to just go ham on things. One thing in particular that I really like is that there are portals that spawn that take you to instances like dungeons or just a big area with lots of enemies and sometimes spawners to kill. I havent run into a dungeon yet, that was just recently added but you get some pretty nifty rewards for doing so if I remember correctly. If not just the rare drops that enemy spawners drop.Anyways, the devs update this game alot, I miss the old complicated as heck magic system with tons of different spells, but the new one is still fine and dandy, there are lots of new skills added to other trees such as combat, crafting and exploring. Building is pretty good so far though it's not what I really look forward to doing in these games, exploring is pretty solid, enemies are diverse, there are bosses (which are just bigger badder versions of smaller things) that will randomly spawn and likely wreck you. I think it's very worth buying or adding to your wishlist and keeping an eye on. I straight up love this game and cant wait for it to hit full release.			"

Is this another clone of Terraria or Starbound, let's see, shall we?There is no point for me to blindly copy what is already in the description of the game because it is exactly what it says there. But the main element in this game is the focus on RPG leveling. With everything you do, you gain accordingly TP (Talent Points). This makes you being really good at things you do the most. You also gain normal levels and distribute points into various attributes. This helps/restricts you with the level system for using items, talents and crafting. That brings us to Crafting. Crafting and researching was pretty confusing for me in few moments. You can't just craft or research things even if you try to check for recipes in research on what you can research and you think you have all the ingredients for it. There is still need for checking google and guides for these situations you will be stuck in. On the other hand, I really liked the ""Chaos"" crafting, being able to enhance items with more potential abilities, making it magical.Gathering things is pretty much same as with other games of this genre. Except you have teleportation system ready at hand (after you discover waypoints - Crystals). Time spend gathering is also lowered by the ability to mine more than one square at the same time, you'll unlock this ability early in the game. You'll get 4 loadouts, 2 for each combat and exploring/building mode, it proved as being very effective after getting used to it. Inventory is pretty small, but you'll also unlock more after few hours of the play and then you'll have plenty of it. Building and architectural enthusiasts will be happy about options on how to make your home look fancy. I was never much into spending many hours decorating my ""house"", but if you like this sort of thing, you'll be thrilled.Visuals of this game are really polished for this type of genre, even animations aren't just the simply rotating items, anchored on one side, just like in Terraria, such a nice change. Music is pretty nice and calming, I really enjoyed it. Other sounds are really just basic or there aren't any at all where they should be, which is such shame for a game that is out of the Early Access. SummaryHopefully developers will continue adding much more content, so this game can become true rival. Should you buy this game if you already own any other game similar to this? I would say no, unless you really want to try something else or you're building type. However if you don't own any similar game, I pretty much recommend it.Rating:8.2/10Pros:Character progression - Put points into Level TalentsEnchantments? ENCHANTMENTS! - Chaos crafting is really nice touch.Other worlds - Dungeons and realms. So you aren't just on one limitedQuick travel and mining - Say goodbye to long trips back and forth. Mine more than one square at same time, don't be a mining monkey!Possibility to name things and other customization - Naming waypoints and storages is very convenient. You can also most of the GUI windows around.Mod supportCons:Occasional lags - Although I only died once because of that.Story is not much engaging - It just lurks somewhere in the backgroundResearch and crafting confusionSometimes no sound effect where you would expect oneHardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitorSamsung 40 LED 3D TVKeyboardC-TECH NereusMouseGenius NX-7000 RedSpeakersCreative Inspire T5400 5.1MotherboardGA-A55M-DS2CPUAMD Athlon II X4 651KGPUGigabyte Radeon HD7770 OCRAM8 GB RAM (Kingston)OSWindows 10 Professional (64bit)HDDSSD Samsung 850 Evo 250GBGame was provided by Siege Games but it didn't influence my review in any way.

Early Access Review
								Crea is an interesting take on the 2D sandbox genre established (or at least popularized) by Terraria. It goes without saying that the game features mining, crafting, and building systems that are found in similar games, but there's much more to Crea that makes it stand out.First, there's research. Instead of being able to craft items as soon as you have the materials, in Crea you need to do research first. This is a really cool mechanic, because it gives the sense of having your player tech up. It also gives the player an urge to explore the world and see what it has to offer, instead of telling the player that they need x, y, and z material right off the bat, and turning exploration basically into a grocery list.The monsters in this game are also really cool. They are all unique and adorable. Also, there are no zombies, which is always a positive in my book.The teleportation system system is awesome as well. There are way points throughout the world, called ""Way Crystals,"" which allow for a fast travel sort of system. This is nice, because it allows you to jump to specific points throughout the world while being able to go back to your base to empty out your inventory from time to time.If you decide you like Crea, but want something more out it, I should point out that Crea is built from the ground up to make modding as easy as possible. You can add anything you want to in this game, so I guess if you really want zombies, there could be a mod that lets you put them in.The community behind Crea is really awesome, too. The forums[siegegames.com] are full of people giving feedback on the game and providing support to new players as well. The devs are also active on the forum, and will add features to the game based on community discussion.All in all, I think that Crea is definitely a game worthy of your attention, especially if you like games like Terraria. Even if Early Access is something that makes you uncomfortable, I would recommend that you keep your eye on Crea. It has amazing potential, and I think it would be a shame if you passed it up now and never came back to look again later.			"

 Crea Review This game is super amazing I love the grapics and everything in the game. The pixle art in the game is very amazing. Their are just a few things I was very disapointed about. First Reason The music never changed and it was just getting super anyoing. Second Reason The movement of my chacter is very laggy and so every time I would click the one of the WSAD Key it would take one step then my game just freezes. Third Reason is that It is not optmized yet for windows ten so that could be another factor. If I saw the developer I would tell them what they need to fix and I bet they will understand what I am saying and fix it.  Overall I would give this five star because I think the gameplay and the art that the developers did were amazing. These Three reasons I am just giving to the developer so they can hear from a playtester and from a product tester perpectives. ####Pros####Love GamplayLove ArtLove ItemsLove Single Player, Quick Play, And Online####Cons####Pauses Between I MovedSpeed of axe needs to be fasterPause in between tasksCharcter moves only one stepJumping needs to be higherVery LaggyDear Developer,I will be changing this review once you go ahead and read it. I really appricte your time and effort you put into this game. It is very good but their just needs to be little stuff tweaked. I will appicate it if you will read my review and if you chanege some of things I listed here I would cross everything out and write a postive review. The reason why I gave 5 stars was beacause I loved you game Crea. I would love to see these improvments developer then I will strike everthing I wrote here. Please take your time in reading the review. Also keep in mind I still love your game so don't worry I am not trying to be negtive nelly about your game.Thank Your For Your Time,Dev Reviewer and Chuglydude Donator			"

 Crea is an extremely enjoyable sandbox game, the engine is vibrant and the game play is solid and enjoyable. The game offers an immense amount of content as is expected of the genre, yet stands out in the deliverance of it. Everything is well organized and simplified in a friendly UI, so unlike some other games the players are not overwhelmed or lost in endless lists of craftables and items. First off, I will need to point out the obvious, Crea is extremely similar to Terraria which is a well beloved and commercially successful game, so it's hard to do the same things Terraria does and do them well. Fortunately, Crea does not disappoint. The environment in Crea is lush, varied, and suitably deadly. There are mounds of things to collect and make, loads of enemies to face and challenging bosses to tackle. The controls in the game are responsive and have not yet caused my demise by being obtuse. The controls are fully map-able, and allow for both kb+mouse and controllers for those who feel they need them.Crea has been stable since launch, both for single and multiplayer modes, and has kept me entertained by the many adorable and very-dead-because-I-need-mats critters it has thrown at me. The developers patched and ironed out most of the reported issues soon after the game's release, as well as continue to make weekly tweaks and fixes in the game. Showing how closely they monitor feedback from users, always nice to know that the products we use will be well maintained.The game itself is simple enough to understand and get into; Most things in the environment can be gathers and used as materials for crafting weapons, clothing, structures etc. There is a level system which governs what items are available for crafting, as well as a skill system which uses accumulated points to unlock perks, passives and improvements to existing mechanics such as movement, gathering speed, combat prowess and so on. As a general rule sandbox games do not have a final goal or destination, but I suppose getting the bosses could be something close to that. Sadly, despite the tutorial, people who have never played a game in this genre might take a little while to get up to speed in Crea.Pros: Rich environmentNice soundtrackHandles nicely and allows for control customizationWell maintained by the development teamOffers hour of fun in solo mode or with friendsImmensely rich in contentAddition of RPG elements to the game allows for more to do than the standard harvest/craft cycleCons:Can be unfriendly to beginnersOccasional minor FPS dropsSuffers from the usual sandbox game issues such as having to collect hundreds or materials to make 1 itemEnemy AI could use some polishingAll ‘n all, I struggled a lot trying to think of cons and had way too easy a time enumerating the pros in Crea, which is rare for me. I highly recommend this game and would give it an easy 8/10Source of consideration: Siege Games "

								First of all, I bought this game a few hours ago. I do generally like 2D adventure/sandbox games, but that is definitely not the only reason I like this game. It is already pretty unique and I believe it will only become better. To all of you saying, "" Oh, it's just another Terraria rip-off,"" I say please be quiet! (Trying to be polite :) ) Starbound started off as ""another Terraria"" but became so much its own game! I believe Crea will, too! Crea is great fun even when it is in a pretty early stage. I do think things can be refined a bit. The things are: a bit more in-depth tutorial because things can get confusing, slightly faster progression and leveling up, and less creature spawners and a creatures spawning more naturally. There are also plenty of good things: unique art style (pixelly yet detailed), unique creatures and world, and a decent pace, especially for those beginning the game, maybe not for ones more into it. I do recommend it, and if you aren't sure definitely keep your eye on it for the future!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is great, with very few downfalls. It incorporates combat, crafting, leveling and boss fighting. However, being Early Access, it still has some bugs. Multiplayer has many crashes and sometimes the players completely disappear. It's an easy fix by re-entering the game, but it's still a nuisance. Single player is crisp and the combat is really fun, but more enemies should be made. Bosses are the same every time and I would hope for more variety and to have them all a little less linear, right now they're all very ""tricky"", meaning there's little to no strategy to fighting them. The best and worst part of the game is the crafting. The crafting is very fun as you have to research items to make new gear, but there is just about no direction on how to do it or what items need to be collected to craft. Understand that it's still an early title that needs fixing, but it's a great buy overall. Well worth the full price if you're willing to support developers.			"

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is a 2D sanbox RPG and at the start it took a while to generate the world but once that is done its time to create your character which is pretty basic options but it does the job nicely. The leveling system is nice and you can also use talent points. talent poitns can be earned by gathering materials, mining and chopping trees and such, each talent has different skills that can be leveled up, there is also passive and active skills and you can spend your talent points on the things you want to be strongest at. The overall experiece with skills and the talent points is excellent. Also there is 2 modes which you change with Y, building an combat to makes things easier you just switch to what you need. The world on this was huge and i ran into some problems when i got to far from the start so had to stay close to level up, both physical and magical attacks seem easy to use and worked well. The game reminds me of Terraria by the look of it and i think this will generate a following similar to that. Over the game was very easy to pick and play and using the controller was very easy, i can see this game becoming a huge success and the developers should be proud of their creation. I do feel the price should be similar to terrarias price of 6.99 GBP Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  basic tutorial is good and gives you a great start to the game Controller support is good, I try to use the steam controller for anything non fps and it was easy to pick an play straight away. i did not try with a keyboard. TELEPORTATION- no need to spend hours trying to get to certain places, something that would put me off usually but this fixed it. Active developer - been many updates since i installed this and more to come. Trading cards for anyone who like to collect the badges :)  Cons:  No dedicated servers. Options menu is limited on the main menu but alot better once the game is running. Lag, my pc seems to lag quite a bit while running this and im not to sure why as the game is not that demanding and i have had other games that require heavy ammount of resources and run fine. Game just will not minimize to windows, if i needed to go back out id have to quit the game completely. Crafting was a bit confusing and i didnt see a tutorial on this, maybe one should be added :)  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor 32 TV   Headphones turtle beach px3   Keyboard logitech g15   Controller xbox wireless   Mouse logitech mx518   Microphone turtle beach px3   Motherboard gigabyte   CPU hex core 3.4 ghz   GPU radeon 7750 OC   RAM 16 gb   OS windows 10   HDD 1tb sata  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege games "

Review Written on Tuesday, June 7th, 2016 Review Crea is a sandbox game that is similar to Terraria. You start in a world with a character with almost nothing. The only thing you start with is a mattock and a weapon. Using these items you can gather resources and kill monsters. Similar to Terraria you can build new stuff with the resources you find in the world, but in order to build more advanced items you need to do researching using a Research Desk. Luckily it didnt need to be researched before being built. There are two play modes: build and attack. These can be switched during game play whenever you feel like. But its most likely you need to switch to attack mode when the are monsters attacking you. Each mode have their own hot bars where you can set to the skills/items you want to use at the moment. Skills can be unlocked using experience points that comes from killing monsters, crafting stuff and etc. There are huge amount of skills to unlock and I believe that in the end you will have everything unlocked. If you really like Terraria, then Crea is the best alternative game. The tutorial could be better, as I played it I had to rely on what I learnt from Terraria in order to progress further, apart from the research and skill leveling part. But the game is really fun to play. It feels like Crea has lots of replayability.Rating: 8/10 Pros:  Its a sandbox game! Nice graphic Huge replayability Crafting, researching and skilling There is a multiplayer mode!  Cons:  Lack of tutorial, it was a lot trial and error Kinda long loading times  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor THOR Display IPS LED by Fujitsu 23   Headphones Siberia V2   Keyboard Steelseries APEX Raw   Controller Xbox One Controller   Mouse Kanai   Microphone -   Motherboard -   CPU Intel i7-3770K   GPU Geforce GTX 670   RAM 16GB   OS Win10   HDD 120SSD 2TB HDD  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games "

Review First of all, this review is going to be based on the few hours of gameplay time I have, most of which was spent experimenting with the very basic mechanics. I'm sure there are many, many more features than those I have come across, but I assume it would require a considerable amount of time spent playing the game for me to experience those. So, let's get right into the review. Crea was fully released a few weeks ago. It has a concept extremely similar to that of Terraria, Starbound and other 2D exploration games, but is unique in some aspects. As soon as I started up the game, I noticed it has a very appealing menu, although simple. Upon creating my character, I began in the centre of a large, randomly-generated world. The graphics are cute and an in-game tutorial is available. I must admit, it took me a while to work out how to harvest trees because of the two modes - building and combat - which are merged into one in other games. One of the downsides to Crea is that despite the integration of a tutorial, some things are quite hard to discover how to do - well, for me anyway. I must admit, I still haven't worked out how to place wood. Some things that makes Crea unique is its research, talent system and spells. By crafting a research desk, you can use collected items to research new weapons, armour, furniture and tools for crafting. I also found the talent system quite interesting. Over time, you build up talent points which you can then spend on making harvesting or combat more efficient, allowing new abilities or unlocking spells. By using equipped spells, you can make your attacks more damaging, heal yourself and give yourself other benefits in combat. Overall, Crea is a fun little game to play in your spare time. Hopefully I won't get addicted to it like I did with Terraria. Aside from the frustration when I can't figure out how to do something, I think I will find myself coming back to it time and time again. There seems to be a lot more to do when you get into it a little bit more. Rating7/10Pros-Cute graphics and menu design. -Good, fitting music. -Crafting system tells you what you need to craft the desired item.-Interesting research system. -A talent system that lets you improve your character's skills. -In-game tutorial (although brief). Cons-Difficult to learn how to do certain things. -You have to play it quite a bit to truly enjoy it. -Having to switch between building and crafting modes is a pain when you get ambushed by an enemy. -There aren't a huch amount of character customisation options.DisclaimerI received this product for free from the Developer in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

								This game is actually pretty good. It has some really good mechanics in it, like RPG elements and the ability to teleport back home straight from the start, great additions to the sandbox genre. Really good. Addictive and a lot of fun.I originally found the controls difficult and was moved to write a bad review because of it. I dug a little further and found a community guide on steam that helped me learn the basics. Now changed to a positive review because this game actually deserves it.If you're willing to be a bit patient for the first hour while you learn some controls, this is great fun and highly recommended.

												A fairly decent game, definitely worth its price. Speaking as someone who hasn't played sandbox games in a very long while:Pros:- Interesting mesh of gameplay systems (chaos crafting, RPG-style progression, sandbox hunting-gathering).- Fairly immersive (when you're not explicitly trying to farm materials or speed-level a character).- Decent (this is very subjective) background themes/music scores... although the volume could be set lower.- Developer(s) are fairly responsive on bug reports & general suggestions.- Great modding potential.- For a 2D game using sprites, the art is quite pleasant.Cons:- The UI could use a LOT more polish.- Some mechanics are not explained (clearly) in-game (chaos-crafting as a prime example), leaving a new player to (slowly) guess what numbers mean what, and what does what.- Can be a bit buggy at times.- Leveling up can be a bit of grind (e.g. hack-and-slash for a bit), but the talent point system (which is not directly tied to the main character level) alleviates this to an extent.

								So this game is really like Terraria but still very different. Although it's still in early access (and therefore pretty glitchy/laggy) it's still an overall great game. I had previously given this game a bad review (mostly for the glitchy part and because i lost my items i worked hard to get) but the developers worked hard to help me and that really made me happy. This game is definitely worth buying and playing all night. ;P Love the rpg feel to it too with the whole leveling up thing and using the points on skills like a chest finder ability or the ore finder ability, both help a lot. :D			"

								I sat down Saturday afternoon, that being the 12th of September, and it is now the 13th (Sunday) and since 4:30 pm yesterday up until 7:24 pm today, I have played 16.7 hours.  Yes... I am now an addict!My biggest complaint is that the game does not come with a warning!!!  SERIOUSLY!?!?!?  How was I to know that my entire weekend was going to be sucked in by this incredibly fun, nostalgic (feeling), and exploriffic game!?  For shame I say to he devs!  For shame!Seriously though... I saw screenshots of the game and was thinking ""Yep.. it looks like that ""other game"" there..I read the ""About This Game"" summary and was like ""Yep... been there and done that...""But it wasn't until I read the reviews of the community I have come to grow fond of (STEAM), that I had to at least give it a try.  I mean come on... it seems a drop in the bucket compared to what these folks are raving about...  Surely there is something to this!And so I cracked open my moth and lint encrusted wallet....So yea.. 16 + hours later and I have completely and totally fallen in love with this game.  The character progression... the beautiful (Although a bit redundant music (MORE TRACKS PLEASE!!  ;D  )) graphics and creatures... they give meaning to the at-first-bland character and world you create.  Crafting, exploring, and combat all fall within this realm of fantasy and ""incredibility"" !!!  And did I just say bland world?  Oh heck no!  Looks like any other ""similar game world"" ;) doesn't it?  Definitely not.  The procedurally generated worlds are rife with nooks and crannies; treasures and baubles; perils and victories just waiting to be had!I have clubbed Oil Slimes to death in a frenzy...Notched Arrow on Harvesters...I have gathered shards of the ""Sunrise"" Crystal from whence I spawned to then instantly materialize elsewhere....I have even beaten down the winged Lord of The Birds...  What is next?  Sanos and then?  My friends.  If you have made even one purchase this year... let it be this one.   From Faxanadu and Metroid to Terreria (there I said it) and Starbound... this is without a doubt a 5 star gem that will be talked about (and enjoyed) for years to come!Kudos to the devs,Menoch			"

								Crea is another game in the 2d adventure Sandbox realm. Very similar to Terraria, I would say Crea is most like Terraria as far as a successor, at least so far. Where Starbound is more about exploration, Crea is more about sticking to the core and adding more mechanics. It has rpg like progression where you gain skill points by using that specific skill line. For instance, if you shoot something with an arrow your physical attack tree will gain experience. The same goes for crafting, buff/healing, sorcery and gathering. When they level up each skill line you gain access to new, more powerful skills.It has a big emphasis on researching materials in the world in order to unlock new recipes. You will need to keep exploring deeper and further to progress to higher tier items. The world is very similar to terraria where you can find chests and all kinds of loot in various places. It has a crystal system in the game as a fast travel device. So once you find the crystals you are able to travel between them for a small price. They are located above and below ground. There is also an advanced research system in place that requires finding recipes from monsters.The soundtrack is amazing. Crea has the look and feel of the game down as well. The soundtrack is put together so well, it is very relaxing and perfect for the game style. Very reminiscent to EVE Online's awesome ambient soundtrack. Hopefully they will make it even longer before release. The UI is very slick and easy to use although for the amount of spells/item combinations it does need a little tweaking in my opinion. Having ten hotkeys and then each having a right/left click bind has been done over and over and I would really like to see a new and efficient action bar/UI implemented in this genre. Or at least a big improvement.At this point in development the most you can do is craft the highest ier items and face one boss. I pretty much got as far as that which was 20 hours of gameplay. I enjoyed it thuroughly and am eager to see what they will be bringing to the game by release. Seeing that the game is early on in develoment still and in early access I would give it an 8.5/10. It will have to do a lot of work to maintain or beat that by release though. The game is also highly modable but I haven't checked anything like that out yet.Things I would really like to see before release.The world needs to be filled with different dungeons/exploration triggers and bosses/special monsters. Content basically and it's early access so I'm sure this is in the works. With these 2d sandbox games the funnest part is the mystery of what you could find.I like the skill progression system. But, as of right now the whole thing is kind of pointless because there are no decisions to make. You unlock the next 3 skills and then to level them up until you hit the next skill unlock level. The skills themselves need a lot of polishing as well and they need to, look cooler.The UI needs something to make it more efficient or intuitive. Is it ok now? Sure, but it doesn't improve on the genre's adopted UI or do anything new. "

												I have a few friends that's really a fan of Terraria but I havn't tried that game personally so I cannot really compare the two. But for a guy that's not a huge fan of sandbox, world builder. It does seems very fun for me.As a Pixel RPG, you harvest trees and ores and fight monsters then you use item you get from tree/ore/monster to research and find item upgrades. Each maps builds on a unique seed.(world name) The world seems very big even you choose the smallest size world. Like many world builder. you can dig below ground and it goes very deep.There are different monster/ores the deeper you go.Your character have a level up system on it's own and there are for skills like fighting/magic/garther/science/explore it's got it's own levels. You have to be certain level to equip certain items.There are many many treasure box.. you need either a key or a lockpick(with skill) to open them.Very addictive in the very natural of this game so it's very hard to put down. Rating:8/10 Pros:Pixel art at it's best with very fun RPG game play and world building.A lot of nice subsystem for you to explore and have discover. You never know what items need to make a new item.Discussion forum are very active and a lot people are playing and talking about this game.Nice Assorted of music and they are pretty good to hear.(there is a item you can put into your home and it changes the music every time you click it)The controls are quite smooth.. and simple combat are actually quite fun with all the skills you got.Cons:Does takes a while to learn and get use to.Achievements are currently not working.Tested controler a bit and it seems it's best to use mouse and keyboard to dig/garther.Items need quite a bit balancing...For example you are using level 0 items you get until you level up to level 15. Which is when you get better items.. So last 6-7 levels before reaching level 15 is very hard since level 0 items are not good enough against monster of same level.Last con .. it's too addictive that you lose track of time.Disclaimer:Source of consideration: Siege Games			"

								Crea is a very awsome and cool game that is ""Community Driven"" in the sense of the term. It's a game that allows you to do lots of things ranging from fighting monsters and using and wide range of weapons and or magic while doing it. And It also features and in depth leveling system so that you can actually feel progress in game even though the story is ""non linear"" and let me note that with this game the unique monsters actually scale to your level so that the feeling of challenge is always there. Crea also features a cool traveling system for convience in the form of waypoint crystals which require crystal shard's that can be found surrounding the waypoint crystal that are randomly spawned throughout the world. Also, you can build amazing structures to suit your taste or general feel with plenty of different block types for what your going with for your own customizable character the building possibilties are endless. The game also has a great mechanic where you research thing's to learn how to build them. And lets not forget the  spelunking  you can go into caves and mine for materials with different tiers of pickaxes while also leveling up your mining skill so that thing's can become more convienient as applys to all other things in the game such as Weapons(Arms),Arcane,Gathering,Magic,etc...  And not to forget that this game is also easily moddable and almost everything in the game can be modded. And another thing that makes this game awsome is that it has multiplayer so that you can experience this cool game with your friends to. All in all crea is and awsome sandbox fantasy rpg that is sure to be filling up most of your freetime.			"

												Word of advice: Don't compare it to any other game, its a nice little gem with a simple thing in mind.It has a huge learning curve in it but I believe the latest updates have made it so that it isn't brainwracking to build a simple bow. It's a neat little game made by a single family for fun, and it has a nice feel to it. The only gripe I have is that it can get very slow and grindy, but it isn't much different from most games of sorts or an MMO for example.All in all, you'll get your money's worth if you treat it like its own game instead of a spinoff or a cousin of Terraria/Starbound.

												TLDR: This is a bargain, even if it wasn't on sale. If you had even the slightest fun with Terraria, Starbound et al, grab Crea.It's a new take on the 2D Sandbox genre, with much deeper RPG leanings than anything I've played so far. Think Starbound with stats. **Stats!** Intelligence! Luck! Agility!Combat is already as fun and engaging as Starbound's recent mechanic update, if not more-so.Graphically, it's a gorgeous, fun 2D sprite world which, incidentally, runs *much* smoother than Starbound does at the same resolution. Music is a treat for the ears, but thats pretty much a given from titles like this.Developer is outstanding; cannot speak highly enough about their presence on the forums. (As an example, I found a small bug, and posted at ~11:100am. Dev replied at ~11:30am.) "

								Crea is a breath of fresh air in the indie gaming universe.It pulls themes from the genre-builders Terraria and Minecraft and is inspired by games like Dark Souls and Final Fantasy. Crea brings energetic new art and mechanics to 2d sandbox games. With unique crafting, combat, and RPG elements, Crea is a great choice for all those who love a lighthearted mood when playing. Crea is always evolving and changing and its possibilities are endless with its friendly developers and easily moddable interface. The game is in beta however, and there are a few bumps that have to be evened out along the road. The movement can seem a bit choppy, multiplayer is unstable, random bugs, etc. Keep in mind that the devs are constantly working on this game along with the fantastic community.  "

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is a crafting sandbox RPG that places you in an alien world and tells you to survive. YES, this is a 2D crafting adventure sandbox RPG, much like Terraria. That does not mean that it is the same game, though. A large part of the time spent playing Crea is used to gather materials from above ground, underground, and enemies. While this may sound very familiar and common, it's the rest of the game that truly makes it shine. Crea focuses on small, randomly-generated dungeons that appear throughout the world, each with unique rules that the player must follow to complete them. Instead of a few large dungeons or giant bosses, the dungeons in Crea can spawn any time you destroy and enemy spawn or just randomly on the map. These dungeons range in size from 1-3(+?) floors and contain treasure and a variety of enemies who all want nothing more than to stop you from reaching the exit crystal. Unfortunately for you, you can't just hack away or start exploring, since each dungeon has a unique set of rules that the player must follow to avoid failing the dungeon. Some of these rules include: a time limit, not attacking enemies, invisible enemies, defeating an extra-strong enemy in the dungeon, etc. This makes every dungeon run a unique experience that requires the player to quickly adapt and decide on a course of action immediately upon entering a dungeon. There are also different colored crystals that will take the player to a simpler dungeon that only requires the player to destroy 1-4+ monsters spawners to receive a chest full of goodies.One of the most unique features of this game is that you have to discover crafting recipes by gathering and researching the components that are used in them. Instead of just gathering materials all day and dumping them into chests, you go to you research bench (once you make one) and use the materials you collected to start learning different recipes to help you survive and, eventually, thrive.Another great feature of Crea is the talents system. During gameplay the player receives experience for completing different tasks, such as mining, fighting, and exploring. These different types of experience level up different categories, such as gathering, combat, and exploration and allow the player to purchase different skills or abilities using those experience points. This allows the player to learn everything from new attacks to better weapon proficiency to passive and active skills to double jump and ledge grabbing. These different options allow the player to customize their character in whatever way they see fit to enhance their Crea survival experience.Rating: 8/10 Pros:  Easy to learn crafting research system Random dungeonsUnique dungeon rulesNice, relaxing musicExcellent talents system Cons:  Unclear if there is a major endgameNo simple way to interact with objects (you have to mouse over the object and press a key or click on it)No major boss fights (that I could find)Dungeon rules not easily visibleTutorial is VERY light Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor ASUSMS246H236 x2   Headphones LogitechG430   Keyboard RazerLycosa   Controller XBox360   Mouse LogitechM570   Microphone LogitechG430   Motherboard EVGAX58FTW3132-GT-E768-KR   CPU IntelCorei7-950BloomfieldQuad-Core306GHz   GPU SAPPHIRERadeonHD5770   RAM 12GBCorsairDDR3   OS Windows764-bit   HDD 120GBSSD   "

I like most of the things about this game; but I do wish it had some more interesting enemy types, more biome types, and more things to see while exploring or caving. While I haven't run into very many bugs like other people have, the main dev is extremely dedicated to fixing them.I look forward to more official content in the future, as well as community-created mods to expand the game further.

												I bought the game before it was even taken out of early access, and even at that time I would have still recommended it. But now being over 60 hours into the game I can safely say it is currently my favorite game, and I play it several hours a day.Originally the game was really buggy, it still is. BUT, the dev Jasson, is attempting to fix the bugs, every single day he works on this game. He goes into the discussions, and he streams the development on Twitch, where if you have a pressing bug, he will help you right there. Anything you have problems with he tries to resolve all of them. So even if the game is buggy, at least this dev takes his time to address them.He also plans to take suggestions for the game once the major bugs have been sorted out.So don't take it being buggy as something bad, because in time it'll be less and less. Also, sometimes the bugs make for hilarious screenshots(take a look at mine).I bought the game because some friends and I were getting bored of Terraria. This game looked cool, and so we took the chance. We are now all 40+ hours into the game and try to compete with each other to get maxed out. It is an incredibly fun game, with literally so much to do and to learn. It is fun alone, but even better with a few buds.The game is by far, worth it's pricetag. Spend the money, even now with what issues it has. It is worth every cent. Don't be a fool and waste any time not delving into this wonderful game! *Especially if you plan on seeing if it'll be in the Steam Summer Sale (2016), the dev already stated it won't be on sale until the Winter Sale.*			"

I'm not sure friends of mine would appreciate it's slower tone, but I, for one, love games like these. It does manage to set itself aside from Terraria, Minecraft, Starbound, and Edge of Space---but does so in a way I'm not sure how to put into words quite yet. I love it's focus on RPG style leveling of skills, and how the more you use them, the faster they level, and the more skill points you have to pour into that tree. It's a neat concept in a sandbox game. I think what I love about Crea above all, is the simplicity. It's very easy to unwind in. It's very easy to grasp. I've played related games and the tutorials are just throwing UI after UI at you. As of this review, there's only maybe---4 or 5 main tabs you'll be using besides your hotbar. It's not that complexity baffles me---if done right, it can be wonderful, but in a very specific line of previous games, it becomes a chore and overwhelming. In Crea, things are displayed in a very easy-going manner, at a great pace. The game is what you make it! If you want to sit down, have a little drink and something to eat, and manage things in your house before exploring the deep undergrounds---then go for it! Crea isn't for everyone, but if you want to have a simple and fun time building and exploring, then it may just be for you! I'm glad I picked it up. I hope to follow the devs as they unleash each new update. I've yet to explore Multiplayer, but I'm hoping it's a whole new ballpark!			"

												If you like Terria, Starbound, or Minecraft this game is for you.  I love this game so much because unlike those other games you can't jump to 10X MAX POWER SUPER GODLY right away.  Sure you would need someone to help you out, but if you join in with anyone else in those three games they can give you most of the more powerful items.  Crea has a very nice leveling up system.  You level up 5 different trees each with skills within those trees.  This system makes you explore like crazy! It's so awesome; you must level up these skills if you want to move forward.  I have been playing for 20 hours so far.  But I see no end in sight for me.  So much more to explore.  Also people have added more stuff in mods after the core game is finished!  This game is going to be awesome playing solo or with friends.			"

												Disclaimer: Review Copy.What is Crea? To put simply, a 2D sandbox-y game with lots of RPG elements thrown in. With so much to do and many things to build. A little confusing when I first started due to the lack of a good tutorial, but it's an addictive little game. And though I'm enjoying the game, I'm still learning to play it properly (I'm just so slow).+ Single player and multiplayer options.+ Consistent updates from the developer.+ Relaxing music.+ Supports Linux natively, woohoo!+ Smooth performance on my setup.+ Nice pixelated graphics.+ Vast world or realms to explore.+ Addictive gameplay.- Controller support is not intuitive (at the time of writing, it was supported). Gave up and played with keyboard and mouse instead.- Tutorial needs to be better, especially for those unfamiliar with either the sandbox or the RPG element of the game.- Crafting and researching can also be confusing, perhaps a wiki would help.But so far, no zombies. Maybe in the next update? Lol.My Rating: 7/10			"

								Crea is an amazing 2D sandbox game much like Terraria, Starbound, and others. But unlike any of these it has its own twist on certain aspects. Like for example it is more on an RPG game because it has a talent point system where you level up in certain areas by doing different things. Another example is that it has magic in the game, like attacks and healing. Also in order to craft things you need to research them before you craft them so you know the recipes. Plus an amazing art style that really ties the game together.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Terraria and the 2D sandbox genre.			"

												There are already plenty of detailed reviews on this game so I'll be brief:I've gotten over 50 hours of playtime out of Crea but it still feels a bit unfinished. Should you buy now? Depends on how bad you need to scratch your Terraria itch and how much patience you have with a game still in development. Though I'm starting to feel ""finished"" with the game at this point I do feel like I got my money's worth and I'm sure if I come back to it later there will be new things to discover. The developer is very active and I have faith that bugs will be fixed and content added as time goes on. 7/10			"

								As of v0.8.5:Pretty solid 2d exploration-building sandbox action-RPG. Sounds too complicated? Well, if you've heard of/played Terraria - you know exactly what's this game about.Crea has enough unique things going on to be considered worthy successor to Terraria, not just a straight copy. To name the few: experience based progression in all fields, skills system, progression in crafting, gathering and other areas, researching recipes and a bunch more minor things.Add to this Python codebase that anyone can edit and, as a result of this, completely moddable game. With a pretty simple way to create ANY mods. And then you can mod the mods if you want. Because it's just python :DMore details in the video:

												Crea is a 2D sidescrolling game with building and slow deliberate combat. It is similar in many respects to Terraria and Starbound. It's a decent game for what it is, but it should still be in early access as it is buggy and lacks polish. As it is now, I cannot recommend this game. If you'd like to play a game like this, you're probably better off playing Terraria as the devs there have had a great deal of time to refine the game.Pros+Talent points are constantly being gained, so your character is always improving as you play.+Procedurally generated worlds.+Built in mod support. If the game is able to maintain dedicated players, then it should have a good deal of extra free content.+Skills that enhance mobility, such as sprinting, ledge grabs, and double jumps can be obtained quite quickly.+Fast travel system. Saves you from retreading the same ground over and over again.+When compared to Terraria, digging is more satisfying earlier on due to upgrades allowing the mining of multiple tiles, making it less tedious to dig through areas.+Spells that you are able to access early on make it easy to find ore and chests.+No contact damage on most, if not all enemies, so you can't just take damage by bumping into them.Cons-Visual feedback is a bit lacking on spells.-Enemies are neither knocked backed or staggered by your attacks, making combo attacks less than usefull and making ranged combat seem like an objectively better option.-Enemies are sparse in the underground and tend to ignore you. There isn't much down there aside from the occasional crystal that teleports you to a dungeon, small rooms with chests in them, and of course, ores.-Only THREE options in the settings menu: volume, fullscreen options, and resolution. Sound effects and music aren't even separated, so if you want to listen to your own music or a video in the background, you're going to have to mute the sound entirely, or let the sounds overlap.-I've encountered a bug that has destroyed all my furniture, chests, NPCs, and many of my waystones (used for fast travel). The bug happened after teleporting back from the first(?) boss. I was able to pick up all of the furniture and items in the chests, but the Renma cores (a fairly valuable and rare resource) used to create the NPCs and my waystones were lost. I'd imagine there is a way to create new waystones, but I'm not sure how far along it is in the game.-Very small weapon variety at least in the early game. There are a few different spells, but not many.-Most chests (aside from ones in realm crystals and dungeons) locked and you have to rely on random drops to get keys for them or use lockpicks.-A lot of the gear you get from chests have high level requirements for the time you're able to get them, so you'll be waiting a while before you can even use them.

								I have had this game for a while (before Steam release) and can honestly say what a great game it is. Great pacing on exploration and things have to be researched before crafting which gives a great sense of achievement. Also every thing you do gives experience for your character in that task, whether it be digging, crafting or hitting things with a big stick it all counts. Graphics are good, interface is great and the music is awesome. Never regretted buying for a second.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following the Crea development for almost a year and a half, and I cannot express how much I recommend this game.Let's start with you all are probably thinking, this looks like Terraria. Well your right it does. You know the famous quote ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? Look at the game Delver for instance. If you were playing Delver a few years back it was 8-bit, minimalistic. It was a simple game, back then I don't think it was really worth what they were asking for. But now, wow does it look different now! It completely changed. And now comes with Texture pack support so you can change it around even more. That's what you have to think about with early access games, you never know what could change or when! Just because graphically the game looks similar to Terraria does not make it a ""clone"" or ""rip-off"", the 2D-pixel side scrollers have been around far longer than Terraria.Gameplay wise Crea feels great. There isn't much in the game when it comes to building blocks or materials, but to me that is a plus. I sometimes feel overwhelmed in Terraria or Starbound with all the blocks I could use to build with. It can get stressful, and I don't want to get stressed over a game; I don't think anyone does. Now keeping in mind this is Early Access, so there is much more to come.Now another thing you are probably wondering about is the ""easily moddable"" line that is mentioned. Now folks, you can't just hop into a program and make your own mod within minutes, you still need a basic understanding of what to do and it still takes some time. But Crea encouraged me to learn the basics and I've already made a few mods myself. That fact the Crea has official mod support right out of the gate is amazing! Unlike some other games *cough* Minecraft *cough*.TL;DR: This game is astounding, the fantasy-style worlds with the RPG-style character progression fit together perfectly. I'd play this over Terraria any day of the week.Yes this game is Early Access, it has bugs and it isn't finished, that may turn some people away. But it's really great to follow the development of a game and help shape it to where it should go. If your afraid of the developers leaving the game, don't worry. They have built from the ground up an amazing game for over 3 years. If they haven't left yet they are not going anywhere.5/5			"

I would like to thank Siege Games for giving me the chance to try this game and write out a review for them. However, I assure you their action does not affect my evaluation at all.REVIEWA sandbox/crafting game with RPG elements that is almost similar to Terraria, but maybe with a cuter art style. Even with the comparisons, there are still features that make Crea a game of its own. But basically, Crea is more of a laidback and relaxing game compared to the similar games.I would definitely recommend this game to those who loved Terraria and want something fresh. But even if you’re not a fan of Terraria, the game is still enjoyable. Just make sure to be patient since the game does require you to play it for a few hours before you can appreciate it as  a whole.PROS Skill-Base Progression – There are different skills in multiple categories. Your tools, attack damage, defence wouldn’t just depend on the items you’re equipping but it would also depend on how much skill points you will spend on it. Researching Recipes – Before crafting any item, first you need to learn its recipe. And this can be done by using a Research Table and then consuming some materials which will later reveal the possible recipes.Active Developers – They’re trying their best to make this game as great as possible. They care a lot about the game, and you can easily see that through their Twitter accounts or their Twitch channel where they do streams to show you more about the game while listening to some suggestions by the community.Controller Support – It’s not a 100% perfect, but still it is satisfying to use. I still switch to using keyboard and mouse when it gets complicated. The game supports both XInput (Xbox) and Dual Shock (PlayStation) controllers. Neat Tutorials – There are times a specific tutorial would pop up, you can always go to the settings and check out the Tutorial from there. The instructions are all clear and they cover the basic principles of the game. But if ever you need more help, they do have an official wiki page right here[creawiki.net]. CONSSudden Lags – With the graphics this game has, it’s kind of surprising to experience some sudden freezes. No Dedicated Servers – I always have a hard time trying to figure out how to connect to other players directly, and sometimes my network just doesn’t allow me to. There won’t be any servers hosted by Steam here, so players are pretty much on their own.Level Scaling – I can’t point my finger whether it is slow or it is just darn too fast. I haven’t been far from the spawn location and I already found a higher level item, now imagine what else could happen if I continue. And I’m personally having a hard time killing monsters which are supposed to be a piece of cake since it is still near the spawn location. "

												This game is decent, It is fairly cheep, and I throughly am enjoying it. This game provides some new elements that I think lacked in terrari (139 hours on terraria as of now) While this game is a terraria clone and I don't recomend it to you if 1.) you dislike terraria, or 2.) havent played terraria, I personally thought it was a great new game to play, rather than terraria. I recomend this to those who arent afraid to put time into the game and get to know it. To those who have like 5 hours on record and are saying its terrible I say this to you: what have you done in this game? Have you tried to enjoy it, or are you looking for a reason to hate it? Now with that out of the way. I must say I would give this a mediocer review had I not put in the time I have. At first it seems to be shallow, but it is deeper than it seems, trust me. I enjoy it. Though Im starting to think starbound may have been a better choice. Regardless. Check out other games before you settle here. Thats all. You should always look around before you settle on a choice.			"

								Still in early development, its a solid game nonetheless and its worth it imo. Typical issues with these kinds of games apply like the lack of a modding community though modding is supported mainly due to it being in beta so any update could defunct a mod.The unique things are when compared to say Starbound is that this game doesn't have some of the things you might expect, like rain and interactable home items. Also you need hamachi to play with friends and so on. The art grows on you quickly for some reason, at first the images looked nice, then I played it an didn't really like the character art but eventually I preffered it over some of the other sprite games out 'T'here. With that said, I can recommend this game to anyone who liked Star Bound and want to experience something slight different and still good. "

								Crea is an excellent game. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to play a fluid, expansive 2D sandbox universe. My favourite aspect of Crea is the crafting and skills. Not only can you upgrade equipment to have major bonuses against monsters, but you can create immersive little hovels to put all your stuff in. It's honestly the quaintest little game i've ever played.There isn't much wrong with Crea. I would suggest doing a few playthroughs if you are new to the genre, as it can be somewhat difficult at first. Once you get the hang of it, it's a fun experience that is more relaxing than anything else. I don't know what the developers plan to add in future updates, but I would like to see more immersive armors and weapons, maybe even some low-level rings and accessories. Making them accessable by level 18+ might make the gameplay a little smoother, but I personally enjoy the grind. An example of other weapons and armors would be staves and a variety of robes (can you tell I play a mage character?). The only thing that bothers (slightly) me about Crea is the placement of physical power weapons on the characters. I mean literally how far they appear to jut from my hands. I think they are a little too far out. Some of the weapons even feel over-sized, but that might just be me.Overall, an excellent game. 11/10			"

Honestly if there's something you don't like about the game, just post it on their forums and one of the devs (in my experience) almost always reads it or replies back with some information or further questions.

								Similar to Starbound and Terraria, while still remaining unique and interesting. Crea focuses more on the traditional sense in it being an RPG. Levels, skills, and magic!

 Leveling up is similar in respects to The Elder Scrolls games, where practice makes perfect. So if you want to spend an entire day just mining and leveling up that gathering skill, you sure can.  Crea's crafting system  also has yet another divergance from it's Starbound and Terraria siblings, in that you actively need to use resources and materials for research. Simply having some stone and wood doesn't mean you can make an axe. You have to use the Research Table, and actually figure out how. Consuming the materials in the process however. The game might start off slow, but once you get into the swing of things is extremely fun. Combat and controls are exciting and responsive, in a somewhat 2D-platformer way, and thanks to the unique and character progression, and environments, with a sprinkle of formidable random world bosses means there's hours of fun to be had.Overall the game is extremely fun, and I prefer it over Starbound simply down to it's old school RPG elements,			"

								I really enjoy this genre, and think Crea is a good addition to it. I'm excited to see what mods people create, and maybe even for contributing one myself.The music is excellent, the graphics are good, and I sort of like the slightly different control mechanic. I find some others in the genre a little clunky and didn't have that experience with Crea.So, while it's good, I had to mod some things for it to be playable for me. The rate of collection from the beginning is slow, which is fine, but I also have a day job and wasn't enjoying the grind -- this is a pretty simple thing to fix, and there's a mod tutorial that will give you enough information to modify the tool you're using to make it faster (the tutorial is for windows, and I'm on a mac). If it seems like I'm complaining, I'm not, because I had the power to change it to my liking, which is really the idea. Though, it might be nice to have this be a world setup configuration for those that don't want to jump into modding?I appreciate the concept behind the research, and think it's a good idea. I would appreciate seeing a research tree, or at least some indication of progression though. I have researched all the materials I've found (there's an indication bar for each material, and it seems like when it's full/yellow you've researched it as much as is possible), but I don't really know if there's more materials or anything, which makes it sort of feel like more of a hinderance than an advancement. I really can't say if I have researched all of the craftables or not -- is there more? Not sure what my feedback is about making that feel more explorative and less restrictive though.That's pretty much it for my feedback. It's a fun play, and it feels pretty wide open for cool mods -- if you know python, get in there and start CREAting.			"

Aside from a few performance issues and a couple bugs (such as spawning in the ground or ceiling under certain circumstances) it's pretty solid, both gameplay and mechanically. The four classes are fun and each have enjoyable weapons, and the abilities you can gain are quite useful. It may seem like you have no story when you start off, but you slowly uncover the tale of the land as you gain pages such as long-lost letters and forgotten story pages. Overall an enjoyable, if incomplete, game. I would definitely reccomend buying it.			"

								A nice game, adding some cool rpg elements to the 2d base-building genere (skyrim meets terraria). It has some flaws, being a an early access game, but it seems to be developing quite well.Give it a try if youre a terraria fan, or want to see whats the 2d-minecraft genere is all about.			"

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review I recently started playing this game honestly not knowing what to expect, so I sat down and played it.  And it turns out theres more to this game than meets the eye.  Crea is a side scroller RPG/Crafing game that has a little of everything.The game play took a little getting used to for me. I will be honest I havent played a side scroller since the early 90's.  But, this game showed theres more to it.  From massive exploration to classic feeling boss fights, this game combines a bunch of elements to keep players entertained time and time again.  While the crafting system is a tad confusing and may need a rework, the combat is fun.  Also in the game is a great multiplayer functionality where you and your friends can team up to survive and take down the bosses and earn those heartwarming achievements together.Whats nice about this game is it seems to be extremely community driven.  Players can always leave suggestions and bug reports on the discussion forums, or even go to twitch where the developer can be seen and chat with directly.  Rating: 6/10 Pros:  Leveling system that levels up an area dependant on a task, such as crafting or exploration Being able to craft entire homes with furniture for more of that homely feelMultiplayer, so you dont have to survive the world alone  A very active developer and constant updates Cons:  Crafting system seems to be overly complex making the game feel a little frustratingI have noticed that if your playing with people and they make a large above ground structure...you might not be going that directionTutorial extremely lackingSome map seeds become extremely hard to navigate causing you to spend more time building land bridges just to get resources.

												The trailer makes it seem like a  reskin of Starbound, but it's really not . The game progression is much more fluid in comparson. The RPG aspect of leveling up to gain points which can be put into stats and building a talent tree to gain specific skills meshes so well with the existing concept of exploring a vast world to find materials, weapons, and gear to better yourself.This game is oozing with potential, but potential is meaningless if it goes to waste . I can see this being wicked fun to play with friends. The idea of grouping up with a warrior, an archer, a mage, and a healer to take on a crazy tough boss seems so exciting, but the path to that fight is pretty bare bones. It is excusable because it's early-access, but there's gotta be more content. I only hope the devs refine this possible gem with their hard work.Tl;DrGame is good. Leveling and skills/talent development works well with Terraria styled adventure game. Needs more content.			"

												---I received this game from the developer in order to review it. You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016ReviewFor review purposes, most of my playing time took place just before and just after the game came out of early access (around Version 1.0.0) Also I used a keyboard and mouse to play.Crea is a Sandbox game with RPG and Crafting elements. When you first start the game you get a sword, shield and a mining tool and that is pretty much it. From there you need to fight, explore and scavenge your way through the game, mining elements and creating items with recipes you unlock during play. The game really is quite in depth and takes quite a bit of time to get used to. I feel like after 18 hours of play, I have barely scratched the surface of what is offered in this game. There are 3 equipment slots and 3 accessory slots on top of weapon and shield slots. As your character levels up you can level up 8 different stats and on top of that there are 5 subsections (Arms, Syle, Gather, Craft and Explore). Each of these subsections have their own level and points awarded for reaching certain criteria and there are between 10 and 20 different spells and abilities to unlock using these points for each subsection. The game really is quite in depth and again I feel like I have only scratched the surface.Crea really is a great Sandbox game with a huge amount to discover. Hopefully if things continue in a positive direction, it will easily leave its competition in the dust. In the following section, I will go into a bit about what makes this game great and a few things it needs to improve on.Rating:8.5/10Pros:Replay Factor : Their are many reasons to keep coming back to this game. I have been playing for close to 20 hours and Im sure I have barely touched the surface of this game. With so many ways to upgrade different stats and objects, you will keep coming back every chance you get. Steam Workshop support included provides players the opportunity to really make this game their own.4-Pack : Being able to purchase the game in a 4-Pack is great as this game really should be played with friends. I started out by playing on a server with a group but I quickly had to switch to single player when the server wasn't kept up to date. I will explain about this further below.Developer Involvement : The developer really has listened to the community to this point. I wasn't able to play much multiplayer because with every game update the server needed to be reset and the person running the server couldn't keep up with all the updates being released. It just seemed like every time someone ran into an issue, it was corrected almost as soon as it was reported. It is hard to find dedication like that.Game Play : Everything from the mining and crafting to the fighting of mobs seemed quite smooth. There does seem to be a bit of lag that I encountered just before I wrote the review but I understand the developer knows about it and I can only imagine it will be fixed any time now with the next update! Overall though a very smooth and easy to play game.Achievements and Trading Cards : Although these were not implemented until around the time of the games full release, they are now available and working as they should be. These are by no means a necessity but always a great addition as many people love their cards and achievements.Cons:No Dedicated Server : For a game like this I would expect a dedicated server to be available as the game really lends itself to play with friends. As you can see in the pros above, 4-Packs are available and you could have one of your friends try to set up and run their own server but I really feel a dedicated server is needed here. Not sure if there are plans to implement this or not at this point.Tutorial : There is a tutorial in the game but it seems like there isn't much info to get enough of an idea what you need to do or how to progress. The one thing I will point out is that there is a Crea Wiki page (Not sure about links but you can Google it to find where it is) I tried to stay away from it as I wanted to play the game without getting any hints but if you run into trouble I'd suggest starting there.Slow Start : I found the game quite slow at the start. I don't know if it was because I wasn't able to craft the right gear early enough but I really didn't get any good gear until level 15 but after that things really took off. This may have to do with the tutorial not being as deep as I feel it should have though.Disclaimer:Source of consideration: Siege Games "

I can see the potential in this game and i hope that the creator keeps adding more and more cause the more content this game receives the better it's going to get. I love the RPG elements, this is something i wanted Terraria to have and it works good and once again the more that gets added to that the more interesting it will become. I'm looking forward to seeing where this game goes, good job!			"

												I have a love for gather and build games such as this. I have spent hours on terraria, starbound and other like minded games and I can honestly say I really enjoy playing this. I would say it is similar to terraria in the fact that its a 2d digging, building, crafting and boss killing game, but I love the crafting style on this game. Each part of a recipe must be found and researched before you are able to craft items / weapons / armor etc. There is also a mini game which you can complete to enable you to craft more quality items, rather than it just being random getting an item imbuement. There are also aspects which alow you to suctomose your character as you level as you are given to choice to level different abilities for combat, gatthering, crafting etc. You can maz them all at the end of course, but this made the gameplay a lot more interesting I found. Would definately reccomend.			"

												This will be a short one:Conclusion: For me as a part-time player with probably 5hrs/week playtime exactly the right game. Just enough to do for an hour or two, not overwhelming and you won´t miss something out not playing for a week.Pro:- Easy, little sandbox game.- Not too much grinding- Very scenic- Good time-wasterCon:- A lot content is ""hidden"". Means, there are more or less vague hints where you can findthem and what they actual are. If you want a game that points directly at everything youhave to / can do: Nope, not Crea- Steep learning curve- After 50hrs you probably have seen most of the game. And nothing, except a new-start,will change this. (so far)			"

								A very good game sort of like Minecraft and Terraria, but with a better use of skills and research.

Review Written on Tuesday, June 14th, 2016 Review 32 hours and counting... that is how long i have played this game. it now ranks in my top .5%(yes, I do mean one half of one percent) of games on steam ranked by hours played. Suffice to say, I have enjoyed it very much, and this is considering I had my doubts that I would get into this game at all going in. Anyway, lets get into it. You all know the buzzwords by now: sandbox, rpg, survival, crafting etc, and that is all well and good, but I would like to talk about exactly what compels me to come back to this game time and time again. I think it comes down to the fact that there is always something different that I am excited to do next. There is usually at least one skill that I am excited to level up. The leveling system is packed with options. Your character as a whole will level up, in addition to acquiring skill points in different categories including syle(magic), crafting, exploring and more. Each category is loaded with different skills to learn. Each set of skills has its own method for accumulating points to buy the skills. Combat consists of both physical and magic attacks, along with a set of skills for each. The fighting itself feels right. You have hand to hand and ranged weapons, as well as a variety of spells at your disposal. Monsters are scattered throughout the land, and you will also be able to enter dungeons that exist outside of the world. I particularly enjoy that each dungeon comes with a specific set of rules. A dungeon may have invisible creatures and no healing allowed, for example. The dungeons can be found in the wild, but you can also craft a NPC who will allow you to jump right into a dungeon that you can create to your specifications. The dungeons keep things fresh with their changes from one to the next. Exploration is also a great way to spend time. I spent much of my time wandering around taking in all the sights and collecting new items. There are various biomes above ground, and an immense world of caverns and secrets when you venture underground. Hours upon hours can be spent exploring any given world. I must say that the one downside of the randomly generated worlds would be that you may have a tough time finding certain items. In my case, There were a few items the game expected me to acquire around the time when my character reached level 10, but due to the random nature of the world, the biome that contains them ended up being far, far away from me. I made it to level 20 or so before I found I had no choice but to venture out to retrieve the items. Unfortunately, the creatures there were all level 40 and could crush me in a single hit. I am willing to accept this task as a chance occurance, but it did slow my progress in the game. The crafting system is based on recipes. I would go out exploring, and each time I returned, I would run over and see what new item recipes i could uncover with the items I had gathered on my journey. New uses for items will become available as you level up, so there was always a chance that some old random item would suddenly become very useful again. There is also a system that involves chaos. It adds a unique twist where you try to improve the quality of your items before the chaos gets too high. It certainly helps to differentiate the crafting system from other games, but may be a bit confusing for beginners. In the end, everything is done well. That is what makes crea so great. I can set off to mine for some ore, only to have it turn into a great adventure into a dungeon that gives me some key items to open up a new pile of goods to craft. I love that the possibilities seem endless everytime I leave my home base and set out into the world. Nothing seems like a chore, and the next epic discovery may be waiting right around the corner.Rating: 8.7/10 Pros:  Dev is super active. He is literally on twitch everyday fixing bugs and chatting. This is one of those games where there is always just one more thing that I want to do before I quit.  Cons:  Crafting can be confusing for beginners, particularly the chaos aspect. Randomly generated worlds can cause problems gathering certain items if you run into bad luck during world creation. Beginners should stay close to the starting point until they get stronger. It can be tough to resist the urge to wander further to explore. Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games	 "

Should You Buy This Game?Crea is a procedurally generated 2D sandbox RPG. The gameplay focuses on collecting/harvesting material and environmental objects/enemies in order to craft items, learn recipes and level up talents. The large and expansive world (if you choose to create such a world) includes multiple terrain/biomes, dungeons, creatures and objects. The world is fairly dense, and a day/night cycle creates a truly immersive setting. Crea is definitely recommended to those that are fans of the 2D sandbox RPG genre (there really aren’t that many on Steam). For everyone else, I would advise waiting for a deeper sale, or go in with a few buddies on a 4-pack (individually cheaper this way). Online multiplayer is supported.First Impressions----06/10/2016----Character & CombatWhen you first make a character (after creating a “small/medium/large” world), you will then be left to proceed at your own pace. Equipped with two modes, Combat & Build, your character will often be switching between the two in order to harvest in peace. The Combat system utilizes a customizable two handed approach, along with a jump and roll-dodge mechanic. A health and stamina bar will limit your prowess. Talent SystemTalents, or skills, are categorized under Arms, Syle (Magic), Gather, Craft, and Explore. Each talent must be unlocked by reaching a certain level, then purchasing with the pre-requisite amount of TP (talent points) – earned by performing actions from that particular category. Some of the skills include: Ledge Grab, Refine, Tool Proficiency, Fireball, Dash etc.EquipmentCharacters may be equipped with a Helm, Chest and Leg armors, along with 3 accessories (disregarding Combat/Build equipment). The character is progressed through an XP level system, and the stats that can be modified are: Health, Stamina, Attack, Defense, Intelligence, Mind, Agility, and Luck.CraftingThere is a plethora of crafting categories and sub-categories that include armor, furniture, outfits, recipes, tools etc. Not all crafting objects/recipes are learned at start. Research must be performed, which generally occurs in the form of retrieving a new item and interacting with the Research Desk.Current State of the GameDeveloper SupportAs of this review, the developers have fixed multitudes of minor bugs and a few major bugs reported by users through Steam reviews and from their website/forums. Originally in Early Access, the official release was launched during this review process. When referring to the Steam News or Discussions board, you can see very active involvement from the developers. I once saw a thread about a door glitch, and the developer responded and fixed the bug within 3 hours of the thread’s posting. The biggest takeaway points are listed below:Highlights:Diverse sceneryDay/night cycleLarge/procedurally generated worldsDungeonsObstacles:Starting inventory space is too smallControllers are supported, but extremely tedious to use (having to aim reticle in order to harvest with a controller is a bit cumbersome)UI is a bit lacking; quantities of which items are possessed/needed for a recipe is a bit confusing to interpret due to absent labels.DisclaimerA copy of this game was provided by the developer: Siege Games; however, this did not bias my review in any form.

								Crea is a fun game, thou far slower paced than Terraria. You should not compare it way too much to Terraria as it offers different things and unique feeling world. Recearch and Leveling are a few things that make it slower but they also offer more fun in building you char the way you want it and searching for new ingredients to research. Monsters also feel unigue as does the world in a way. The teleport crystals are also a fun way to move around faster, as you travel further you find new crystal that you can then teleport your self later. Thou the game is currently very blocky looking what comes to terrain bu so was terraria, 7 days to die and other game like it when they started. It is still early access so more content is due to come. I recomend this game for those who like games such as Terraria, Starbound, Edge of space and other crafting games.			"

								What at first appears to be a basic version of terraria quickly becomes a deep and interesting game.I love the leveling system, it reminds me slightly of Skyrim, what you use more often gets leveled quicker.The crafting system is brilliant, having to research materials to get recipes i find much more enjoyable than having to look it up on a wiki somewhere.  The inventory management is superb as well, as well as the ability to use items in chests as long as you are in range makes crafting much simpler.Combat and Magic mechanics are excellent, though i can imagine it will get even better.And lastly, my favorite thing, it actually runs on my crummy computer.

The gameplay can be a bit slow at times but thats ok coz the rest is awesomeUpdate: I used to love this game a couple of years back, but now i cant even play it anymore because when i open it, its resolution is really weird so i can not see any of the buttons in the main menu. I do not know why it does this and how to fix it, ive tried re installing and everything. There is no way for me to set it to full screen or access the settings to fix it.			"

								Updated (8/29/'15) Making yet another edit to this game. I recently just started playing again as of two days ago, reason being I've been busy most of the time, With little time left to seriosly play this game. What I am really a fan of is Crea's combat system. You can actually use your shield to block and you can somewhat dodge things, it's not just  *click* *click* *skill* and there is a lot of different ways to mix up the combat to have a continuiously fun time. What I mostly spend my time in Crea doing is Exploring, and crafting. Even with 300 hours on the game I can definitely say There's a lot I really haven't done, due to the fact I've been just exploring the world. There's so much to see and discover. Exploring is fun, yes, and it's not completely useless. you actually do NEED to explore, you won't be able to find your materials all in one place. You have to go far and wide to find the things you need.With crafting there's a ton of things to do with this. Before, (which I thought was more fun) You had to actually go around and kill stuff, and use the items you find to put towards a crafting recipe in order to find out how to make the item. So you'd need to find the materials one by one until you finally get the right combination. That's also something I've had fun doing. Now, it's a bit more easier and i'm not complaining, it gives me time to do more in Crea.Lastly, the modding is something I have great hopes in. There are already some creations on the workshop, but I would like to see a lot more.  This is the game where I definitely want to try to sink my feet into with modding the game. I also would like to see a lot more people play this game, but that's going to come sooner or later. With Crea, there's really an exciting future in store for all of us fans. I highly recommend it.~Prinny			"

Early Access Review
								This game amoung all the crafting games promises character buildup, a world with many of places to explore, and a very intresting NPC system that allows the player to build up on their crafting and also purchase many of items. As far of these hours put into the game, I didn't really get super far because the amount of items that need to be researched before actually crafting. Some may say it's tedious, but in reality it's a way to get you character up to a understanding level of crafting which is a good way of immersion. As for the combat and gameplay is kind of limited it still shows value that this game isn't just a game where the people decided that they should release it for money, but a growing game where it is indeed playable. As to most early access games, there are a few bugs I'd like to say to those looking into this game. All of the game is probably the best in fuctioning besides some chest not showing you removed the item from the chest. Another is falling through a block when breaking off the block next to it. It sometimes happens when you don't want it to and gravity in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥! That's another problem, the jumping. I feel that it's so far one of the most weirdest games to have gravity that will pull you down under seconds, and the jump button sometimes just for some reason doesn't want to work for me sometimes. Might be my laptop, but any other game it works just fine. All in all though, this game is worth the early access and it understood to be one of the next terraria's on steam. I'd say 8.5/10 for me, I'm almost sold!			"

								I think crea is a great game, but its a little rough around the edges my main complaint is how bad the controlls for the ps4/xbox one controler is the gamplay is really diffrent and not in a good way you can only use 4 of the 5 tallent slots and you can't even equip them to the slots when your using a controller and when you use a keyboard and mouse you can't roll butt you can with a controller.butt other than that its a great game "

								Interesting little game. While the music and sound effects are nothing to write home about, the skill tree and xp system brings a fun new mechanic to the genre. I look forward to the animals not being auto leveled. Currently there is no sense of progression. ie. Yes, you make a stronger sword, but you enemies get stronger too so the creature that killed you at level 1 can still kill you at level 10.			"

								Very interesting and lovely 2d-minecraft-sandbox-terraria-thing.exe Focuses on colorful environment and a very light mood, allowing for more casual and free play, instead of hardcore survival including endless mining and grinding. Very intuitive crafting system and the combat is great as well, especially with the very well made magic mechanics, even though combat doesnt seem to be that big of a focus. But the most stunning thing that ive experienced about this game is the soundtrack. It fits perfectly with the mood and just makes you feel better.Maybe not a game for everyone, as it doesnt seem nearly as progress-focused as something like terraria, but i personally almost prefer it that way, after all, its a sandbox, right?

												[UPDATE]So Jasson released a update and the game is working beautifully. There are some fps dips on game start but it WILL go away! The gui has been reworked and works wonderfully! To some older players who have a game crash on launch just unsub some/all of the mods for the game and it should run.The game at times can feel like a grind but in my personal opinion it is not a ""bad"" kind of grind. It is quite rewarding and makes you want to put in the hours to get somewhere. The talent system is awesome and while I do feel that more talents should be added I also feel that it is not necessary just yet. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of different talents and trust me it will take a while to get them all.I have noticed that at first it may feel the enemies are OP to some but you can block, dodge or later on cast protection spells + healing spells,potions or food which will benefit you in a fight.Honestly after the most recent update I can full on recommend this to anyone. The devs are constantly communicating and their attitudes are great so all in all you can expect things to be fixed if something goes wrong.If you love 2D adventure games with magic and beautiful art + music and mod support then you should for sure try Crea.

Early Access Review
								Early days yet, but Crea still impresses.Although this game is early access, it is more than playable. The crafting/research system is excellent, pacing the development of characters well, giving purpose to seeking out and harvesting even basic minerals. The idea of using pre-crafted items as part of recipes, almost like upgrades, also keeps a good progressive pace.Although there is only one boss at present, the game itself is extensive and exploration can go on for hours.The easy 'moddability' of Crea is a surprisingly strong point. Within mere minutes, it is possible to create additional in game items from weapons to furniture.Visually pleasing however the scaling of the screen resolution can be an issue. There is a scaling slider in options, but this can be buggy at times.I would recommend this game for fans of the 2D Sandbox genre or crafting/survival games in general.			"

								A unique name for a game, but sometimes it's the hidden gem behind a name that truly stands out. Crea is very much like Starbound; crafting items and weapons/armor and battling baddies. Some major differences from Starbound is that you level up when you earn enough XP, and each weapon/tool that is used will grant you the XP tied to a particular category. Kind of like a crafting survival RPG. You're always full--hunger is exempt here. The graphics aren't anything special, but if you enjoyed playing SB's pixel graphics you'll likely approach Crea in a positive way. I've experienced some lag while playing, and this is for single-player. It's very minor, fortunately. The soundtrack's pretty soothing until it abruptly ends for an odd reason; I still find SB's unbeatable, though. Busy with Starbound so why did I buy Crea? It's indie developed and Python was used to make it--I've been learning Python since last year on my spare time, and I want to be able to see the code and learn from it. Modding is available too.

								Let's be honest...yes, it is basically a clone of Terraria, doesn't really do much that the first hasn't done with building, even seems to take steps back in some areas.  However, if you felt that your characters, and not just your equipment, should have been able to grow and get stronger, as well as having some freedom in how your character gets stronger (like with going melee or concentrating on bows, or magic spells) then this might be a good game to get.  Just...wait til there's some development progress.			"

												I would give this game a solid 4/5, which is amazing considering it was just released. Between the levelling system, crafting, skills, and world exploration, this is a must-buy.As far as critiques go, I would say that the skill levelling needs to be tweaked a bit. It is very rare that your crafting level and your player level coincide, resulting in you not being able to use the armor/weapons that you can make or not being able to make the armor/weapons that you need. This takes away a lot of the game's momentum, as it results in you needing to grind crafting recipes or monsters before you can continue to progress. Also, with the crafting system, it's nice that you can pay scrap to learn a recipe if you just can't figure out a couple of the ingredients, but this system would work a lot better if you could just pay 50 scrap to uncover each individual part of a recipe. Also there needs to be a more reliable way to get scrap; the scrapper machine (or whatever it's called) gives like 1 scrap for every 5 or so good items you destroy (totally not worth it).Also, I may be missing something, but it's really hard to use combat skills in combat. If you wanted to use more than 4 combat skills (plus heal), you're basically SOL since your toolbar is full. a toolbar with more slots would help alleviate this problem. Aside from these trivial critiques, the fact remains that this a superb game. More immersive than Terraria and more fun than Edge of Space or even Dig or Die. Buy it while it's on sale!			"

								Was looking for a game like Terraria after being disappointed by Starbound. This game adds an RPG and a research dynamic that are a lot of fun, and helps with the feeling of progression. The varioius spells in the game add more unique ways of killing enemies as well. I am not really into the ""base building"" and I just buid the essentials(no decorations), so I cannot comment a lot on that aspect of the game, but I have no complaints about it either. If I did have any compliants about this game they would be: 1. The spells do not have very much information, so it is hard to tell how much stronger the next level is. It may be based on level, but that would be useful information as well. Also, they only go up to level 5, which is easy to get to. 2. I feel the underground is very dark, even with a lot of torches, so sometimes it is hard to see. 3. It would be nice to be able to tell what items you could make from materials, by clicking on them in the ""materials"" list. As of now, I have trouble organizing garbage materials from the good ones(like I said I dont care about decoration items)Overall I am glad I picked this game up! I have been having a lot of fun.			"

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is Siege Games take on the terraria/starbound sandbox kind of game with some really interesting ideas and mechanics. Most notable would be the inclusion a large variety of skills and talents, You gain experience for levels and to spend on talents like mining, fighting, exploring and crafting. Learning recipes is interesting as you need to research different materials that you find to begin unlocking them. The graphics are nice enough, if a little small on my big monitor. The music is pleasant and doesnt seem to get too repetitive. It has nice multiplayer and I only noticed a few bugs. I have played a few hours(several offline), researched a lot of recipes, explored several caves, died countless times to creatures simple and complex alike. This is definitely a game worth sinking time into! Rating: 8.0/10 Pros:  Combat - Blocking, using skills, very fun and an interesting addition to this style of game. Research - Hording all those materials is worthwhile! You might learn some really nice recipes :) Talents - Grants abilities to help with everything. Crafting can be improved, you can even learn to grab the edge of a ledge. Mini Dungeons - When you kill a creature spawner, there seems a chance to drop a crystal, and if you use it, you teleport to a small dungeon of those spawners, and you have to kill them all to get treasures. Mode Switch - Switch between combat hotbar and building hotbar with the press of a button.  Cons:  Day/Night Cycle - It seems a bit fast, before I know it, it is dark again. Lighting - Could just be me, as I havent gotten very far, but I cant seem to light the place up enough  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor LG-27MP37HQ-27 IPS Monitor   Headphones Razer Adaro Wireless   Keyboard Razer Deathstalker   Controller Logitech F310   Mouse Logitech M-U0028   Microphone Microphone   Motherboard MS-7693   CPU AMD FX-6300   GPU AMD Radeon R9 380   RAM 8GB   OS Windows 10   HDD HDD  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games "

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is an RPG/sandbox hybrid game, in the style of Terarria. Despite being 2D side-scroller, the Creas procedural generated worlds are vast and beautifully rendered, making it all to easy to put hours and hours into the crafting of your world and levelling of your characters. While the tutorial is brief, the learning curve is not to steep - I found it took a while for the game to pick up pace. Once you get there though there is an enjoyably detailed RPG adventure with many talents and skills to master. Rating: 7.0/10 Pros:  Vast game to explore with procedurally generated worlds Good mod support Fast travel avoids potential tedium Well built levelling system  Cons:  Combat with spells a little clunky User interface a little tough to use/reead Game takes a while to pick up pace  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor BenQ GW2760 1920x1080   Headphones Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930   Keyboard Gamdias HERMES Lite Mechanical Keyboard   Controller Xbox 360 Controller for Windows   Mouse Sharkoon Fireglider   Microphone Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930   Motherboard msi sli x99 plus   CPU Intel i7 5820k   GPU GeForce GTX 980   RAM 16GB   OS Windows 7   HDD 256GB SSD + 2 x 1TB HDD + 1 x 8TB NAS  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games "

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is a is a side scrolling 2d open world sandbox game where you obtain materials by hacking up the rocks, trees and creatures around you and craft items. There is also lore items you can find. The game starts you out alone in the wilds but there is a tutorial that does a nice job of telling you what there is to do and how to go about doing it. Other similar games have left me a bit lost so this was very welcome. You can also re-open the tutorial so review anything you may have forgotten. I also enjoyed the talent system which just by doing something I earned talent points and spent these points on skills. This gave a nice feeling of character growth and progression. While I only played the single player version I found the game to be fun to play and pleasing visually and audibly. Rating: 6.5/10 Pros:  Tutorial was helpful and I was able to refer back to it. Graphics and sound effects were simple but pleasing. The backgrounds were really pretty. Ability to alternate between build and combat mode as a toggle made less confusing UI. A wide variety of monsters to slaughter. Some were so cute I felt bad killing them. Difficulty settings let me play on easy till I figured out what I was doing.  Cons:  I died super easy. I dont know if I am just bad but its frustrating to die to your first slime. I would like to choose what displays to the General and Battle tabs. The music, which is really good, does not play often enough. I interacted with a realm crystal but I have no idea what it did. It did transport me somewhere else. I leveled up but never saw a tutorial about it.

Posted: June 16, 2016
												I think this game falls under a ""wait and see"" category, even though I did mark this as a recommended review. I decided on this because while there are notable flaws, my overall experience wasn't negative and the developer seems to be constantly working on the game. I picked Crea up during its -10% release sale. The developer has said the next sale will be in December 2016, at ~25% off.I suppose the first game people jump to in comparison is Terraria. I loved Terraria. I rarely think about Terraria when playing this game. I would draw more similarities to Starbound. I didn’t like Starbound, but Crea doesn’t draw out the same dullness I felt from there. Crea has two leveling systems. The first is the general character/combat level that increases as you kill monsters. Your stats go up, you get a point to allocate, simple enough. The second is the Talent system. Whenever you take an action, you have a chance to gain experience in a corresponding Talent, Arms (Weapons), Syle (Magic), Gather, Craft, and Explore. It’s a very nice system that feels rewarding… aside from Craft. I’ll talk about that later.Graphics are nice, I like the more subtle colors compared to Terraria, while still remaining crisper than Starbound. Music is nice and accompanies the slower gameplay very well. Even though the gameplay is slower, I never really felt like my character itself was too slow. I know in Terraria the initial startup movement is extremely painful, but it feels good in Crea. Even with a Sprinting talent unlocked, I often forget about it simply because the normal walking speed is a great pace. The time before a grappler can be obtained is smoothed out with a Ledge Grab talent, and you can unlock a Double Jump talent farther in. Way Crystals are sprinkled throughout the world, and you can harvest them and create your own. You can choose any Way Crystal as your spawn point and teleport back using warp crystals that grow around Way Crystals. These grow back in pretty large numbers, so you’re never really low on them.Now, Craft… it just feels bad after a certain point. At first, you’re blowing through it like every other talent. And then it stops. Why? Because you’ve already crafted what you needed. So you’ll find yourself running around, have all your other Talents continue going up in level… while the game is waiting for you to grind Craft. And it’s not supposed to be just random junk either. Nope. You have to craft things close to your level to actually gain exp. And only sometimes, because gaining Talent exp is through chance. Now, I will say I can’t tell if there’s a level indicator on non-level-restricted items, and I’ve seen some mentions about candle crafting working (which is somewhat cheap), but the whole idea just feels very contrasting with the other talents. It’s usually huge spikes in research followed by large droughts, you have to actively work on it with some vague concepts, while all the other Talents just happen, and it feels tightly linked to progression.Overall, though, if you happen to look up Craft help and get through it’s not horrible. Crea has potential. Multiplayer needs to be ironed out but singleplayer seems fun. "

If you wanted to use more than 4 combat skills (plus heal), you're basically SOL since your toolbar is full. a toolbar with more slots would help alleviate this problem. Aside from these trivial critiques, the fact remains that this a superb game. More immersive than Terraria and more fun than Edge of Space or even Dig or Die. Buy it while it's on sale!			"

So like many of you will do, I went into this game thinking ""teraria/starbound clone"". Well I assure you that is wrong.This game has so many unique aspects that I want to say the potential is way beyond those games, which I do love.Some pros - +A sense of progression via talents/research+Great music+The ability to use many different spells whether its damage or protection.+Random bosses!+Much more loot & things to create compared to similar games.Some cons - -A few bugs, especially one where when you die and respawn you cant move. (game restart fixes)-music doesnt transition smoothly from song to song.-could use a better tutorial systemThat all being sad, this game is in early access so many things are subject to change of course, but i personally love it.  I will be doing a series on my channel if you guys want to see more of this game.			"

								A unique name for a game, but sometimes it's the hidden gem behind a name that truly stands out. Crea is very much like Starbound; crafting items and weapons/armor and battling baddies. Some major differences from Starbound is that you level up when you earn enough XP, and each weapon/tool that is used will grant you the XP tied to a particular category. Kind of like a crafting survival RPG. You're always full--hunger is exempt here. The graphics aren't anything special, but if you enjoyed playing SB's pixel graphics you'll likely approach Crea in a positive way. I've experienced some lag while playing, and this is for single-player. It's very minor, fortunately. The soundtrack's pretty soothing until it abruptly ends for an odd reason; I still find SB's unbeatable, though. Busy with Starbound so why did I buy Crea? It's indie developed and Python was used to make it--I've been learning Python since last year on my spare time, and I want to be able to see the code and learn from it. Modding is available too.

								Was looking for a game like Terraria after being disappointed by Starbound. This game adds an RPG and a research dynamic that are a lot of fun, and helps with the feeling of progression. The varioius spells in the game add more unique ways of killing enemies as well. I am not really into the ""base building"" and I just buid the essentials(no decorations), so I cannot comment a lot on that aspect of the game, but I have no complaints about it either. If I did have any compliants about this game they would be: 1. The spells do not have very much information, so it is hard to tell how much stronger the next level is. It may be based on level, but that would be useful information as well. Also, they only go up to level 5, which is easy to get to. 2. I feel the underground is very dark, even with a lot of torches, so sometimes it is hard to see. 3. It would be nice to be able to tell what items you could make from materials, by clicking on them in the ""materials"" list. As of now, I have trouble organizing garbage materials from the good ones(like I said I dont care about decoration items)Overall I am glad I picked this game up! I have been having a lot of fun.			"

												Art style is fantastic. Gameplay is awesome (although still some bugs in there). I really like how you gain TP(Talent Points) which you then spend on an upgrade tree (not actually a tree) to unlock and upgrade your skills in multiple areas. A nice breath of fresh air in these types of 2D crafting/survival games.Only a two person dev team, so props to both of you. Very pleased with my purchase! Also looking forward to seeing the remaining bugs squashed, and whatever your next game may be! All the best			"

Early Access Review
								Well i've only played Crea for 90 minutes at this point, and what I think is this is a great game with alot of potential. The game feels a lot more relaxed than others of the genre, but that's also it's worst point. I know this is Early Access and alot is going to change, but in it's current state it's just kind of...barren. Within the time I played I have yet to build anything simply because there is no point, there is no threat. You can dig underground where monsters don't spawn and you're safe, why waste material on something that isn't needed?Now for for the best bit of the game, it is just so easy to get into. Unlike Terraria (which is just too clustered with content) and Edge of Space (which is a fairly complex game) it has a decent amount of content which isn't a massive overload. The best thing is, I think it will stay that way. I believe there will be (alot) more content in the final release, but not over done due to the fact it plans on using Steam Workshop. I love the idea of openly being invited to change and adapt the game to suit my needs with either community content or self made content. Why go all out adding alot of optional things that is just going to make it cluttered, right? Combat is a nice change too. You can assign items, weapons and spells to the hotbar, and then assign each one to either LMB or RMB. For example I use my trusty sword (LMB) and a good ol' fireball (RMB) which is assigned to hotbar box 1, where as I could assign a pickaxe and torches to 2 and so on. This mean alot less pesky fiddling with inventory or scrolling hotbar constantly. Spells are also one of the best bits of combat, i'm not much for a mage character but feel myself wanting to use my spells more than anything else. The problem with combat at this stage is that enemies level up with you. It's a good idea, but because everything is as strong as you, you don't feel any threat of dying or wanting to stay away from certain enemies. It's just a case of ""well I can kill most of these easy"". I'd like the enemies to be a preset level, so different biomes have a higher/lower threat than others. The same with underground exploring, enemies should spawn more frequently the further down you go.Finally the leveling system. I have found no fault in this so far. There are 5 categroies; Combat (Melee and Ranged combat), Gathering (as you'd think, picking up harvested blocks and items), Crafting (crafting items), Magic (using damage based spells) and Restoration (not sure that's the right name, but basically spells like healing). You don't get general experience and choose where to put in skills point, for each thing you do (kill an enemy with a sword and craft a new helmet) you get TP in that set category. This is great, why would you learn more about crafting if you killed something? I like the way it's done, I kill and I get TP in combat, I pick up some logs and I get TP in gathering. You don't need to level up to put points in a skill either (though certain skills are unlocked at higher levels), for example I can learn a new spell for 1000 TP in the magic category. This doesn't stunt level progression either, it's about amount of TP gained in total rather than how much you already have.All in all a good game, I can't wait for the finished product. I think it'll be the one of the best in the genre ( though Terraria is hard to beat)A solid 8/10			"

								It ran very slow on my notebook, but I have played it long enough to know that this is worth getting. All the problems I am experencing will likly be fixed soon (It's just the Beta). Also, I think that this Python API is going to be handy for anyone starting coding (like me).The problem I have now, is that the computer I have now is a 2007 Macbook Pro (not by my own choice) and this game crashes on it very quickly. On a Windows machine (or maybe a newer Mac would do), it runs very well for me.OVERALL: It still needs development time, but if you have nothing better to do, play it. I think you will enjoy the game as it is and enjoy the mods people are making.			"

												This has been an absolutely amazing game for me so far. It has its issues with a few bugs here and there, but it's very clear on the developer twitch streams that he is working very hard to fix these. The actual gameplay has been amazing, and so very fun, but also, this game was made with the intention of being moddable, and although I had no previous experience with modding I was able to very easily learn to do some basic modding, just as this game grows and becomes better and better, I would hope to be able to contribute to the community just a little bit more with mods.

												I had no big expectations from Crea and thought it would be yet another one of these new uninspired games trying to jump on the bandwagon of the sandbox genre. After playing it for five minutes, I knew how wrong I was. Those 5 minutes suddenly turned into 3 hours and I had to make myself stop as it was already 2 A.M. It could be argued that Crea looks exactly like other similar games, and although that might be true, Crea knows how to combine ideas that we have all already seen in other games with a lot of new ones, creating a perfect mix with hours and hours of entertainment and freedom. It contains not only the tools to set free your creativity, but also a concealed complex game with its own lore. You can choose to ignore it completely, or you can try to delve deeper. This certainly translates to many hours and many different possible approaches to the same game. It’s, simply put, a 2D Minecraft. Although as complex as Notch’s game, Crea helps its players and guides them through the game, making external online searches unnecessary, something I must really thank the developers for. I have not found too many negative things, but I believe more sounds are needed (for example for enemies), more game modes (creative or permadeath), weather effects and a bit of enemy balancing (if you explore too much, you suddenly encounter very high-leveled enemies) Otherwise, I honestly could not ask for more, as the game is awesome as it is.  In my opinion, this game receives a score of 9 out of 10. Once more mods are created and those game modes are implemented, this game will become the ultimate 2D alternative to Minecraft. Pros:- Fun and easy to put a ton of hours in- Awesome tools for creation- RPG elements perfectly implemented- Bits of lore and lore related features- Interesting achievements and cards- Mod implementation- Fair priceCons:- More sound effects would be nice- Weather effects missing (rain, snow, desert storms…) - More game modes would be a great additionI personally can’t wait until a hunger/thirst mod is created. I’d also like to address some of the problems other people have mentioned: It is true that the game takes long to load, but it isn’t longer than a minute and I’m used to waiting more than 5 minutes for Crusader Kings II to load. Once the game loads, you no longer have any kind of waiting time and everything is seamless.I’ve also noticed that the game opens like 5 different processes if you check using task manager. I’m not sure that’s the most efficient way for the game to run, but I have personally not experienced any kind of lag or bug in my 6 hours of gameplay so far and once you close the game, all those processes close along the game. I have a 6 year old crappy laptop, if that helps. If you are worried about the game, I encourage you to watch a few gameplays on youtube, which surely helps more than just reading reviews and then decide for yourself. Have fun!Disclaimer: I received this product for free from the Developer in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.			"

								Edit 11/18/2014Crea is coming along fantastic in Early Access.  Updates are frequent and content grows every month or so.  There is a LOT to do and it really feels like the devs have fleshed out not only parts of the game which make it a very enjoyable entry in it's genre, but one that is a unique presence that I believe is going highly underrated.  Their community involvement is concise and appropriate, they have clear goals and seem to be extremely well organized.  The game is superb, a lot of fun to play even at its infancy considering you can play for hours upon hours without encountering bugs that turn you off.  Overall, like my previous review said, buy it now, your library will thank you.Edit 10/5/2015Progress has been great, and as I recently said in the forums:  This game is worth it solely on the premise that the developer has handled early access marvelously and is on top of the game 100%. Many companies out there could learn a *lot* from Siege Games, many of them much larger with exponentially larger budgets.			"

												I am so fond of this game. It's still currently under some construction (mostly where multiplayer is concerned, but I personally haven't experienced any serious problems). The developer is very devoted to smoothing out the bumps and regularly streams his progress live. I was initially skeptical of Crea because I enjoy Terraria and figured it was just a clone for money. I still shamelessly wanted it, though, because the graphics are much nicer.  Crea has turned out to be more than just pretty but also a big improvement on the genre. Crafting feels more satisfying and there's some very nice attention to the backstory, making Crea feel more like an RPG.			"

Please, keep in mind that this is only an opinion of mine and each of us has their own, unique, thoughts. The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. Moreover, this particularly review holds more formal nature and form. The review might be updated later to follow game's playing style and nature.April 4th, year 2016. The copy was obtained from Siege Games.What will you think being at Crea's storepage for the first time? ""Oh, once again a sandboxy Terraria clone."" But be sure that won't be precisely right. Of course, we can't deny there are similarities in both games as well as in the genre in general. That's why being a fan of lookalike titles you are always looking for something new and innovative to be in the forthcoming product. And truly, Crea possess some interesting elements and features which make it distinctive compared to its predecessors.Without further go, I really enjoyed Crea. It might look similar for the newcomers at the beginning as you are thrown into the world, given some instructions and set to go. However, the further you progress the deeper game immersion becomes. As usual, you gather materials, kill monsters, craft gear and build a home for yourself. Then you dive deeper or travel farther to explore new horizons repeating all that on a greater scale. Sounds familiar, indeed, but there is more to it than what is seen plainly on surface. The most developed and well designed part of game is crafting system. It's interesting, it's catchy and what's even more important it's complex. You can't just ""I got the deer muscus now I can make an *Uber 2156 Annihilator Optimus Prime"". Here you have to actually research each material figuring its specifications and how and where it can be used - and you will need to do that several times learning more and more of a particular item as your researching (crafting) level increases and so do your skills. Therefore great or just regular items can be created when you collect enough materials to both analyze and use them in the crafting process. Though sometimes you can find prepared recipes as well. There are only few stations each usable for certain categories of items. You can ""improve"" them by finding (mostly in random chests) different techpieces. What's absolutely worth mentioning is 'Chaos system' which allows you to craft better items giving them additional stats or special characteristics depending on how well you manage to keep the ""Chaos"" from ruining your work using different features and talents to do so (that's sort of hard to explain in the review but I hope main point is still comprehensible). Next, there is also an extended talents ""tree"" with different branches. You gain points by running around, killing monsters, shooting hadoukens fireballs, breaking blocks and crafting and then allocate them to affiliated sections thus learning new fighting techniques and new spells as well as improving yourself and your more pacific skills generally. There are quite enough of such abilities so you won't be bored and can always try playing a new style, like battlemage or rogue-archer. Finally, lets talk about the world you are in and its content. As usual, you can create several sizes where each will have ground, sky and underground levels with different biomes. You can travel only by foot or by crystal waypoints, unfortunately, but who knows if wings or transport will be added in the future updates - that would surely be nice. Monster are unique and each has its own style and combat pattern so as abilities while some may be challenging to face in the early stage. There aren't many monsters though, to be honest. Bosses prove to be even more tough and provide a necessary degree of ""buttpain"" if you don't master evasion or figure what is the right way to fight them. Exploration aspect is solid enough with many caves and hidden goodies underground like chests or rooms with pages about the preset or world's past. Rather doable element is fighting/gathering: you have to switch between 2 modes which also have two tabs each which might be confusing a bit to those who were previously playing games like Terraria, for instance. You will constantly need to switch to fighting if you are mining underground, but It's still somewhat versatile system in the end. In-game animations are well done and lovely (except for the jumping). Graphics is pretty common to the genre but still has some charm to it mostly due to beautiful and full-blooded arts, though backgrounds are rather simple. Effects are stylish and there is physics in place - shooting ball of earth may destroy a block or drop icicles from the ceiling which will damage enemies when fall, for example. Main game menu is simple too but that's not to be concerned of. Interface is fine but small improvements could still be added (for example, bigger fonts). Soundtrack is nice and plausible to hear.Technically, there is nothing to be concerned of. Game is out of Early Access and was granted almost bugless state. The only issues I had so far are two crashes which appeared during boss fights when game was acting a big laggish and light sphere (the one serving as light source) dissapearing after you travel via crystal or die and a couple of sound effects missing (harvesting plants and logs underground, for instance), but that's not critical mostly. Performance & optimization is great overally and game runs smoothly on both powerful, mid-end and ""cozy"" specs like Mac Air (well, nothing surprising as it's not really resourceful).What was enjoyable:  Interesting and beautiful world with much to exploreLore and book of hostile creatures, journal with notes which you can find worldwide - game has a storyComplex and deep crafting system with Chaos system letting you craft better itemsTalents ""tree"" with many active abilities of different sorts to try outChallenging enemies and bosses with unique combat patternsActive developers with constant updates, confidence that game won't be deserted for a whileMultiplayer, Steam integration including achievements and Cloud Saving What proves lacking:  Only English as a language - that's not critical but surely lowers the potential player base Tutorial should be slightly more  detailed in my opinion (at least about crafting system and Chaos)Interface might not be that convenient for some users (small fonts and icons)Biomes could be more distinctive with addition of richer flora, background and music perhaps (for example, mushroom one is only varied trees and grass)A bit controversial fighting/gathering system which may require some time to get accustomed toNPCs could be more alive and more or talk at least (currently those are just animated interactive statues)Not so many monsters, bosses, music compositions while accent was made on mechanics in general and crafting: game feels completed but may become null at some point without further addons _____________________________________________8 Flying Flamethrower Boars out of 10. Fun and enjoyable, exciting and catchy, challenging and tricky Terraria'esque sandbox game with lots of great improvements and additions towards the genre. 'D'aventure artificielle' by all means. "

												As you can probably, see, I've sunk over 100 hours into this game, over a wide variety of patches, changes and ideas. I've talked with the devs, found fun errors, created amazing things, and killed pretty much everything by blade, spear and bow.tldr; Crea is Dark Souls lore and exploration in an open world setting. Ambitious, awesome, and has many strands of progress.Crea is a good, different take on the Terraria style game the genre descends from. Instead of handholding, guides and mysterious landmarks, Crea has tasked you with exploring, investigating and noticing things. I stumbled into the first boss by crafting a Chaos Bed, and then using it. Maybe I should've expected a magical, cloning, nightmare boss, but holy hell was that a pulse pounding victory.Later, I check the other teleporter tabs and found a new boss I had not seen before, and proceeded to get my stuff kicked in until I found a strategy that worked and actually pulled it off. Was it easy? No. Was it fun? Mostly. Was it exciting? Yes. Like many things, the boss fights are taking a known value [Enemies, lava, water, fallling] and adapting a strategy. Instead of the Terraria style ""Build your own"" arena, Crea bosses come with an arena, or spawn in a fixed area where you determined they should be.The crafting game is both light and heavy, and is constantly getting refined. You can make a weapon out of the barest, meagerest supplies possible, or you can forge it from start to finish to be a high quality, polished work, and the quality of the item will reflect this. This is done through a satisfying mini-game, where you race the chaos level you're injecting your works with, it starts out hilariously easy, 25 quality to 100 chaos, but will happily jump up to 200 quality to 100 chaos, and ramp up the challenge to perfect as well.The game mechanics are crisp, polished and are really based on comitting to an action [without the imput delay of the PC Dark Sous games], and through planning, posititioning, properly levelled skills and the use of the dodge roll, I found myself going from a struggling meatbag to an acrobatic jerk who would dance through the enemies and loot their remains.Above all, Crea rewards determination. As you do a thing, you get skill points for it, which can make you better at that. Crafting begets cooler crafting techniques, weapon combat helps you combat harder, etc. Not innovate, but well paced and most skills either bring a brand of utility [healing spells, ranged attacks] or help you get better at storming the world [ extra jumps/jump height, grappling ledges, extra inventory slots.] And yes, determination means I wish the game could be faster, but I also feel a sense of attachment for the characters I create.Overall, Crea is a very good, lightly flawed game. The dev himself is a kind, generous person, who may have dropped the game a bit early, but he had high hopes and a great heart behind it, and I know he's going to keep slamming out updates, content and great gameplay.

												I quite enjoyed Crea, the game is very similar to Terraria, with some variations.  Crea has your character leveling up, spending skill points, wielding magic, etc. You level skills such as tool speed, attack boost, defense boost, tool reach, and more. The crafting system takes its own direction as well, using research to learn new recipes.  This system allows the game to feel like more than just a clone.  Is the addition of RPG elements enough to set Crea apart from the other games like this..  I'd certainly say yes, it's unique enough to offer the hardcore 2d sandbox gameplayer, while keeping all the core mechanics that make the genre fun.  Building, crafting, looking, exploring and killing,  can all be found in one neat package..  While Minecraft is the king of 3d sandbox games, the market for 2d sandbox games exploded, and has brought about many games of various quality, Crea isn't the first but it's one of the best. Game play Much like other games in the genre, Crea has no real purpose outside of the users own imagination, build yourself a mammoth base, stock up on the rarest of materials and gear, or explore the depths of the earth and see if you can find out what makes the world tick.  Outside of the mechanics that are present in other games, the newer elements such as leveling, and gaining skill points really sets the game apart.  The RPG elements are a breath of fresh air.   Pros RPG elements (leveling, skills, etc etc etc)The Modding Community is fairly impressive and getting betterFull controller support Great big worlds  cons quite a few bugs and glitchesTutorial could be a bit more involved, Combat could be tweaked a bit to be more inline with other games of this genre recommendation If you enjoy sand box games, using your imagination and exploring an amazingly fun world, Crea will be right up your alley.  So many positives about Crea, that the few negatives are greatly overshadowed.  I think if you enjoy other games in the 2d sandbox genre, you'll love this one as well.  It has loads of content, loads of mods, and will leave the gamer feeling engaged.  I highly recommend the game to any and all sandbox gameplayers..			"

												Left original review below just for my first impressions. After receiving comments/updates from the developer, i was going to re-purchase this game anyway just to help do my little bit to help support the game. I mean, it's not every day you get a response from game developers advising you on the situation of a game. As it stands now, have just spent the best part of an hour wandering around to see if the stuttering is still there or not. YES! The stuttering has gone which eliminates the major annoyance i had to begin with. If you enjoy 2d sandbox games then is definitely worth picking up.Looks like it could be a fun game (im new to the 2d sandbox genre, bit late to the party i know lol) however at the moment the game seems to stutter really bad every couple of minutes which kills the enjoyment for me. If/when this get fixed i will pick the game up again and give it a go but as it stands have requested a refund to try another game in the genre.			"

												I own and play Crea, Planet Centauri, Starbound, and Terraria. I love playing them all. Each of them has very different storyline/lore, progression, and game mechanics.What I like about Crea:- High resolution textures- Level progression that is based on types of actions performed- Many different types of research tiers to advance through- Quick swap between crafting/building loadout and combat loadoutI have not yet encountered any bugs and it runs great on my system that was built ~ 2 years ago.I recommend Crea to those who like steady progression, crafting and combat in these types of games.

Early Access Review
								UPDATE:over a year has passed and i finally checked out the progress. actually a lot has changed, many of the issues i spoke of have significantly changed and improved. UI is more accessible,  the game feels smoother and the different aspects of the game seem to interact with each other a lot better.  im going to edit the review and say yes, now i recommend the game! it's good to see devlopers actually developing the product :)there are still some questions open, and answers to be given to jesson, the dev that commented my review.1) story development: yes please! crea is still all about its own game mechanics - they have improved a lot but its all about filling progress bars. character development is very nice, but a little story behind it, maybe even quests and campaigns would motivate a lot more - plus it acts like a feedback when you improve levels and skills. 2) character development: yes please! you have a lot of mechanics already, especially for the huge crafting system. thats perfectly fine, the number of skills is vast. but the main characteristics (like agility, intelligence,...) do not feel like having a real impact on the way i play. more limitations and benefits might help, like minimum values for using certain items and skills. e.g.  a high-intelligence character not better in researching stuff than a dumb brute - a high strength character cant carry more than others - a high agility is not necessary for picking locks.3) NPCs and character interaction: the idea of building dummies and dressing them up to get a little company for the main character is a little creepy if you think about it, but works surprisingly well as a mechanic to build your environment. but, will there be other npcs? if so, will you be able to interact with them? will there be dialogue and choices even, especially if you implement stories, big and small? it would be a real asset and a unique feature compared to all the tarrarias, starbounds and the likes out there.former review:dear crea developers,unfortunately i cannot recommend this title - yet. As with many early acces titles this one has great potential but it feels a little like things grow over the your heads. i always missed deep rpg elements in similar games but i understand it's difficult to create a whole new terraria or starbound AND add a complete roleplaying system with character development and everything to it. so if it is too much at once, why not mod titles that already exist and really concentrate on your new ideas and things that are really important to you?anyway, this is just guessing and suggesting.here a few bullets i recommend to improve:- the gui is not very smooth. for character display this is not that important but the crafting and inventory menus need simplicity, clarification and coherence to be intuitive.    - the pace feels not right: combat, crafting, moving, mining etc mechanisms need to bebalanced with each other, ""speedwise""Additionally for the price people are paying for the early access they would expect more frequent updates - not even necessarily regarding real development but at least a post about anyhting you are doing.

								Game is nice, runs smoothly with occasional crashes, but Jasson (developer) is working on them as I type this review. You can watch him develope the game on his twitch channel SiegeGames. He is very intereactive, and listens to a lot of things in the chat. Enough about him though. The game has a different artstyle then terraria, albiet similar. But its different, and makes a nice twist to it. The game has a few bosses, that need to be unlocked in game through discovery, and luck that you make or find the right things.Music is calm and peaceful, combat is okay, could have some improving, and boss mechanics are on point.

								Wow!  Honestly this game has been really refreshing.  I watch one of the programmers, Jasson, on twitch at www.twitch.tv/siegegames.  At first, I honestly thought it was just another terraria clone, but once I started watching him every day and playing the game, it turned out to be a whole lot different.  The character progression really makes this game stand out.  Usually in terraria, what Crea is most commonly compared to, you just beat the wall of flesh then play hard mode and then you have all of the over-powered items and the game isn't fun and you quit. However, in Crea, the progression of the game isn't only based on what enemies you've defeated and what iteams you have, but also what level you are and what skills you've acquired.  I believe Crea opens up a new realm to the 2d sandbox genre and can't wait to see where the modding gets it! Keep it up guys!			"

												It may take some time to get used to especially if you've played Terraria or Starbound, but this game has a lot of potential. Right now there is so much to do, and there is so much to research! Everything you gather can be used to research new items to make, and every turn of the corner presents a new enemy to find, the chests always seem to draw you in giving things you may want or need. The boss fights are just pure fun and require some strategy and some planning. I couldn't have asked for a better game to play while i wait for Terraria Otherworld. only 40.4 hours in, but I am so going to put so many more hours into this game to find all it's secrets. Buy it and you won't be dissapointed, you just may find that material piece you needed to make that awesome piece of gear.			"

								At 11 hours in I am really enjoying this game.  I fell in love with Terraria a while back and was looking for something similar when I found Crea.  Just being similar to Terraria would have been enough for me to like this game too but Crea is actually so much more.Unlike Terraria, Crea has added RPG mechanics to the sandbox, exploring, fighting, gathering, crafting, building genre.  So by playing the game I gain experience which levels up my character.  With each level-up I get points I can use to increase my character's attributes.  I also get Talent points which I can use to add or upgrade a large set of potential Skills like new magic spells, enhancements to melee and defense, and skills used to explore, gather and craft.  So Crea allows for much greater character customization and growth.  At this point of Early Access it doesn't seem to have as many vanity and visual character customization options but those are less important to me than the options that actually do stuff.Crea also has a unique and creative visual style.  When I am playing I find myself appreciating the way things look more than I remember doing in Terraria.  It also has a great a sense of humour.  Some of the tool tips are very funny.  And the creatures and enemies look great too and can be very amusing and weird in an interesting way.Enemy fighting style is also diverse and interesting.  No cookie cutter AI here.  I think the player has more different kinds of options too so I would say that combat is more complex in Crea.  I haven't fought any of the bosses yet but the day to day mobs have been fun to go up against so far.In addition to the procedurally generated worlds that you create there are also Realms and dungeons that you can transport to for an additional challenge and added areas to explore.Crea has also been designed to be easier to mod so I am looking forward to creating my own mods and seeing what other players come up with in the Steam Workshop.I think that people who like Terraria will like Crea a lot too.  I also recommend Crea to players new to the genre.  I am having a lot of fun with it and can see getting many more hours of play from this game.Edited to add:  Make sure you upgrade to Ledge Grab when you can.  It is very useful.			"

Early Access Review
Review Written on Monday, June 6th, 2016 Review I've had quite a few experiences with open-sandbox games before, but none of them can compare to the experience I had with Crea. The game visually resembles a Terraria-styled world with a much higher emphasis on character progression and skill-building. If you haven't played Terraria, its a game that is involves lots of exploring, crafting, building and mining to create new gear, items, and decorations for you and your friends. While Crea incorporates all of the core elements of Terraria, it does so in a different way that allows the game to be unique (mining is primarily done at the surface, and combat is more in depth etc.) While the two games share many assets, I will say that Terraria focuses on exploration and that Crea is focused on the RPG elements. Crea has a very neat experience system that makes everything count. Every item looted, attack used, or ore mined will increase your characters talent in that profession, allowing for upgrades that can be unlocked. This is great because it allows for player to choose how they want to upgrade their character, focusing on ranged or melee combat, or becoming a healing character. It makes the player feel more invested to build their character for online play, and makes mundane tasks feel more rewarding. The combat in the game is made much more advanced by giving the enemies levels to match the player, and when combined with the endless amount of crafting recipes, there's always another reason to improve your characters gear and stats. Rating: 8.4/10 Pros:  EXP system keeps the game going, even when it gets slow. Graphics look nice with lots of details. Takes all of the pros of Terraria, while keeping original.  Cons:   Game may require a wiki to get the best enjoyment.

												I have about 38 hours in this game, and my experience has been mixed but generally favorable.The game is plagued by bugs and instability, and the art and lore can feel awkward and rushed.  Balance and progression are a bit wonky, and controller support is functional but problematic in some situations.  Often, it is not clear what you need to do to progress, and the game gives you no hints.  In fact, there are points at which you may not realize there is anything left to do at all, and it is easy to find oneself wondering, ""Is this really all there is?""  For example, the mannequins in the game have an item description that says they are for displaying armor and outfits.  In truth, placing an outfit on a placed mannequin causes it to come to life, and it is the only way to encounter an NPC.  Some of the mechanics also feel forced and tiresome, such as the novel crafting system.Do I sound like I hate the game?  Great.  Nothing could be further from the truth.For all its flaws, this game has the crucial, undefinable ingredient that Terraria clones to date have lacked: a soul.  Your home feels meaningful, as does the world around you.  Just when you think you have seen everything the game has to offer, you see more--and not just new items with better stats.  The lore, awkward as it can be, does inspire genuine curiosity, and when I head off to explore, I never really know what I am going to find or where it will be found.  The monsters are more than just red-hot floating blobs of damage with slight variations on the same AI, and so different approaches to different enemies really does pay off so long as you are not over leveled.  I have 38 hours in this game because it is a very good game with a lot of potential, and it can only get better from here.  The developer's unique process, while unconventional, has created something I have thoroughly enjoyed.For what they are asking, this is game is a steal, and if you at all enjoyed Terraria, you should buy Crea.  It is not quite on par, but it is the closest to Terraria's heart and soul that any game has come in the years since.  Beyond the clear value to you as a consumer, these dedicated developers--so thoroughly involved with their community--genuinely deserve your money for what they have accomplished.  I want to see more heart in games, so I reward it when I see it.  I see it here.			"

												Very similar to Terraria, however different in terms of combat style and some crafting mechanisms, the game stresses on talent points for building active and passive skills rather than only being item based for progression. The graphics are definitely prettier than Terraria's and I also find more conveniences in some areas such as for example, crafting near your storage chests without needing to have the items in your inventory which is really helpful for organization. Overall this game is crazy addicting and I find myself spending hours a day on it lol			"

												I love this game.  I've played Starbound and Terraria and it is similiar to those two but Crea truly shines.  Starbound is fun and I hope they fixed the ""Oops I acccidentally killed my rare NPC"" glitch.  Terraria was just too fighty for me.  Crea is challenging and beautiful and I love playing it with my friends, but it is also fun to play by oneself.  Good job Jasson, I hope you expand this game to the stars!			"

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016ReviewSo, this game just came out of Early Access a few days ago, and it deserved to, because the game looks good enough to be out already.If you never played Terraria or Starbound, to which this game is most similar to, you have for sure played, or heard about Minecraft, and this game is like Minecraft in 2D, but with way more content.You may think of it like a copy of Terraria/Starbound, but no, it has many gameplay differences, those that make the game unique in its own way.Rating:8.8/10Pros:Having two specials separate tabs, where there are 2 for fighting and one for building, for me was the most unique thing in the game, making it easier to split your fighting from your building.The Research Table was also something really new to me, where you have a piece of furniture where you learn to craft everything possible to, and where all your recipies are safe and sound.The Art and Music are pretty heartwarming and really good for a game design by such a small Developer.The skill tree is something that the game incorporated to define it from the other similar ones, where Terraria, for example, has multiple weapon types, this one has several skill points, making possible to have several buffs at the same time.The game is being constantly updated, with a team of Developers that, even though they are only two, if im not mistaken, they care a lot about their game, and take a lot in care what the community tells them.Cons:The game is not very Early Game friendly, too strong enemies with skills that you cannot fight against without proper equipment.The game lacks a proper tutorial, it does have some tips in early game, but it doesnt prepare you enough for what you will face.Before you have any skill points its pretty hard to do anything underground, unless you have enough dirt, for example, to build your way up again.Hardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitor1366x768HeadphonesOzone Rage STMouseE-Blue AurozaMicrophoneOzone Rage ST MicrophoneCPUIntel Core i5-3210M 250GHzGPUNVIDIA GeForce GT 620MRAM6GbOSWindows 7HDD750GbDisclaimer:Source of consideration: Siege Games "

Terr? Star? Crea! About the gameCrea is a 2D sandbox/crafting game with RPG typical RPG elements. It has a lot of similarities with the games of the same Genre like Terraria or Starbound: The world is randomly generated, you can gather almost anything you see, you can craft hundreads of things, battle monsters, etc. Yet it feels like a game of it's own. The cute art style, the talent trees and the diversity of the world make it stand out.A great feature in this game is the waypoint system, as you find crystals around the world, you can teleport between them and reach places you have already visited without having to walk all the way back or remember where it was.The RPG talent tree is really well done, whenever you perform actions in a certain category (Fighting, Exploration, Crafting, etc.) you gain points to spend in that category to improve it's efficiency.Overall it's a really great experience, wheter you like to explore, craft your own world or simply level up your character, you will have fun playing this game at least for a while.Also, If you enjoyed Terraria or Starbound, you should definately give this game a try!Pros:   Waypoint system RPG talent tree Crafting Exploration Variety of monsters Cons:   Networking / Lag Slow start / Enemies are much stronger than you would expect Sometimes unintuitive and lack of tutorial UI feels like it could get a massive rework Spells seems really bad/too slow for combat Rating: 9 out of 10 Disclaimer: Source of consideration: SiegeGames "

												Been playing this for a little while and I have to say it's pretty fun. There's lots to...it's plays a lot like Starbound but I feel like this game is a little easier to just pick up and play. Honestly I like both games and I'm not far enough into this one to tell  if there is world traveling but you can travel to other ""Realms"" after defeating spawners....so that's cool. All in all I'm having fun with it.

Early Access Review
								A very interesting game thats main focus is modding although I haven't tried any mods I have had alot of fun finding the unique factors of this game such as the research system which requires you to find various materials and put them in and depending on your crafting level you can make certain things by clicking on the icon (weapons, home items, basic etc) this is very interesting and fun to play about with and find out what makes what but can be a bit annoying at times when you are trying to find 1 final crafting material but it is nowhere to be found (you have to research the material in the certain catagory to find out the rest of it's recipe) The combat is pretty basic with just clicking atm but you do have a fireball and healing spell to begin with.Do I reccomend this game at this stage? Yes, if you are a big fan of games like Terraria or Starbound then this is the game for you.Gameplay Video From My Channel: (Coming Soon)			"

Early Access Review
If you like RPG and Sandbox, and have played things like Minecraft or Terraria, you'll love this.GAMEPLAY: Customisation is so much better compared to other games of this style. Crea is really based on building your own player in an RPG-type fashion, leveling up skills, y'know. Sandbox-wise, on the other hand, isn't as diverse as such.AUDIO: Soundtrack is a bit weird, not really my style. It's got that trance-y feel, but there's always the sound options.MULTIPLAYER: Not that great. Still has a IP, port, password-type interface. Kinda like the Blockheads if you've ever played that.WORLD DESIGN: Average. Not great, not bad. Expect something like the early release of Minecraft.BUGS: Yeah, early access. You know what that means; if you buy this, you'll get them. And it does come with this game; there are instances in which cursors will suddenly freeze, graphics will glitch, interactions are somewhat impossible, but just wait a while and it'll be fixed. Hopefully.OVERALL: A great game in the making, which will, hopefully, stray away from the likes of Starbound, Minecraft, Terraria etc. and become it's own type of sandbox-rpg. Highly recommended for those who like messing around with bits and pieces to make more bits and pieces, and also RPG lovers.3.8/5. "

												     Honestly a lot of released games are loaded down with bugs, Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, and these were games published by designers who care and release fixes, the same can be said for this game Crea, the team working on it obviously care and you can even watch and talk with them via a twitch stream while they are working on it.  Unlike Electronic Arts and the Sim games which never fix any of the game breaking bugs they release with and only care about getting your money out of your wallet...     Yes it has bugs, and probably should still be in alpha. However it already has more functional content than both terraria and starbound combined !The game is awesome, my only real complaint is that the skill bar at the bottom of the screen is bulky and often in the way, it is also unmoveable.

In the future it will support steam workshop for mods for pretty much everything.  This is THE game.If you like RPGs and Terraria (and its a plus if you have a couple friends that can blow the cash and get it too!) GET THIS GAME NOW.  This is easily the best Early Acess indie game I have purchased.			"

												This game is very clearly heavily influenced by Terraria, but it takes that influence and runs with it in its own direction.As someone who has dumped quite a lot of time into the sandbox craft/fight/dig games (mostly Minecraft, but also a bit of Terraria), the addition of a skill system in this game is a very welcome improvement. There's an actual sense of progression rather than just weakly gated tiers of items that you can rush through. Of course, there are item tiers as well, but at least at the early levels the skill progression seems to have just as much if not more impact.Coming from Terraria, the control scheme threw me off for a bit, as there are a total of four (4) hotbars, split between two modes (combat and exploration) and two tab groups each. After I got used to it, I came to appreciate the ergonomics, but there was a bit of a learning curve.Overall, quite impressed with this game thus far, but there are competing games at a lower price point that are probably better entry points into the genre.

ReviewThis is a pleasantly relaxing sandbox game, with a mix of exploration, combat, crafting and building. I like how I'm not bound to any specific roll (mage, archer, swordsman, ect), and can technically switch rolls and playstyle throughout the game. But  my only gripe with the current leveling system is that you can't re-spec your points, because it feels like it should be a feature. One small different detail I really liked, was that putting points into Agility increases your range. Almost everything give points towards the different talents you can choice from. The researching system is one of my favorite parts of the game. Finding items reveals parts of recipes, so discovering and collecting felt more rewarding than usual. One optional part of the crafting was at first slightly confusing , is crafting with Chaos, as the tutorial is simplistic but not so detailed. It took a while to get used to switching between Crafting and Aggro Mode, but I'm glad that this feature was put in place. Because then you don't accidently attack animals passing by, but also it takes up less screen space than if there were two skill bars. When building, I like that I could place objects wherever I wanted on the ground, so nothing is locked to specific tile blocks on the ground. Someone recommended that I zoom the camera closer to the character, and I have to say, that being able to change the zoom around constantly made it a lot more enjoyable. Sometimes there is a split moment lag. During combat or It is understandable that there is a split moment of lag when discovering new terrain, but sometimes it'll happen during combat.  I've seen in the discussions that there are often bugs, even though it's out of early access, but luckily there are constant updates being added into the game. Pros: Enjoyable  RPG elements , such as an experience system with talents/skills. The researching and crafting system. A lot of decent content: monsters, weapons, quick-travel, ect. Excellent arrange of settings (such as zooming in/out). Regularly updated for bugs. Mixed:Takes some time to learn essential talents , such as wall-grabbing and double-jumping. Cons:Currently can't respec  your skill points. Sometimes there is a split moment lag. Final Comment and Rating:It has most of the same mechanics that you'd expect from somewhat similar 2D crafting sandbox games, and on top of that, has RPG elements. There are plenty of items, beautiful art style, plenty of items and monsters. Overall a great CREAtive world.  8 / 10Disclaimer: Played with a review copy.

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is a sandbox RPG game, similar to games like Terraria, which includes farming and exploring. It adds many elements that games like Terraria or Starbound are missing, such as the use of items or the ability to research specific materials. The use of the tutorial helps tell the player what buttons to use and does a great job of introducing you into the game. Everything you do gives you exp, but you can gain specific experience by doing certain tasks. This gives the player a reason to explore and fight enemies. I really enjoyed everything about the game and cant wait to see what is next for updates!Rating: 8.5/10 Pros:  Extensive mod support. Great RPG Sandbox styled gameplay! Beautiful world to explore.

												""Now this game will get good!""This game is basically Terraria with a more complex crafting system.  What's not to love?Unfortunately, the crafting system is poorly thought out and implemented.  Sure I ""could"" create lots of cool armor, walking up the stats tree, but unfortunately that game doesn't really seem to work that way.  I know tons of recipes, have loads of components, but for some reason the components are grayed out.  Need a studded vest to make the improved vest?  You have 2?  No matter, it's still greyed out.  No tool tip explaining why, just it is.You are constantly hitting your head in research, as your crafting level isn't high enough to research new items.  Fine, but your crafting skill improves by researching new items, so you are basically screwed, except by getting recipes from scraps.  These can be very hard to come by early, having to find them in chests and pots, but after a bit, hey you can now get these scraps occasionally by mining ore.  Great!  Except the trickle is so small it doesn't really help that much.So later, you get a Scrapper, which can change junk you have collected and convert them into scraps.   Great, except the exchange rates seem all over the place.  Very generous for some components, such as vines, but stingy as hell for true items, such as bows.  By the way, why can't I scrap certain items?   No clue, you just can't.No worries anyhow, as even though research via scraps gets easier, you can't make most of the recipes you have anyway,  Some compoents are too rare to get.  For example, it seems many many items are gated by the need for Lonis seeds.  They are needed to make entry level items, which are needed to make the next level etc. etc. etc.  But I never did find a single seed in the wild.  Finally after getting creating an NPC which sells items, I was able to buy a few and cultivate my own, though that only led me to more greyed out components.  Again, no clue why they are greyed out.I could go on and on, but hopefully you get my drift.  Poor documentation, and very little in-game information finally got me to delete the game from my computer.  Every time I thought I had jumped through the last hoop, so that the game was about to get good, nope, just more B.S.Other flaws?  Poorly designed hot keys and tool bars really stand out.  Sure, you could get lots of cool spells, but then again, you only get access to five at a time, each with cooldowns.  If you use up two slots with healing spells, what's the point of knowing 10 other spells?The inventory system has little to help you organize you pack.It's overly difficult to compare item's you find or are considering crafting to what you have currently equiped.  It sure would have been nice to show the specs of what is currently equiped in the details popup on the item you are looking at.And let no talk too much about the map!  Not a mini map, but a full map.  No true mini map is available, though the map does have a useless mode, what it is drawn on the screen at the same time your landscape is drawn.  This map is the ugliest P.O,S, map I have ever seen,  Not to say there aren't positive aspects to the game.  I thought the creating your own NPCs by dressing up mannequins was a clever idea, though most of these NPCs are worthless after a couple of quick interactions.The game generally looks nice, though most just a clone of Terraria.Perhaps one day enough polish will be added to make the game enjoyable, but boy, it's just not there yet.

								Crea is another one of those Terraria-like games that sucks your time in like nobody's business. Though, Crea differentiates itself from the usual 2D voxel games with its rewarding talents system. Yes, you've got the usual mine-craft-fight mechanic, but now you've also got skills to manage that improves your game. It's a bit like Skyrim's where you accumulate points (TP) in certain talent areas based on what you do, then spend those points on perks. It's interesting and rewarding since certain perks actually change up the gameplay a bit (like being able to ledge grab, or being able to mine more than one block).The combat is actually fun, with dodge rolls, combos, and blocking mechanics. What's also interesting is the ""Style"" system, which is essentially Crea's magic-based combat. It's a bit finicky since most enemies move so fast (while you have a casting time), but fun when you get it right. The Style system plays differently in that you need to accumulate a number of charges by casting its base form (heal self, throw fireball, etc). Once you've got enough, then you can cast upgraded forms like fire pillars or ice beams or whatever. Definitely interesting, but gimped since melee is still better.For mining, I like that you only need one tool to break the world (well, two: one for breaking stuff, and your hands for picking up stuff in place like furnaces and anvils). It's slow at first, but it's mitigated by the Talent system's upgrades.Crafting is one of the gripes I have. It's the typical have-these-to-make-that, or have-these-and-be-near-this-to-make that, but the crafting menu seriously needs an overhaul. There's a filter, sure, but it's not very intuitive. I prefer the usual categorization of crafting items rather than having it all out.Graphics are pretty decent as well. It's like Terraria in terms of tone, but with a much more polished look. My other gripe is the lack of purpose. That's true for most voxel games, though, and Crea is no different. ""Here's the world, and here's a pickaxe. Bye!"" I think it would really improve the experience if the game had towns or NPCs to interact with (talk, fight, barter, whatever). I think the only voxel game that nailed this artificial community aspect was WindForge. Overall, Crea is a lot of fun. It's deeper than other Terraria clones thanks to its skill system, and the graphics are fun. I'd have been all over this game if it weren't for the general lack of purpose.			"

Early Access Review
								Crea, a sandbox game that I supported via Kickstarter, is now available via the Steam early access program.  A cousin of Terraria, Crea also includes RPG elements, such as character progression.  There are a number of paths one can explore that change how the game is played.  For an early access game, there's a lot of depth.The title has evolved a great deal since the first version was released.  It's continuing to change and the developers appear to be committed to moving the title forward.  The developers also interact with users, via the forums here, on their website and Twitch.  Even in it's current state, I find this title to be engaging and it's easy to get lost in the game while exploring it's procedurally generated worlds (and worlds within worlds).			"

												Had this game for a few weeks now but only really started getting into it recently. The depth of the game is surprising and it just branches off with the various crafting paths and talents. The talent system and lore behind the game really set it apart from its competition. The game still has its bugs but the developer is very dedicated to his CREAtion's progress (bugfixes as well as new features) and has streams detailing his efforts very often, during which times he has very refreshing open communication with the viewers. Bottom line, if you're interested but worried about the currently almost saturated market of 2d sandbox platformers then let your fears be assuaged; this game is definitely different than the rest. Trust me, I have experience in this field. I look forward to putting more time into this game.			"

												When this game went out of early access, I decided to take it for a spin. Boy was that a mistake.The game is not even near finished, Plus, the amount of content you can explore and collect is incredibly low. You can reach endgame content on your second day playing, which really takes the fun out of things- Only a handful of different enemies.- Very limited amount of obtainable items.- Very buggy.- Incredibly resource hungry for a simple game like this! Not for those of you with older computers.It's a shame really, I was hoping for the next Terraria - but received something that is closer to Starbound.			"

												Its a great game but it seems it's still far from being finished as far as the multiplayer goes.My wife is constantly being kicked from dungeons and everytime she tries to join the dream realm she crashes.Even I the host have had my game crash upon finishing dungeons.I hate to put I don't reccomend this game but in it's current state it's very frustrating, I hope to come back to this game in a few weeks and be able to fully enjoy it.

Review Written on Sunday, June 12th, 2016 Review This game is an awesome and is addictive with Starbound and Terraria elements to it, but with its own type of flavor. The game is early access has occasional hiccups, but can be easily fixed with an update or two. It’s a refreshing take on 2D sandbox/rpg type of games which is a good commodity. Let’s start with the gameplay. It starts out rather easy as you can get a short tutorial on what to do. You can easily manage controls on an Xbox controller or PlayStation controller which can be helpful. The graphics are pixelated like any other retro game. I’m a fan of these retro games as I grew up in the 80's and 90's playing those console games in their prime. The skilling up/leveling up system is very unique and different from Starbound and Terraria which makes this game stand on its own. I enjoyed exploring and creating my homes, teleport points, forges, and loved the crafting aspect inside of it. This game is very time consuming and can be very addictive at the same time. The game isn’t perfect and still is an early access game which comes with its bugs and glitches. The game has unusually long load times when you first start out which I found awkward knowing this is a pixel 2d sandbox game and isn’t a really big game that should be doing so. I found that it did take much more memory than expected as well which I heard the developer is seeking to fix. In terms of the multiplayer aspect, there should be some dedicated servers steam side to help everyone connect with each other to make this game even more fun. I hope that this is also fixed and implemented in the finalized version so I can even give this a higher grade on my review. Anyways I found this game to be quite fun, addictive, time consuming, and refreshingly new. I hope this game can fix these glitches and whatnot to make this an even better game.Rating: 7.5/10 Pros:  Refreshingly new take on skilling/leveling up system Smooth/solid gameplay with either controller or keyboard Music is mesmerizing and soothing to keep the gameplay running smoothly as well Fun Crafting and exploring Mods can be implemented in the game  Cons:  Occasional hiccups that may cause sluggish gameplay momentarily Sometimes glitchy scenery/enemies Unusually long load times at certain points of the game No dedicated servers otherwise I can give this higher rating There are often multiplayer connection timeouts  Hardware Information   Hardware Type   Monitor Samsung Series 9 S27B970D Display Port 2560x1440   Headphones Astro A40 Headset   Keyboard CMStorm KB   Controller Xbox 360 Wired Controller   Mouse Logitech - G900 Chaos Spectrum   Microphone Astro A40 Mic   Motherboard ASRock X79 Professional   CPU Intel i7-4930K 340GHz   GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 X 2   RAM 16 GB Ram   OS Windows 7 Pro   HDD WD 2TB Hdd  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Siege Games "

He even allows for suggestions to make the game better and answers everyones questions. Great game though, you should buy it for sure!			"

								From what I've experience thus far, this game has more than just a bit of potential. The talent system is something I have always enjoyed in games, and is something that sets it apart from games like Terraria. However, the game still has a ways to go. I fullheartedly believe that the developers have the capabilities to take Crea above and beyond, and am anxious to see how they will do so.			"

Review Written on Monday, June 14th, 2016ReviewUpon first glance of Crea you might get the vibes which says, this game looks just like Terraria but less 16-bit pixel graphic. Well part of it is same, the genre and style is similar to Terraria actually. But! in Crea you have a leveling system, a research system, and the crafting system well placed and easy to use and understand even without the need of tutorial. Something I would like however is a larger inventory capacity.I haven't played the largest map yet, the tryout I had was on the smallest map. Even on a small map you can expect lots of play hour. Since on your first go with a new character you want to build my leveling up so you can hit harder and collect materials faster. So if you like sandbox games but you think 3d sandbox like Minecraft is too big, and you don't feel Terraria is pretty, then I think you should give Crea a try. So far I have enjoyed the hours I spent on it. Here's a list of improvement I think Crea has over Terraria:Crisp graphicLevel up systemEasy craftingSome users has complained about bugs, from my experience I only had one occassion in which I had to restart the game, because my controller stopped to work for some reason. Except for that I haven't experience any problem with the game. Moreover the developer is very active and I believe the reported bugs are quickly fixed. So you don't need to worry about you bought a broken game ;)Rating:8.5/10Pros:Crisp graphic, if you prefer less pixelLevel up systemEasy to understand crafting systemResearch instead of recipesCons:If you careless go inside a cave and falls down in a hole you be stuck there forever.Too few customization option when creating your characterToo small graphic, but I guess if you zoom it in it would look too much like Terraria maybe?Hardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitor24HeadphonesHeadphonesKeyboardRazor black widowControllerxbox360 gamepadMouselogitech g602MicrophoneMicrophoneMotherboardasrock xtreme3CPUi5GPU660tiRAM24gb dd3OSwin10HDDHDDDisclaimer:Source of consideration: Siege Games "

												I want to preface this by stating that I got a copy for both my friend and i, and got 4 other people to get copies. That's how much i like this game.Okay now into the detailed part of my assessment.There are some things you should know about this game:The game is not finished. There is still a lot more to be done, bugs to be fixed, features planned, and so on.There is A LOT of content in it currently. I am this far into the game and still discovering new things.The customization with different armours and weapons and accessories is CRAZY OVERWHELMING (in a good way)It shares many similarities to that of Starbound and Terraria, with a complex leveling and skill system, along with a researching system in which you use items to learn their uses, which i believe makes perfect sense.The bosses (may change in the future) are incredibly beautiful. I love their art, he really did a great job on them. There's only 4 in game at the moment, with more to be plannedYes there are bugs.There are some pretty gamebreaking bugs that will either ruin the game for you, or for your friends playing with you.He is CONSTANTLY working on them at https://www.twitch.tv/siegegames for all of you to say, talking to the fans, seeing what they want, and what needs fixed. I have seen him resolve issues he had no idea how to fix, simply with help from fans, and the information they provided live on stream.TLDR: This is an amazing game. It has bugs.

												Alrighty. I don't see how I can run Arma 3 at 120+ frames. But on this, I get 30 tops... Optimize.Other than that, the concept it cool I guess. Pretty much the same thing as Terraria, but with a twist. Terraria is obviously better than this game, but Crea is, different enough I suppose, to be considered a different game... Maybe not. Hostile slimes when you spawn? I, I dont know. I couldn't get that far in the game considering I was stuttering like Eric Maye. Look up Eric Maye. Thats pretty much this games performance in a nutshell... I don't want it to sound like Im dogging on this game, because if that is indeed is what im doing, I also want to point out that this game does have potential. All this game needs is an optimization update. Then I'll be all over this, but till then. I'm putting this guy up on the shelf.*EDIT* I don't know what you did my man, but the game no longer lags. Thank you for keeping to your word, I respect 'dat. Now, as for the Crea, Now that I've had time to sit down and play. It, is really cool xD So many monsters on the surface? Er ma gerd! Different attacks too! I was running away from one dude, and the guy pulled up an ice wall in front of me, I mean wow. Very cool indeed. Im eager to see what some next in this.			"

All this game needs is an optimization update. Then I'll be all over this, but till then. I'm putting this guy up on the shelf.*EDIT* I don't know what you did my man, but the game no longer lags. Thank you for keeping to your word, I respect 'dat. Now, as for the Crea, Now that I've had time to sit down and play. It, is really cool xD So many monsters on the surface? Er ma gerd! Different attacks too! I was running away from one dude, and the guy pulled up an ice wall in front of me, I mean wow. Very cool indeed. Im eager to see what some next in this.			"

												Let's make this abundantly clear. This game does have it's bugs, and there's a number of them; but that shouldn't be the absolute decided factor between picking up this game in my opinion. Jasson (Siege Games main developer) does a weekly live stream where he let's players chat and discuss various issues with the game. He is, without a doubt, 100% on top of all issues that are being addressed.Now, in my experience thus far, I actually haven't came across a single bug that's been mentioned by other players. More specifically, Audio/Graphic issues. I have 14.4 hours (as of this review) and I've yet to experience one hiccup. The game itself has enough content for a CASUAL gamer. You have boss fights, you have character progression, you have researching/crafting. There's plenty of pros to this game in it's current state, and that will only continue to grow.One thing I see that's mentioned quite a bit is the learning curve. Here's what you need to understand. The game is new, and the fanbase is relatively small currently (Approx. ~1000 players). The Wiki doesn't have much information, so you're really reliant on exploring the game yourself and actually taking the time to LEARN it. If that's something you don't want to do, and you just want a mindless tutorial you're going to skip over anyways, then this isn't the game for you. The best way to learn the game currently IS TO PLAY IT.At first, I was extremely intimidated by the game. I spawned next to a crystal with what seemed to be a teleporting option; I quickly ignored it and moved on. A few hours in I really started to understand it's purpose. For nearly 10 hours of gameplay, I had NO idea you could use spells such as proficiencies, in passive mode. I kept switching to attack mode to cast my spells. Again, I figured this out because I PLAYED the game.TL;DR:The game isn't in bad shape at all. There's major and minor bugs, but every game will have those. Stick with the developer, report the bugs, and I PROMISE this will make Terraria seem like a childs game. Also, on a side note. Jasson is the only developer, and on his stream June 13th, he mentioned wanting to hire a C++ coder to help fix bugs and improve content. One thing I truly admired about him was his excitement seeing people on Twitch playing his game. He's clearly working his very hardest to listen to players and fix big issues. He took questions/issues DIRECTLY from viewers on Twitch and fixed them right in front of your eyes. The guy shows a lot of promise, and so does this game. I highly recommend picking it up while it's $15. One thing I do recommend (this is for Siege Games), ask some big players of your game to help expand the content of your Wiki. Provide starter guides, more explanations, and clarifications on items/crafting/chaos. Let your players help other players.			"

												I fell in Love with this Game after seeing it so i bought the 4 Pack.It's really worth the Money, the dev is working on it every day on stream!I had a problem (my fps were dropping after 10 minutes ingame) he tried to help me th best he couldJust now i did reinstall Steam and it did fix it hes a very nice guy and will try everything to fix the bugs.He earned my respect and i'll follow his stream every day now hes also planning to add new Features for the GameThe game overall is pretty good but its also challenging you can have lots of fun with it even if its  a bit buggy at the moment (Update 1.0.2) but as i said hes trying his best to fix these bugs when you read this they are probally gone.The Graphics are great and there is a lot of work going into the Details.I really enjoy the RPG Elements even if it's a bit hard to start as a Mage its possible so i did switch to an Archer/Mage Build and it's working just fine cus you can swap between Loadouts so you can use a total of 10 spells, 5 on every Loadout.All in all i really enjoy this Game and i hope you will Support the dev by buying the Game as i Said it's worth the Money.Sincerely, Chickengamer			"

												Now before I say anything else, yes, this game does have a few bugs, A FEW. All the reviews saying that the game is just so buggy and it keps crashing are either outdated or just plain over exaggerating. Now, some pros and cons.ProsRuns very smoothly (minus a few small lag spikes here and there).The RPG leveling system separates the game from other 2d sandbox platformers.The researching system gives a very high feeling of progress to the player.AddictingConsAs mentioned before, there are a few small bugs.This may only apply to me, but you might find yourself stuck, as in having to level up to progress more, but theres really nothing you can think of to do to level yourself up.Overall, the game is fun, addicting, with very little bugs.8.5/10 "

												This is one of my favorite games on steam, even though I have not played very much. It is like a combination of Starbound and Terraria, and has many other things as well. The research system makes things a bit more difficult and helps to balance out the loot you often get when you go into dungeons or high level areas. The idea of things getting harder as you go out into the world is one of my favorite features and really helps to make the game interesting. You have to take risks and go out farther to find rare materials as well as to level up faster when facing tougher enemies. I also really enjoy the chaos crafting mini game (even though I am terrible at it) because the increased chances of modifiers and quality can make a very powerful weapon or tool. The talent leveling system is also pretty good, you have to use the talent a good bit to improve upon your skill in it. There is also a character leveling system which gives stat points as well as improving all stats. The bosses seem to level up as you defeat them over and over, so that is nice, is keeps the game interesting. Well, one boss is always the same level as the player which means that boss fight is pretty even unless the player improves their combat talents. Again, this is one of my favorite games and I can't wait to see what's in store for it.			"

Pros+ Nice levelling system+ Cool crafting system+ Interesting lore+ Nice, diverse bosses+ Awesome weapons (bows that shoot 5 arrows which split and bounce)+ MOD SUPPORT (Terraria, take note.)Cons:- Bugs- Repetitve dungeons- Too much grinding for that one recipy- More bugs- Not enough monsters- Not enough spells/abilities- Terraria/starbound clone- Did i mention bugs? Like there is seriously an armor set that makes you invincible because its been coded wrong.- Boring world generation- Bad controls6/10 overall. Decent game, with fun mechanics and gimmicky weapons. but full of bugs. Im personally going to put it aside for a while, until it has more content.			"

Review Written on Wednesday, June 15th, 2016 Review Crea is a 2D sandbox RPG with procedural generated maps. The game is clearly inspired by Terraria, in the game you kill monsters, explore, craft, and survive.  Rating: 7.0/10 Pros:  Graphics: Great looking art style and a UI that looks great and is very easy to use Exploring: There is a lot of content in this game. There are caves, hidden chest, and portals, and a lot of other fun stuff just waiting to be seen. Character Progression: Put points into level talents, that makes your character feel powerful. Music: The music is nice and surprisingly relaxing. Sandbox: The world is procedural genenerated but still has unique dungeons that are fun.  Cons:  Tutorial: the tutorial exist but it is very minimal Lag: The game will suddenly Lag beyond control (hopefully this will be fixed) Controller: Keyboard and mouse works fine but hopefully eventually there will be some better controller support.

 Crea: An interesting 2D sandbox with a focus on RPG elements  Crea is a very fun addictive 2D sandbox game. Although it may at first glance seem similar to other competitors such as Terraria, the game strives to provide a unique experience through its unique talent and research systems.  Pros: + Great Art Style and overall feel. + The research system is really cool. It works by consuming items in your inventory that are in a specific recipe to in turn unlock partial knowledge of that recipe as a whole. I was truly surprised as to how well this system fits into a game like this, not to mention how well the crafting system works alongside this.+ The talent system works great and feels well implemented into a game of this nature. It is extremely fun both level up and improving your player's stats, as well as improving various perks in different skills that all rank up independently from each other.+Great amount of exploration and lots to do.+Trading Cards, Achievements, Workshop Support, etc.+ Mac and Linux Ports much appreciated. It only took Terraria like 2 years and millions of sales to make some of those. Cons: - REALLY BAD STUTTERING ISSUES. Although my frames per second was generally good (30-40 fps) considering my lower end hardware, the game would often freeze for multiple seconds at a time. This was mostly apparent during combat and crafting and was also reported by other users.- Decent amount of bugs (Although the game did just release from early access)-No Dedicated Servers- LACK OF EXPLANATION: While there is some tutorial, the game could do alot better at explaining some of these elements.  It almost seems as though the developer assumed everyone playing also owned similar games such as Terraria or Starbound, and the game as a result is very unfriendly to beginners. There are various community guides to help supplement this thankfully, and although the game may be hard for some to initially get through with enough time this can be overcome.  Overall Assessment Crea is certainly an extremely well thought out and well made game, and its unique research and talent systems alone make it worth buying.  Although, if you haven't played other similar games such as Terraria and Starbound, you may want to take a look at them first to get a grasp of the genre and how to play these kinds of games. However, if you've already played Terarria, enjoy RPG elements, and don't care about dedicated servers, Crea is definitely worth a purchase.  Just beware of some stuttering issues if your computer is lower end.VisGaming Score: 7.5/10 I received this product for reviewing purposes from Siege Games. 
This did not effect my review or rating in any way.	 "

								I was having a great time, spent most of the day on this levelling up, building stuff - great and splendid time.Then a sudden crash and blue screen.  Ok, no problem.  Rebooted PC....and ...my character's been rolled back to level 3.  And this isn't due to 'not saving' - I had saved and reloaded the game to do a different world maybe only 30 minutes or so before this crash ...yet somehow, my character data lost 6 hours worth. My actual world and 'stuff' was intact, but really don't fancy another 6 hours of grinding to get back to where I was skillwise, so I'll not be playing this anymore until the data can be sorted out.  Otherwise a great game with lots of promise - would have just liked a warning about 'your character will randomly disappear or get rolled back' - whilst I understand its early access and this may eventually happen, having it happen mid-play-session is a non-starter.

The way he is active on forum, being open about development, steady updates and communicating to players deserves a medal. It's safe to put Jasson/Siege Games on your trusted EA developer list without a doubt.Crea has tons more RPG elements than the other games in the genre. So if you like this genre (and don't hate RPG) you should at least try it out.  + The music makes playing this game a very relaxing experience, I assure you it's ragequit proof :)			"

DARKKi's Dark Star Reviews - CreaCrea is pretty much alike Terraria and people who like Terraria i can say right now that you would like this! Something that sets Crea different from Terraria is that your character levels up (and you have lots of things to put your skill points and more), researching, magic and more. For those unfamiliar with Terraria, Crea is an 2D Sandbox / Roguelite / RPG with elements like exploration, mining, crafting, building, fighting and much more. Think at is like Minecraft in 2D. You also have multiplayer which is kind of an requirement in games like these nowadays. Crea also support Steamworkshop (Mods) which is really good thing and we can expect some nice mods to come along.Graphics and sounds are good for this kind of title but nothing extraordinary.Rating and Should you buy this game8.5/10This is like Terraria with RPG elements and more put into it and also has Workshop support.

My biggest issue with this one is the leveling and monster scaling. Yes the thing that didnt work in Oblivion and was one of the first things fans modded out is in Crea.

												This game has little to no content. What u see in the first 10mins is pretty much the whole game in a nutshell. There is probably something like 8-10 monster varieties, mining/crafting is not rewarding because of the lack of biomes. I spent hrs mining and exploring the world from top to bottom and its pretty much the exact same thing. Even the resources you gather lacks diversity. There is little incentive to continue playing where as in Terraria you have so many things to do. This game honestly belongs in alpha. What a waste of money.			"

												First of all, if you're thinking ""Just another Terraria rip-off"", I'm going to stop you right there and let you know that you're not correct.You are right to think that Crea is a game full of adventure, roleplaying, crafting, survival and more. However, Crea adds so many incredible features that I've never seen in this genre.-Improve your character through leveling him/her up-Spend ""Talent Points"" to give your character incredible powers and abilities-Learn magic and focus on certain traits-Hang from ledges-Learn grapple, and grapple your enemies (plus I hear the dev plans to make a CHAINSAW grapple!)-So much moreOn top of all of this:-the creatures and monsters are amazing-the OST is beautiful-Sprite art is so detailed and creative-Tons and tons of recipes to learn (in a really unique way)-Tons of weapons and tools-Dev is constantly updating, and will fix bugs in a timely fashion-Steam Workshop allows for tons of fun mods to spice up the gameplayThis game is TOTALLY worth the $14.99. I have been playing it since its first Early Access release and I have seen such a profound transformation. I'm proud to be a fan and supporting of this game and the game's dev.If you love open world sandbox games, rpg's, suvival-crafting genre - you will love Crea.			"

												I LOVE this game! At first, I didn't know what it even was when I was first gifted this by a good friend of mine. When I researched it a bit, I was pretty excited and instantly hopped on. Even though I have a crappy laptop that has this game at 20+ fps maximum, I still  enjoyed the entire playthrough. Sure, I played with developer mode after I've gotten a bit far, but I made a new character and experienced the rest without. I'm now max level with all my gear maxed and almost all end-game weapons (except the Elida, cuz of the laito drops are ridiculous for me >.>) and all end-game armors. There IS noticable bugs like when the imbuing station where sommetimes when you place a material or remna, it doesn't show until you interact with another station and interact back to the original, but its only been released for a month so I'll be friendly with them. I HIGHLY recommend people who play sandbox games like Terraria or Starbound, to buy this game and try it out. You won't be disappointed. :)			"

												I love this game worth every penny and more. the gameplay is great but the tutorial is for lack of a better word half baked! I would rate this game a 9.5 because even though the tutorial is half-baked the controls are simple and there are YouTube videos that help out a lot. overall, I would like to see three things add to the game.1. Pets like taming monsters by killing a spawner or doing a quest for an NPC2. Hidden skills like kill and eat 100 oil slimes and get a skill to shoot sticky oil3. Random NPC encounter and invaders, the chance to meet a rare merchant to buy rare gear or scrolls, and to have the ability to invade other people's world. If you agree please like and share this review.			"

Review Written on Sunday, June 12th, 2016 Review Crea is a 2D sandbox RPG, with pixel-art graphics. It instantly reminds of Terraria, and for good reason of course. It is obvious where the devs took their inspiration from. This is not to say that this is a negative thing. Not at all, as they have done a great job with this game offering hours of gameplay with variety. You start out with basic tools such as a club and chopping/digging tool. As you progress through the game by gaining experience you are able to get talent points, which can be used to increase your combat skills or to improve your gathering productivity. When leveling up you are also able to distribute points across different character stats, such as health, stamina, attack, defense, agility etc. An important factor of this game of course, is its crafting ability. You use resources which you can gather throughout the games world, things like flora and minerals. You can craft a wide range of items, whether this be gear, housing or improved tools. It took a while for me to get used to the crafting, but after the initial confusion it becomes self-explanatory. Rating: 7.5/10 Pros:  Great UI. Everything is done very intuitively, whether this involves the settings of the game, the various hotkeys or simply the placing of UI elements. It is obvious that the dev put a lot of effort into this. The game contains a wide range of controls, which are fully rebindable. Big plus from me. Pixel-art, you either love it or hate it. I definitely love it, and it fits the game well. The game contains both single-player and multiplayer. Supports mods, so I hope this will keep the game going with new and refreshing content.  Cons:  Please improve the tutorials. While I do appreciate the game having them, it could - and should - be done better. Personal preference of course, but I thought the sound effects were rather annoying and the music spread out scarcely. The loading times take way too long on my high-end system, which I find odd. Might be nice to have a wiki containing craft-abilities and more information on how to play the game.

Review Written on Thursday, June 9th, 2016 Review Remember the first time you played Terraria or Starbound? After a short impression of 10 hours i must say i was addicted again. Never would have thought i would be investing that much time in a early acces game.Prepare yourself for a couple or hours of exploring, building, fighting and crafting. At first it might be a big learning curve as you die a lot when you venture to far out, but once you get familiar and level up that isnt a issue anymore. So in the beginning just keep slaying those fluffy sheep who are jumping all over the place. So if you like Terraria, Starbound and want to see how this developer implements his ideas to the genre you probably should buy the damn game :P  Rating: 7.5/10 Pros:  Multiplayer Nice UI (imo) Crafting Active developer (updates & feedback)  Cons:  Bugs (played the early access game) Like others have mentioned crafting/researching need some explaining Frames are hurting sometimes (but it could be my dear old computer lol)  Disclaimer: Source of consideration: SiegeGames "

												It's really hard to explain just how bad this game is. My issue was that despite my early misgivings, I kept thinking the game would 'open up' after the 4 hours mark, and so I kept playing. Once I reached the first boss, that was when I knew...This game suffers from No Man's Sky syndrome.""What is NMS Syndrome?"", you may ask. Great question! It's a special sort of suffering that comes about when a game has just enough intrigue and promise to make you play past Steam's refund period, and then instantly drops off afterwards.The problems with this game are not going to be fixed without a total rework and transformation into a totally different game, but let me go ahead and waste my time explaining to you just how extensive they are.Music:This might seem to be a silly thing to start with, but my god the music in this game is the blandest most boring OST I have ever heard. It's tough to even call it music, honestly. This was always my biggest problem with it. Once you realize there is no 'action' in the game and it's truly a slow, plodding, boring experience, the music begins to make sense, but by then you've already lost all hope.If anything could start to make a dent in the playability of this game, making the music more interesting would be a big first step. Compare this to Terraria, which I consider the gold standard for indie game music. The music changes based on where you are in a planet, and it not only fits the general mood of an area, it also can help set the mood, like when you enter the Dungeon for the first time.Crea? The bosses don't even have different music. It's the same bland overworld track you've been listening to for 3 hours straight!Night-time/Day-time? Same music!Underground? Hey, the music changes a little bit! Too bad it's still boring.TL:DR, the music in this game is below sub-par, it might as well not even be there.User Interaction:One of the reasons I bought this game was because of the big lauded User Interface upgrade that I saw so much about and how excited people were for it. Guess what?...it's good. Like, the UI isn't bad at all.But the control scheme for this game is the worst thing I have experienced barring $0.99 games being resold from 1995 on Steam. I don't even know how to explain this, but here goes.1. You have two main 'control schemes' you must use. One is for exploration, the other is for combat.2. Each control scheme has a sort of alternate scheme you can switch from. As an example, you can have a melee/ranged and a magic loudout for your character, then your other scheme will be for exploration with magic spells to detect ore and such.3. So let's say you're playing with your sword and bow scheme. LMB will likely attack with the sword, and RMB will charge up and shoot your arrow. Want to switch to magic? Maybe you, like me, binded it to scroll-wheel-down. But if you want to switch to exploration mode, with your pickaxe and torches and stuff? That's a totally different button.4a. It gets better. The buttons you need to press change depending on what mode you're in. For example, in exploration mode, if you have a spell like the 'locate ore' spell on your hotbar in the '4' position, pressing 4 does not activate the spell. Instead, after pressing 4, you have to press RMB to activate it!4b. But let's say you're in combat mode, with your wands in hand and spells at the ready with Fireball tagged to the 4 slot. Pressing '4' DOES cast the spell! WHAT?!5a. Your actions against the lower hotbars also change depending on what menu you are viewing. For example, let's say you're in combat mode and there's an enemy coming. You don't have any of your inventory/character/talent windows or etc open, so if you right-click on fireball on your quick menu, it will cast Fireball.5b. But then let's say that you DO have an inventory or talent menu open... if you don't realize this and right-click on Fireball... it will delete the god-damn spell from your hotbar! The enymy was already close by, now you have to frantically open up your talent menu, scroll to the fireball spell, drag it to your hotbar, close the menu, then right-click it again to cast it! Oops, you died!6. This one is more agregious, because of how asinine it is. In Exploration Mode, left clicking removes an object or mines a tile... and right click places one. Further, when you pluck comething out of your inventory, like a crafting table, and you then right click to place it... it doesn't place it! You often have to right-click twice! God forbid you left-click instead, you'll be baffled as to why you can't place this item down.Oh no! An enemy is attacking! You're in exploration mode underground, and you need to switch to your weapons in a hurry! What do you do? In your panic, you hit scroll-wheel-down, but alas... that switches to your alternate exploration loadout. So you hit your other button and now you're in magic mode... but oops! You forgot to place a torch somewhere so now you're in total darkness! (Unlike in Terraria, you can't hold shift for a split second to illuminate your surroundings with a torch in your inventory)You quicklly press the other button and swap your loadout to melee since this is CQC, but you're still totally blind. Swinging wildly, you quickly die. Or you try to run blindly, fall off a ledge, and take a ridiculous amount of fall damage.All I'm saying is that the control scheme in this game is abominable. But even all of what I've said pales in comparison to the next point...""""""Sandbox"""""" Progression:You know what I think makes Terraria great? You can be as good as you want at the game and it's all skill based. Sure, you might only be doing one-damage to the boss with each arrow you fire, but you're still actually damaging him. In Crea, you will often be fighting enemies at a much higher level than you and not be damaging them at all. Let's dive into core gameplay.Leveling Up:In Crea, as you perform an activity, you gain EXP for that thing. You have Arms, magic, exploration, crafting, and gathering.Arms is your physical attacks and such. This includes melee and ranged weapons like bows. (All right, just bows. No guns or anything cool.)Magic is obviously stuff related to magic, mostly meaning spells.Exploration is gained literally by walking around, and boosted by walking in areas you haven't been before, moreso in high level areas. This category also includes mobility upgrades like a double jump and sprinting.Crafting is leveled by crafting items, researching, etc. It not only allows you to refine items better, but get better sell prices and such.Gather is gained when you pick up items, dig in the ground, etc. It includes a few 'spells' that allow you to see ore and treasure chests and stuff, plus lots of upgrades for mining speed and etc.So the fundamental issue with leveling, especially in Crea, is that it just flatly locks you out of everything. In Terraria, double jumps can be obtained by finding a cloud in a bottle, and you might literally luck out and find those in a surface level chest five minutes into the game. In Crea, you're guaranteed 5 hours of grinding before you gain such a simple thing.But the real issue is what leveling and stats do to the gameplay experience. Crea has leveled zones, meaning the further you are from spawn, the stronger the enemies are, to the point of just one-shotting you. Three of your leveling traits gain you zero combat survivability. The only way to increase your actual player level is to grind in combat by attacking every single enemy you see, and it takes a LONG time........I hit the character limit for steam reviews. I really wanted to continue ripping this game to shreds but now I'm bored. Fantastic, that was effort wasted. Didn't know the limit existed. "

												I'm generally a big fan of these 2D sandbox games; Crea brings an interesting approach research & crafting with some cool rpg elements.Personally more of a fan for Starbound's solid structure and sci-fi theme, Crea is still a fun time with friends!At the moment a bit buggy, a bit jenky, the development team appear to be very active so I'm sure it'll all be ironed out.An interesting title if you've burnt out on Terraria.5/10 stolen golden altars			"

												I like this genre and have played many hours of Terraria and Starbound. I picked up Crea to give it a try and have enjoyed the gameplay, so far. The graphics aren't bad and there is controller support, unlike the previously mentioned games. I like the crafting system and how there are various levels to it. It gives me something to look forward to when exploring and leveling up my character. In any case, I would give this game a try if you like exploration and crafting games.			"

								Really love this game and all of its functions expecially the traits system. It is very unique to the genre I would say. I love 2d sandox games so naturally this is a good game to me. It is in an early stage so it is sort of choppy but it is fun. Buy it if you like this kind of genre.			"

												Terraria with rpg elements. Better than starbound.DISCLAIMER: In order to smelt ores and craft items efficiently in this game you must endure one of the least entertaining mini games ever concieved. You click on a number of abilities to max out the items quality before its chaos rating fills up. However, each of your abilities used to craft is simply a dice roll. The variation on the rolls is very large. Large to the point of it feeling completely pointless each time you use an ability as it is possilbe to completely fill out your chaos on an ability that is necessary to use in a single click. Pretty much everytime you click something you run the risk of trashing the item and wasting all the resources. This same process is used to smelt ores. Instead of just smelting all the ores you bring back you have to do this frustrating minigame for EVERY SINGLE BAR YOU SMELT. Sure you could just smelt it normally, but you will recieve 1/2 - 1/3 as much ore as you would by torturing yourself with the chaos crafting system. You will be motivated to go through this because you need as much smelted as possible to try the ""minigame"" (random dice roll) when crafting the actual items as many times as possible in hopes of getting an item with something besides pickup distance. It is hard to really determine how much fun the rest of the game is because in comparison to the crafting system everything is amazing.			"

												I was skeptical at first. Another Terraria clone, they said. Then I played. I found that, yes; It is has Terraria elements. Many of them. But what's wrong with that?Then I got into the Chaos Crafting System. It very much reminds me of Final Fantasy 14, and I have no problems with that whatsoever. I LOVED that specific crafting system and sunk many many hours of gameplay into making high quality gear and parts. Once I started getting the hang of Chaos Crafting in Crea, I spent hours with it making the most perfect gear I could. Im still currently playing a ton and I dont see an end. -Pros-Familiar Terraria feelLevelingCraftingAbility System-Cons-Multiplayer needs workLack of monster variety past a pointNeeds more level 50 contentDevs need to add a dungeon designer.

												I think this is the first review I have written for a computer game.  The reason I am taking the time to write this review is because I want the reader to know that the developer, Jasson, is very competent and very available and responsive.  The game is fun and playable and being constantly updated, with new content planned.  Whenever an update breaks something, Jason is on it and fixes the problem.  For example, version 1.0.10 was an unstable opt-in beta attempt to fix some multiplayer issues.  It did fix some of the issues but created others.  We just clicked on the live stream button in the game which took us right to Jasson live, then he reproduced the problem, tracked down three issues and fixed them, and had a new version 1.0,12 out the same day.  Now we are up and playing again,  The problems that are left are minor annoyances which Jason is aware of and is working daily to fix, and will have fixed them all soon.  This game is worth the money, and the developers back their product and give the highest level of service and help imaginable, in my humble opinion.  I am totally happy with the game and with my experience with the developer.  My wife and I have played over 150 hours and are looking forward to new content and further developemet of this game and concept.			"

It dosent have much direction at first so its up to you how you are going to live on this planet and expect to die quite a few times. Its not that hard though to progress and despite the average graphics the gameplay is much more better then the more expensive first person RPG games.

												Like terraria and starbound but different because of the rpg like progression of your avatar. To be more precise, your avatar has experience level, and talents level (arms/syle/crafting/gathering/exploration). Best gear is crafted and you need to reach a certain level to be able to use it. There are boss in the game and killing them unlock better material for crafting.			"

												Bought this game a while back and did have a few problems with it at first with crashing but since the update it did work and i got to play a few hours. It had another update recently and for some reason my computer was acting up with not being able to run the game as it would launch then close instantly before you even got in game. If anyone has this issue please try and check your windows updates if they do not work just search google for how to fix the constant searching of a windows update and it should fix the problem once you get your update for windows. The game itself is quite fun but can take some getting used to with the controls. All in all it is a fun little game and I do love the artistry of it. If you do have any problems still i sugest contacting them on the support forum as they are very good at tryign to resolve the issues even if its not their game createing it! props to the team for helping me with the issue I had and I will reccomend this game to anyone who loves anything like terraria and such.

												I bought this game exactly to get away from Terraria.. Whatever new thing is added there It's going straight for the end game. While this here is something new and people make the same Minecraft mistake as always - comparing one game to another which is considered superior.. But I wouldn't call it that way because this game has some things that Terraria doesn't have. CONS:- You can move the inventory menus.- The Gathering / Combat switch is great - we all expirienced the pick to be at button 6 while the sword is on 1...- The research system is something new, many people may complain about it, but every game has its element, which's sole purpose is to ""waste"" your time in a good way - head in the game.- Huge talent system.- Classic RPG elements.Of course, every game has it's own..CONS:- Lag spikes/ Frame Rate drop - nothing is more capable than this to ruin your game and sadly this game has this problem.- Not so much content when talking about Mobs.- Multiplayer is somehow left.. unfinished.. while you can play with your friends, it's just not supported on steam, and that makes things a little bit uncomfortable.- In the settings there arent many graphic options. Only in-game, and still the only two which will help you reduce the lag spikes are V-sync disable and Lightning.- Beginner Unfriendly.Overall :While this is everything I had to say until this moment about pros and cons, I don't thing there is any need this game to be rated.. not in this early stage. It has great potential, just a little bit witch the wrench here and there. I do not regret buying the game simply because I'm sure that in 4-5 months this game will have at least 200 downloads a day.7.8 / 10			"

												It's aight, extremely buggy and less content rich version of Terraria with more RPG elements.the small team behind the game are working hard and updating the game daily to fix these bugs, but it feels like an early access title right now - so many things don't work in online Multiplayer.5/10 in it's current state, go buy Terraria instead if you haven't played it.

								I can't say that the artwork is top notch, or the combat is perfect, but damn this game is charming as all get out!  The RPG-style exp gain and skill buying, and the research system go a long way to set it apart from other games in the 2D building genre too.It's not everything you could ever want from a game, but it sure is fun to play, and keeps me coming back for more!

												Dou you like Terraria, Starbound, Minecraft? Then don't play this game. It's way way worse than any of those.The game can be described in these 4 words: unintuitive, messy, underdeveloped and monotonous.1. The tutorial is pretty poor/incomplete. Same for game's wiki. You will have to google pretty often for core game mechanics, item recipies etc. 2. UI is as bad as it can be. It's unintuitive, overcomplicated, unfriendly, poorly documented and inconsistent. It's a constant pain and struggle.3. Forget diversity. The game is pretty monotonous. Even soundtrack only has a single main theme. There is nothing like Terraria events or Starbound quests,4. The skills system that is advertised as an advantage over Terraria/Starbound/Minecraft is in fact not sweet at all. Many skills are useles: some of them will be irrelevant for you because you follow one specific skill build (e.g. warrior, not mage). Another reason why having many skills is not cool is UI: there is almost no way one will use more than 3-5 active skills. And there is casting delay. And there is stamina cost. Bottom line is that skills system is not fun at all.			"

												As much as a good game this is I can far from recommend it.8 hours play time and can still not make stairs or ladders and have yet to see a single NPC.The entire crafting system builds on a weird mechanic of researching. Everything seems to be random and like I said, I can after 8 hours craft various beds, chairs, chrystal stuff but no ladder och stairs!There are a lot of bugs still and I know the dev is working hard.Enemies have a weird scale as well, you can attack a lvl 1 monster and get a portal to a realm where the monster are higher lvl than you, and then you die if your not really careful. So a lvl 1 monster and you thinking ""oh nice, some easy loot in this realm"" can turn in to a 20 min attack and run fest.The crafting system I like very much, but there are some weird combinations that make no sense.The combat system is probably the most well thought in this game. Good variety of combos, spells and attacks. And depending on what you do (swords or magic) you gain levels in that specific category.It sadens me to say that I'd much rather keep playing Terraria (1000+ hours) and/or Starbound. This game feels more like a Early Access than anything else.			"

												Crea is a 2D sandbox type game that blends exploration, building, crafting and combat all into one universe. While it's easy to compare the game to others like Terraria and Starbound I would say that based on the systems present in the game, it tends to lean more on the RPG  side of things. Unfortunately the art style of Crea does not appeal to me but this in no way affects the gameplay. One of the main reasons I'll praise this game over similar titles is the full controller support. I absolutely despise playing this genre with a keyboard and mouse. It just personally feels clunky to me and while Crea may not be the best in its class, overall I would hope for continued updates and improvements over time.I received this game for free in exchange for my honest review.

Although, if itdont frustrates you fully by teleporting you into a dongen where you are fully trapped and have no hope to flee, it is a great geame, so, if you have any ideas how to overcome those bugs, go ahead and play the game :D (and please tell me how to overcome the listed bugs)			"

												How to decipher a hiccup if anyone experiencing window 7 problem like I am, its loading and then crashes and they are asking you turn over your logs do so. Game overall was okay, I had 6 hours to 14 hours one time, before reinstall method. it really resets your data. T_T Music and Gameplay I liked it, for 2d game, its not creativerse, there are boss monsters, who make it your day feel like worst nightmare. Unless you figured out recipes for crystal tools. Unlike creativerse diamond rules as best made weapon. Beyond that loading for me sucked and fact it break out in second or third time I'm sorry I gave out CREA I loved game but Rogue harvest developers and Forsaken Isle became my only survival games to play right after that hiccup.  I recommend it if only plays for you, me it doesn't play. unless devs can solve windows 7 riddle.			"

												I'm not gonna do any pro - con thing about this game, but i will say what the game has so far. I can't say cons except for, maybe, the easy bosses. Why? Well the game is in ""Alpha"" state, so that means it's in development, so bugs and issues will be during this phase. So i will be waiting for the patch to say if the game has been improved, or maybe, some of the issues were taken care off. But the game has a really nice crafting system, a nice lvling system, including a rebirth thingy to get even stronger during the time u spend in the game. It has bosses, minibosses, mini minibosses (paragons), although they are in small numbers, in a further update i think more will be added. It has dungeons, dungeon spawner, creep spawner. It's an interesting game that's worth ur time if u understand the concept of ""Alpha"" or ""In development"". Otherwise is not worth ur time, until it will be out of testing.			"

												This game has all the makings of a great game, too bad every time I try to do anything (enter dungeons/realms, explore, play for more than 45 mins) the game crashes to desktop and god forbid anyone else on my server goes to a dungeon without me then everything else on the outside world stops reacting you can move around but don't regen stam and cant cast spells and if the person rushes through the dungeon and makes it out the server begins to lag really badly as all the mobs that where in the dungeon suddenly dont have a home and the server text goes mental spamming this mob doesnt have a realm and everyone gets kicked. I can't recomend this game in its current state but with a little more work and polish then its going to be awesome and since the developers are very active I can see that being sooner rather than later. I should probably note that I am using the dedicated server.Pros: great music, fun game play, leveling system is intuative, fun crafting system.

												I don't think there's much I can add to the numerous reviews already here, but I'm going to go ahead and add my opinion anyhow.I've played the game some.  And then some.  I've never played Terraria (beyond the first few minutes of trying it), and never playing Starbound (though it's on my wishlist).  So playing this presented a new type of challenge for me.  I like platformers, I like building houses, I like exploring, I like crafting.  Perfect!  Backtracking a little, I like recipe based crafting.  I don't like Minecraft style crafting where you put certain things in certain places and hope for the best.  Wood + metal = Barrel!  I shouldn't have to worry about the design necessary to create it.  (Some people like to...  that's fine with me.  I don't.)Early game I found myself getting my butt kicked...  mercilessly.  Again, new style of game...  plus playing a platformer on a keyboard has never been particularly easy for me (I'll rock MegaMan on a controller all day long though).  As I learned the enemies, their attacks, and my own skills I became a much more profecient killer.  Now, at level 50 with 50 Arms level...  there isn't a damn thing that frightens me.  (Aside from the dark.  That's still scary.)There are beginners guides out there if you need them, or just want them.  I'll just give a little tip...  gather.  Stone, wood, and especially ore early game...  that's what it's all about.  Investing in good armor will save your♥♥♥♥♥too.  Also, when you find boxes and loot them, feel free to gather the box too.  Bows are tricky but allow you to stay mobile.  Also, pressing down while holding either direction will cause you to tumble.  You will avoid all damage while doing this...  including falling damage (there's an achievement associated with this).Learning new recipes can be challenging.  You learn stuff based on material drops you've gotten, or things you've crafted.  Keeping a researcher near your boxes keeps you from having to grab items from your boxes in order to see if you can learn something new.  Additionally, most materials have different rarity tiers.  (White, green, blue, purple, gold...  just like rarity for weapons and armor.)The developer is great, he's always working on the game and generally streams as he's doing it.  He's constantly reading the comments/questions on his channel and answering them while he works too.  So far he's the first (and only) Twitch subscription I have.  Updates are released frequently, which is great.Lastly, dungeons are instanced temporary maps that have different goals.  The end goal is always to make it to the crystal, but some times you have to avoid damaging monsters, sometimes you have to kill them all, sometimes you just have to flip switches.  There are also different affects applied to your character or the mobs making the instances constantly different (to an extent).The ultra rare stuff is hard to find.  I have yet to find some things and I have most all of the bosses on farm mode and have traveled to the four corners of the map.All in all, I recommend the game.  It isn't perfect but Jasson strives at getting it there, and then revamping what already exists.			"

Review Written on Sunday, June 26th, 2016ReviewThis game is an unmistakable descendant of Terraria, and it stays true to the look and feel of the original with many similar game play elements. However, there is enough innovation and variation here to make it well worth playing. It's a relaxed, explore-at-your-own-pace game -- ideal as an enjoyable, long-running endeavor to play whenever you have some free time. Drop in to explore, collect resources, expand your home base, kill some ugly creatures, and then call it a day. Your world is saved and will be waiting for you to explore and build when you return.If you need high-octane battles and constant action, youll not find a happy home here. On the other hand if you enjoy exploring and learning, there is more than enough depth to keep you entertained for many hours. Progression is limited by how much you have leveled up your talents and how much research you've managed to complete. Both of which gently guide you toward the next thing you need to learn in order to advance. The environment is forgiving, and the consequences of dying are almost none; you can feel free to give any idea a whirl.Having played 50+ hours so far, there have been many aha! moments, but there is still a lot to learn. Its quite addicting if youre prone to getting lost in the details with games like this. When you divide the price by the number of hours worth of quiet enjoyment you can get out of this, it looks like a real deal. Even better if you have friends who play and you can arrange some multiplayer fun along the way.Rating:9.0/10Pros:True to the original without being a cloneVery active developer, continuing to improve the gameRuns very well under Linux, even on a modest laptop.Completely playable and fun as single-user, but multiplayer is supported tooSome clever control features, which remove the tedium of moving around in worldCons:A few user-interface actions are not quite as obvious as they could beThe tutorial is very basic and youre on your own to discover how things workThe web site creawiki.net is full of spoilers :-)Over 50 hours of play, had a single game crashI should be doing my actual work instead of crafting and building.Hardware InformationHardwareTypeMonitorAcer AL2416WHeadphones-nope-KeyboardLogitechController-none-MouseLogitechMicrophone-none-MotherboardMSI Z77A-GD65CPUIntel i5-3570KGPURadeon R7 260XRAM8GOSFedora LinuxHDD250G SSDDisclaimer:Source of consideration: Siege Games provided a gratis review copy.

												There are more and more of these type of games,mine stuff,build stuff but Crea adds a lot of originality and give a good feeling of progression.Enemies are interesting as they have different attack styles so you have to find best ways of dealing with them.skills and items are kinda similar to terraria but it has more depth as they are more gradiated and have different elements,also it is more centred around your character as  your character has stats and skills like an ARPG and is not pure item based.

												Since Terraria, I've had a hard time finding a game to scratch the same itch that Terraria covered so well. Crea has sucessfully done this. Kudos to you guys for doing what Starbound failed to do (actually get released) and what Edge of Space fell so flat at. The RPG elements, leveling system, research system, all add to a great crafting/exploring/fighting experience. If you enjoyed Terraria, but felt let down by CrapBound and Edge of Space, then definately give this game a try.			"

												The UI for this game is probably one of the clunkiest I've ever seen. Not only is it a hassle to just access items and actually build, but it is painfully slow when everything else in the game runs smoothly. For example, if I wanted to place down a torch while exploring, I would need to stop whatever I'm doing, open my inventory, grab the torches, place one down, and put them back in my inventory. In games like Terraria and Starbound, you could have items in a sort of hotbar where you easily access them while on the go, making exploring easier and faster. With Crea it just feels like a chore. Building is no better, with you having slowly place down each block one at a time. And as I mentioned before the UI is horribly slow. When I first entered the game the UI wasn't even there, it took almost a solid minute to appear. I couldn't build, couldn't research, I couldn't even see my inventory. Research is also kind of confusing. The game will tell me that I've unlocked an item, but when I actually try to craft it, its nowhere to be seen. I'm not sure if this is a bug, or maybe I'm just doing something wrong but I have no way of knowing. Besides the UI issues and bugs, the game is okay I guess. I mean I can tell that alot of effort went into making this but in the end it just ends up feeling like a second-rate terraria. It does have alot of original things going for it like the fighting and leveling system. The music and art style are nice too, but as for the game as a whole, I just can't reccomend it. Overall I'd give it maybe a 4-5/10. At least the developer is active and is currently addressing many of the bugs within the game, but in my opinion the game should have stayed in early access.			"

												Crea is a game that is similar to Terraria, but at the same time, quite different. Fans of the Minecraft modding scene may remember a mod called 'Thaumcraft 3', the one where you needed to get materials and research them to unlock more recipies. This game has that as a core element, and it's a feature I quite like. You have an RPG leveling system in here, where you can upgrade your basic stats, attack, damage, magic attack, magic damage, ect. Another plus is that this game actually has a story, unlike Terraria. The tooltips hint at a story, and you also have a book that fills itself in as you complete specific dungeons. It is a bit buggy, but the bugs are very minor. I give it a 7.8/10			"

												This is not a game that you should buy. It was supposed to have left early access a month ago, but don't believe the devs. The game is so unpolished that it is unplayable and I don't mean the bugs (and there is plenty of them). Despite the fact that my computer easily meets the requirements, after a while of playing, the game slows down to the point that it is impossible to continue. And the issue was visible only after around 2 hours of gameplay, so I can't get Crea refunded. I tried playing again later on, the same thing happend. I feel cheated for 13$			"

												My pre-release review was a don't buy, wait and see, due to a few issues with the UI, controls, and bugs.  With the 1.0 release here, I've gone back and played a bit, and to be honest, I'm on the fence.With the exception of the ""crafting"" NPCs issue, there seems to have been improvements all around. The control scheme (UI) is better, I haven't encountered any bugs yet, and the skill progression appears much improved. I'll need to delve into it more to get better insight, but overall it is a better game now.However, better doesn't mean that there aren't much needed improvements/additions to be made.  Many similar games out now are focusing on adding things such as mechanical systems, power systems, vehicles, etc.  Compared to those games, this one seems priced a bit steep, as it incorporates none of that.  Sure, you can explore your world, go through dimensional rifts to smaller dynamic areas, and use magic, but most other games have that and then some.Then there's the issue of mining - now, I'm not sure if this changes with higher tier gear, but mining one block at a time is sort of a pain (NOTE: It has been confirmed that this is upgradable).Now, despite all of that, I still enjoy playing it for the most part - I enjoy the genre, unlocking skills, and exploration.  Plus, the game is still fairly new, thus could see all of these issues addressed.  Leading me to the dilemna of the recommendation - which unfortunately is still, wait & see...			"

								Really good game. Crea stands out among many 2D Terraria-type games with it's fun magic and skills system for some RPG with your crafting exploring and combat. This is a fun game and quite deep and well worth the price. Why this game isn't huge I don't know, it will be I think. The devs are really communicative and nice to the community and open.It doesn't even occur to me when playing the game is in EA, this is one of the good ones, support it!			"

								While I like the concept. I find the game pretty freaking annoying. Once you go into placement mode, can't get out of it. I hit every key on was still stuck in it (most annoying feature).You build a workstation and then you don't know if you're supposed to access it or just be standing over it. I built a workstation, but I couldn't figure out how to access it, and standing right on it, I could still craft the same items. You have to swtch between combat and passive mode, however....You can only have 1 weapon equipped at a time. So if you have a bow and want to switch to a melee weapon it's a pain. You have to open your inventory and manually change weapons and hope you don't get killed in the process.I had no freaking clue how to use my shield to defend myself (lack of help info). Since there is a skill in there about moving while defending with your shield.There's no penalty for dying.You can cast heal on your self, but not in combat. So if you survive combat you can heal yourself.The hot keys and inventory are pretty small. 2 hot keys for weapons (really only 1, shield is equipped all the time). 5 for passive & 5 for spells.On the positive side you can level up your character and skills. However for me it's just not enough to get over the annoyances of the game (expecially placement mode).			"

												Game should still be in early access it isnt finished theres major bugs such as crash to desktop bugs when you try and enter a dungeon and bugs that make it incapable to interact with treasure chests.Theres also a multitude of visual bugs and a bunch that make clients unable to interact with the world.I'd warn you to wait until this game is actually finished before buying as this isn't at the moment.Game is a substandard terraria like game that has some good elements but terraria does pretty much everything better.If you havent played terraria and are interested in this get terraria instead if you have terraria already wait to buy this till its fixed.

It's so much fun! It's so pretty! The lore, the adventure, the everything, is so expansive! I LOVE IT IT'S NEVER ENDING! I can't wait to get back to playing it and I'm so grateful to the team, thanks for such an amazing game. PS- I worship the Lacies. Honestly like wtf this game is FANTASTIC! And I had almost given up on video games but this game reminded me they can great. So happy I supported it back then. I can't wait to see what else there is to uncover and what what you guys will add! PSS- I love the art too so much! Kelley is so good! I mean Jason and Aaron you guys rock too but I live for art!

												I'm going to start this review off with me saying this game ISNT like Terraria, so all you 12 year old idiots stop saying it's to much like Terraria because it isn't. Terraria doesn't have a leveling system like Crea. In Terraria adventuring isn't worth it because you can basically get the best stuff with in the first few in game nights. So over all Crea is definitely a great game and I would recommend it to people who are into games such as Terraria, Starboard, etc. And I think this game has a lot of potential.			"

								I bought this game thinking that it would combine elements of RPG and terraria, but i was wrong. There is absolutely no RPG or adventure elements in this early access game. The only god saving feature for this game is the art work and music. Game play is pretty superficial at best, much worse than some free online web games with almost zero replayability. My advice is to wait for them to fully release the game and see what features are available.			"

Early Access Review
								1/50th terrarias content with an arbitrary skill tree and dumbed down game play but much less fun. add nazi forum moderators who delete posts when its convenient and you have a real recipe for filth. this lady assclown (who is almost certainly a trannie named ted) or whatever her name is (forum mods are sub-human♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has time to memorize their names?) literally removed every post i made, helpful or not.. after perma-banning me for telling some kid who ""spelt lyket his"" to learn english or not bother posting. hmm what was the last game to go that route? oh thats right, DARKOUT! this game will surely suffer the same fate.gotta love it when you support a game before its even on steam and the developers decide making a trip to pax (while delaying a MAJOR patch to do so) is a great idea when they arent even showing the game! like JUST there to rub e-peens and schmooze reporters.. love seeing money wasted on crap like this and then hearing about how tight budgets are and how much ""work"" has to be done (sitting on your duff typing=work? get a real job), and missed deadlines being part of the business.while it may seem like im attacking the developer and his crew (because i am) the fact remains this is a very boring game, most of terrarias appeal was it being action based and having little things like traps, this game has none of that. it has slightly better art (yea than a 16 bit game... what doesnt?) but in every other way the question is ""why not play terraria?"". multiplayer is buggy, the mobs are fully uninspired (slimes, and boars, and golems oh my! was the guy born with 0 creative bones in his body AT ALL?), and the digging is.. exactly as digging is in any other game. the soundtrack is boring, not just boring.. but the kind of boring that sounds like it should be heard in a room with a sleeping 3 month old baby. the crafting system is stupid (waste multiple pieces of a material to see what it can make.. then go get more of said material to actually MAKE said item and then waste that to see what IT can be used to make), and the selection of items is pathetic (1 dozen or so swords.. same for bows.. and armor.. nothing cool here at all). no boomerangs, no grappling hooks, theres really only even a rudimentary collection of building materials (which are kind of a pain to place).. it just plain reeks of mediocrity. avoid it.

								DO NOT BUY THIS!I sat here for five fragging minutes trying to figure out how the HELL TO EVEN FIGHT.Starbound, Terraria, HELL... Exanima!These games are rather simple. Avoid getting hit.This? It gives no tutorial on how the hell to avoid attacks, to block or even use your spells. I understand you are level one, but for christs sake, EVEN OBLIVIONS FIRST FIREBALL COULD KILL A RAT!Waste your money if you like, its your choice and I did my duty as a gamer to warn others. SCREW THIS GAME.			"

												Edit: post EA it doesn't seem to have fixed a lot of its issues that I thought would be quashed before official release. Unfortunately I can't recommend the game as it is, it lacks a point to it and feels grindy because there isn't really a goal (bosses, accomplish X/Y/Z). Perhaps future patches will fix it up, but for now, thumbs down. EA Review below.Terraria-like game with actual progression, based on what you do. Gathering increases your gathering skill which will give you points to improve your speed/power/etc while gathering. Same thing with combat, exploration, and crafting.Personally I REALLY love character-based progression, so this game clicked with me despite being a bit clunkly to play. I'd recommend giving it a try if you enjoy Terraria-like games (2D Minecraft), though I suspect that some people will not enjoy the level-based progression.Some cons would include a complaint here that archery feels bad (arrow drop is overtuned IMO), the starting stamina is really really bad, and I do wish there was some kind of quest-based progression as well (a la Terraria or Starbound). However, the game is in EA so it could very well improve over time.  So far, 7/10, I am satisfied with what I bought.			"
