												I really loved this game and had a lot of fun with it.   Beyond ridiculous I cannot give this game a recommendation...The issue?   Well, the Steam version ruins the game completely.  By this I mean, and this is a spoiler you NEED to hear!  Once you kill the Last Ending Boss the game immediately cuts to the Main menu!?!?  Your supposed to be able to look at your loot, watch the ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then have the option to move some of your characters to multiplayer.... you get non of that!   I just spent over 30 hours on a game just to have the ending robbed from me!   Looked this up on google this problem has been since it was put on Steam and they never fixed it, its been years!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTFIf your going to buy this, buy the actual disc,  Im beginning to think steam is not the way to go for old PC games as I have had other issues with some other pc originals from the early 2000s as well.

												Bought the 3-pack (Dungeon Siege I, II, and III) for just over $10, so I wasn't expecting much - especially from a game that was 15 yrs old.  At first I found it cheesy and the graphics were almost too unpolished to stomach.  But after I finally got out of the woods and into a dungeon, I started to truly appreciate the game.  It wound up reminding me alot of ""Dragon Age - Awakenings"" and ""Diablo"".  The music is pretty cool, the graphics (once I finally found a zoom level I was comfortable with - 2.5D'ish) weren't too bad, the battles got epic at times, and character development and the interface were awesome.  There is little to no plot, and it is full-tilt hack&slash, but overall I found it to be well worth my money and time.  I give it enthusiastic thumbs up to anyone who wants to have some fun.			"

												Do I recommend this game? To most people, yes. To some people who only favor the new generation of video games... Not so much.Dungeon Siege is mainly a game you would play for nostalgia; or if you're just a fan of mysterious, old school RPGs that don't hold your hand or if you're just a RPG collector in the first place, and seek a new game to add to your collection. Since Dungeon Siege was the first game I ever played, my review may bare some bias: but hopefully, that shall not be the case.Dungeon Siege MIGHT not have the most advanced combat system, but with the amount of interesting characters you can control (8 at maximum, if I'm correct) such as a dwarf, an archer, a alcoholic yet skilled warrior and even a half giant (in the expansion pack!) you can create a team of adventurers with all kinds of strategy and you can find and loot all kinds of accoutrement to independantly equip each party member you are controlling.The game may seem very linear at first but if you're willing to playthrough the game over one time you'll discover many secret locations and party members which you may not have discovered from the first playthrough, something special Dungeon Siege always captured me with was the mystery. SPOILER ALERT: In one area, you find extremely large (seemingly dragon) bones... Who knows what that was before it died? I suppose we'll never know.You have three classes: Melee, Ranged or Magic. There are many spells, swords (or even clubs or hammers or axes) and bows (or crossbows in the expansion pack) to collect, and a large amount of armor to follow. Not to mention the brilliant voice acting and enchanting sound effects which if you played Dungeon Siege awhile ago shall capture your heart with nostalgia.Dungeon Siege is overall an AMAZING game. The first playthrough you will find incredible since you won't know what to expect, then there's always the expansion. The only complaints I have is that the multiplayer is disabled, I wish there were more party members and it wasn't as linear (The secret locations and party members does get slightly limited, there are many side quests though too!) The final verdict for Dungeon Siege is... A 8 out of 10. The game is incredible (a 10/10 for the first playthrough) but there are a few flaws that could keep someone from playing.Until the next review, seeya!			"

												Dungeon Siege was one of my favourite games growing up. This is a Diablo like dungeon crawler, action RPG hack and slash. You start out with one character, which you create yourself in classic RPG fashion, and set out on your journey. Along the linear path, you meet you adventures who will join your party, by the end of the game you will have up to eight different party members, and there are three different classes which your characters can take the role of, melee, range and mage. I found the melee and range characters levelled up a lot quicker than the mage but it didn't seem to make that much difference in the grand scheme of things. You can really get into micromanaging your party once you get a couple of members, the game allows you to pause real time action to let you give orders for your characters. You can also just sit back and let the AI work it out with the very initiative behaviour system; you can set each characters default behaviour for certain circumstances which gives you the hands off approach. The graphics show their thirteen year age here; although back when this game was originally released, this was one of the best looking games of its time. Bare that in mind before you judge the pixels!The game play is very linear, there is no reason to back track in this game as enemies do not respawn, and you just need to push on forward. The zones are nicely put together, with lots of different hidden areas off the main track, allowing you to explorer and find hidden treasures or maybe a small side boss.  The dungeons themselves are massive, you can find yourself getting lost in all of the corridors; this isn't a bad thing though as you just keep on squishing all the enemies till you find your path again. You are playing a dungeon crawler, so you should expect that. I've been playing Dungeon Siege for about twenty odd hours now, this was to complete the whole game including side quests; as with all games of this type, it's highly recommended you do these as they give you extra rewards and more story to immerse yourself in. Even on newer operating systems I didn't have any technical issues, it was a shame I couldn't ramp the resolution right the way up, but I am sure if you look out there you can find mods that allow you to do so. In this day and age, Dungeon Siege will only appeal to a certain audience, newer gamers will probably instantly dislike it because of the way it looks. However, if you want to try out a classic RPG game with tons of content, then Dungeon Siege is a pretty good starting point which you won't be disappointed in. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Dungeon Siege is a pretty solid Action RPG in the vein of Diablo. Although it requires some coaxing to get functional on a modern OS it has aged remarkably well and mainly only suffers from somewhat wonky controls (which get worse when you've more party members to manage), a rather awkward camera, and some exception crashes; though in my case that last one plagued the bandit cave area so horribly that it effectively ended my campaign, so your mileage may vary.Graphics: The graphics are still pretty passable and in some cases still quite beautiful, no complaints aside from character display UI issues in the inventory screen probably caused by playing on a higher resolution than the game was designed for. Throughout the game, a fairly dark, earthy theme is most-often employed.Sound: The game features an excellent, genre-appropriate, soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule (Morrowind, Oblivion, Knights of the Old Republic...) but has some weird sound effects issues wherein an item drop sound may play when no items are dropped. Some basic, often unconvincing, voice acting is employed for important characters.Story: A pretty standard fantasy storyline that doesn't really stand out in any way, although it's not unbearable, it is very linear and can get boring pretty quickly, making it hard to play for extended periods of time. Characters are very basic, as seems very common amongst Action RPGs.This reviewer gives Dungeon Siege: 7/10 "

												8.5/10Somewhere between Baldur's Gate and Diablo lies the awesomeness of Dungeon Siege.This is one of those sadly under-rated classics which should be much better known, Give it a good shot and you'll see why.I'll be the first to admit that it's pretty ugly, even by standards of the time, but that's OK. The story isn't as well executed as BG, but better Than most Dungeon bashers. Voice acting is minimal, but competent, just enough to give a little flavour and highlight major plot points.What you get, though, is A HELL of a dungeon basher, Amazing atmosphere and tension a load of options for selecting your squad and what skills and equipment they take with them, and a horde of enemies more than capable of taking you down if you get sloppy. Watch every step, keep an ear out for ambient sounds which may be clues of a coming ambush, and don't rush in to grab loot unless you're sure your exit is clear!RPG aspects are a bit like the Elder Scrolls series, you get better at what you do most, and the skills that go with that. Eventually your squad will be moulded to your play-style, although some party members for hire have clear advantages in one field or another.If you like dungeon bashing RPGs and haven't tried this one, why not?

												Great game. A lot like diablo. Dungeons are not instanced, so there is no loading. Its somewhat limited thought. Magic isn't elemental. Fire monsters take as much damage by fire spells as ice monsters. Its somewhat imbalanced, melee is overpowered. The party system and mules are awesome. I just love being able to control a party of heroes instead of only one, but at the same time not a whole army. It is like playing a truly rpg pen and paper by yourself where you control the whole party, or only one hero if you wish. Its not perfect, limited in a lot of aspects, but overall a very enjoyable game with unique features (afaik).			"

												Dungeon Siege was the first game created by Gas powered games. Founded by Chris Taylor, who created such beloved games like Total Annihilation.Dungeon Siege is a party based rpg. You play as a humble farmer who has his/her farm attacked by an evil race called the ""Krug"". Taking it upon themselves, you then go from town to town ridding the land of whatever evil you find on a journey to destroy the source of it. The plot to Dungeon Siege isn't particularly interesting nor particularly fleshed out or focused upon. It's a background distraction that serves to get you from place to place.What Dungeon Siege excels at is in the gameplay department. The entirety of the experience of Dungeon Siege is unabridged. It takes place in a world completely without loading screens. Even while transitioning from the overworld to dungeons. This is by far the most impressive thing the game does and it feels very authentic. Dungeon Siege feels like an odyssey, where you are constantly moving forward on a trek. It is also absurdly long and has an enormous amount of content with its optional multiplayer campaign (which is double the length of the singleplayer) and has an expansion pack which adds even more to the playtime. The levelling system is very similar to something like Elder Scrolls, all of your stats level up based on using them. And levelling itself is automatic. Indeed the only real thing you can directly control with your character is what equipment they have and what spells they can use. This makes gameplay very fast and aside from fiddling with your inventory in shops, you spend little time outside of combat. Dungeon Siege is a kind of mindless game at times. A lot of the combat feels very automated and you mostly just run in and watch your guys smack the enemies around for a little while and then loot bodies, very similar to older rpgs like Ultima. But this is one of the most memorable aspects of the game overall. It's a very comfy game where you just move forward on a journey as your guys pummel the crap out of everything.			"

												Dungeon Siege is an old isometric action-RPG. It was quite original for the wanna-beat-Diablo game of year 2003, but now it can attract only a small group of players with the taste for ""old-school games"". With the slight remark that DS is not as much old-school, being just an Arpg (with emphasis on Action and not RPG).However, for an action-rpg it has very promising setting, with the story based on the heritage of the legion of a great empire, lost in the world of magic, and, the most noticeable - the clever system of character grading, where you ""levelling"" your heroes only when using specific skills. Shoot the bow - become dexterous archer, cast spells - and take a gain in ""intelligence"" and magic power. Or, well, just bash'em all with a stick or shovel - as you start your adventure with the ""child of farmer lost his home"" background.Other than character evolution, Dungeon Siege ""key features"" are not likely to take your interest, as following the story turns out too thankless task. Well, unless we return to the levelling system - as there you can hire companions (up to 7) and train them to fit your tactics. So you can gather a somewhat standard band, like 2 melee, 2 archers, 2 mages, 2 healers... or to mix all the roles at your leasure. You can even hire 7 mules to carry your stuff, and fight your way all alone... if you that attracted to the DS, which I doubt.Oh, well. Do I like Dungeon Siege? Sure, it brings some memories, and it is still not bad, if you know the drill. The interface was fine back in time, and it is still quite easy to get along. Although... the gameplay not aged that well, for my tastes. What was quite alright in time between Diablo 1 and 2, now feels... too plain. Bland even.Can I recommend it to the people who are new to the plethora of games, made more than 10 years back? Barely. People, who started to play in time of Mass Effect rising, certainly will be having hard times motivating themselves to play Dungeon Siege I. It was good back then, but now... now it's worth buying only if you know already what you're getting yourself into.Nostalgia project, with personal mark 7/10 - for the fun time back in the days. It was nice while it lasted.			"

												THIS GAME IS SO FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!Not kidding! The game is addicting and fun. its one of the first and best RPGs i have ever played and i still love playing it to this day!Now on to the official reviewing:Pros: ➴ More than 100 Varieties of armor and weapons➴ Each weapon and armor has a specefic rarity that makes every item diffrent and unique from one another➴ A whole world generated for you! no portals or teleported entrences. your whole world is spawned right infront of you➴ Each village or outpost you come to has a Blacksmith, a Priest, and some mercaneries-for-hire that meet almost all your needs. Some NPC's are in hostile areas that sell both priest and blacksmith items➴ Fight through hordes of mosnters, tons of dungeons (part of the title right?), and ALOT of mini-bosses that drop Loot like loot you find from a chest➴ Mega bosses in story and multiplayer campaigns that drop rare or legendary loot➴ you can spend hours playing this game. its literelly addictingCons:➴ Some grinding required➴ Game maybe a little bit too difficult➴ Story might be confusing if your not paying attention to itNot much cons here right? Thats because this game is the best and its hard for me to say any bad things about it. anyway, you should learn more about the game so i will tell you.Dungeon Siege is an RPG game that features tons of mosnters, NPC's, and fun content that keep you going for hours. You can level up all the way to 150! You have 4 diffrent skills which you can upgrade. You can be tons of diffrent classes based on the skills you upgraded. You can get magic items based on the rarity:➴ Normal (No Color)➴ Magic (Blue)➴ Exotic? (Brown)➴ Rare (Purple) ➴ Legendary (Yellow)In the singleplayer campaign, you can buy mercaneries-for-hire and packmules to come along with you in your adventure to find out why humanity is being attacked by other races they allied with. You are a farmer who goes on a marvelous (and yet long) adventure to find out why Huminity is threatened and crush the threat before it destroys humanity. You can customize your own character before you play the game and you can import your singleplayer campaign characters into multiplayer campaign.Thats all i have right now. i hope this review is helpful			"

												[My steam total is much less than I've actually played since you can play offline without Steam connection.  EDIT: Game is of quite sufficient length.  Longest mazes I've ever played.]Fun game from 2002.  I started as a huge Diablo 2 fan.  I'm catching up and enjoying the era of now-cheap RPG/action games before upgrading my system to run more modern games.   Just so I don't spend before I really need to.  (currently a Radeon X-600)  This includes the Dungeon Siege series + Fallout, Torment, Torchlight 1/2, Baldur's Gate, Titan Quest, Morrowind, Oblivion ...before hitting Skyrim, D3, etc.  Bottom line: In many ways, this fits in the older era.  -- So, those are your ganeral Action/RPG + hack/slash comparisons.** Graphics:  It's 3-D.  Steam graphics are representative.  Sure, it's dated, but that doesn't ruin the game for me.** Team: You can manage 8 characters drawn from three general classes from which you can customize: Melee, ranged, mage.   Two kids of mages: Combat, Nature.  Former is mostly offensive; the latter mainly includes healing spells, etc.   Buffs and spell selection are typical.  ** Multiplayer: No multiplayer anymore. ** Loot: Regular items for purchase and souped up loot (some has tradeoffs).  One of your 8 chars can be a moving mule: non fighting with 3 times inventory.  ... One /very/ cool minor feature is casting a ""transmute"" spell that turns items into gold on the spot at a fraction of the value.  Thus, there's no need to leave loot unless you want to leave mapping markers or don't want to bother with the super-cheap stuff.  Obviously, take the valuable stuff, right?  :)** Overview of Attributes with examples: 3 areas: Strength (perks: melee combat damage, eventually wear better armor), Dex (ranged damage), Intel (mana pool, spell damage, mage armor).  -- Dex provides minimal advantages.** Character development is actually more complex than usual.  Use a melee weapon, you build strength.  -- but you also gain a slight boost in dex and a very slight intel boost.  Reverse is true.  This enables your ranged character to VERY gradually build strength for slightly better armor.  Although you delay advanced specializion perks, I like a little flexibility.[EDIT: Recommendation: Specialization for fighters.  Don't broaden their attributes/abilities beyond strength.  ...Be very cautious about mage/fighters.]  ** Replayability?  The only replayability factors would be different party composition, which IMO is little to none.  No randomness at all.  I think it's a great one and done.** Monsters: Once you clear an area, the monsters don't respawn.  I expect that next game, they'll be in the same place.** Other: You can remap keys like a bandit.  Haven't even explored all the options.  Raise/lower difficulty.  Standard quests.  Quick save along the way.  Secret areas that aren't easy to find without advice?  You can get an overview map, but it does NOT show caves since they're underground.  Sometimes unlit areas aren't obvious, both of which are authentic and nice touches.  I'll investigate mods later, if they exist.EDIT: Just completed the game (12/12/14).  This game has a let-down for an ending.  Still worth the purchase, but oh my goodness, Steam version has removed all sense of closure!  Does this matter?  Think of it as a 98% great game, and subsequently see a therapist for any emotional damage.** Advice: If you like the standard old ARPG like the above, get this game.  Cheap Steam bundles are occasionally available at humblebundle, gamersgate, bundlestar, etc.  Probably will hit gog soon if you want no DRM. Thanks for reading.			"

												Value!Having only played the first game, the addition of the other two titles in the Dungeon Seige complete pack was very welcome, even more so thanks to the expansions included, but the cost of the pack is justified easily by virtue of the quality game that the Original is.Bursting with atmosphere, Dungeon Seige is a 3D take on the Diablo 2 model, though with fixed level layouts. Dungeon Seige is a long game - you progress across the world map seamlessly and you easily notice the distances that you are chewing up, as key towns are few and far between. The experience of this game is probably more akin to the idea of a Lord of the Rings type quest than anything more computer-game/zone-based, because as I have mentioned before you really get the feeling that you are blazing your own path, one that only occasionally intersects with civilization. Echoing ice caverns full of crystal avatars fill you with apprehension as the prospect of questing for hours without seeing the light of day is very real and a gameplay element in itself, and once you escape a gruelling forest zone midway through the game you are confronted with a seemingly impassable swamp, rather than the stereotypical sunny metropolis populated with traders.Dungeon Seige is also a difficult game - an example being the afore-mentioned swamp which pits your squad - albiet experienced and doughty - against hordes of difficult creatures marshalled by witches and targetting your most vulnerable members.The difficulty of the game, and the sheer distances of travel involved, is counterbalanced by the joys of a steadily improving squad. You have the choice to ally yourself with various squad members - more than you can ever hold in your total squad, in a feature that reminds one of the Baldur's Gate series and adds to the sense of blazing one's own path - and you can't wait for your hitherto skinny and ragged heroes and squad members to stumble across great shields, shiny helmets or keen longswords. Improving your skills relies simply on using related items - keep using a one handed longsword and a mini experience bar built in to your 'melee item' combat slot will reflect your character's steady improvement in it's use, ditto for ranged, nature and fire spells.In summary of this ragged and ill-formatted review (for which I beg your forgivness - I am partially distracted) I assure you that this game is a worthy investment of time and emotion - love your squad, covet your packmule, listen to every word of pre-recorded dialogue and seek out all encounters, because you are living through a bonafide high fantasy advanture, and it does, eventually, end.

												Dungeon Siege was a great hack nslash dungeon crawler RPG when it was released and the mechanics are still solid even today, although the graphics have dated poorly.The reason I do not recommend is that it is unplayable via steam and does not include the expansion pack Legends of Aranna.There are a few guides that purport to help you run the game via the steam installation and although I've spent numerous hours following them to the ""T"" and reinstalling the game, it still does not work on Windows 8.1. (The hour I've spent ""playing"" was logging into the game on multiple occasions to see if it would work)If possible try and get the original digital discs or make iso's of your original discs and play the game that way not via the steam copy.

												One of the most greatest games of my lifetime. I will never forget the classical RPG gameplay that this game has provided, with its adventurous and wonderous story and setting. I've enjoyed this game ever since it had came out and is a must have for people who like this style of gameplay such as this. I am more than excited to know that this game had gone on steam, but its missing (personally) my favorite features, like the expantion to it and the multiplayer. But maybe theres some multiplayer provider out there for this game still, just takes time to look around.			"

												*sigh*A decade ago, I played this game so much my grades in high school suffered.  When I saw that the game was on steam, I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to relive the memories of this excellent game.I bought the game.  I just didn't GET the game.The game would probably run, if it weren't for crippling compatibility issues that result in random crashing.  However, Steam, in their infinit wizdom, DISABLED THE MULTIPLAYER ENTIRELY.  Seriously.  Main menu. Click Multiplayer. You're greeted with an ugly (not skinned at all) and rude dialog box that simply says ""DISABLED"".  That's it.  Nothing.I bought this game as part of a bundle with Dungeon Siege 2, and Dungeon Siege 3.  Dungeon Siege 2 multiplayer is ALSO DISABLED, and Dungeon Siege 3 isn't even a DS game, in my opinion.  It might have done better if they gave it a different name and didn't try to step in the footsteps of such a great franchise.Seriously, I wish Steam would have just let this entire franchise of games rest in peace.  I honestly would take my money back and return these if that were an option. I feel like I did not get what I paid for. "

 “You must be either a hero or the most spectacular fool I’ve ever had the good fortune to meet.” Dungeon Siege represents a classic squad-based action role-playing game, that covers all bases with style. The accessible gameplay in combination with a broad spectrum of tactical customization allow you to create a team adapted to your own needs, offering plenty of variation and replayability. Even by today’s standards it remains a decent example of original dungeon crawler game. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												Classic game that most likely won’t win over new players. This game is more of a party manager than anything else. You will be managing formations, spells, and potions for your entire group. The game progresses in a linear fashion revealing lore unique to the Dungeon Siege world. At the time of its release the graphics were top notch. I still enjoy some of the environments until this day. For some reason the ending cut scenes were removed and the expansion is absent. I’m sure licensing issues are why the expansion aren’t included. Multiplayer is also stripped away. There are steps to replace the content found in the Steam community. Overall I have a level of nostalgia attached to this game that still brings me back to play every so often. If you like reading fantasy lore, managing your party, and sorting through loot, this might be your game.			"

												Love this game. It is a classic. However, if you are running a modern system it will probably crash at some point. Whether that is during game play, or after you save your first game, shut down, and then try to load again, something will go wrong. This game isn't really supported well so you will need to hunt down fixes online to make it work. If you do get it to work, good on ya! If you don't, well, you were warned. I do wish Steam would make a bigger effort when allowing these types of older games onto the sytem to support them and make sure they work always.			"

												This game is wonderful. Released back in 2002, I learned about this game through a cousin of mine, and I fell in love with the game. Spending well over 500 hours into its singleplayer and online multiplayer (now defunct -- LAN works great though), I never realized how much I would come to miss this game. A classic dungeon crawler where you're not limited by classes or levels. You can be whatever you want, a pure melee character, an archer, a mage, a combination of two, or all of the above. You have the ability to choose how you level up your skills. Instead of levels, there's strength, dexterity, and intelligence. These act as your levels towards what you want to use in combat, and progressively increase through combat. This is different from the timeless classic of Diablo 2, however has a great leveling system that's sure to let you play however you'd like. The storyline is wonderful, and with co-op multiplayer, it adds on more difficulty so your not running around finding too easy. Unfortunately, this doesn't come included with Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, but if you happen to have a copy, you can install it over Steam's installation (plus with a little renaming of game executables) and be able to play it through Steam.One of the downsides is that since its been over 11 years that Dungeon Siege has been released, multiplayer is now defunct. In Dungeon Siege, you'll find that the Multiplayer button gives you the message ""Disabled"". Is all hope lost? Of course not. By adding the launch parameter ""zonematch=true"" to your game, you can access multiplayer LAN and direct connection games without the use of warez, cracks, or patches. Its a shame that you need to bypass that message just for direct and LAN capabilities, but it gets the job done, and it still works perfectly. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of dungeon crawlers, especially playing them with friends, and for those who are looking to try something new. It's not hard to get the hang of, but it won't get too easy on you either.			"

												NOTE: this game as far as I can tell is one of the most sporadic games on Steam. For some people, the game doesn't work at all. Others cant play in high resolutions, others can't get the multiplayer to work, and others can't get the expansion to work. I personally was able to get the game running (turn your shadows down btw) flawlessly, and I was able to bruteforce anti aliasing with Nvidia control panel, so the game looks great for 2002. Your mileage will more than likely vary.Dungeon Siege is a fantasy ARPG with the blandest ♥♥♥♥ing story in gaming history. First off, this game basically plays itself. My party consists of 6 melee characters and I just send in the tank first into a fight and watch 6 characters beat the snot out of monsters while I hit a hotkey to make some people heal every now and again. It feels like an arcade game, where it's pretty god damn easy a lot of the time, but every now and again has a difficulty spike to ♥♥♥♥ you up.Aside from the fact that I've won many fights without even pressing anything, and has almost 0 strategy, this game is fun as hell. If your fun comes from winning challenging fights through tactics and strategy, you won't like this game. If you like to just watch a bunch of guys beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of monsters for a minute, then grab loot, and repeat for an hour or so, you'll love this game. The best part about this game imo is that its a journey. You walk down a pretty linear path, with your party consisting of up to 8 people including pack mules, into different environments, killing♥♥♥♥♥♥in caves, and finally hitting a town after a few hours to unload all of those nifty lil items you got from the monsters you mugged. Then you do this bunch more times and you eventually win. Hey, if you enjoyed watching your crew beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters for like 10-15 (tbh i forgot how long this game is) hours, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. Theres a wonderful man who published a guide on how to get Legends of Aranna singleplayer expansion for the steam copy of Dungeon Siege in case yours didn't have it. This is basically more of the same, just going down a road beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of monsters with a new gang, but in different environments.Hey, if you enjoyed the expansion pack or the main campaign, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. This game has a ♥♥♥♥in multiplayer mode with IP and LAN methods of connection, so you and I think 7 other people can go around a NEW world thats much more open than either of the singleplayer campaigns, and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of monsters for a while. The multiplayer map is roughly 2x as big as the main campaign's map, and is much more open. I have beaten the multiplayer with someone and it was great. I haven't tried any, but there are mods that allow you to play the multiplayer campaign, solo, with a full squad of 8 characters.Its a pretty mindless journey of an ARPG, but if you want to just watch 1-8 people mug monsters for loot for a while, or do it with some buds, this game is great. Just remember this game does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants in terms of it functioning.			"

												This is mostly a nostalgia driven review and as such you probably should take that into account before blindly following this recomendation.First of all I'm basing this review on my first experience when as a 13 year old I received this videogame as a christmas gift from my parents. When I first got to play it I was blown away cus it was an action game with some Age of Empires control schemes and I loved the setting, the exploration bits and slaughtering monsters all over the place with my weapons and party, so I decided to get the whole package again when I saw an offer here 13 years later and due to the holidays getting closer I felt nostalgic to play it again and I feel pretty much everything I enjoyed from it is back, minor a few things.Would I recommend it? yes, it's a fun game with an interesting control scheme however it has a glaring flaw to it and that is that the game once completed it offers NO REPLAY VALUE at all			"

												Well...how should i put this.Dungeon siege has everything i could want in a hack and slash rpg with a big spectrum of things to doI started playin this back in 2005 and i have never regreted looking for a copy of this game at a retail store in lincoln.So whats great well first, id like to get this out of the way the main reason i love dungeon siege is the fact that you can command an army of 8 soldiers( 16 if you count summoned creatures). second when it comes to most hack and slash games they come to a point to where you are just grinding for hours on end and it almost feels like a job to finish what you started. that cannot be said about Dungeon siege, further more id like to point out that this stands between a cross country sim and a VERY long map game. What this means is that once you start the game you are in for the journey of a lifetime as this game has the whole map connected throughout. So if you want to walk back well its about 20 mins both ways through each town. Yes each place is checkmarked with a town so it is convenient yet a pain to walk back...just keep going. And fourth yes the COMBAT, the combat in dungeon siege game focuses on four classes melee fighter, archer, nature mage and combat mage. each has its own sets of advantages and weaknesses mostly the magic but its fun as hell to experiment with. (Imo the best class is the archer to an extent) That said dungeon siege is my alltime favorite h/s rpg of the century, it tops any other for 2002 if you can name one. One thing i cannot leave out is the graphics, because for 2002 these graphics are really well done for a dx8 game. The scenery the weather and the atmosphere are perfect for this game. So thats how i feel about dungeon siege a game that gives me nostalgia everytime i play it.Hopefully you will get as much fun as i did out of it.  p.s. i still love this game to DATE. "

Product received for free
												Dungeon Siege is a classic RPG and I always get nostalgic playing it. When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens - you just constantly walk through one giant map. There's not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.One thing I originally liked about the game was that there aren't any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things - hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While it's nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you don't have an array of special abilities to manage (well, none unless you have a mage). Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it weren't for the nostalgia I probably wouldn't be enjoying as much as I am today.If you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if you're new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay. Now, back to the grindstone.			"

												For the sake of your sanity and free time i'll try to be as short as i can.The fun in this game : is when you have your squad of warriors mages archers et cetera and the beatdown of the enemy begins. Its also♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to reach that point before getting bored because by the first town (30-40 minutes in) you get a second party member for free and you can hire another at one of the local shops. And from that point onwards you constantly meet new people until you max the total party member slots which are 8. But hey if you are playing with summons this can be extended up to 16 !Pros :-Huge variety of spells that includes from fireballs to world manipulating magics-Very very good control over your squad , customizing their behavior and attack patterns as you please.-Mules. You get to have mules to carry the loot you cant fit into inventory and would in some other game have to leave behind or constantly move back and forth from town.-More mules. At this point im having two and i believe i can buy a third one.-Great voice acting. Especialy considering this game came out 15 years ago.-You don't just use a potion and your HP goes up. Your character actually CHUGS it. Furthermore they don't drink it all ,just as much as they need and the rest stays in the inventory to be used later.-You can press R and distribute all potions between party members without having to manually give them as many as they need. And characters that use magic automaticaly get more mana potions.-Theres a guide that shows you how to update to the latest version ,fix all bugs easily and run on any desired resolution which i will link below. Currently im running it between 70 and 120 fps.Cons:-The story doesn't say a lot but its definitely there and you can always find more about it via books in game. Not a very big deal but it could be a little better.-The soundtrack. Its good but very unfiting ,if you mute the sfx and just listen to it you'll notice.Honest truth about the soundtrack-In multiplayer you can have only one character and the sense of squad comes from other players. There are mods though!The only guide you need :Killah's GuideI'd give this game a solid 7.5/10And a tip to younger players : Don't bash on an old game you can't run. Theres always a way. And remember to always check the guides before playing 90s and 00s games			"

												Dungeon siege is a classic hack and slash with some RPG elements to it. By the time it was released, it was a technological and gameplay marvel, but for today's standards, it's a very bland and generic fantasy game that has some cool mechanics, but poor depth.Graphics have aged very poorly, but the animations are very tight and still an impressive feat considering the game's release date.Gameplay is a strong point, with an ""innovative"" (it was back in the days) party management system and class/job experience system.Story is poor, very poor. Voice acting is ok, but since the story is so generic, it does not shine.Music is very good. I think it is the early work of a now-famous game composer.The game has two glaring flaws: 1) it drags its content too much, too slowly, making the pace of the game very troubling; 2) the Steam version DOES NOT COME WITH THE EXPANSION, Legends of Aranna (for reference, you can download it in the internet, just search for Dungeon SIege Steam Fix).Overrall, I  recommend the game for old fans and for new gamers who would like to experience ""historic""games, such as this one, if only for the discovery.

												EDITED: While the game initially has multiplayer disabled there is a guide that allows you to access the multiplayer menu in the steam guides.  Just follow the instructions by accessing the Network option and having Hamachi.  If you want to play single-player in the network you can do that as well as the benefit of multiplayer is you can have more enemies to kill.I've changed this because of what I have discovered.  It makes me happy.  However, I still find it ridiculous, and annoying, that they disabled the multiplayer menu where what they should have disabled is their matcmaking and internet options.			"

												This game is my entire childhood. Played it non-stop with my brother and some friends in multiplayer... Imagine my disapointment when I found out that the steam edition doesn't have multiplayer.Pros:- Music is perfect. Some of the best video game music ever made.- The atmosphere is very immersive and a real joy to rediscover.- Still packs a good challenge.Cons:- Doesn't support today's typical resolutions.- Controls/Camera is little meh.(not too bad considering the original release date, but not up to par with today's standards)- NO MULTIPLAYER!

												Graphics Siege - The War Against WindowsThis is potentially a great game, however, it doesn't work for many people with later versions of Windows (esp 8.1) and the multiplayer is currently disabled.  Added to that is the fact that the game is unsupported outside of the community, and you end up with a real risky purchase.  I'd say just look elsewhere until the game is reliably working unless you happen to have an older computer / OS.			"

												Windows 7 review (Prepare for a messy review) - Over 100 hours non-steam:Dungeon siege is an old series of 3d hack and slash games,very fast paced this one being from 2002 that made me start gaming on pc and brought me here where I am today. Of course the graphics are out dated but who really cares when the game brings you so much content that's enjoyable. There are A LOT of items in this game with different rarities ,there are 2 shops in every town and area so you can get better gear. You can be a warrior,an archer,a mage (nature or combat magic) or a hybrid determined by strength - warrior,dexterity - archer and intelligence - mage. You have the option to take other characters with you but I think they're a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(you can steal items from the ones you get for free then leave them there hue hue hue), I like to be alone and strong. I always play as a warrior because that's what I did back in the day. A playthrough will last way more than 15 hours if you actually take a look at the game because it actually has secrets , easter eggs and puzzles that are pretty fun and they reward you with rare items. It actually has co-op multiplayer but I don't have much to say about it since I only tried it like 2 times and I didin't get to finish the game, it may not work. If you're playing for the first time you may want to play on medium because it's the most enjoyable difficulty. The game has different mobs and bosses for each area  you are in so you don't have to fight the same creatures for the entire game, you don't go back so you'll only see new places. You can play at 1920x1080 there are guides on steam about how to do it, also there is a DLC for this game called legends of the aranna and you can find guides for it as well easily, I really recommend the DLC because it's another campaign that lasts A LONG TIME as well, more than 7-10 hours anyway. The review is more for the game than the steam version but you can get this game on sale for less than 3 dollars.. just buy it.And remember... ALWAYS SAVE THE GAME EVERY 10 MINUTES!			"

												Dungeon Siege is an RPG masquerading as an ARPG, blending the best features of each genre:1) It offers a party composition system that is reminiscent of Baldur's Gate. You can hire key NPCs into your party as you meet them. You share weapons and loot among 6 characters at a time.2) Similar to The Elder Scrolls, you gain skill ability by actually using skills, not as a pickable reward for gaining levels. Love this.3) Lots of side quests.4) Lots of hacky-slashy gameplay, and a breezy lightness to the whole thing.Today, you will need to look past the dated graphics, but this is a solid game.Be warned that Dungeon Siege requires a little effort to get running on a modern computer. As delivered from Steam, you'll get crashes and black screens. I was able to find what I needed in the Steam Forums, though, to get it running on Windows 7 at 1920x1080 resolution. "

												I don't play a lot of games now a days. I believe although that I have scorned genres that could please me. This click-to-move-click-to-attack RPGs fall in those games. I loved torchlight 2 when i played it. And I this game resembles torchlight 2 a lot. However, it is PARTY-BASED-RPG, where you get to control multiple party members.At the price this is available now(Dungeon Siege Collection, includes I, II and III), it is a must have, even if, like me, you dislike the genre.For playtime, I have played this game for 8 hours in the first two days, which is kind of a lot for me nowadays.Strongly Recommended!

												This game is unplayable for me and countless others - possibly for you too.Dungeon SIege is a blast of nostalgia for me, and I've played it numerous times over the years. As wear and tear seems to have finally claimed my hard copy of it, I decided to purchase the steam version.And then it crashed. Everything seemed fine up until the opening cutscene - which displayed weird texture glitches - but that stopped when the cutscene ended. As did the entirety of the game. After a quick search and about half an hour playing around with suggested methods, I managed to stop it from crashing. Except those texture glitches were still there, popping in and out in countless places all over the screen. So, back to the forums with me. There's lots of genuinely helpful guides online, all of which touting the same 3 or 4 basic fixes; but none of these worked for me, or for countless others. I patiently tried these fixes, and various combinations thereof, but there's been no change whatsoever. This game might work for you, in which case you'll almost certainly have a great time playing it. But the level of detail I've had to go into to simply stop this game from crashing is outrageous, and even then the product I'm left with is unplayable. It is, in this state, a total waste of time and money.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games. I've played it through several times, and as a fantasy RPG/dungeon crawler, this game gets just about everything right. You start off as a solo adventurer fighting mobs, and looting treasure and weapons. Along the way, you meet more adventurers that join you in your quest. Ultimately, you end up with a party of six, and you choose how you want each person to develop their fighting style.Other D&D-style games like Baldur's Gate have a very steep learning curve, and are heavy on the player maintenance. I think that Dungeon Siege strikes just the right balance between playability and maintenance.			"

Anyhow, laters i got Krug to slay.			"

												I played the original RPGs a long time ago on my Commodore 64.  Bard's Tale, Wizardry, Ultima, Might and Magic... the games that started it all.  Then a great many years passed before I revisited the RPG, in fact, it wasn't until MMORPGs came about that I fell in love the with genre all over again.Playing through Dungeon Siege I felt like the dots had been connected between the old school RPG and the modern MMO.  I bought 1, 2, and 3 in a combo pack, but I only played through the first.  I played through it entirely, and enjoyed the trip down memory lane.  I'm going to recommend it, it's a good a game and deserves a thumbs up, but you'll likely only enjoy it for the nostalgia if you're old like me, or as a history lesson if you're a youngster.  It's probably the oldest RPG I can imagine any one enjoying playing through start to finish.			"

												Enjoyed many aspects to this game and the graphics held up alright many moons later. The story wasn't the most interesting and the hardest part of the game was figuring out a way to balancing your party as there is limited foes and experience points out there to share-- once that was figured out, it was fairly easy afterwards with a few challenging parts. The music is very comfy and familiar, the loot was interesting, and the environments as well as enemies were varied and often intriguing. For a game call Dungeon Siege, I can't recall going thru more than a couple of actual dungeons, but I guess Rolling Valley & Swamp Siege doesn't roll off the tongue well. The game didn't seem to have any bugs, though sometimes I had to switch resolutions so it would fit properly, but that might be an OS thing anyway. If you like RPGs with multiple party members you can use simultaneously, you will most likely have a good time. Considering it's age, the game is great value at 5 dollars or less.			"

												From the getgo, Dungeon Siege has been my very favorite game, standing the test of time for over ten years.  It is a gem in the rough, lackluster hack 'n' slash genre.  Some of it is nostalgia, sure, but most of all it is a quality that whispers softly to those that will listen.The most accurate and common description praises Dungeon Siege as being atmospheric.  The music from the now esteemed Jeremy Soule is top notch, fitting the game's open scenery, environments, dungeons, and caves very well.  The often peaceful music of the open outside landscape fits well in the different environments (wood, snow, desert, swamp, etc.) and contrasts with the sudden tense quiet of many caves and dungeons.The other thing about Dungeon Siege, which I mentioned, is that it rises above the rest of the genre, simply.  Other games feel like an endless cycle to get a quest to go in this cave where you kill an unremarkable boss and destroy the crates only to find yourself looking at a bunch of junk.  So much junk.  And then the only thing you ever equip are the occassional super items that the boss happened to drop for your class.Ok, so Dungeon Siege is also an endless cycle of wading through the countless monsters, minions, and grunts of the local denizens.  But what Dungeon Siege does is a journey on a highly linear path that winds through the wilderness of those monsters.  It's the same in the sense that it's another screen full of those enemies and you gotta punch through them.  But it really makes you feel relieved as you emerge from that dungeon and think, ""wow, that was a long dungeon, I'm really glad I got outta there.""  The crate and barrel smashing is not as dull when they may explode, breaking others in the radius, and arrow traps.  Seriously, when is the last time a crate fired an arrow at you?Enemies will spawn from bushes on the side of the path.  Tiny swarms of little spiders skitter from passages on the ceiling to rush you.  They ambush you from grating in the floor and in the wall.  Small mage creatures appear on the edges of the snowy hills.  Ice creatures will shatter their frosty pillars and surge toward you.  Goblins go at you with...oops no spoilers.Although it may get tedious (if you let it) at times, you lead a party of up to eight(!) adventurers.  The story is the same cliche but I think executes it well.  It is however, sparse and far between.  Most of the game is in the journeying bit.  My favorite dialog from this game from a cranky mountain shopkeeper (maybe it's just me):""Who are you then?!  Another of that short goblin's cussin' errand runners?  You tell that little green snotball...""The graphics are quite dated, and if you aren't someone who played games from the 90's period, you may not think they look good.  However, the environment still has a lot of detail that you might not realize at the first impression.I recommend playing this game for between two and five hours in a session, although I have been guilty of spending ten hours for several days.  If you enjoy the genre, I believe Dungeon Siege is a great pick.  Although the age of the game is apparent (there are no abilities), the sequel, Dungeon Siege 2, is also very good and has includes those more modern ideas in the gameplay.			"

												One of my all time favorite games as a kid.  This game doesnt have a very in depth story due to its age but the gameplay and constant excitement of leveling and finding new spells or companions keeps me going.  The soundtrack feels epic and never any loading screens other than the first making the game feel relaxing to play.  My only advice is to not be frightened by the single plaeyer character creation since you play the game zoomed out quite a bit and don't see the characters face much.			"

It's huge shame.- compatibility issues (exceptions) with Windows version > 7By luck, you can restore manually compatibility & multiplayer. See guide below.- no editor to create your own contentTheorically you should'nt support Square Enix because they ruined all DS version on Steam compared to boxed version.III) GUIDE to force compatibility & multiplayer :__guide beginning__1) Compatibility-- In DS directory --(should be something like Steam\Steamapps\common\dungeon siege 1\) :- force DungeonSiege.exe to be launched as ""Windows XP SP2 compatibility""- run DSVideoConfig.exe, change video driver settings as ""Primary Display Driver"" avoiding any TnL option. Cancel shadows as well because they are often problems in-game with modern hardware.-- In your Steam library --right-click on game name and change settings :- uncheck Steam overlay2) Modern screen & multiplayer-- In your Steam library --right-click on game name and change settings in properties :- game launch option, add this command below zonematch=true width=1600 height=1200to force game to be displayed in modern config (replace 1600x1200 by your own screen config)zonematch=true allow only multiplayer, for solo just write zonematch=falsePublic servers are gone, you can only play multiplayer in local.For multiplayer, you must use Tunngle account to force computer to find your friends like they were playing on local with you, because all online multiplayer servers are gone.__ guide ending__IV) GUIDE to install Legend of ArannaEven if you can find such guide on Steam, i don't support it for many reasons :- it's 100% illegal to install software without license. Those who pretend some Steam version can be downloaded with Legend of Aranna included are pure liars. It's illegal content to update Steam version with cracked no-cd version. Square Enix don't own rights about DS1 & DS2 add-ons.- you must replace your exe files to anothers at your own risk- some guide's owners add you as friend, help you to solve all problems about DSLOA install but when it's end, come to beg you for free gift game. NEVER TRUST ANY GIFT. Unfriend these swindlers immediatly because real friend never ask to you something just to help you.V) EVALUATION :Even if this Steam version doesn't include Legend of Aranna, i must admit i take pleasure to play it because i'am real fan of this serie (i talk about DS1 & DS2, DS3 is only pure joke and won't be DS game).[Good]- easy real-time Hack'n'Slash without need of gear optimization to play it- 4 classes to play : Warrior (melee+shield), Archer (ranged), Mage (natural or war)- autoleveling stats depending on which weapons you use, on each up you gain major xp on your main stat depending on weapon your use and full regen HP/mana, on each fight round you receive short xp to increase stas & skills.- progressive difficulty- some hidden areas to discover[Bad]- no tp to city/merchants to sell junk, you must use spell to convert junk or play game as rogue-like getting only essential- no shared stash to share your items between characters (multiplayer)- no mobs respawm in solo game (you must play with limited XP & loots)- no world quest saved in multiplayer (when you quit game, you loose all current quest activated, but it seem possible to do quests each time you log in)- mage classes are pain to play due to lack of active spell slots- only normal difficulty mode- missing content & broken end-game.Buy it only when discounted price like -75% off or less.To be continued (i'am currently testing Steam version fully, i'll update later my evaluation)...

												I think if I had played this game when it first came out I'd have been more into the game, so as a fair warning, this review is from a gamer here and now only recently playing this game.So what are it's problems?  Bloated loot system with no town portal to sell said items, a difficulty step missing between normal and easy (easy is too easy and normal is punishing even at higher levels), scant story and an enviromnment that obscures almost every monster to come your way.  The game almost plays better being constantly on the map rather than the normal top down game mode, the party member's battle AI is atrocious, the pathing is specious at best.  Traps are either very deadly or inconsequential with no in-between.  The textures of everything blend into a hodge podge.  The battles do better than constant pausing (a la Baldur's Gate), which can be done at any time, but is really only suitable for corner cases.  Basically, any advancement that had happened since this game was released casts a pall over the game which I think would have been much more revolutionary at the time than it is now.  It's old school and not in a fun, engaging way, but more of an, ""I'm only hanging out watching my guys fight just in case I need to press the 'heal' or 'mana' keys"" or ""I said kill the freaking wizard/cleric that keeps ressurecting the monsters, you dolts!"" kind of experience.

												Dungeon Siege is a classic RPG and I always get nostalgic playing it. When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens - you just constantly walk through one giant map. There's not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.One thing I originally liked about the game was that there aren't any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things - hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While it's nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you don't have an array of special abilities to manage (well, none unless you have a mage). Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it weren't for the nostalgia I probably wouldn't be enjoying as much as I am today.If you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if you're new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay. Now, back to the grindstone.			"

												Don't mind my hours played, I completed the game multiple times before it even was on steam.This game is, without any understatement, half truths or exaggeration, a great game.One of my fighters was dying too much, so I promplty gave him a bow and, since then, he has become a formidable archer. No re-leveling, no grinding. Yes, he was slighlty worse than he could have been if he started out as an archer, but it's the possibility, and the feasability of such a possibility, that truly elevates this game out of the mediocre bunch for me.That, and the insane amount of spells, armours and weapons the game has. I replayed it just to see them all, and I kept seeing new ones on each playthrough. There will come a point in the game, where you will play only for the satisfaction of seeing your epic iron-clad, fire-casting heroes do battle. You will come back for a ""quick fix"" every evening, because you will suffer from withdrawal. Yes, it's true, because even the slightly dated graphics of the game don't reduce the epicness of it by even a single iota.			"

												The level up system is like runescape where you use that type of attack and level up the associated attributes with use.  Game was amazing as a kid and the combat was a mix of diablo and dragon age.  The game is very dated to be warned and the Jason Stathom movie adaptation is so cheesy you could make a pizza and still have enough for some Mac N Cheese.  Whatever you do dont get the third one though.  Its the tried and true result of someone making the decision that they should take everything that defined the game, throw it out, and try to pass off a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥to its fanbase.  Shout out to that ""Red Rental Box"" for saving me ample money in this current market mindset of bait and switch games.			"

Dungeon Siege has one of the greatest OST (the main one is very catchy..), and I love how inventory works, for it's not one of those inventory system where swords, armors, potions are just 'square stickers'. There are no attribute/skill points. You just keep up with one type of combat for each characters (Melee, Ranged, Nature Magic, or Combat Magic) to level them up.

												Dungeon Siege was one of my favorite games as a kid and after all these years i still love this game+Gameplay: Dungeon Siege is basiclly a Diablo-type like dungeon crawler game, linear, simple but very effective and addictive in my opinion.One of the things that made me fell in love with this game is the fact that you can have a group of 8 people in your party at once.This compined with the Great Ai in the game(for the most part)pretty much skyrockets Dungeon Siege into one of my favorite games of all time.Music: Being composed by the legendary Jeremy Soule Dungeon Siege has a Great Soundtrack overall, defiently fits the areas and environments in the game well. . when your not mowing down tons and tons of monsters that is.Graphics: For the early 2000's this game looked fantastic and i still think i looks great today.~ Story: The Story in this game is . .umm . . very basic(honestly i barley care about the story), while the story is kinda meh the story doesnt really take up much time and doesnt get in way of the gameplay.-This is unforgently one of those games which modern computers have more trouble running it than an old computer would, Square bascilly ported it to Steam with no attempts of making it more compatible for todays computers, i can still run it though without much trouble and some help from the steam forums.The fact that not even the so called ""Complete pack""includes the expansion pack: Legends of Aranna(which is a great expansion pack)Final Verdict: 9.5/10 this is a classic and one of my personal favorite PC games of all time, if you like me love rpgs and you havent played it yet,While the steam version is not the best version of the game i'd definently suggest checking it out dispite the expansion pack missing and the combatability issues with newer Computers.

												This game as well as it's first sequel are classics of their genre. As it is, as sold by Steam, I would not suggest purchasing the game. I played all the way through and what you're getting here is the bare minimum version of the game. It's bugged as it is, and while some glitches can be worked around with enough knowledge and personal tweaking, there are some things, like the missing ending video files after fighting the last boss that prevents you from obtaining his loot, and thelack of access to multiplayer that dampers just about the whole experience. It was fun while it lasted, but there's a better version of the game out there. Also, by default, no Legends of Aranna. Stick to the real deal. Again, I recommend this game and the first sequel, just not the way it's sold here, even if it is dirt cheap right now. Well, you get what you pay for I suppose.			"

												The classic dungeon crawler lives!  Dungeon Siege remains one of the most dynamic, engaging and complex games in its genre and it plays smoother than ever on Steam.  Do not hesitate on this.  The price is great, even when it isn't on sale, and stands high among modern Dungeon Crawlers like Torchlight 2 and Diablo III.  If you are a fan of the genre, this is a must-play.Leveling is smooth and effortless, requiring little maintanence, as skills and stats level through use.  You start as a blank slate, and as you use weapons and spells, your stats and your proficiency in those attack types increases automatically, similar to something like modern Elder Scrolls games.  It's a fluid and fun style.  Add to that the strategy element of having AI-controlled companions fighting alongside you, who can take commands or be set up in formations with proiorities and focuses that you choose based on their stats, with a number of optional playable units to hire from towns and dungeons.This is a fast game, too.  It has all the challenge you would expect from an entry in the genre and encourages exploration and experimentation as you progress through the game.  Do not hesitate to invest in this title.  It is one of the greatest PC games of all time and remains one of my all-time favorite Dungeon Crawlers of all time!			"

												Now a classic and despite the series and fanfare it spawned remains undeservingly without a true spiritual successor. The reviews I've read from my peers thus far are spot on. This little Tactical-RPG was way ahead of its time. Touted as a ""Diablo killer"", clearly inspired by Baldur's Gate the expectations were high (to say the least) upon release. Admitedly though and to no surprise the fledgling developer (at the time) Gaspowered Games may have bitten off more than it could chew (as the title falls short in many aspects of its predecessors). Still this shouldn't deter you from giving it a go as it is a solid piece of work from start to finish.Unfortunately however Steam has failed to acquire the Exanpsions which contain necessary patching and multiplayer is relegated to LAN, TCP/IP, Hamachi or GameRanger. All of these options require time and effort to coordinate play with others rather than being able to just jump right in. Still if you like ARPGs give this one a chance. It should also be noted there were many mods of varying qualities great and small including a couple of conversions such Ultima V & 6 all thanks to the dedicated Dungeon Siege Community -- should you be interested extending the experience.

Somewhere between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, you will control a party and can pause the action at any time, but loot lust and hacking/slashing abound.

												I adore this game. My first Dungeone siege Game was Dungeon siege II and I can see similar gameplay when I play the first one. First time I played I could see where the second game got their mechanics and while this game has a more simplistic version of the second games levelling system I love it!! My first time playing I found it charming but as I contine to play the charm has turned into respect for the team that made the game and love for the game itself. I might be a little biased to my series as the dungeon sige series was one of my first RPG's but 10/10!!			"

												I played the demo for this game back when it was launched and thought at the time ""here is a very good game with good graphics and a different approach to the RPGs"". until then, I had not known the Ultima series, and the continuous fighting instead of the turn based was very new to me.Dungeon Siege is a very good game, it has a balanced skill set (3 primary, 4 secondary skills to develop) and allows te player to use 8 characters in the same party, resulting in a very good way to balance all the skills between the team.Almost at the end of the single player campaign you have a very strong team that smashes and breaks every enemy that crosses your path.On the bad side, the Steam version does not come with the legends of Aranna expansion, which would be a very good  addition to the games available.All in all, it is a very good game to play once in a while. Really recommended			"

												Runs fine on a Windows 10 64x Rig.Naturally there are a few minor tweeks to do before starting your game, but this take no-longer than five minutes to do.Ive finished the game without any crash2desktop moments, and even have it installed on a windows 10 86x machine with crappy intergrated GFX. (it has crashed on the 86x machine, but this is most likely down to bad hardware, not the game).10/10 still lives up to the nostalgia, and still very playable.			"

												Doesn't work. I've tried literally everything, researching for hours on how to get this thing to work. The farthest I've gotten to is when you're about to gain control of the player, but then a ""EXCEPTION DETECTED!"" box shows up and the game crashes. I'm not the only one to have this problem, I actually found almost a dozen forums with people having the same problem. None of them have a solution that worked for me. You'll find a link in some of the other reviews down below. Tried everything in that, didn't work. Disabled Steam overlay, didn't work. Forced it to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP, didn't work. Tried screwing with screen resolutions, didn't work. I have no AV software installed, so that's not intefering. Pretty much tried everything I can think of, didn't work. This game doesn't work. I also bought it foolishly before it was on sale. Thank you Steam, for essentially making me throw seven dollars down the drain.			"

												It's a hack n slash game. I love hack n slash games, I played the hell out of Torchlight 2 and Diablo II back in the day.I played Dungeon Siege for the first time this year and, while I probably would have liked this game when I was a kid (when it came out in 2002, I was 9 years old), I find there is something severely lacking in this game.You basically walk around and kill a ton of enemies and drink potions from time to time, which makes sense, it is a hack 'n slash game after all. But Diablo II was fun. This is not. It feels like the developers added more monsters and made the paths between quest objectives longer so that it could give more length to the game. But it is basically empty. And the storyline is absolutely atrocious.The game is not completely awful, the gameplay is well done. I think it is simply a boring game. I'll still give a try to the other games in the franchise though.			"

												Well, I'm not a big fan of Hack & Slay games in general. But this one added some elements that made it more interesting for me: Semi-automatic attacks instead of clicking marathons (btw bad for your health), strategic elements like several formations, character behaviour configuration, group separation and finally the ability to freeze the game any time to plan your moves and reorganize your party.And there are easy to confiure hot keys on the fly to get e.g. just your melee fighters together for some special tactics.But the balancing is a catastrophe. Dungeons are way too long where you can spend hours seeing the same enemies and building blocks again and again. And the AI behaves pretty stupid. They have a very limited field of view and you can easily wake them up one by one or in small groups even when you are surrounded by them in larger halls. But if you accidentally get into a larger group that hits you a lot: Your health is regenerating very fast. So fast that using health potions is rarily required. And you can find tons of them. Speaking of which there is sooo many loot you can find that it's hard to manage all this stuff and have enough space to get the crap to the next town for sale. Don't let them lie around because they vanish after some time (especially if you change in-/outdoor environments).At least you can have donkeys in your party that have plenty of storage for all your loot. But then you carry even more stuff around that needs to be organized. Furthermore the story presentation is boring and you never have the feeling to care about people you meet. They are so dull. And quests are solved when you just did what you should do. That means you don't have to go back to report... it's like magic. This of course leads to a very linear experience. Also the levels are pretty linear. You can only move in restricted areas, you can't fall down and it's hard to die. Verdict: There are some good concepts in this game but it isn't executed very well so it gets boring after several hours of playing and finally its only annoying. But playing should be fun and never feel like plain repetitive work, isn't it? Because otherwise you should rather start to work on something useful.			"

												Someone made a review about this game saying that it's not playable due to the graphics being a little outdated. Some classic games aren't played because of their graphics, they made sucess back in 2003 because they were innovative and the story and gameplay were satisfying. I'm not talking only about Dungeon Siege.. Prince of Persia the Trilogy is another exemple of a classic game with relatively bad graphics (compared to nowadays). That doesn't make a game bad though. I'm sure that if you haven't played a master piece like Dungeon Siege back in the release year, if you give a real try u'll see what I'm all about here. Everything in this game is good, specially the soundtrack, which is amazing!			"

Although...It has SEVERE compatibility issues (that Valve neglects to mention here) so much so, I have not been able to beat the game (crash loop), its also VERY expensive for a game that came out in 2002.  Buy it when all 3 are on sale, as they often are.  Its online functions have been removed as well, which is fine, but a bit of a shame that we cant connect to friends and not rely on their network. It also has the old school grid inventory sytem, where items take up a random number of slots and if you dont have the right shape available you dont have the room for the item.

												As far as mindless dungeon crawlers go, this is probably one of the better ones although it does show its age a fair bit since its release back in 2002 (graphics-wise, the A.I. and the game's interface isn't exactly optimal).  The story isn't very compelling and isn't really there at all per se.  But if you like dungeon crawling this is the game for you.  I play mostly out of nostalgia.     6/10 (It's alright).  And if you are running Windows 7, be prepared to troubleshoot because this game does have trouble running in the newer systems, not a performance issue, but just getting it to run.  That being said it is fairly simple and getting it to work shouldn't be too much of an issue for most.  Edit: Library > Dungeon Siege > Right Click > Properties > Launch Options > ""width=1280 height=720 fullscreen=true vsync=false maxfps=60 bltonly=true""  For those wishing to play in 1920 x 1080 just change the numbers but be warned that the UI gets really small and unless you have a giant screen, eagle-eye vision or the screen 3-5 inches away from your face you'll have a hard time seeing anything.And the number of hours I've actually played is closer to 250-300ish.  A lot of idle time and many different characters.			"

												It's an old game, but it is still a good game. A massive world to explore, either solo or in your group. Various enemy types, loads of different spells and tons of items to find!  Play singleplayer or multiplayer in a top-down adventure.			"

												Good game, if youre a fan of Diablo or Torchlight and the many other gams in the genre, youll enjoy it.  Although...It has SEVERE compatibility issues (that Valve neglects to mention here) so much so, I have not been able to beat the game (crash loop), its also VERY expensive for a game that came out in 2002.  Buy it when all 3 are on sale, as they often are.  Its online functions have been removed as well, which is fine, but a bit of a shame that we cant connect to friends and not rely on their network. It also has the old school grid inventory sytem, where items take up a random number of slots and if you dont have the right shape available you dont have the room for the item. (even if you have the squares)			"

												As far as mindless dungeon crawlers go, this is probably one of the better ones although it does show its age a fair bit since its release back in 2002 (graphics-wise, the A.I. and the game's interface isn't exactly optimal).  The story isn't very compelling and isn't really there at all per se.  But if you like dungeon crawling this is the game for you.  I play mostly out of nostalgia.     6/10 (It's alright).  And if you are running Windows 7, be prepared to troubleshoot because this game does have trouble running in the newer systems, not a performance issue, but just getting it to run.  That being said it is fairly simple and getting it to work shouldn't be too much of an issue for most.  Edit: Library > Dungeon Siege > Right Click > Properties > Launch Options > ""width=1280 height=720 fullscreen=true vsync=false maxfps=60 bltonly=true""  For those wishing to play in 1920 x 1080 just change the numbers but be warned that the UI gets really small and unless you have a giant screen, eagle-eye vision or the screen 3-5 inches away from your face you'll have a hard time seeing anything.And the number of hours I've actually played is closer to 250-300ish.  A lot of idle time and many different characters.			"

												Pretty good ARPG back in the day.  I believe the only way you'll get this on on Steam is to buy Dungeon Siege III.  If you do buy DS3 you'll not only get DS1 free you'll also get DS2 as well.  Win Win!  Grap DS3 on sale and give DS1 a shot.  Decent for at least a 1 time play through.			"

												A fun classic dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo, but with in depth party management and a better story.  The world is well built, finely detailed and fleshed out.  Explore off of the beaten path and you'll find all sorts of neat little nooks and crannies.  Combat is simple enough for managing a party of brave adventurers on a loot-filled quest, but satisfying.  This is a good, moderately old game.			"

												Although I haven't played Dungeon Siege much yet on my steam install I played through the entire game many time after the original release.  It is an excellent party based live action RPG (although you can pause while you make your character decisions if you want).  It is well worth the purchase for any fans of this style of RPG that may have missed it back in the day.			"

												A classic! Worth playing by itself.But, sadly, it has a bug in the ending.Originally you beat the boss and get the ending cutscene and credits. Then you return and have the option of taking any of your characters into multiplayer.In this Steam version, after boss's death, you'll be immediatly kicked to title screen.That's it: no loot, no ending cutscene, neither credits... Nothing.Here is the (weak) ending:

												This game is the essence of hack n slash. That is literally all you do. It gets very tedious, very quick. Granted, the graphics are very nice for its time and I enjoy them very much. Much of the scenery is very inspired and you can tell they took the time to make it very detailed.That being said, the maps are beyond huge. It's so easy to get lost and it can get very frustrating, quick. If all you want to do is hack n slash. This is definitely for you. The party concept of this game is awesome! You can have 7 people total in your party including a pack mule to carry all of your inventory which is very convenient. You have 3 main skills, Strength, Dexterity and Intelligent. (Swordsman, Bows and Spells).I played roughly 4-6 hours total and got to chapter 4 out of 9 chapters. I also killed and explored EVERY bit of area as I worked my way towards 5, but it's just..so tedious. Honestly, it's fun for what it is and I'm hoping to finish it one day, but no rush. Lastly, the story is fine. It's pretty interesting and the side quests are fun, even though they are just done along the way. The only problem is again, the maps are so insanely huge you might skip it and not even know. Problem with that? No fast travel and if you're a 100% kinda guy. You will be gritting your teeth on the way back from Chp. back to 1.			"

												Just realized I had this and I'm going to go play it later.Dungeon Siege is the most playable Diablo clone out there. It was made before the consolization frenzy, but it's not so old that the graphics make it hard to play.What I love about it is the lack of character classes. In that respect, it is as sandboxy as Elder Scrolls. You gain skill by doing things, which allows you to do them better and equip better equipment. This is the best possible way for an RPG to work and I don't understand why more developers don't do it this way.Speaking of sandboxy, play multiplayer by yourself. Total sandbox with no quests. Very cool. I got lost in a mine for a week. It was awesome.I haven't played DS1 recently enough to comment on controls or sound, but I don't recall having issue with either of them.So I give Dungeon Siege an A. It's my favorite of the franchise.			"

While the multiplayer is disabled, the singleplayer works just fine. Just remember to save frequently, as dying in this game is merciless, and Windows 7 occasionally crashes the game. Other than that, the choices of being a warrior, ranger or two types of mages, or just mixing it up a bit, because you don't need to specifically pick a class, the game provides hours of entertainment. Before you question it, yes there is a difficulty setting, from easy to hard. And honestly, I'm finding Normal to be pretty difficult as it is.			"

												Well, I'm not a big fan of Hack & Slay games in general. But this one added some elements that made it more interesting for me: Semi-automatic attacks instead of clicking marathons (btw bad for your health), strategic elements like several formations, character behaviour configuration, group separation and finally the ability to freeze the game any time to plan your moves and reorganize your party.And there are easy to confiure hot keys on the fly to get e.g. just your melee fighters together for some special tactics.But the balancing is a catastrophe. Dungeons are way too long where you can spend hours seeing the same enemies and building blocks again and again. And the AI behaves pretty stupid. They have a very limited field of view and you can easily wake them up one by one or in small groups even when you are surrounded by them in larger halls. But if you accidentally get into a larger group that hits you a lot: Your health is regenerating very fast. So fast that using health potions is rarily required. And you can find tons of them. Speaking of which there is sooo many loot you can find that it's hard to manage all this stuff and have enough space to get the crap to the next town for sale. Don't let them lie around because they vanish after some time (especially if you change in-/outdoor environments).At least you can have donkeys in your party that have plenty of storage for all your loot. But then you carry even more stuff around that needs to be organized. Furthermore the story presentation is boring and you never have the feeling to care about people you meet. They are so dull. And quests are solved when you just did what you should do. That means you don't have to go back to report... it's like magic. This of course leads to a very linear experience. Also the levels are pretty linear. You can only move in restricted areas, you can't fall down and it's hard to die. Verdict: There are some good concepts in this game but it isn't executed very well so it gets boring after several hours of playing and finally its only annoying. But playing should be fun and never feel like plain repetitive work, isn't it? Because otherwise you should rather start to work on something useful.			"

												I used to play DS1 long time ago, so it has sentimental value to me. Graphics are old, some stuff from moderns rpg games is missing (loot all option, item stats comparision...), middle button for camera rotating is kinda annoying, but the game is still fun to play. And music by Jeremy Soule is very nice. Too bad LoA expansion is not available on Steam.			"

												""HOLY SHÏT, this game is focking AMAZING!"" was pretty much my initial reaction to Dungeon Siege when my best friend showed it to me someteen years ago, and that reaction hasn't faded ever since. Dungeon Siege is to roleplaying/combat-adventure games as RoboCop is to, well... movies, basically. It took the world by storm, and sure, not many might acknowledge it these days, but it's still one of those permanent milestones which just smacked you raw with how great it was and still is, even compared to modern crap. Hell, even being threatened by two horribly shïtty excuses for sequels didn't ruin either of 'em. Hell naw! They just kept on truckin', and everybody with any brains knew this: the original one is the best one. 'Nuff said. 9.5/10			"

												A fun Dungeon crawling adventure! Its not as featured as Dungeon Siege 2 but it does feel like an epic campaign.There isn't different areas or waypoints you just keep scrolling on forever which makes the game feel very large. You level up between 4 skills or buy spells so the charecter developement isn't very advanced you will be most focused on a party then a single charecter. This is a classic Hack n Slash you wont regret			"

												I spent many hours playing this with multiple character builds before I got it on steam, lots of fun had. I bought the Dungeon Siege bundle x3 on steam expecting ease of use, functionality and no drama in getting it to work and sorting out CD keys and updates on multiple computers of my family...Started game Multiplayer disabledNot cool.I normally would give this a big thumbs up but the steam version has multiplayer disabled because the online servers are no longer in existence, the problem is that local/LAN has also been disabled along with that for no reason at all other than laziness I guess, because they just disabled the multiplayer menu button in the main menu. Even when I played this by myself I used the multiplayer function so that I could use my characters when I wanted to play with friends and for certain features in the game host settings that were not in singleplayer.So you are better off getting it somewhere else.

												Having played through DS1/2 before a few years ago, I got this as part of a package deal (DS1,2,3) and didn't notice that it didn't include all the DLC/xpacs. The game itself looks pretty horrible on modern hardware. IMHO if you're going to play Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, you play it with all the DLC/xpacs. Even more so if you're going to play it in multiplayer, which simply doesn't work as is in the STEAM version.If anything, they probably bundled this to get people into buying DS3, which is nothing like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2.

												Game keeps crashing... Too many incompatability issues... Despite trying everything I've found on google...Why are you selling games that aren't working Steam?Had it not been for this being in a pack with Dungeon Siege II (Which also has issues, and MULTIPLAYER disabled!)And being in a pack with DS 3 + Expansion...I'd be getting a full REFUND.I'm still thinking about getting a refund to be honest... I feel somewhat ripped off.Firstly; Why take multiplayer OUT of a game? If it doesn't work, make it work!I'm having to play multiplayer on DS 2 through GameRanger using a NON-Steam version of the game...Getting rather fed up and frustrated with steam to be honest...Selling games that don't work -,-"" ripping out multiplayer on some of the best games...Why?

												Just a quick review for the Steam Award Nominations. This is my all-time favourite RPG. Great combat, a lot of variety, has mods and can be played online/in LAN. Beautiful soundtrack and modding adds a lot of playtime even if you can't easily find players to play with anymore. Graphics are still fine, but you'll need to tweak the settings quite a bit on newer operating systems and GPUS to be able to play.			"

												Of a truth, this game is a classic.  Support 10/10This game is very old but is now on steam.  Therefore I give support for this product a 10 because the developers never stopped supporting it. Graphics 7/10Graphics are not bad.  In some ways they are slightly above average. Sounds and Music 7/10Music and sounds are average. Gameplay 9/10For its genre the game is nothing less than a classic.  I therefore give it a 9. Fun 9/10Oh yes!! This game is awesomely fun to play.   Price:  Worth every penny I paid for it!Bugs and Execution:  There are a few bugs in the swamp area so save often when you get there. Other than that the game executes fairly nice. It is also compatible with win7 if you ahve installed DX9. Overall : This game is a classic action rpg dungeon crawler.			"

This game is inferior to the most masterfully crafted RPG's of old such as Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 in nearly every single respect except one.You can play as a spooky scary skeleton, and for that, its character creation has no equal. 10/10, can recommend.

Posted: August 5, 2014
												Let me start off by saying I really like old school rpg games,  but this game is the epitome of boring.  The dungeons feel overly long, as if they extended gameplay through the sheer length they make your characters walk.  The combat is pretty bland.  I went almost all archers with my squad since, at the hardest difficulty, 1: Melee gets decimated and 2: It costs no resources unlike spells.  It does fairly well but the gameplay is just blah.99% of the item drops fall into 2 categories:  Items you can't wear and Items you can't use.  Either all of the drops have stat requirements that are way beyond what my characters can use or they aren't even close to being an upgrade.  It's almost exclusively vendor trash.Leveling:  It's pretty much a use a skill get some auto xp gains system.  There is no decision making other than what to use.  I chose to focus on a single discipline rather than jack-of-all-trades.  That said, since I am ranged, my armor selection is pretty♥♥♥♥♥since it's based on str and int for useage requirements.  The choices are poor even if I DID have the appropriate attributes to wear said equipment.Quests:  I'm sorry, there are quests?  Basically it's talk to the 3 npcs you'll encounter per chapter then walk linearly through a massive dungeon crawl, completing the quests.  Hardly what I'd call quests.  There's not really even a reward for doing them that I can see.It comes down to this: I am playing this through JUST to beat it and play it, but it's not very fun.  I was hoping for a NWN-type game and it comes off as an overly long poor diablo clone with a bigger party and crappier combat.  My playthrough on the hardest difficulty is basically, set my party to hold/engage freely/strongest target, have them all ranged, then pull with a single guy into range and have the mobs explode.  I move the party about 3 feet then repeat.  Ranged is kind of necessary since even melee die in 3-4 hits and you can get swarmed by 5+ if you aren't careful.  It's a slow slog through dungeons that seem to never end.  Since I bought Dungeon Siege 1, 2, and 3 I am hoping the sequels will be much better.Do I regret buying this?  No, I paid like $2.99 or whatever the super Steam sale was, can't regret that.Do I enjoy this game?  Nope.			"

												I know it says I don't recommend this game... but let me explain why.It's a solid game, really, but it's outdated.  Besides that, the plot AND locations are pretty much identical to Dungeon Siege 3 but the graphics, controls, and AI are much better there.  So get Dungeon Siege 3 instead; you'll be happier with that one.That said, if you really are looking for an outdated party-based dungeon-crawling RPG then this one isn't really a bad choice.  You start out ALONE but you can later recruit other warriors (all AI controlled) and/or donkeys that don't fight but have much more inventory space to carry stuff.  You can have up to 7 or 8 (I forget) people and mules in your group at any time; they all fight on screen together.  There are more recruitable characters than there are spots on your team, too.  A mule and a person take up the same space on your team, so you can either have 2 mules and 6 people, or 1 mule and  people, or 8 people without any mules.  You can only actively control one player at a time but you can switch your choice to another character (even one of the mules) at any time.  You can also give one or several of your party members individual commands, such as telling three people to attack a strong enemy and then telling the other five to stay back and let the mage heal them for a minute.Each character can develop various skills, and it's ENTIRELY up to you which ones to develop.  Warriors can use swords, maces, axes, etc. to smash foes and they use a lot of the strength stat.  Combat mages can hurl fireballs and summon creatures to kill stuff.  Nature mages can heal the party AND they have a few solid attack spells.  At least one nature mage (preferably two) is a MUST.  Both mage types run off of the intelligence stat.  Archers use bows to rain destruction from a distance and they use the dexterity stat.  Honestly though, bows are pretty crappy until you're almost 2/3 done with the game.  Only characters with high dexterity can use a decent bow.  Only characters with high strength can equip decent armor and smash/slash weapons.  Intelligence increases the effectiveness of magic spells; mage skill levels only determine which spells you are allowed to use.There are no ""skill points"" to allocate.  It's all automatic.  You set the type of attack the character will use, and they use that one attack type until you tell them to switch to a different one.  CAUTION:  magic attacks use up magic power (the blue bar) and if you leave mages set to spell attacks they will stand there and do NOTHING until their MP recharges.  So you might have to manually change your mages to archers or warriors when their MP runs low.  Whichever type of attack they use, that's the one that will earn ""experience"" and slowly build up to the next level.			"

												I can't believe that this game has spark a long running franchise. Seriously, before people gave me ""I am too young"" or ""This game was good for its time"", I actually played good action rpg's like darkstone, nox, and the original diablo and enjoyed them. Dungeon Siege should be forgotten, as it has two major flaws with the game.The Bad:1. Easy: The game is too due to having regen health, 40 million health potions throwned at you, and the foes you faced being too damn weak.2. Boring: The game throws several dozens opponents at you on a small map. So every few steps, some might pop out, and you ever kill them or run to attract more of them. But the biggest sin is combat, as melee fighters just auto attack, which leads the game to be walk spot here, sit there as your guys hacks every 200 people on screen.The Good:1. Presentation: The game has good music (because of Jeremy Soule being the composer), very good gwaphix (for its time, really out of date now), and the game is not buggy.Conclusion: Just shock how this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game is beloved by many people, and how this game made a franchise. At least Dungeon Siege 2 and 3 are actually above average games.			"

												Remember that flick Uwe Boll made with the dude from Cannonball Run?  This game is EXACTLY like that.  Cannonball Run dude is running around the Nascar circuit trying to get up Loni Anderson's skirt in the movie, and in the game you're doing...uh,♥♥♥♥♥♥  That may be be Stroker Ace.  I think there was a movie based on this anyways. Maybe it wasn't exactly like the game.  I think I remember Loni Anderson though.  Oh wait, now I remember where I was going this.  This game is a lot like Loni Anderson in that it used to be pretty hot♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it hasn't aged so well.  Still... Action RPG's started with Diablo, but they started to branch out and experiment with Dungeon Siege.  It's a good bit of nostalgia but it's goign to look pretty fugly and the controls we've come to know in Action RPG's have been refined a lot since those days, so it's going to feel a bit weird at first.  But, just like Burt Reynold's 'stache, it'll feel right before long and you'll just go with it because it's warm and nostalgic and tickles a bit in all the right places.			"

												Unable to play on Windows 7, despite a multitude of guides attempting to assist.The crux of it is that the game starts but the mouse is nowehere to be seen which then requires searching the screen with an inseen pointer and waiting for something to highlight to get one's bearings, clicking, the proceeding to the next step. Getting even halfway thtough character creation alone, took roughly 20 minutes. Please don't place something for sale and advertize it is playable for specific operating systems that it likely isn't. Luckily it came in a larger pack but this all just feels like the whole toxic asset trading that led to global economic collapse...albeit on the scale of local frustration.			"

												Game does not work, gets to create character screen and freezes every time.  I have a new system and windows 10.  I'm not interested in troubleshooting anymore.  I'm so tired of buying old games on Steam that always have some kind of compatability problem with new systems and newer versions of Windows, and require a ton of research and tweaking just to run.  I'm just going to ask Steam for a refund and sigh heavily... again.			"

												Best game ever!!! (The origional game which made me fall in love with Rpgs in the first place!!!)> You want to be a fighter? Pick up that rake next to you, swing a few times, get better...> You want to be a shield tank? Pick up that lose board lying in the rubble over there, now go find a hoe... start swinging, get better> want to be a combat wizard? Pick of that Fire Ball sheet, thorw it around, get better/ Nature? pick up a Zap spell... Use it...  and so onSkill points? (ok, some people WILL hate this but... WHAT SKILL POINTS?? use a weapon/spell/shield... GET BETTER! ^^)Amazing story... Difficult enough to feel like a challenge... easy enough not to feel like a *hit-die-drink potions-die-hit* grind fest... The only way you will *fail* is by user error... that's not to say this game isn't without its brains/tactics though....You will not be dissapointed			"

												This game is one of those games that might have been a technological wonder at its time but it has not aged well at all. I can only recommend it to die hard fans of hhaack & slash .Where to start?First of all the textures are watered down and are not pleasent to watch at all. I found myself using the overhead map just to avoid looking at those low res textures all the time.Yes it does add that oh so fascinating idea of progressing your character by using either a weapon or a spell. The idea is very interesting at start but when you actually get to play the game over a few hours you realize that only melee chars are viable in this game. Magic and ranged are practically useless or at least utterly inferior to melee chars.The first few maps have a really slow progression curve,which is both satisfying at first but gets absolutelly frustrating way too fast. You get too many pointless drops and too little gold to actually progres the first quarter of the game and right after the game literally starts throwing thousands of gold at you and the sense of progression is really out of the question.All monster drops dont really mean anything because you get tons of gold to buy all the best gear from the next shop. And by gear i mean just get the weapon with most damage for your melee chars and you are good to go. All the other items are absolutely pointless.Oh and speaking of chars,its all fun  when you have one char,and get 2-3 more..but soon enough you get a total of 8, leaving inventory management a burden. Everything you pickup is esentially worthless anyway. You only need the weapon with most damage in the next shop for each of your chars and to fill your inventory with health potions.Yes only health potions ,because the mana potions are redundent since most of the wortwhile spells in the game cost your entire mana pool in 2-3 casts. There are several spell options but all of them are completely pointless as most of them try out a tactical point of view to a game that literally throws hundreds of mobs at you for no particular purpose. There is no feeling of progress nor of getting the next best item.The story is almost non-existent,battle the generic utter evil that plagues the land.The environments are very detailed though and vary a lot,unfortunatelly both the environments and the enemies fall in the generic hack & slash creatures and zones and neither stand out.The music is probably the best part of this game.The main theme is one of the most memorable music display in my game experience, which is both a good and a bad thing. Why a bad thing? Because there is only one god damn piece of music that  gets recycled all over the game.It is sad to see a game stand out only through its music.Speaking of sound, the sound effects just do their job but they are utterly forgetable and lackluster as well. The voiceovers ? They almost dont exist at all which is not helping with the immersion at all.The story is poor to say the least,itt is another generic farmer that starts out to help a friend and ends up saving the kingdom, so unique .Getting back to gameplay. The progressing system is pretty cool as an idea as it does not limit you to a specific class.The stats progression is insanely slow and limits the item usability tremendously. A huge amount of mage/ranger items require a high amount of strength for example,which esentially limits their use.All this can be overlooked if it werent for the almost complete automatization of the game. You just need to run in and click in the middle of a group of mobs and the game will take care of the rest. You just need to have a potion handy from time to time,which does not make it challenging at all.The game is overall all too tedious and it throws too many enemies at once making certain areas feel like they need an eternity to finish offConclusion? Dungeon Siege is awfully slow paced,non immersive and tedious to a point where you just stop caring about the quests,story and gameplay overall. We have way too many better games than this now for me to be able to reccomend this			"

												要約すると、「ダンジョンって名前だけにダンジョン凄い長いよね」　ハクスラ系、というジャンルになります。トーチライトやディアブロでお馴染みの操作で、マウスでキャラを動かすタイプのゲームですね。何やらモンスターが襲ってくるようになってしまったので、農民の若者が立ち上がる勇者のお話のようです。敵が一度しか出てこない為にキャラの育成を間違えると大変なことになるので、セーブデータはこまめにどうぞ。　一応Vistaや7で遊ぼうとすると、互換性が云々という表示が出ることがありますが、ゲームの実行ファイルのプロパティを開き、互換性モードでXPを選んでおけば大丈夫かと、あとは、強制的にフルスクリーンからウィンドウモードへ変えることも出来ますが、マウスがはみ出るのでどうしてもという人意外はお薦めできません。　ハクスラ系好きな人ならば、楽しめるのではないでしょうか。小生は装備やら何やらといろいろとゆっくりと吟味しながら進めるタイプなので、相当時間がかかりそうです。			"

												Dungeon Siege works perfectly under Windows 10 on an Ultra HD (4K) TV with the most recent (Nov 2015) NVIDIA driver update.Dungeon Siege including the expansion provides many hours of gameplay.  The quest line is linear and there are occasional puzzles to be solved.  The gameplay is solid and the game is fun to play.  Keeping the multiple party members together can get a bit tricky at times especially in areas with lifts or moving platforms, but is something the player will get used to micro-managing.Great to be able to play this timeless classic on the latest hardware so many years after initial release.Spent 20 hours lost in Glitterdelve Mine.  Would gladly get lost there again.  I am one of those hardcore gamers that refuse to consult walkthrough's ... and boy does this game make me wish I was more reddit friendly!  LOLRating 9.5 / 10			"

												This game has just about the right way on how a RPG should be , and even though its an old game its still a game with high replayability, you could lose a lot of hours crawling dungeons and caves. Find the right combo of 8 characters for your team and stick to it. Just don`t download the  DLC of legends of aranna unless you know what you are doing. It messed up my game and wasnt playable anymore. even though Legends of Aranna was a great addon back in those days. However i could still advice you this game as the Game itself is amazing. Looting drops, learning new spells and leveling up your skills is all in here.Dungeon siege is a classic and a game every RPG-lover shouldve at least experienced. Easy to learn but dont let your guard down of healthbars could drop fast. and yet it is way better then dungeon siege 2 or its addon where you die easily many times on the first mobpack. But maybe thats what you would want , challenge, then by all means go for it.Big plus from me. "

I have played this game countless times before it was on Steam and I genuinely wish I could go back and play it again. This is an amazing RPG. It is very linear, so you don't have much of an ability to explore, but the story shows you anything you could hope to see in the world.8/10			"

												Bought the 3-pack (Dungeon Siege I, II, and III), and decided to play through them.  Dungeon Siege 1 is old.  It came out in 2002, and the graphics are reflective of its age.  The gameplay itself is amazing however, it's a great RPG from days long past, and the ability to have up to eight party members was actually a breath of fresh air.  There are some definite balance issues, especially with how effective mass melee is.  Still, it provided a great atmosphere and RPG experience, with fun leveling mechanics.  The ability to change characters are you go is actually fun, although it felt like specialization was almost always superior.  The loot system had a few flaws, but overall was great.It begins rather slow, and the first level farm + forest levels felt rather tedious.  After you begin to immerse yourself, the experience takens on a better form.  It feels almost liek Baldur's Gate, with a bit less character and world building.  For it's time, I think it was an incredible game, and I wish I would have played it back then, I think I would have found it amazing.  Despite that, I think if you are a fan of RPGs, this is a fun Action RTS with minor questing.  Some of the quests are more difficult, but in general it's focused entirely on the action and the character building.  While some later battles do require micromanagement, the game itself it's very long or difficult.I played on medium difficulty and finished the game in 14 hours, while taking a leisurely pace.  Recommended for fans of RPGs, especially older ones.  Aside from that, DS1 probably  won't be your cup of tea. "

												Just finished the game. I played it around 10+ years ago. This version is unfortunatelly very buggy expecially at the end in Castle EHB. I had to save the game after each battle. After finishing the last boss there is no animation nothing at all. The game simply displays the main menu. Anyway I really enjoyed playing again this title. Good game.			"

												A good ol' game. Requires a few workarounds to work at its best on modern PCs but it is certainly a great game. If you like your typical DnD-style RPG games, well Dungeon Siege is in the same style but much more combat focused. You can have 8 dudes at once in a giant melee moshpit, and still find it difficult at a normal difficulty. The minigun doesn't do as much damage as I'd like.On a scale of ham to vegetable, I'd say it's about pretzel.			"

												Starts of *excrutiatingly* slow. There are some good early areas, but a lot of boring ones. But the further into the game you get, the more interesting things get. (Maybe that's kind of normal for this kind of game.)It's definitely worth playing if you can get past the beginning.I recommend playing on hard, but there is one issue. It looks like the game comes with Legends of Aranna pre-installed. The problem with that is that LoA introduced a stealth nerf to the gameplay. The game is significantly easier with Legends of Aranna installed (though I can't really recall if it was the installation that did it, or if it depended on which .exe you used.)I always used to recommend playing on hard with LoA NOT installed, but it doesn't look like you'll have a choice now, except that if LoA IS making it easier, you will definitely want to play on hard not normal. (Depends on your personal preference though, too, of course.)			"

												As of now, it is quite an old game, that modern monitors cannot display, as the VGA display needed doesn`t seem to be available. I have completed it several times, as its quite easy - you cannot wander off the selected tracks. The game crashes in several locations, but providing you save the game regularly you should be OK. Ideally you need a laptop that has gone out of date running Windows 98 if possible. The second Game in the series runs on any DOS up to Windows XP.Most of the older games fail to run on Windows System 7, (Which does have a software based XP Emulator - it does actually work). After that you can forget running any of your older stuff from Windows 8 onwards.			"

												I love this game. I played probably 1000 hours+ as a child. It has a great lore, gameplay, mechanics, beautiful world design, was moddable, etc., and was ahead of it's time when released. The graphics aren't super great, but it came out in 2000, so you really can't blame the developers. And the score is one of a kind, music like no other <3 I would reccomend this game to anyone.HOWEVER.The steam release of this game is downright unacceptable. The game does not run on newer computers without fiddling of the game files after dowload, nothing hard in any way, but one should simply be able to jump right in. A game so grand deserves at least that much. And even when you do that, the game is still very hard to play. The screen flashes, parts of the HUD are not where they should be, and mouse clicks to not register in the correct location. These problems are due to the game being out of date and a simple update would make this game enjoyable once more. Another thing I dislike is the fact that the multiplayer campaign is inaccessable in the steam release. There is a whole other fully fleshed-out world and a more in-depth character creation system that can only be accesseed via the multi-player tab. If it weren't for these two issues, I'd say it's more than worth it's price.I'd like to request a developer make a modern remake/remastering of this game, make something along the same lines (because DS2 and DS3 are far too different and simplified in a way that makes them not enjoyable) or if someone could suggest a similar game to this that actually works, I'd be very appreciative.

												Some tips:Consider downloading the ""Monty Haul"" mod that drastically increases your inventory size.  Also consider the ""Cat Mansion Plus Pack"" mod if you like low-poly anime style girls in skimpy clothing along with a few other tweaks like toilet plungers for weapons.  :P  There are definitely a few other decent mods for the game, but they are getting harder to find since many of the old mod sites are getting dilapidated.  :(You can run the game just fine in 1080p.  To do so, set this under ""Set Launch Options..."":nointro=true fullscreen=true width=1920 height=1080 bpp=32 nospacecheck=true bltonly=trueYour party can have up to 8 concurrent characters, including the starting hero character.  Other than pack mules, there are 16 recruitable characters available, and the ones with the highest stats are obtained later in the game.  In order of encounter, they are: Ulora, Gyorn, Rusk, Naidi, Zed, Gloern, Kroduk, Lorun, Merik, Phaedriel, Andiemus, Borkyev, Rhut, Sikra, Ulfgrim, Lord Bolinghar.There is a finite amount of enemies in this game, sort of, but there is at least one place to farm respawning enemies if you want an insane amount of cash and XP: In chapter 4, you will travel through a swamp.  In the swamp, there are certain witch-like enemies that summon swamp monster type minions over and over.  Avoid killing the witch-like enemies and kill only the swamp monster enemies they spawn.  You can do this easiest if you avoid wearing damage reflecting gear, avoid AOE spells and effects, and are extremely careful with certain ranged skills.  If you do all melee, it is very easy. - although I cannot say for sure if this is all just a 'feature' of the 'Cat Mansion Plus Pack' I used. "

You can start a new game. Just as when the intro starts, - to quote one of my favorite steam curators - ""IT'S SH!T.""You'll see a light show of graphical glitches so much you'll think it's a different indie steam game full of gimmicks then branding it as a ""game"" just cause they know how to launch games on steam.IT'S UNPLAYABLE.If you don't skip the intro cinematics lightshow, - It will crash.If you skip the intro cinematics lightshow,  It's as good as a crash because the lightshow is still there. then it will crash.Don't buy it. A complete waste of money. You'll just be disappointed with Gas Powered Games and Square Enix for being inconsiderate pieces of sh!t who didn't even try to bother to test if their game works on the platform.0/10 - unplayable.

												This game was fantastic back in its day.  It's a contemporary of the original Neverwinter Nights, and while that was more for the cerebral D&D style RPG gamer, Dungeon Seige married hack and slash with RPG in a new way.   Rather than be like Diablo, it went the direction of being linear, giving a bit of an epic-tale sort of feel. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it for purchase and use on newer machines.  It's not natively Win7+ compatible, which is normally not really a problem, but its older code for graphics management bleeds over to cause some pretty nasty glitching in HUD graphics and gameplay stuttering on nicer machines.   I'll need to run it in a virtual machine, which is beyond where most gamers are willing to take something they pick up on sale.   It may also run a bit better on ARM processors or similar systems that do not have discrete video cards.  As a game, 8 of 10.   But only buy it if you have something crappy to run it on; otherwise, you'll look to the sequels.			"

You can collect items that monster drop.... but after few hours I figure out it's totally useless doing that. You just lose time and most items are just bad. Collect gold? Seem useless too.

												An absolute classic Action RPG with beautiful and varied environments, tons of different enemies and one of the greatest soundtracks in gaming. It could possibly be too old for a lot of people, but for me it is still totally playable, though at the time of release it was incredibly polished. One of my favorite games of all time. I do think that Dungeon Siege 1 beat Diablo 2 in the single player, even if D2 nailed the multiplayer.This Steam release is mysteriously missing Legends of Aranna though and there is no multiplayer unless you bootleg it (thank god for this though).

I have counted. and it is STILL a 10/10) I HIGHLY recommend it :)			"

												I won't lie, I'm torn on this recommendation. There are definitely compatibility issues. Even when loaded outside of Steam, regardless of compatibility choice through Windows, etc.I purchased 3 copies of the Complete to play with my family over LAN, as anyone would know reading the Steam forums prior to purchasing anything, you'd quickly understand that Steam disabled the Multiplayer options by default. Configuring this is easily accomplished via command lines. zonematch=true. There are a list of command line codes all over the web, which will allow you hard change screen resolution, skip the intro, etc.  And if you forgot or didn't know, remember, no saving in MP mode. *sigh*  Personally this is the epic fail on this game.  You basically have to grind an entire day through each ""chapter"" completing all the quests so that you don't have to complete them again later, unless you want to...  Otherwise, everytime you exit out of MP and quit, the next time you hunker down for some MP over TCIP/LAN guess what, yup.. cleared maps & all mobs reload.Characters save as does their gear earned/collected.That all being said, it is extremely buggy in MP mode. Even more so than it EVER was.One of the rigs used (oldest) is a 2010 2ghz P4 with max ram & 1gb GTX280 pcie, running vista x86. Bottom of the barrel, but the same rig I ran my hard copy of this game, flawlessly for 120+hrs on this game. Both single player and multiplayer. However on the Steam version recently purchased, you can't get more than 15-30 minutes with out the infamous Exception Detected crash fault..Granted it doesn't crash on single player mode, there is an obvious detection of wonkiness in the AI & game mechanics ""glitches"" picking up items/opening/activating issues. Very annoying, but totally playable.These issues are 100% repeatable on both a 1yr old Windows 8 laptop with 8gb DDR3 & AMD graphcis as well as a Top tier Windows 7 gaming rig.As for the perks? This game is still classy, beautiful in regards to many modern games, true to the fundementals of fantasy games, with some valuable lessions tucked in. Stop clicking yer brains out and enjoy some real time tactical fun even on Normal Mode. Want a challenge and step up to Hard and see how far you can get with only yer main character. Gotta love watching yer corpse explode and all your items shoot all over the ground. *laugh* Oh yeah, save much? ;)The Music is awesome, it's Jeremy Soule for crying out loud.As for the story and length of the game, it's old school, so if you think your going to beat the game in a single sitting, too into watching other gamers playing games instead of playing them yourself, just log out of Steam and go back to crushing candy..  Best 3x5$ I've spent in a looonnnggg time.. :D***UPDATED: Take that back, crashed on SP mode upon speaking to random town folk...Awesome...  *sigh*			"

The quest line is linear and there are occasional puzzles to be solved.  The gameplay is solid and the game is fun to play.  Keeping the multiple party members together can get a bit tricky at times especially in areas with lifts or moving platforms, but is something the player will get used to micro-managing.Great to be able to play this timeless classic on the latest hardware so many years after initial release.Spent 20 hours lost in Glitterdelve Mine.  Would gladly get lost there again.  I am one of those hardcore gamers that refuse to consult walkthrough's ... and boy does this game make me wish I was more reddit friendly!  LOLRating 9.5 / 10			"

												I'm playing this game on windows 8.1 in full HD (1920x1080) and it runs flawlessly.It is a jewel, a technical marvel for its time (no loading screens, just seamless transition from one big area to the next, even bigger area!). The graphics are obviously outdated but for a game published in 2002 absolutely insane, and the level of detail is stunning. The music is excellent, the monsters varied and well designed. Almost everything about this game is top notch, except for the AI and the combat system that can be annoying at times. Nevertheless, this game is an impressive work of art and a remarkable technical achievement (especially for its time) and should not miss in any RPG fan's collection. Highly, highly recommended!!!

												Edit: Actually got it to work. If you can't get it to work, try updating your graphics card. I know it seems counter-intuitive for an older game but trust me it works.Looks like a good game, but do not buy if you have windows 8. it wont work. i have tried for hours to  make it work but it won't. it presents with a weird texture glitch that won't go away.

												This is easily the best hack n' slash RPG I have ever played.  I started playing this title when it was first released, and I still find myself coming back to it after over a decade.The control and combat system is pretty intuitive, and camera only bites you when you have your back to a steep wall (extreme zoom).  That isn't much of a problem, however, since you can turn the camera around with ease.  The party manipulation options are somewhat in-depth, with multiple selections for formations, movement ranges, and aggression.  Probably more than what's needed to play through the game, but workable nonetheless.Another great feature is the loading screens (or lack therof).  You load once at the beginning, and the game ""streams"" the entire world without a pause; the entire map from start to finish.  The maps are not huge by any means, but big enough that this is an impressive feature given when this game was released.Character development is also interesting; your party members develop thier combat effectiveness by how you use them (melee, ranged, caster, etc.).  You can also switch fighting styles at any time, just be mindful that a jack-of-all is a master-of-none (unless you grind all your skills on the multiplayer map).The single-player campaign has just enough content to keep you focused on why you're stomping your way through hordes of hostile creatures, and doesn't overload you with too much ""lore.""  The multi-player offers an additional map that you can use, and both the single and multi maps can be used for it.There is also a massive mod community for this game, which also keep it alive for those who own computers that have left this old title in the dust.Like I said, it is downright fun (and cheap, too).

												Rather dissapointed.I bought the dungeon siege complete set, as I have a great appreciation for rpg's, especially ones like this. When dungeon siege finished downloading, I started it up and immediately a little box came up saying that the program may have some compatability issues. I clicked ok and started the game. I created a character, selected my difficulty and started my epic journey. Except I don't think the epic journey was composed of large grey and neon colored triangles. The game seems to be incompatible with my computer, something I discovered after I purchased it. I can see nothing except these large streaks and triangles of rapidly changing colors. I am apparently not the only one with this problem. I have searched everywhere, and I cannot find anything that works. I am more dissapointed with steam than anything else, however, because of the fact that they would sell a game which has been complained about not working, and then not even offer a buyback. I even found the original copy of the game off steam, which still did not work. The final verdict: Do not buy if you do not have the exact specifics listed, or unless you somehow know that it will work.			"

												An absolute classic Action RPG with beautiful and varied environments, tons of different enemies and one of the greatest soundtracks in gaming. It could possibly be too old for a lot of people, but for me it is still totally playable, though at the time of release it was incredibly polished. One of my favorite games of all time. I do think that Dungeon Siege 1 beat Diablo 2 in the single player, even if D2 nailed the multiplayer.This Steam release is mysteriously missing Legends of Aranna though and there is no multiplayer unless you bootleg it (thank god for this though).

												If you have not played Dungeon Siege, then I suggest that you check it out. It is a fantastic party based dungeon crawl game. It is however a bit dated and to enjoy the game at higher resolutions I reccomend that you look into some modified steam run parameters to get the game much better looking and removing the framerate cap.Ive gone through the game a few times back in the day. I cant resist going back for another go on Steam. If anything just to see the epic terrain set pieces!			"

												I have to agree with Yaso Kita. This game is really a nostalgia jerker. It was also MY first (real) game i played with my dad when i was a little kid. It is as awesome today as it was then. Even back then I saw the flaws of the game (I had the cracked version so i was able to spend hours upon hours running around that forest with no path and then you look at the map and see it is just green...hahaha great memories) but anyways, this game was and is always gonna be close to my heart so I give it a 10/10 (I know that Yaso said its a 10/10 for the first playthrough, but ive played this game through 13 times. I have counted. and it is STILL a 10/10) I HIGHLY recommend it :)			"

												As of now, it is quite an old game, that modern monitors cannot display, as the VGA display needed doesn`t seem to be available. I have completed it several times, as its quite easy - you cannot wander off the selected tracks. The game crashes in several locations, but providing you save the game regularly you should be OK. Ideally you need a laptop that has gone out of date running Windows 98 if possible. The second Game in the series runs on any DOS up to Windows XP.Most of the older games fail to run on Windows System 7, (Which does have a software based XP Emulator - it does actually work). After that you can forget running any of your older stuff from Windows 8 onwards.			"

												Starts of *excrutiatingly* slow. There are some good early areas, but a lot of boring ones. But the further into the game you get, the more interesting things get. (Maybe that's kind of normal for this kind of game.)It's definitely worth playing if you can get past the beginning.I recommend playing on hard, but there is one issue. It looks like the game comes with Legends of Aranna pre-installed. The problem with that is that LoA introduced a stealth nerf to the gameplay. The game is significantly easier with Legends of Aranna installed (though I can't really recall if it was the installation that did it, or if it depended on which .exe you used.)I always used to recommend playing on hard with LoA NOT installed, but it doesn't look like you'll have a choice now, except that if LoA IS making it easier, you will definitely want to play on hard not normal. (Depends on your personal preference though, too, of course.)			"

												I love this game. I played probably 1000 hours+ as a child. It has a great lore, gameplay, mechanics, beautiful world design, was moddable, etc., and was ahead of it's time when released. The graphics aren't super great, but it came out in 2000, so you really can't blame the developers. And the score is one of a kind, music like no other <3 I would reccomend this game to anyone.HOWEVER.The steam release of this game is downright unacceptable. The game does not run on newer computers without fiddling of the game files after dowload, nothing hard in any way, but one should simply be able to jump right in. A game so grand deserves at least that much. And even when you do that, the game is still very hard to play. The screen flashes, parts of the HUD are not where they should be, and mouse clicks to not register in the correct location. These problems are due to the game being out of date and a simple update would make this game enjoyable once more. Another thing I dislike is the fact that the multiplayer campaign is inaccessable in the steam release. There is a whole other fully fleshed-out world and a more in-depth character creation system that can only be accesseed via the multi-player tab. If it weren't for these two issues, I'd say it's more than worth it's price.I'd like to request a developer make a modern remake/remastering of this game, make something along the same lines (because DS2 and DS3 are far too different and simplified in a way that makes them not enjoyable) or if someone could suggest a similar game to this that actually works, I'd be very appreciative.

												Hell yeah, any Steam friends of mine into MMORPG's or RPG's or MMO's or whatever the difference, this game is a flash back to the past. Very rustic, and old, dating back to 2002, I played this when I was like 6 or 7, and decided to play it again 12 years ago, it's even better than I thought. Not sure about Dungeon Siege 2, I played that as well 7 years ago or so, but it wasn't the same, it got pretty advanced and felt like WoW. It was still fun though. So you guys should get Dungeon Siege, very diverse open world MMORPG,♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of different items and stuff. Focuses on a few branches of skills: Magic. which is Combat Magic and Nature Magic. Melee weapons, such as Maces, Swords, Clubs, Axes, Scythes and a lot more random stuff. Ranged weapons, like Bows, Crossbows, and I think there's even a laser gun at one point from a steampunk robot enemy you fight in the game. The game gets really addicting, make sure you save frequently, it crashed about 20 hours in and I lost about an hours worth of progress.			"

Why is the multiplayer disabled *NO MORE CHICKEN LEVEL FTW!!!!*I do recommened it, works absolutly fine on Win8.1, the crashes it has, has always been there *it was even incompatible with Win XP FFS, lol* so that never has bothered me *SAVE SAVE SAVE PEOPLE*But this is a very very butchered version of it, i am deeply dissapointed, and i had no idea Square Enix took them over, which is proberly why the Xpansions are gone and mulitiplayer too... When you buy a collection you should get a collection NOT half the collection and call it a collection.That being said, i do recommened it, specially for those old schoolers like myself who absolutly love these type of games!

												This is easily the best hack n' slash RPG I have ever played.  I started playing this title when it was first released, and I still find myself coming back to it after over a decade.The control and combat system is pretty intuitive, and camera only bites you when you have your back to a steep wall (extreme zoom).  That isn't much of a problem, however, since you can turn the camera around with ease.  The party manipulation options are somewhat in-depth, with multiple selections for formations, movement ranges, and aggression.  Probably more than what's needed to play through the game, but workable nonetheless.Another great feature is the loading screens (or lack therof).  You load once at the beginning, and the game ""streams"" the entire world without a pause; the entire map from start to finish.  The maps are not huge by any means, but big enough that this is an impressive feature given when this game was released.Character development is also interesting; your party members develop thier combat effectiveness by how you use them (melee, ranged, caster, etc.).  You can also switch fighting styles at any time, just be mindful that a jack-of-all is a master-of-none (unless you grind all your skills on the multiplayer map).The single-player campaign has just enough content to keep you focused on why you're stomping your way through hordes of hostile creatures, and doesn't overload you with too much ""lore.""  The multi-player offers an additional map that you can use, and both the single and multi maps can be used for it.There is also a massive mod community for this game, which also keep it alive for those who own computers that have left this old title in the dust.Like I said, it is downright fun (and cheap, too).

												This game has just about the right way on how a RPG should be , and even though its an old game its still a game with high replayability, you could lose a lot of hours crawling dungeons and caves. Find the right combo of 8 characters for your team and stick to it. Just don`t download the  DLC of legends of aranna unless you know what you are doing. It messed up my game and wasnt playable anymore. even though Legends of Aranna was a great addon back in those days. However i could still advice you this game as the Game itself is amazing. Looting drops, learning new spells and leveling up your skills is all in here.Dungeon siege is a classic and a game every RPG-lover shouldve at least experienced. Easy to learn but dont let your guard down of healthbars could drop fast. and yet it is way better then dungeon siege 2 or its addon where you die easily many times on the first mobpack. But maybe thats what you would want , challenge, then by all means go for it.Big plus from me. "

												Dungeon Siege works perfectly under Windows 10 on an Ultra HD (4K) TV with the most recent (Nov 2015) NVIDIA driver update.Dungeon Siege including the expansion provides many hours of gameplay.  The quest line is linear and there are occasional puzzles to be solved.  The gameplay is solid and the game is fun to play.  Keeping the multiple party members together can get a bit tricky at times especially in areas with lifts or moving platforms, but is something the player will get used to micro-managing.Great to be able to play this timeless classic on the latest hardware so many years after initial release.Spent 20 hours lost in Glitterdelve Mine.  Would gladly get lost there again.  I am one of those hardcore gamers that refuse to consult walkthrough's ... and boy does this game make me wish I was more reddit friendly!  LOLRating 9.5 / 10			"

												Watch Ross's game dungeon on this game. My only advice after that is to play it when you have alot of free time, its best to play through in the span of a short period of time. Also after you beat the main game you can enable the expansion using mods, and using even more mods you can play the multiplayer in singleplayer. If theres some things I dont like about the game its that caves and dungeons go on for longer than I like and they are really close togeather, ontop of that 2/3rd of the way through each dungeon/cave I keep thinking ""Man, will this ever end"". Other wise this is a fantastic game, I highly recomend it.			"

												This game was fantastic back in its day.  It's a contemporary of the original Neverwinter Nights, and while that was more for the cerebral D&D style RPG gamer, Dungeon Seige married hack and slash with RPG in a new way.   Rather than be like Diablo, it went the direction of being linear, giving a bit of an epic-tale sort of feel. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it for purchase and use on newer machines.  It's not natively Win7+ compatible, which is normally not really a problem, but its older code for graphics management bleeds over to cause some pretty nasty glitching in HUD graphics and gameplay stuttering on nicer machines.   I'll need to run it in a virtual machine, which is beyond where most gamers are willing to take something they pick up on sale.   It may also run a bit better on ARM processors or similar systems that do not have discrete video cards.  As a game, 8 of 10.   But only buy it if you have something crappy to run it on; otherwise, you'll look to the sequels.			"

												I absolutely love this game, but why on earth have Valve not included LoA? Or BW for DS 1/2? The only reason I brought the complete pack was because it was supposed to be ""complete"" in my opinion you're better off buying it from some where that actually includes the ENTIRE game, even more so for the fact that LoA is basically needed to complete the DS 1 story =/ So I would suggest this game to anyone who loves old RPG's or just RPG's in general, this is a fantastic game along with DS 2 but I personally wouldn't buy it off steam as you don't actually get either expansion for DS 1 or 2, so go to GoG or somewhere similar that sells this + expansion and buy it from there!EDIT: The only way to 'activate' the expansions is to follow this guide

												Surprisingly entertaining fast-paced-action fun and best of the series. It's a pretty linear game, following down a path, that takes you through every chapter. If you can run it, you can enjoy it. If you've got some brandnew Nvidia/AMD graphics then .. look in the forums before you buy it. It mostly works quite well, but the AI controlling your party gets really confused sometimes if there are too many groups of enemies and then it gets quite frustrating to play, when your party spreads out and most certainly die. Avoid death at all costs, because even though resurrection is quite easy (if you stand close enough and you are not in combat at the same time), your character drops all items on the ground on death, that totally clutter the screen and each item needs to be picked individually.. Sheesh.  There is no honour in healing. Since there is no exp gain from healing, setting up a companion to be a healer would render it totally useless in time, because it will never gain levels.  You can have six members in your party AND two Pack-mules(!!).. Awesome. Unfortunately the mules can die too, leaving an even bigger mess to clean up, but its quite rare that they do.Save often.It's easy to understand why this game spun a sequel and after playing the second installment I understand why it stopped. The third game, which is the first I played, is something completely different.			"

												One of my absolute favorite old school isometric PC RPGs, and it's also one of the first games I played on my first real gaming PC. I somehow actually stilll have the intact box and CDs sitting around in storage somewhere.You control up to eight characters at once, including a pack mule to act as extra inventory space. Characters can be specialized in a few ways, with two different schools of magic, ranged, or melee attacks. If you are feeling saucy, you can combine and make a hybrid class, such as a spellsword or some kind of other variant. You can succeed with nearly any party combination, so there isn't much pressure to min/mix the perfect party combination.Combat is very micro-heavy, with lots of little subtle things needed to keep your party fighting in top shape. Although the game starts slow, you'll very quickly end up with a party of four to six characters and you'll be slashing through huge parties of monsters. You'll need to pay attention to what spells are being cast, positioning of your characters, and more; it's very consuming and very satisfying when you get through an encounter unscathed.With a modern eye, though, there are a lot of rough parts to the game. Camera control is a pain, and controlling your party can get really overwhelming when you have a ton of characters. With casters, it can be clunky to switch between spells in combat. I really enjoyed this game and I still enjoy it to this day, but it might be hard to get for someone who didn't play it back in the day.			"

												I downloaded this game thinking it would work on my new laptop because it was downloaded through steam... I was wrong. I then restarted my computer and retried but this time it wouldn't even start the program. I was really disappointed and lost 7 dollars.			"

												(3-10-15)I just finished the game.  I have to say it was a great journey back in time to a more classic feeling game with a wide array of settings.  The challenge was fairly good and would have been more challenging if I had played on hard mode.  I loved how a lot of the battles consisted of a large number of enemies and that you could have a large group of party members.  Some of the dungeons are very long (Sometimes I felt like I was playing a solo World of Warcraft classic style dungeon because of the roles of the party members, large battles and the length of dungeons.).  It was also nice to see that the items you could buy in the store were actually useful and that you would want to buy them.  There are so many ways to play this game that my playstyle of trying to be everything was hindered.  That isn't really a bad thing.  You could play this multiple times, being different types of characters, though I'm not really one to play through a game again.  I like to move on and try something new.  The music (in the majority, is very nice) reminded me a lot of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.  Some are repetative though (very short and then it repeats), making those annoying.  I didn't realize that it was the same composer until today.  Early on, some of the voices were annoying, but a lot were interesting and sometimes funny.  Hearing the click of selecting or opening a persons inventory became annoying, fast (and you did this a lot). At the beginning of the game, the amount of inventory space is annoying (not enough).  It was a long way to the first town.  Also, with very large areas between two shop areas, you will find your inventory full and have to travel back long distances to sell things.  One other thing deals with organization of inventory.  I would group my health and mana potions together, seperately.  When I would use them, it wouldn't use them in order from top to bottom.  So, I ended up with a scattered mess that I would end up having to organize again.  In a shop with spells to purchase, it would have also been nice to sort and seperate the two types of magic (nature and combat).  It would have also been nice to be able to grab multiple items in your inventory to move around.When I would have multiple characters's windows open or just a shop along with one character, the inventory windows for the group would appear extra small (with shop window open this actually only occurred with the pack mules).  It made it harder to do what I wanted.It took me to long to figure out how to clearly get everyone to play their roles in battle (some wouldn't move or attack, even though I had set things to do so).  I eventually figured out I needed to select a character and then hit ctrl-A to select everyone or press ctrl and click on the members you wanted, to get things to work properly.  This was after figuring out what the different battle options did and setting them for each of the party members.  It is also to easy to click on other characters, which then deselects everyone else.If you want to take any screenshots and not have the adventurer's handbook open, you will need to go into the input options and change your hotkey for the handbook.  The default screenshot button is F12, which is also the adventurer's handbook.Sometimes it is hard to get all your party on a transport elevator before it moves.  Then you have to wait to get everyone together.It would have been nice if they had labeled the area you were currently in on the map and when you are entering a new area.I had a few crash to desktop occurrances and exceptions while playing through the game.  The last crash I had was a memory error where the game apparently didn't deallocate correctly.  This was in Castle Ehb.I disliked the dropping of a party members complete inventory onto the ground when it dies.  It creates a mess of text on the screen (you could turn the text off), as well as having to keep up with who was carrying what.  I also hit max gold and then when I would sell things, it would drop the gold on the ground.  This eventually created a pile of text.  I'm not sure if it was play style, to much stuff for the amount of gold one can carry or that to much gold can be found in chests or dropped from an enemy.  I also came back to the dropped pile of gold one time, after many, and found it gone.The pack mules don't follow behind my party in a speedy fashion during battles, which can sometimes cause problems of them getting out of the way from being hit by an enemy.As far as the ending goes, I had to watch it on YouTube.  I find this a very bad thing.  When you defeat the final boss and it explodes, it drops loot and then the screen goes black.  You are then returned to the start menu.  In the non-steam version, you are sent to a black screen with text and narration to end the story.  Then, you get the credits.  After this, you are returned to the game to be able to pick up the loot and do as you please (play multiplayer or expansions).  I guess since the steam version doesn't come with multiplayer and the expansions, they cut this out.  It still should have gone through the ending credits and then returned you to the game to pick up the loot.Though it seems I mentioned more of the negative aspects to this game, it is a very good game overall.  It is definately worthy of being played.  Hopefully steam will release a fix for the ending and sparse crashes.Rating9/10			"

												A classic. Back in the day, when I was a kid, I didn't like this game much (for it was 3d). Nowadays it is hard to find a game with so big world and so much different environments. The gameplay of the game is sometimes boring (almost always the same) yet very attracting. It is a must-play IMO. Especially if you are ready for the old-school.			"

												After 14 years I forgot how brilliant this game is. It starts slowly, and perhaps less seasoned players might get bored in the 3 or 4 hours it takes to really pick up pace. But once you start to build an effective party, it's hack n' slash RPG giggles like the good ol' days.A lot of people complain about the multiplayer being removed from Steam, but really that's never why I played Dungeon Siege.Highly recommended.NOTE: You will have to do a little bit of work to get this to run nicely on Steam - such as installing Killah's Fix and also modifying the command line options, but this takes about 10 minutes. This will also enable you to play the Legend of Arrana expansion. A little more homework and you can easily mod the game to enable the single player mode on the multiplayer map, which gives you many more hours of explorarion.			"

												**Revised reviewThe true meaning of hack n slash, x100.You and a million [not really] other people in your party just bash their weapons (or spam spells) into enemies while gaining loot Diablo style. You explore the vast land, killing every enemy on sight, and just lay hell upon them while spamming the H button. (Drink: Health Potion?)If you want a game where you just go to town on every sorry enemy that happens to be in your party's vicinity and don't much care for a great story, you've come to the right place! Just don't forget to heal up everyone in your team! You'll regret what you'll see when they die.ITEM DROP x999Resurrection ScrollITEM PICK UP x999Recommended.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone whose computer can play the game.  However this is more of a question.  The game will not let me past the intro.  I get a message: ""Exception Detected"" and I have to click the game closed.  There have been times when I have bypassed this by hitting ""ESC"" but now that does not work. Anyone know anything about this?  Would appreciate any help given.  Have tried different resolutions including the one mentioned in one of the reviews.  My notebook will not go down to 800x600.  The default setting for the game is 640x480x32.  I am hoping this is not a resolution issue.  Thanks.			"

												Starts of *excrutiatingly* slow. There are some good early areas, but a lot of boring ones. But the further into the game you get, the more interesting things get. (Maybe that's kind of normal for this kind of game.)It's definitely worth playing if you can get past the beginning.I recommend playing on hard, but there is one issue. It looks like the game comes with Legends of Aranna pre-installed. The problem with that is that LoA introduced a stealth nerf to the gameplay. The game is significantly easier with Legends of Aranna installed (though I can't really recall if it was the installation that did it, or if it depended on which .exe you used.)I always used to recommend playing on hard with LoA NOT installed, but it doesn't look like you'll have a choice now, except that if LoA IS making it easier, you will definitely want to play on hard not normal. (Depends on your personal preference though, too, of course.)			"

												I'm playing this game on windows 8.1 in full HD (1920x1080) and it runs flawlessly.It is a jewel, a technical marvel for its time (no loading screens, just seamless transition from one big area to the next, even bigger area!). The graphics are obviously outdated but for a game published in 2002 absolutely insane, and the level of detail is stunning. The music is excellent, the monsters varied and well designed. Almost everything about this game is top notch, except for the AI and the combat system that can be annoying at times. Nevertheless, this game is an impressive work of art and a remarkable technical achievement (especially for its time) and should not miss in any RPG fan's collection. Highly, highly recommended!!!

												As of now, it is quite an old game, that modern monitors cannot display, as the VGA display needed doesn`t seem to be available. I have completed it several times, as its quite easy - you cannot wander off the selected tracks. The game crashes in several locations, but providing you save the game regularly you should be OK. Ideally you need a laptop that has gone out of date running Windows 98 if possible. The second Game in the series runs on any DOS up to Windows XP.Most of the older games fail to run on Windows System 7, (Which does have a software based XP Emulator - it does actually work). After that you can forget running any of your older stuff from Windows 8 onwards.			"

												Incompatible error messages for this version of windows and way too many exception crashes.  I found that deleting and re-downloading took care of that problem. The characters still seem to have a mind of their own sometimes but I can live with that. It's a real treat to be able to play one of my favorite XP games on Windows 7 and a 42"" screen. Fantastic.

												Graphics are a bit dated but do not detract from the experience.Voice acting a bit cringeworthy at times.Gameplay is fun and absorbing, dungeons give literal meaning to the term 'dungeon crawling' with ability to control up to 8 party members, including mules to carry extra loot.Soundtrack generally excellent with music from Jeremy Soule (composed for Guild Wars/GW2 among other games).Story is quite simplistic.Overall the game is fun and kept me playing until the end.Do yourself a favour and buy this game, and before playing go to the community page and read through Killah's guide on how to enable the EXPANSION as well as MULTIPLAYER.Yes the game did crash for me several times, ensure you quick-save often. No bugs encountered during my playthrough.6.5-7/10			"
