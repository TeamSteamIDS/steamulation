EDIT: I got super tired of reading so many complaints of people saying that the game is too hard and confusing, so I wrote a guide for beginners. This should clear up any questions you might have about the game, and if you still don't like it afterwards, then I guess it isn't for you. This review is also specifically focused on the base game and does not include any info on the DLC expansion.---This is a near-perfect lovechild of tabletop board games and roguelikes.Coin Crypt is a procedurally-generated roguelike adventure game. What makes this game unique is its deckbuilding mechanics and deep, strategic gameplay. You play as a lootmancer, one of 20 characters who hunt for treasure in the mysterious ""Coin Crypts"". The coins found within treasure chests are used for both battling and bartering, but once they're used they're gone forever. With 201 different coins to find and use, the game offers a rich variety of play.Coin Crypt separates itself from other games in its genre through a combination of strategy and pressure. The combat system runs on an active time battle format rather than a strict turn-based system. Each coin has its own cast time, and if you take too long to decide your play, your opponent will get the better of you. There's always the looming danger of running out of coins, which immediately ends your run. Because of this, you must keep your deck lean and efficient, but also mindful of the coins you spend as they'll disappear once used. To balance this, you can donate unneeded coins to Deities, the Loot Gods, who offer specific coins that suit different styles of play such as stalling, pure offense, defensive, and more. Other than the wide variety of coins, there's also a good amount of different enemies who challenge you with specific playstyles. Some will steal your coins, poison you, force you to drop your coins, and more. Each floor has an optional miniboss that award you with items that give positive modifiers to your character. Once you've beaten 9 levels, you'll have to fight a random boss to win your run. As with most roguelikes, Coin Crypt has permadeath. Upon ending a run, you can use the money you accumulated to unlock different character classes with different modifiers that can change the way you play. Every class has to be played in their own unique way, and there’s no one method that will work for any class.This game offers great replayability, a surprising amount of depth, and good fun if you're looking for a more strategic roguelike/RPG. Be warned; it is a difficult game with a moderate learning curve. One of its biggest issues is that new players will have a hard time learning the mechanics. There is no tutorial, and the game can feel very confusing at first. It will take a lot of subsequent playthroughs to slowly understand the strategies and skills needed. Some players may get turned off by the game's almost childish art. Personally, I feel like it suits the game, giving it an almost boardgame-like aesthetic, which suits its gameplay. Some aspects may feel unbalanced, such as quick enemies or unfair coins, and there are still some bugs that have ruined some user's savefiles. Playing the game with a gamepad may feel awkward, but it plays smoothly with keyboard and mouse. Some classes are more difficult to play than others, although that's typical for most roguelikes. However, the developer is still in touch with the community and has steadily been working out the game's kinks. All in all, Coin Crypt is definitely worth the $10.00 purchase.TL; DR: One of the most underrated roguelikes on Steam. Must-get if you're a fan of collectible card games and roguelikes/RPGs.			"

Early Access Review
								Coin Crypt, currently in Early Access, is a top-down roguelite in which you brave a randomly generated dungeon in search of coins.  Each coin is assigned a traditional currency value but also doubles as a separate item in your inventory used to attack, defend or heal, as well as to cause or cure status effects.  Dozens of unique coin types exist within the game.Dungeon design is basic and not much makes one room or floor stand out from another, aside from the occasional environment change.  You’ll find most of what you’d expect while exploring:  shopkeepers who will trade upgrades for coins; secret rooms; random elements like coin hungry cat pillars (not to be confused with caterpillars); enemies ranging from skeletons to bandits to grannies; and chests which contain coins, keys or upgrades.  Enemies will chase you if you venture too close and, once you come into contact, you’ll be taken to another screen to duel it out.Battle is where Coin Crypt genuinely tries to be original and takes place in first-person with your palm stretched out before you, with a random selection of coins in it.  You can either use one of the coins in your hand or redraw for new ones, but the clock is ticking and both options have a cast time.  Meanwhile you can see how close the enemy is to completing his action, what coin he’s using and how many coins he has left.  If you survive until he runs out of coins you win and, if you destroy him before he runs out, you’ll also get his unused coins as loot.Managing what coins you have on hand is an important balance that means you can’t snatch up everything for sale in every shop you find because, if you run out of coins during battle, you will die the same as if you’d been killed.  Upon death, you can spend the total currency value of coins you found to unlock additional characters, each with a unique strength and weakness. Coin Crypt is easy to pick up and put down, and almost seems more suited for handheld devices and touch controls than PC; however, it plays perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard and the developers have set a very reasonable five dollar asking price, so make your own call here.

												This is a fun Adventure / Dungeon game where you travel through randomly generated levels to collect coins from looting chests or defeating monsters.Each coin offers a different ability in battle. One coin can be activated to attack, defend, cast poison, cast steal, cast slow or speed and many others. You can even stack up different coins for combination attacks.This game is very tricky in that you have to be careful not to use or lose all of your coins or it's Game Over and there is no continue. You will have to start right back from the beginning. But it's not all in vain as all the coins you collect earn you cash to spend towards new character unlockables. Each with different stats and powers to help you.You will also be able to unlock new and upgraded coins and new monsters that appear throughout the game.An online leaderboard is available to compare your progress with other Steam Users and there is also a cool daily challenge to help you earn new things.The game works smooth with both keyboard and mouse as well as a 360 controller.This is one of those games you will find yourself coming back to quite often. :)			"

												Imagine a card game.You have to use your cards to do anything.There are attack cards, defense cards, heal cards, steal cards, and all kinds of trick cards.If you run out of cards, you lose. The same applies to your enemies.You get cards from chests and enemies. Enemies only drop the cards they have remaining when beaten, so you're encouraged to defeat them or steal their cards rather than let them run out.There is no currency. Every card has a monetary value and in order to buy things or donate to gods, you must barter with your cards.Every character uses cards in different and unique ways.Everything in this game revolves around cards.Now imagine instead of cards, it's coins.That's Coin Crypt.

												Got this game on humble and didn't expect to play it long at all. Was very wrong, will be playing more of this.Pros--Great method of making procedural generation change deckbuilding-Fun mechanics, giving you multiple ways to win a fight-Character implementation makes dying fun and lessens your rage-Classes feel distinctly different from one another-Secret rooms are hypeCons--Deckbuilding happens in game, which is fun, but it sort of takes away pregame strategy some deckbuilding enthusiasts enjoy-Levels are always different but feel the same, would be better if you always didn't follow the same location pathWhat would make this game better?-Local MultiplayerAs a wrap up, good introductory roguelike, good for both veterans and newbies. Very fun for a casual game. "

Early Access Review
								I love this game! I can't believe nobody has thought of this coin mechanic before -- I love that there's this perfect tension between spending coins, using them, and hoarding them. I love the card-game and deck-building mechanics, and the surprisingly large and deep variety in the characters. Seriously, check this out. And don't let graphics or anything hold you back. This is also the perfect game for stupid grown-ups like me.You can play it in short bursts, you can put it down safely to deal with the baby, and even if you die horribly you can still bank some long-term progress by cashing in your coins to unlock a new character.

												Coin Crypt is a great, highly polished, and addictive roguelike with the unusual addition of deckbuilding elements that work very well. It's hard to believe that this title was made in Game Maker with it's polished pseudo-3D graphics that are somewhat reminiscent of Paper Mario. Most importantly, the gameplay is very fun with reasonable depth. Runs can be a little too same-y, working in more randomized elements would definitely be to the game's benefit, but it offers fun gameplay and a large cast of playable characters, each of whom adds their own spin to the game's formula. There could be a bit more variety and I'd love to see the developer keep patching in new content, or even releasing DLC, but overall the content that Coin Crypt offers is just so fun and engaging that it remains an easy recommendation.

												In Coin Crypt, you are a lootmancer harnessing the power of coins. The gameplay mixes deck-building with standard roguelike elements - permadeath and random levels. Your bag of coins is used both for combat and for buying items. The combat is semi turn-based - coins have cast times and everything slows down while picking a coin. There's a lot of variety in coins, enemies, and classes. Of course, there's unlocks. Your total earnings go toward new classes and achievements unlock new classes, coins, and enemies. Games are generally quick and the variety keeps things interesting. Overall, it's good fun.			"

Posted: February 24, 2016
												Best review would be a lengthy description, imo. Coin Crypt is roguelike top-down RPG w/ real-time card-based combat, and an on-map encounter system for enemies (touching an enemy in the ""overworld"" triggers combat). The way the card game system is done is far different from anything else I've ever come across. I suppose it would make the most sense to start by explaining how the real-time part works.       When you play a card, your character removes it from your hand, and starts to cast it, during which time you cannot do anything else. Casting basically presents as a windup timer showing how long that particular played card needs until it is put into effect. When it comes down to it, casting is what really ties the combat together, and makes the real-time part viable. Cards cast quick enough to keep the feeling of real-time –combat feels like a continuous string of actions–, but also slow enough so you have time to think during an opponent's cast –effectively preventing it from coming down to a battle of luck and who clicks quickest. The best comparison I can give of how it feels would be to say when casting is at it's very worst the combat's flow slows the same way it might when reloading your gun in an FPS, and when casting is normal I'd say combat flow is more akin to chess utilizing a stop clock –you feel pressure to be quick, but there's enough time to be deliberate, and overall strategy/planning definitely feels like the main focus and factor in winning.       However, casting is far from being the only uncommon part of the card system. That said, every unique mechanic seems to be carefully designed with each of the others in mind, chief of which are the roles cards themselves play. Cards are essentially everything. Not only are cards the combat medium, but cards are the loot, cards are the passive effect carriers, some cards are one-use skeleton keys, cards remaining in your deck is a secondary health bar, and –most importantly– all cards are currency. In line with this duel nature, used cards are not given back after battle (they are dropped when you play them), forcing you to choose a little more literally, and much more carefully, how you spend them. Using cards to buy useful items and influence the island gods needs to be balanced with keeping a large enough and carefully built enough deck so you don't run out of cards. On top of this, you are forced to take only a few out of a small group of coins chest ghosts offer when you're looting a chest, so it can often be a tough choice deciding how many of the weak/low-value cards of the type you're low on (for example Heal 2 worth $5) you should take versus how many of the average/mid-value coin (like Attack 4).      Building around that duality, a lot of the other mechanics are designed in order to make deliberate, personalized deck construction and management the backbone of the game. This is also why the card game mechanics have to be so unorthodox compared to most card games. Your hand size is only 3 cards (by default), your health is only 10 (by default), and when you play a card you also draw a fresh hand. Additionally, all drawn hands will organize any duplicate cards into stacks (stacks if played will cast all the cards in that stack at once as a single cast). Having a small hand and possible stacks means trying to prevent cards that don't help your build from accumulating in your deck and not taking care not to be too prone to finding yourself choosing between using two Attack 4 cards (or w/e) on a 2/10 health monster, or letting their cast finish while you redraw and taking 4 damage.      Beyond that, it forces you to create a deliberate style of deck-build & corresponding combat style by making ""use the most overpowered coins you can find"" type strategy almost useless. Using lots of Steal an enemy card type cards depletes their deck to win, and so physical damage is a waste to have in your deck (most of the time), and a wasted turn could easily mean losing 40% of your health. Poison damage builds rely on overwhelming the opponent more than they can heal while trying to stay guarded, so passive cards –which usually also have a draws often effect– would (normally) get in the way of that. The thing is, there are ways to combine these kinds of cards into a useful deck, but they don't play well together if you just throw them together. Having a lot of damage cards and a few Steal cards can be useful for shield card focused enemies because you can deplete their shields quicker by just taking them (a lot of the time) than letting them keep playing them as you attack over and over, and you can augment this balance to withstand other types of enemies by having most of your deck comprised of shields in case of a bad draw, as shield health and shield time-remaining carry over between battles, so it's not nearly as much of a risk if you don't get the card type you needed. Decks have a lot of depth, esp. depending on your play style, yet coins themselves are often very straightforward.      There are 201 unique cards in the game so far, and there are tons of items, passive-power cards, blessings, and other things that all modify your stats or mechanics, often in classic RPG fashion. Using items or modifiers in tandem with particular deck builds, strategy complexity can potentially be increased to much, much further depths depending on the chosen play style. Ex. the Joker Token card with the coin pouch. When played, anything that damages the user now heals them, and anything that heals the user now damages them. Two of the status will reverse healing and damage back to normal. A coin pouch lets you store a coin from your current hand for use at any point/battle in place of one of the coins you drew. Using the saved coin also draws a new hand, and clears the quickslot. The Joker Token is one of the best coins to put in it. It can save the player from the brink of death and allow them to survive very powerful attacks, such as the Explosion Chip (Attack 20) used by the ""Grandma"" enemy. Furthermore, donations to gods lets up two of them bless chests and add several of their card class to your options to pick from, allowing you to more easily tune your deck to a particular play style. The more you donate, the more likely to be rarer cards of that god's type.      In addition to all of those modifiers, every one of the characters (except for the starter) have more major, unique modifiers of their own, making the game play differently for each character. For example when playing as Demon: whenever the enemy plays a card, one cursed card (that does damage to your player if cast) is added to their deck, but demon also makes all card currency values negative (so cursed coins become positive currency). Basically Demon doesn’t have to buy items or get blessings using the useful cards in his deck, and constantly makes good amounts of money from battle spoils –but the more money you save up the more chance of drawing a hand polluted with harmful cards, and you need to choose between ending battles quickly to take more of the enemy’s original cards (you [default] take 100% of their unplayed cards), or stalling to grind for cash.      Other characters have more simplistic modifiers, like Monkey: he casts more slowly than other characters, but redraws his hand at quadruple speed and always casts all of the cards in his hand. So, In order to do well as Monkey, the player must learn the effects of all the coins they carry, and be a little more frugal to make up for occasional unnecessary card casting caused by his unique traits.      All of this makes for a tight combat system with tons and tons of styles of play, and giving it an immense amount of replay value, all while remaining very intuitive and fast paced. 11/10 would build a deck again –and again –and again.

												There's a gamble that comes with attempting new mechanics in a game. We've all been around long enough that we expect certain things to work certain ways, and cutting against that grain can really turn people off. But nobody wants to fight the same monsters and gain the same levels forever, and so we must give games like Coin Crypt their dues. Easily one of the most unique roguelikes I've ever played, Coin Crypt not only forges forth with a bold new concept, but constructs some brilliant strategy around it.You are a lootmancer, unraveling the secrets of a mysterious island in the Pacific in the search for more loot. And you're going to find plenty of it in the form of coins, dozens upon dozens of different kinds of coins. The thing is, these coins are how you do EVERYTHING in the game. Attack coins do damage to your enemies, healing coins heal you, shield coins protect you, stealing coins take your foe's coins, key coins unlock things, and so on. Run out of life OR coins and it's game over, so you need to be just as careful about spending yourself into oblivion as you are fighting monsters.If that sounds daunting, then let me assure you it is, at least at first. You start the game with a basic set of coins and find more in chests liberally scattered throughout the levels. Coins can also be nicked off your enemies or collected when they perish, but must be spent to defeat them. Combat is far more complex than just attacking or healing, though. Enemies can also be beaten by running them out of coins, and there are a wealth of coins that can steal coins, drop coins, clone coins, switch coins, and more. You'll always need to size up your foe before launching a strategy, because armored enemies might be easier to take down by running them dry, or low-health enemies might be better handled through status effects.I really cannot stress enough how deep the combat system is. It's real-time as well, with each coin having a cast time to consider. That means you can launch quick steals to stop a heavy incoming attack, or fill a swift enemy's pockets with self-damaging coins, or just wait for a basic attacker to waste their coins against your shields. Your available coins are drawn randomly as three options so you won't always have your chosen strategy up, but you can re-draw or find items or buffs that affect the coins you tend to draw.This brilliant combat system is the heart of Coin Crypt, particularly because there's a pretty simple game built around it. Levels tend to be short and contain few features outside enemies and chests. There are shrines to loot deities, wishing wells, and shops to spend your coins on, but with all of these you'll need some experience to know when to spend and when to save. Your coins all have value, of course, and so their worth as actual currency may also color your strategy. You'll even find a few secrets and shortcuts, assuming you take the time to explore a little.There's a daily challenge mode on top of the regular adventure, and a whole gaggle of characters to unlock, each with their own unique playstyle. It's all wrapped up in an adorable blocky presentation of bold lines, primary colors, and bouncing rectangular people. The sound design is fine as well, though I can't say I remember much outside of the pleasing jingle of coins. But really, that's all you need when the core experience is so good. Coin Crypt does a lot with a fresh concept, making it something worth digging into and spending hours mastering.			"

Early Access Review
								[Beta Review]This game has gotten a good amount of positive feedbacks and I do like the neo-""roguelike"" genre that seems to be recently popular. I am just having a hard time getting to enjoy it. I've unlocked five or six classes and it is fun trying them out and their different playstyles, and have gotten as far as level 3-3 with the princess where a grandma killed me rather fast :P. The concept of the game itself -- collecting coins and using them to do battle -- is fine, but the implementation just seems off.The biggest issue for me is that the flow or pacing of the game feels like it is all over the place:1. Walking around is too slow for my tastes. I know this is upgradeable, but it's simply not fun to be walking as slow as you do. The pace after one upgrade is just about perfect for a standard walking speed, or a tad slower than that.2. Looting coins from enemies/chests and discovering new coins was fun for a short while, but it just seemed too hectic for me to constantly have to keep track of what coins I had at the moment, and it's easy to run out of any particular coin. I am aware this adds an element of ""strategy"" to the game, and I'm not opposed to strategy in any sense -- I love strategy games, as well as RPGs, and even some computer trading card games (which Coin Crypt's coin system very vaguely resembles). To me, the coin and loot system started feeling like a chore very fast.The ""cursed chest"" system also seemed good in theory, limiting players but giving them choices and what coins to pick, but looting chests quickly felt like a chore as well. The ""Choose for me"" feature somewhat helped this, but didn't entirely alleviate the pain, and I don't enjoy the game making too many decisions for me :P. Perhaps chests should hold more coins at a time, but have less chests throughout the corridors to compensate. I believe that this would make looting chests more rewarding and feel less like a chore.As with the coin system itself, I would enjoy having atleast some basic attack to count on in the heat of battle - it can be relatively weak and slow, with coins still being used the majority of turns, but all too often I'm out of attack coins or it takes 2-3 turns to draw any in my hand for combat. All too often, combat felt more like simple luck based on what coins I drew and the size of the stacks, rather than a system where I had some sense of control and that flowed well.3. Victory when enemies run out of coins is good and all, but receiving no reward on victory just makes the battle seem like a waste of time -- even a random 3 hit/heal/shield coin would be better than nothing.4. There's already discussion about and players wanting more RPG and persistent elements to the game, and I would have to strongly agree that these would help make playing Coin Crypt much more enjoyable and rewarding. The devs have posted that they don't want to dilute the challenge of the game, which I understand -- but the game as it is with zero progress (excluding class unlocks) carrying over between deaths seems more like a ""hardcore"" mode than the standard mode of the game should feel. Perhaps I am bias after playing through an excellent neo-roguelike and a game that is already completed, Rogue Legacy, which balances between progression and perma-death (you could call it serial-death) very nicely.In summary,ProsPermadeath actionClass unlocksUnique coin systemConsBase walking is too slowLack of satisfying progression between gamesBattles seem to rely too much on luckCoin system in general seems chaotic and not funPerhaps this game simply wasn't my ""cup of tea"" so to speak, but the elements of the game in theory seemed to be enjoyable for me, just not the implementation. I wouldn't want to turn this game into something it isn't, as it already has it's fair share of fans who have enjoyed the game and played it far more than I. But implementing these features and suggestions would hopefully turn the game into something that I would personally more enjoy, and that I believe other players would enjoy as well. Good luck devs, and thanks for reading! I'd like to keep up to date on the development of this game and may try it again after any big updates.Take care,- johnmyster			"

												Coin Crypt is a strange little game, where you use coins as both currency, as well as a weapon, while exploring dungeons full of enemies and loot. Death is permenent, making it a challenging game to stay alive.  There are unlockable character classes each with their own style and gameplay. You must spend coins to get more coins, so you can't rush off into fights: some strategy will be necessary to survive. Visually, It is a top-down 3D game with a roguelike structure. It looks somewhat retro, but is still a fun game to play.			"

								Coin Crypt is a breath of fresh air in the rogue-like genre. The combat mechnic is fun and very strategic and makes combat feel a lot more strategic than most rogue-likes. The characters and way you progress through the game feels very quick yet long enough to give loads of replayability (if procedural generation isn't enough). Overall Coin Crypt is a very enjoyable experience and highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys roguelike-like's.I have a first impressions video if you'd like to see some gameplay.

Early Access Review
								Coin Crypt is a roguelike, like FTL or The Binding Of Isaac. It's a game where you have to start all over again if you die. But Coin Crypt has an original concept for its battles; the loot you find, coins in this case, is also used to battle your foes. Coins can have different properties, like healing for 5 or 10 points, or doing 10 points of damage while taking 5 of your hitpoints. A fun concept that keeps things fresh. If you run out of coins it's game over. You have to be careful which coins you want to use and which ones you want to save as loot. Of course, all loot is randomized and there are several floors to go through. It's not a big game, I guess one can complete the game in roughly 30 minutes, if you're lucky enough. If you're not lucky enough, you'll at least earn experience points that can be used to unlock new classes that might you help during future playthroughs. The graphics are simple and all enemies are basically just textured rectangles, but it's cute to look at. The sounds didn't make much of an impression on me, but I guess it fits the game as far as style is concerned.Recommended for it's original take on the genre. Let's hope more stuff gets added in a later stage, because right now there's not really enough content.[Rating: 76/100]			"

								The best coin collecting simulator 2014Feels like a very original game concept, and it's very well executed.You go around a randomly generated dungeon hunting for coins, and at the same time you have to spend those same coins to perform attacks on enemies lurking in the dark of the dungeon. This creates a mechanic that I've never seen before, being a loot hoarder it is hard on me to part with my coins to be able to survive through the attacks and proceed through the dungeon!It also has unlockable characters with different set of bonuses that affect gameplay in different ways.Only real issue I have with it is that it's an obvious tablet/mobile port to PC, it's abundantly clear in the controls and it's a bit painful at times.Well worth the reasonable price :)			"

												Undoubtely one of the best Roguelike experiences you can get on Steam. I definitively recommend this game. Unique blend of features resulting in something new and original, yet somehow familiar and not easy to learn ( any game unlike I have ever played before is already a huge plus for me ) .Simple short game where features are extremely well matched and the replay value is enourmous. Makes you keep wanting one playthrough after another.			"

												I didn't get in on Coin Crypt until the official release, so I never got to see the development, but in its finished state the game is really damn fun. As you proceed through the game you unlock new characters with unique playstyles and strategies. It's also balls hard. Definitely worth the price of admission as far as I've played, and I'm sure I'm gonna keep going back to it for a while.UPDATE: Oh also there are a lot of secret. I'm still playing 3 months after writing the review and am still figuring out new things. I really love this game.			"

												As much as I tried, I could never really get into this game; the random nature of the coin drops/draws made this less a game of skill than of luck.  The art style is charming, the controls tight (yay controller support!), and there seems to be plenty of content.  Feel free to write this off as someone who just wasn't good enough, but I really just didn't have fun with this game... Delete			"

												I am in love with this game. It has such a unique concept that it makes it very fun to play. It's kind of like a card game but with coins. Since there are so many classes all with things that make them so different the game play doesn't get stale quickly. I like the art style but you should judge it for yourself by looking at some screen shots. Overall it's a great concept that was implemented well too. I'm surprised the game is not more popular.

												Note: I bought this from the humble bundle, so I did not pay $10 for this game alone.I will have to admit this is really unique, like who thought of this?? It's very fun and the graphics are so cute.So basically you're a ""lootmancer"" and you use coins which can attack/heal/and many others to use on enemies. As you start off the coins are pretty simple ""Attack 4"" ""Heal 4"" etc. but they end up getting advantages and disadvantes such as ""Attack 7 but Attack 2 on yourself"".Talking about advantages and disadvantages there are many characters to get/unlock which, as I said have advantages and disadvantes which really evens them out. Enemies are all different too, using certain coins having certain HP and etc.  In this game nothing is perfect and is more powerful than others. The pros and cons:Pros:- Really addictive- Super unique- Cute graphics- Tons of secrets- Lots of things to unlock- Developer updates often, which is rad- Randomly genertaed maps, meaning different gameplay each timeCons: - I have to admit that $10 is quite expensive for this game- Even though there are different generated maps it kinda feels repeatitive, (it's hard to explain it.)- In my opinon I can't play this game for a few hours straight, I can probably play a few games then quit as it gets boring if you keep playing a whole day. (but the next day it's fun again lmao)Ideas for the game:I only have one and that's to add online multiplayer! I know this is pretty big but imagine how cool it'd be!

												This is a surprizingly good deck-building game (not constructed).You fight monsters by playing cards (called ""coins"") that deal damage or heal you or a variety of other effects. When you kill a monster, their remaining cards are added to your deck. You die when your deck is empty and so do the monsters.There are a lot of classes that introduce interesting game mechanics.HIGHLY recommended for anyone looking for a rogue-like game that is easy to get into yet very fresh and interesting.

												A very fast-paced and unique take on the roguelike genre with a lot of elements that work to make every run VERY different. The actual content within each stage may feel sparse at first, but the strategy has a bent to it where every decision has large, long-reaching reprecussions. A large amount of classes, alternate routes, and different coins allows for significant replay value.			"

												Coin crypt is a rouge-like real time RPG game based around the usage of coins. Coins act as your way of attack mainly, but also are a sort of secondary health and currency in the game forcing you to use them wisely as running out of them is game over. The alternate characters in this game also change the way it's played entirely, such as making you use all the coins in your hand to do a lot more damage but also risk running out of coins faster, or removing the main way to get coins and replaces it with more coin drops from enemies. The game isn't too difficult for the most part, most of the potential challenge comes from the alternate characters abilities as mentioned. The overall game is pretty simple and my only compaints are that sometimes coin descriptions could be better and I'm not the biggest fan of the art style at times.But with everything the game brings to the table I have to say that this might become one of my favriote games.*dating this review* On humble bundle right now the game can be gotten for as low as 5$ along with a few other popular games, which is a good chance to get it even if you think you may not like it.

												This game is a gem. Visually it's adorable, and mechanically its comprehensive without being simplistic. The runs are fast, never lasting more than a half hour or so until you're much better at the game, and the difficulty curve is fair and rewarding to climb. They tend to introduce more complex mechanics to raise the difficulty instead of just increasing numbers. The diversity of characters along with the number of different coins and items that you can buy mean that no run ever really feels the same.My one complaint would be ther it does ♥♥♥♥-all to teach the player what is what. None of the icons or mechanics or anything are even kind of explain in a tutorial or tips system or anything. It just kind of assumes you'll figure it out or die. And to be fair, its not hard at all to figure it out. But still.♥♥♥♥♥♥move Coin Crypt.Other than that, its an amazing game.			"

												This is coming from a fan of cards games like Dominion and Magic.As a Dominion fan, I didn't think much of the game at first. Losing cards from your deck on cast was very frustrating - I decked out a lot when first playing. However, once I got used to the gameplay and unlocked a few classes, the game grew very fun. I especially enjoyed Executive and Demon. Excutive is a bit like milling in Magic the Gathering - you just steal their coins over and over until they have no library of coins and die. Demon is hilarious - you're basically inserting curse cards like in Dominion into their deck until it drowns them. It's utterly satisfying to kill a big stupid enemy just by watching them kill themselves with those self damage coins.The graphics etc are nothing special, but that isn't the point of a game like this. It's fun, deep, replayable, and worth giving a shot.			"

												Coin Crypt is a pretty fun game.At this point, i've played over 2 hours and beaten the game once.Story is short, the intro almost put me to sleep.Graphics aren't fantastic, the coins are well really done but everything else is a literal rectangle and eventually becomes an eyesore.Audio is okay. Music's starting to get repetitive, and i'm sure in a few more hours, it'll get unbearable.Gameplay is this game's saving grace. Pretty sure I haven't seen a tutorial, but it's pretty straightforward. It has turn-based card-style gameplay, but with a timer. The timer isn't there to pressure you into taking your turn, it's there because every coin played takes a certain amount of time to be ""cast"". Add in the mix of rather unique perma-buff/debuffs in the form of classes and unique coin effects -- it makes for a really different playthrough each time in terms of speed, strategy, and overall ""game feel""... That is, if you choose so.If you're familiar with rouge-likes and turn-based games, you'll probably enjoy what Coin Crypt has to offer -- A comfortable pace of progression with a battle system that'll keep you on your toes, even when you're not fighting.P.S. The game could use a little bit of clarification when it comes to effects. i.e. ""Is the debuff happening to me or the enemy?"" It might ruin a short run or two, but if you use context, i'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.			"

												A pretty simple but fun dungeon-crawler. Graphics and music are fine, there's no real story. You move room-to-room in a dungeon, collect coins (via chests and battles), spend coins (as attacks in battle, for powerups or more coins), and battle using the coin attacks. Floors are time-limited: if you spend too much time exploring, you'll start to drop coins until you leave.The god-tribute system isn't explained so I had to search the forums to have an idea what the point was. You can donate coins to gods and in return you'll randomly find bonus coins in chests and debuffed enemies in future levels. If you neglect gods, they'll power up enemies and potentially fight you at the end.There's a good amount of luck involved in this game (as is inherent in all card games) but there are some things that influence what is drawn. If you don't get the right coins in chests or draw the right coins in battle, you'll lose through no fault of your own. All you can do is try to maximize your chances and hope you get useful coins from chests.Worth a try if you think you'd like the game mechanics and are fine with losing and replaying it until you get a good run of luck to get to the end.

												I got Coin Crypt in a humble bundle and was just planning on using it as one of the games that my laptop can run without overheating after 15 minutes while I'm away from home and my PC, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is in fact an extremely fun little game.The graphics are nice, the soundtrack is repetitive but not in an irritating way and the mechanics are all well thought out and put together. You can easily sink a fair bit of time into this title and the game itself is about 56mb so it downloads fast on bad internet and will run on a potato.			"

												For what this game is, a simplistic RPG, it does its job. The game doesnt try to win you over with complicated graphics and deep strategy, but instead, it embraces what it is, an indie game with a fun and easy to learn style of play. Very good to pick up and play for half hour segments at a time, and the difficulty curve is just right so learning better strategy is fun and fair.			"

												It's a good game. Graphcis are nice and content seems plenty. I could do without the time pressure though, both on the overworld and in a fight, to apply more strategy. But I guess you can't have it all.Subjective: ★★★★★Objective: ★★★★★ — Graphics: ★★★ — Content: ★★★ — Handling: ★★★http://played.today/coin_crypt.html

			The game I played today is called Coin Crypt. A dungeon crawler sans dungeon where you use coins to attack but also to buy stuff. It's a good game. Graphcis are nice and content seems plenty.

												If games where chemical compounds this one would be pure crack.I have to say this is the most fun addictive RPG I have played in years, the strategy is great, the difficulty is very challenging  and each time you go a bit farther and get a bit better.The only thing is lacking is a bit of story telling or dialog, I would like to see small dialogs between the diverse characters and the main enemies in the game and having a background of each main character included in the game (as oposed to reading them in the website).If I where to compared it I would say this game is  like  ""The binding of Isaac""  with RPG mechanics and a brigther tone with more cheery and diverse enemies.It's great, it's cheap , it will bring a huge amount of fun hours and ""I just ♥♥♥♥ed up"" moments to your life.Update, Sea and Sky: The update added a lot of new challenges for us that wanted to replay this game again, I loved it, added more creative coins and more fun. Still one of the most creative and addictive RPGs you will find in steam.			"

												This game is so addictive it looks very simple, but definitely not easy. You have the default guy in the beginning, just roam through the world, fight monsters gain powers open chests buy new items etc.. you collect magic coins if i can say so,  that are basically like cards with a lot of different abilities. In fight you are basically pulling the right or the wrong moves, there's no pause in fight, you get limited time to think your move so think quick and smart, there are a lot of character to unlock with gold after each death or i guess if you finish the game, which i'm planning..that's it i need to go to sleep i have to work tomorrow, ok now its the last time if i die i'm going to bed..just died again, hm maybe try new unlocked character? Sure why not! I'm prity sure this game will entertain me for hours to come so i'm recommending it!			"

												Coin Crypt is a really fun little game that actually requires some strategy and memorization of coins.  The game starts off kind of confusing as there is really no tutorial at all. You may die a lot, or may be a god at the game already, but as you keep playing, you gain experience on how the coins interact and stuff.  Coin conservation and partioning becomes more important and quick use of coins helps you win battles as the timer keeps ticking even if you dont pick.  Also as you play, more and more coins and enemies are ""unlocked"" and more and more playable characters are unlocked as well. Since this game is roguelike, each playthrough is different to a degree with random generation but predictable levels. Overall this game was a load of fun and I thank humble bundle for this game.Rating: 8.7/10			"

												First off, this is my wife's favorite game, even though she has never played it, entirely because of the opening theme music. I would recommend this game as a fun, though sometimes challenging rogue-like romp, bringing together the constant threat of permanent death with a light-hearted playfulness.The game attempts to present itself without tutorial or much explanation, evoking the enigmatic feeling of many games in the NES era, and does so mostly successfully. (I did do some wiki-ing about the gods after a few days, as this was somewhat opaque to me). The basic strategy of the game unfolds into a fairly rich and varied system as you unlock new classes and learn how to synergize class talents with the other elements of the game. While some classes can be made into powerhouses quite easily, others seem destined for failure. Though at first I felt the obvious imbalances of the classes was a flaw in the design, I now feel like this helps lend the game its particular charm. For such a small game, this has remarkable replay value. I am not generally a completionist, and after a few winning runs, I figured I was about done with the game. And yet, several months later, I still find myself coming back to Coin Crypt for a few runs here and there, trying to finally win with one of the more ""challenged"" classes. My one complaint might be that it feels like as soon as I get a good run going, I win, and there's not much room to utilize the full capabilities of the character I've been building. Ultimately, this game is never going to be something you can obsess over. It's fun, it's fast paced, very cute, at times difficult, but is never going to require extensive theory-crafting, and I think the developer wanted it that way. Depending on what you're looking for, this could be a good or a bad thing.I also recently bought the DLC/expansion. If you liked the game and wanted more of the same, that's what it is. More content, but the same basic feel. New classes seem interesting. If you were bored with the base game, then the DLC probably won't change that, but if you were still enjoying the base game, then the expansion will provide you with new content and more play styles to choose from.All in all, I recommend the game, and give a neutral recommendation for the DLC. One of the favorites I've purchased in a while. Something fun and light-hearted; enough strategic depth to keep you engaged but not so much as to give you a headache. Good replay value and your wife will love the music.			"

								I uhh... love this game immensely.Until the evening of my writing this, I've been looking at this game in the indie marketplace time and time again, over and over, always wondering why it mystified me.Admitedly I impulse bought it to finally scratch that itch (An activity I honestly hate doing on Steam these days)It was truely love at first playthrough, if you'll excuse my gushyness.  This game was made for me down to a science.There are a ton of systems going on in this gem of a Rogue-like (A word I am using to skip over the obvious about the level generation/enemy layouts/item drops/yada yada).`Real time pillar crawling/evasive maneuvers to avoid combat sequences and a very effective fog of war that makes crawling a tenative and fun as hell experience`Combat sequences that have you use randomly drawn coins to the best of your abilities.  Each selection has serious ramifications for the rest of your playthrough (for soooo many reasons)  You will need to familiarize yourself with the coins you carry, because the enemies aren't going to stand around watching you decide what your best move is all night long.  Moving fast is the name of the game... right?`The coins used in combat also serve as your currency on passive-boost items, healing station fodder, ect.`For those who are familiar with deck building games, the coins in your inventory can be discarded and/or traded to Gods for coins of lesser value (or none, for the sake of removing dead weight)`Let's call it stressful fun, trying to not spend enough so that you can feel safe moving down to harder depths, whilst being tempted by shopkeepers with shiny treasures, and shortly afterwards feeling remorse when you don't have any coins for combat purposes.  Or perhaps just the wrong coins.  `Don't leave yourself without any attack coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't leave yourself without any heal coins or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't dilude your inventory with too many conflicting ideas amongst your coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.`You're ♥♥♥♥ed.`Coins you carry through to the end of the game (Be it your trumph or demise) are used to spend on unlocking additional classees with different play styles.  Characters have their own unique benefits and drawbacks.There's a lot more to be said, but what I would like to put out there is this:This game is seriously impressive and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it			"

												Similar Games:Binding of Isaac, The Original Legend of Zelda, and to a lesser degree PokemonThe Good:Absolutely enjoyable “pickup & play” game mechanicsEnemy battles are fun and frantic with a very strong roshambo feel to themCombat consists of each combatant using their bag of coins against each other, but only a handful of coins are given to choose from during each “turn”Battles happen in real time (loosely similar to Final Fantasy X in execution), but there is a delay between drawing a handful of a coins from your bagCoin types can be attack based, defense based, or support based and same coins can stack to be extra potentThe a fore mentioned battle system may seem complex, but it really adds a brilliant level of tactics to the top down PDL genreCoin Crypt uses a charming chip-tune soundtrack that would be at home with Nintendo games of oldThe music feels like it would end up being grating, but I found that not to be the caseThe lighting technique is very similar to Monaco, which is to say that the game only shows areas of the map that are visible to your avatar.Being that this is a top-down perspective game, it really assists in the feeling of discovery as you turn a corner in a dungeonDifferent player classes can be unlocked, which add to the level of strategy when playing the gameMost of them have a balanced advantage/disadvantage methodology behind themFor example one class allows you to get more loot, but at the expense of occasionally dropping coins from your bagWhile the game is similar to Binding of Isaac in gameplay, which is a big plus in my opinion, the content is thankfully much tamerI am aware that this may be a negative to someThe Bad:While the developer is certainly churning out hefty content patches pretty consistently, it still feels like there should be additional content and a (minor spoilers) more robust finaleI’d like to point out, as there was some mild drama recently, that “Redlight, Greenlight?” reviews games for its current state, so I’m very well aware that this will most likely be addressed before final releaseObtained items take up too much of the valuable screen space (This appears to have since been addressed)It would be nice to have the game remember my last play-session’s class choice when restarting the gameA room identification system would be helpful on the mini-mapFor example: remembering exactly where a merchant was can add unnecessary wandering time to your play-throughWhile the interactive menu screen is unique and nifty, after a handful of dungeon-crawls it can be a mild nuisance to have to walk into a room to change a setting and/or classPerhaps the game will eventually incorporate an option, for those of us with ADHD, to bring up a menu screen with a button pressCan you play it while the children are awake?:Yes, you can.  The game has a “cartoonish” quality to the character/environment design, which really appeals to those of us that have nostalgia for games past.  This also means that little ones can enjoy and watch the game too.Did I make time to complete it?Yes and  I imagine that I will find myself playing this game numerous times throughout its development.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.$4.99 is a steal for a game with this kind of content.  My “bad” comments above boil down to nothing more than recommendations.  While a lot of Coin Crypt’s general gameplay elements borrow moderately from a number of other games, the strategy present in this title makes it stand out of its own merit.  Even if development stopped at this point, the game would be well worth the asking price.Reviewer:MisterS42http://www.gamersglance.com "

								Coin Crypt is a randomly-generated roguelike where coins act as currency and items. Every action you take in battle is decided by coins, and your options each turn are a random set of coins drawn from your coin pouch. The emphasis on money having value beyond just the shop presents an interesting dynamic, and makes for a really interesting game.This game is really cool, you should get it.			"

												Very unique roguelike!  You use coins to do everything in the game- attack, defend, buy things, etc.  A lot of different characters to play as well- all of which have pros and cons.  This isn't just a mindless ""kill everything"" roguelike either. You lose if you run out of health or run out of coins! So you must decide if you are going to save the coins, or buy an item with the hopes it wont mess you up later.Update (August 18)- game is out of early access and game maker is still providing great content updates to the game!

								Merging your in-battle abilities with your available loot is a pretty interesting twist on the usual roguelike. The battle interface is pretty simple and easy to grasp, but the many different types of coins and classes add a lot of depth and the need to strategise.In a way it's lighter than the standard roguelike because you don't have to fuss around with different stats like elemental resistances/strengths or physical/magical damage, and neither do you have to fool around with accessories or potions. It's a nice simple, yet exciting & fresh game in its own right.The game mechanics are still being fiddled around with, but at this stage it's already pretty playable, letting you sink a few hours in at a go.

Go into first person view with 3 coins in my hand.No idea what im doing but there is a countdown circle over the other guys hand.Panic and choose random coins from my hand.Guy dies.I won i guess.Take his remaing coins.Repeated till i met a big guy who kicked my butt.Start again feeling enlightend.10/10 would throw coins at people again.

												This game, is hands down, one of the most fun games i've played in awhile.So, lets get to the nitty gritty. This game doesn't come with a pre-game tutorial, long explanations about what each coins ability and how to ""build your deck"", or explanation about the world. You've given a very short intro and then thrown into the world of Coin Crypt. My initial reaction while watching my friend play was, ""Wow, this is stupid."" But, after trying it out myself, I became addicted really, really fast. And, after playing through and (finally) beating the game, I have to say that this is going to be a long time favorite of mine.The Good:+Simple- It's so, so simple to start playing this game. Don't get it, don't worry, you will. It doesn't take long to pick up and the interface, level design, combat system and everything else is very straight forward.+Engrossing- This little game sucks you in reallllly quick. Before you know it, you've unlocked 8 new characters and half the day is gone. And all of the hidden treasure boxes, secret tunnels, hidden bosses and fun twists keeps the game interesting.+Controller Friendly!- Just plug in your xbox controller (or logitech/other) and get playing. Was really nice to play from the couch.+Replayability- I don't feel like i'm trying to complete the same task over and over again with each retry. The levels present (usually) the same creeps, but there is a bit of randomization that goes on so you're not stuck having to hit the same wall over and over again.The Bad:-In-Game Options/Menu: So, if you want to change from fullscreen to windowed, you have to do it at ""options book"" in the beginning island. You can't just hit start/esc and change something on the fly. I found this really, really, really inconvienent. It's quirky, sure, but the design is poor. -No pause during combat: Ok, I get not wanting to add a pause option since you could just keep pausing to think through you next move, but when you need to leave to go do something and you die since you can't pause, that's just bad. -Music: The music is actually pretty decent, but the settings for it aren't. Even on the lowest setting, its pretty loud. When I was voip, I could barely hear anything outside of the games music. So, sadly, I ended up just turning it off. Overall: 8/10			"

												I didn't play this for very long after realizing how random it really was. You have very little control over a variety of factors and this leads to frustrating gameplay that isn't very satisfying. The biggest feeling of success you have is either 'I got some good coins!' or 'I sure did get lucky on those draws for me and the enemy'. Overall I wouldn't recommend this even for roguelike fans. An interesting asthetic, but poor gameplay where you feel like you have no control.			"

								It's part dungeon crawler and part deckbuilding game. The classes are interesting and affect your playstyle greatly, adding a lot of variety to a fairly simple concept. This is one of the best little indie games I've played. You can easily jump on and play for 5 minutes or get sucked into it for a couple hours.  If you're curious I'd check it out. Don't let the goofy graphics turn you off, they work for what the game is and kinda grow on you after a bit.			"

												I liked this game. I don't remember buying it, so I must have gotten it as a Humble Bundle. I played it thinking it would not be any good, but it really surprised me. There are choices all over, from the character you play, where you go and especially what coins to pick up. The coins are like a big collectible card game, essentially, and you will unlock a bunch as you play. Strategy is key, but there is also randomness and twitchiness at play. The developer also made a lot of changes as it goes, adding a lot of coins and content to the base game. It's not even sold as an early release game, so they obviously care about it instead of moving on to the next project.The graphics are OK to fairly good. Maybe it could use some umph in that department to add the wow factor, I guess. The music, however, is awesome. It changes with different environments and is enjoyable.I've beaten it with the demon character (easiest, I think, once you figure out the tricks involved) and a few others. Different characters need different strategies. There's even a monkey!I picked up the DLC for it finally during the winter sale, so if you pay extra you know it's a good game. Total surprise, but there you are.			"

												In this game about collecting coins and using them as tools to achieve victory, you will:-Lose because you didn't have enough coins-Lose because you had too many coins-Lose because someone stole all your coins-Lose because you drew the wrong coins-Lose because all of your coins were replaced with coins that make you hurt yourself-Lose because you tried to gather all the coins on a floor only to realize spending time costs you coins-Lose because you raced through levels to conserve coins and then didn't have enough coins-Lose because you gave all your coins to gods so they didn't screw you-Lose because you didn't give your coins to gods, so they screwed you-Lose because your class is too weak to carry coins-Lose because your class forgot how to heal-Lose because your class habitually drops coins-Lose because your class uses all coins all the timeRoguelite, I get it, but come on.  There's probably a decent game in here, but I just don't understand why they hate their own mechanic so much.  It's all so random that player input just feels like it's there because it's a game, and not because the player actually has anything of value to add.On the upside, the controls allow you to smoothly navigate towards failure.  Loads of classes to lose with.  Visuals make failing cute looking. Could use a tutorial.			"

												Battles are in real-time. So your succes in combat depends on quick decison making.When you are analysing the stats/items of your opponent in battle and observing your coin(=weapon) set to create a strategy, in that timeframe the opponent already attacked you.You can only use a given small amount of random coins(weapons) from your inventory at the beginning of the battle which ruins your pre determined strategy.

								This is the best game to play when youre bored. The music isn't too distracting nor does it ever get old, and it's a fresh new idea for a roguelike. I mean, battling with coins? Like yugioh or something? Who would think, right? The more coins you earn the more you can spend in unlocking other characters which also is unique because you don't need all the coins at once to unlock a character. It's like a progress bar. I love the blocky art style for the game, usually I'm not fond of that kind of art, but for Coin Crypt it just fits like a glove. Best thing in the game are the cat towers and the secret rooms.			"

												A very weird but fun game.I quite like the battle mechanics and how you spend precious attacks (coins) to gain more, checking chests to find loot (coins aka attacks/skills) and just... do whatever you can to gain more coins.When you die you get paid in cash for the coins you gathered. Said money can be spend on new unlockable characters (including a monkey, just like the storepage said!! Yay!) But... from what I see, that's about it.In the end, I do like the mechanics but I can't get myself to like the game itself.The enemies look kinda nice, but inconsistent. You encounter a Magician... and then a Ghost... and then a Mimic ... and suddenly a Pirate. And what about a story? Why am I on that Island... and suddenly in dungeons and forests? Just what is going on and why?A roguelike game doesn't -need- to have a story, or be consistent, but those things keep me going. The Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy are good examples for that. Tough, always different, just a bit of a story which unfolds to be bigger than expected.And even if this turns out to be bigger than expected... I won't get there.PS. If available on iOS/Android: Go get it there. It'd be a nice game for on the go with little to no story, quick rounds but lots of unlockables and the mechanics are perfect for touch controls.If it's not available on mobile devices: Why the heck not? Kind of a letdown.			"

								I WAS very passionate about this game and everyone in my family played this game with great glee...UNTIL THE UPDATEThe update added a changed system which basically divided all values by 2.5 and it just made everything so much weirder and so unnecessary. The original coin values were Mainly in increments of 5 and made quick maths so much easier. No my brain has to attempt to decipher how much of such and such a coin is required to knock the enemy to kingdom come. I'm NOT stupid and I am in top-set maths BUT I find this update unnecessary and infuriating. It was so much better before :sfsmile:I DO love the mechanics of this game. I DO love the creativity and individual style of this game. I DID love the graphics (they're a bit broken now) and I ADORE the music (Much love to the composer) I hope this review serves also as a report to the dev as I've no idea how to send a report to him. I hope he knows how much I LOVE this game but, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GO BACK TO EASY VALUES!!!!!Bugs:When entering a secret area you may sometimes keep entering and exiting accidentally'Coin Failed' happens WAY to often, even with a single stackEDIT: The new update has added some cool stuff but the dev still needs to decide whether he wants the battle system to be turn-based or fast because currently it's in between ideas and has the worst of both worlds (no offence)ANOTHER EDIT: The Dev is amazing, they've changed the graphics to look awesome and charming and the coin system rebalances are great. I do however, hate playing thief and getting one-shotted by a reaper coin but oh well, nevermind. I have come to like the coin system and it's quite good :) Well worth the priceAll Ratings are Out Of 10 (x/10)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|Point-----------|---Before update---|---After Update---|---SUPER UPDATE----||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------||Graphics-------|----------8---------|----------7----------|-----------10--------||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------||Sounds---------|---------9----------|----------9----------|----------9----------||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------||Gameplay-----|-----------8----------|--------4---------|----------7------------||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------||Control---------|----------9----------|---------9---------|-----------8----------||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------||Ingenuity------|----OVER 9000----|----OVER 9000-----|-----OVER 9000-----||---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|OVERALL RATING Before: 8.7                             After  :   5                             After After: 9 p.s This table took me AGES so please rate up if it helped :)			"

												Unique roguelike experience with serious resource management where coins are your currency, your weapons, your healing potions and ultimately if you run out, your life.You receive coins from beating enemies and from chests. The random nature of everything makes the game a little annoying at times. You feel you've built a strong character and a good coin collection, but get a little unlucky a few times in a row and that's it. There are also so many different types of coin that memorising them becomes a little difficult.Overall it's a great game that you can easily sink 20+ hours into, and a lot more if you have the patience. Avoid if you don't like RNG though.7/10			"

												Good game. I feel like it might be to niche and a little to hard for the majority of people. Ok so a little update because I mostly enjoy the game. I have played this for some time now. You have to donate to a god to to get anywhere. You can try it solo but good luck to you. I do find the game still to be a tad to hard for your average player. I still do not fully understand Trade Coins. I did have to do some investigating to figure out how  the god system works. The game could do with a tip system.. Really needed for the gods. The game can be fun provided your willing to do some homework on this game.So for my tips and what I have learned. Give money to one god and give it a good sum and keep at giving it coins your not goiong to use. Running away is sometimes the only way to fight another day. I should also mention this game is easy on the eyes and I do enjoy the sounds as well. Just one more update. I currently have every character unlocked. Played 10 hours and made it some what far did not kill the head honcho . Doubt I will play anymore its just to hard for me to enjoy.  For those that have made it to end you have my hearty congrats. I just couldnt take getting beaten like a drum every game.			"

Cute cartoony visuals and upbeat music wraps the player in a warm snug blanket of rogue like love but the limited inventory mechanics leave their feet sticking out in the cold holding back a great experience.Fight monsters with a wide arrangement of coins each that represent an ability but if you run out you lose!  These coins are also used as currency during each run making it very difficult to stay in the positive.  The stacking of coins and time to use offers a lot of great options, if not for the heavy cost of doing business keeping the game from being great.			"

												Pretty neat. Cool graphics but low res/buggy looking. Would look better on a phone's screen but controls best with a mouse. Text is a bit hard to read because of the font. DLC would have been better off included in the game and would have made the game feel a bit more finished/rounded out.Fun looking game, Gameplay is weird, but doesn't quite make a lot of sense. You use coins as weapons but... what happens when you have no coins or none that can be used to attack enemies? neat game.			"

												It's fun for a while. Until you realize this is another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥entirely luck based- indie game.Since all you do depends on the coins you get from enemies and loot, the quality of your game depends on the drops.As is always the case in this luck-based garbage, and contrary to any common sense and good game design, the more you unlock the harder the game becomes, because there's even less chance that you'll get what you need in a particular moment, and because there's no ""game director ai"", this basically happens 100% of the plays.And don't be fooled: if you think that proper altar offerings, proper coin collection matter... they don't. They'll just allow a few more steps forward, and then entirely out of luck a wrong hand will cost you the game.Play this if you have a couple of hours to waste, and then uninstall.It becomes a disgusting, unrewarding chore after that time, fit for those masochists of today that mistake indie game stupid, entirely random difficulty as ""skill"".

												Coin Crypt is an addicting, Rogue-like, Cartoony, Indie RPG that isn't that unique. Now, I really only ever play it when I am bored, like games such as Curse of Mermos.In Coin Crypt, you play as a lootmancer. A lootmancer is someone who can unlock the hidden power inside of coins and use them in magical duels. This isn't that unique. Now, the objective of the game is to get to the end of each level. Again, not that unique. The ony unique thing about this game is it's art style. I really like this games art style, it's nice, and friendly. But, like I said with Clicker Heroes, (by the way, this game is no where NEAR as bad as Clicker Heroes), the art style is the only thing good about it.Overall, this game isn't bad. I just wouldn't recommend playing it. This game is okay, at best. if you do like it, that's fine. I just personally don't, mostly because it's just one of those games you play when you are bored. But, hey, if you wanna buy it, go right ahead.			"

								I had an absolute blast playing this game and showing it off on my stream.  The viewers seemed to enjoy the fun of it as well.  It is a very interesting Roguelike game where the way you die is either by losing your hp or running out of coins.  So prepare to laugh from pure enjoyment or scream in pure frustration as you learn what all of the different coins can do.  I also absolutely love the amount of different playable characters that all have their own unique ability that changes your strategy greatly.  If you get this game you will have a huge amount of fun time ahead of you.. and the game is just 5 bucks.. how can you beat that?!			"

								The game itself it pretty good. A nice roguelike with tricky combat and trading systems combined.Damn hard as well (or maybe it is me who's bad xD).But at the moment (last upd. 5 May 2014) the game has some fiddly sides to it, mostly due to fact that it looks like it was developed for mobile devices. Hopefully that gets fixed.More details in the video:

												Coin Crypt, a mix between a rouge-like and a cardgame (but with coins. duh!) and with some ""cute"" Super mario 3 like topdown graphics. You really can't go wrong with those preferences can you?So the basics of the game is to collect different coins that you use in duels agains various enemies, some of the coins do damage and some do other mysterious things, and the core of the game is to know which coin to use and when. Mind you that if you run out of coins during a duel you will ""die"" and it's game over. When you die though you get to use your accumulated points to buy new playable characters like the thief, monkey or wizard (and around 10 more)A fun jump in and jump out kind of game were a round dosn't take that long.Check out our let's play here!

												Quite like the idea of building your own deck, however the real-time nature of combat makes this very frustrating... I don't feel that I have enough time to weigh the pros and cons of playing this or that card (once a card is played, it is removed permanently from your deck).. Instead I feel punished if I take my time thinking me decision through, as the AI isn't waiting for me to decide and instead pummels me. And if I don't take my time to think it through, I often end up throwing good cards away. With some sort of a turn-based combat, this could've been a fanstastic game.			"

												First impression:- Cool. It uses gamepad.- Hey, some people over there!- Awesome! There are multiple characters I could use!- Except they require an expansion I don't have...- Okay! Walking through a forest!- There's an enemy!- I guess this is the attack button?- Am I meant to memorise these icons?- Is combat turn-based? There's a Slowing coin, but would I be just better off selecting actions faster?- There's a wall over there.- I can't see any keys.- (a bit later after fighting a bunch of enemies and wondering if I'll run out of attack coins) Oh, apparently I have a key.- There's a chest here, which has a key. - Why can't I grab the key?- I'll just come back for it, I guess?- I only grabbed 1 of 2 coins, but now the chest appears empty? Does that mean I missed out on the key entirely?(I then died to what I think was a fake chest, and didn't get a chance to go back and try to get that second key.)Maybe the game would grow on me if I played it more. It's probably great once you get into it.But when the first thing I see is something forbidden to me unless I spend money, and there doesn't appear to be any sort of tutorial - or at least, none that I encountered - it doesn't make for the beginnings of an immersive game experience.If I get back into the game and it's fun, I'll certainly change this review. But my first death happened 7 minutes in, and I still hadn't figured out the basics.Even something like having coins tend to show up in certain positions on the gamepad would have been helpful. Make it so that Attacks (red) are more likely to be on B, make it so Healing abilities (blue) are more likely to be on X, make it so Shields/Armor abilities (green) are more likely to be on A. That way I'm not constantly having to stop and double-check that I'm using the correct ability each and every turn, as the +4dmg Attack ability constantly bounces around between buttons each time I would get to use it.At the end, I had an opportunity to spend coins towards unlocking 3 characters. I'm not sure if those were the same characters I saw at the start which required the expansion or not, but pressing A (and expecting to be sent to the next screen) started funnelling coins into one of them. A pity I was more interested in unlocking one of the other characters that showed up on-screen, and there didn't appear to be any way to undo the effects of that button press.The game has potential, but I'm just not given enough information - and I shouldn't have to go and quickly Google a new player's guide in order to figure out wtf I'm meant to be doing in a game. The game should be able to explain that for itself.			"

												The game is okay-ish. It's the quality of a flash game coupled with mechanics of a bad take on rogue-like.The gamplay is like a very, very basic tcg. Cards deal damage or heal. The ammount of luck that is outside of your control is killing the game for me. You often face far to strong enemies at a bad time or don't get enough healing and just die because of random effects like these.			"

												I really don't understand how this currently has 95% positive reviews.  The game basically boils down to 'who can one-shot faster'.  Last run I got hit for 26 damage (your max health is 10) within one second of starting the battle on the fourth stage.  I don't see how that's challenging or interesting.  Likewise, your character usually does anywhere from 4-50 damage to things that have 10-20 health.  Battles rarely last more than a couple rounds.  Your character and options are mostly the same throughout a playthrough.  You get different coins, but they're barely different and only slightly more powerful.  But the worst part is that there are so many different coins (I think over 100) that you can't possibly know what they all do, but you're constantly under a timer with zero leeway, so you can't even read what they do.  You're wind up just clicking and hoping it was a good one.It's not all bad: it's basically a deck building game with constant influx and outflux of cards.  That's a pretty fresh take, and was mildly interesting.The big problem is there just isn't a whole lot of meat to the game.  Unlock a ""good"" character and you can breeze through no matter what.  Otherwise, it's just random how far you'll make it.  Sometimes you get good coins and can breeze through.  Sometimes you get crap coins and don't make it past the second floor.Overall, it was interesting for a couple hours.  I don't think anyone could get more than that out of it.  5/10.  For me it's a pass on recommending it.  I got it in a bundle and wouldn't have played it otherwise.  There are much better roguelites out there.  If the battle system let you actually process what was going on better (i.e. didn't have a constantly running timer), I'd give it a 7/10.  Combat's far too spammy and unsatisfying to really get into it.			"

												The idea is pretty unique, but the gameplay lacks of depth and content.Pros:+ very unique gameplay, havent seen this before (slight comparison to Final Fantasy mechanics maybe)+ simplistic in visuals, yet appealing+ good controller layout and supportCons:- the game feels great at beginning, while exploring the coin effects and outcomes, but it lacks even more when you   have seen them all- variety of coins is pretty lackluster, they just vary in the slightest like: Hit for 2 - Hit for 4 There could have been way more clever ones- the randomness is barely noticeable......everything feels the same- I didnt like the shop mechanics, purchasing something almost always meant death later on, as you chip in your coins, that you need to battle- power ups didnt feel like they help alot.....- fighting felt way too random, as I often ran out of damage coins and was left for dead, by the games randomness - which was no fun at all, I cant play a strategy here- I couldnt get a feel of progression even though I go far into the levels, there was no real reward.- some characters are bound to be never played, as they suck so hardOverall it was neat for a couple of minutes, but there are way too many great rogue-likes, to waist your time on an overpriced game with lack of content and depth.

												This one was pretty meh, so thank the dark lord Cthulhu for Humble Bundle. Coin Crypt is an indie, rogue-like RPG from Dumb and Fat Games.The GoodThe concept of the game is pretty cool. Your character is a “Lootmancer” and the coins that you pick up during your questing become the actions that you can take during combat.I was a fan of the vibrant color scheme.The BadNo formal tutorial made this game a bit difficult to figure out.Your starting character is very squishy and is made even more squishy by the lack of tutorial ensuring that you’ll go into the game not knowing what the hell is going on.The MehCoin Crypt didn’t implement it’s concept of gameplay very well. I believe I had this same complaint about another game recently as well.For those of you who have played Phantom Dust (one of my all time most favorite games), Coin Crypt kind of echoes that style of gameplay in a way. But it’s more like the tail end of an echo travelling through the Grand Canyon.Verdict: NayIf you get it through a Humble Bundle or (better) for free, sure, Coin Crypt is alright. Otherwise, I wouldn’t waste your money on this one. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Not really compelling.  No tutorials, which is basically unforgiveable in this day and age.  Also no widescreen support or video options that I could find.  It seems like a roguelike RPG where everything is based on coins, you heal, fight, unlock chests all using coins, which are also your currency.  Cute but it starts to wear on you pretty quickly.			"

												No tutorial! Not even a help screen! And for a bizarre game where you ""draft"" a bag of coins and have only seconds to respond in combat! The game is also buggy - I started off playing with an Xbox controller, I got stuck in a book in the game that indicated I needed to press LB to exit it, and showed an animation when I pressed that button, but didn't actually let me continue in the game until I switched to the mouse. (Clearly a great couch game! /s) Xbox controller support is generally pretty awkward. Looking through your bag of coins and want to read what a new one does? The obvious choice would be to let you select a coin with the joystick or arrow keys and then show a description for whichever one you selected but not here! No, instead, each coin is assigned a particular directional key to highlight it, perhaps because the dev has a bet with some programmer friends to design the worst UI ever. Also the banner that indicates a coin is new covers up the name of the button you need to press to use it. Yeah, just stick with the mouse...I'm used to rough-around-edges deck building games (I've put dozens of hours into Dream Quest) and I this game still seems promising, but it desperately needs some improvement.

								Did not like the update at all.1. Error message pops up around level 2 when trying to switch to next map.2. Character abilities much too difficult to use and not as much fun.3. Why are coins worth so little now?4. Actually liked the music for the first version.5. Why are there no secret rooms? Or if there are, where are they?6. Combat mode is harder to see with distracting background.Although I did enjoy the new look with new maps, coins, and villains but the new formats were less than satisfactory. "

Early Access Review
								Looking at an early access top down procedurally generated rogue-like, you'd be forgiven for thinking this is just like every other game currently on steam. But, Coin Crypt has an original twist that adds strategy, and enough polish to elevate it above most of the dross early access throws at people now-a-days.In this game, your battle moves are tied to coins. Once you use that coin on attacking, healing or any other move, it disappears. Every coin also has a monetary value that can be used to trade at a variety of points throughout the game. What all of this means is that you always need something, keeping every game exciting. If either side runs out of coins in battle, they lose, but if you defeat an enemy before they run out, you get all of the coins they haven't used. So you always have to becareful with your choices in and out of battle. You might end up with a bag full with attacks just when you're hanging on 3 hp and desparately need a heal, or a bag full of heal coins that limit your attack options significantly and leaves you to wait for the enemy to run out of coins, but then you don't get any attacks from the enemy at the end of battles!But most of the coins don't come from enemies, but from chests. You can only pick a limited number of coins from chests, giving you more choices to make. As the game goes on, more coins of different types get introduced with the enemies and chests, altering your deck to have more coin diversity. Naturally for rogue-likes, you will die quite a bit. When you die or win a run you get to spend the coins you got throughout the run into unlocking new characters. Every character plays differently but most if not all of them aren't objectively better than others. You unlock your first classes quite quickly to experiment with but the more you unlock, the more expensive they get. This is the game's way to give a purpose to each playthrough, some people will like it, and some will want a more substantial meta game. There are over 14 classes so to those who do care it will take quite a bit of play to unlock all of them!This is what early access should be, Coin Crypt was already functional from the first time it arrived on steam and has only improved ever since.So, yeah, this is worth a buy!

								Low-tech stressful coin management roguelike game. Harder than Chinese arithmetic. If that's not your thing, stay far away. If that -IS- your thing, prepare yourself for a whole lot of ""just one more game!""s. :btw I think this would make a good WiiU game. Use the touchpad for selecting coins! Wave the pad around for movement, like one of those old ball-in-the-maze games!			"

There are also 20 different classes to play as, which all offer their own unique set of challenges and advantages. This game is difficult and has a massive amount of replayability. It has 6 different bosses for each path/difficulty (12 bosses total). Lots of unlockables which include new coins, classes, and more difficult enemy types.

												Coin Crypt is a nice fun game to play a few minutes (or hours) at a time. Yeah.That's it. Not much to it.It's just a fun game to play, easy to pick up, and just takes up a lot of your time. Every run is different, level-wise. You probably won't get the same exact run two times in a row. You can do a lot of things. You can donate to only one god in one run, you can try only using certain coins in another run. You can just joke around and choose a card at random if you want. As you play this game, you can choose whether you want to save up your coins for a god, or to save that one key for a chest or another location that's blocked off. The whole game is full of these situations between your fights against others only using these coins. The further you get into the game, the more characters you can unlock. Each character has different abilities, or stats that make each of them unique. Go try to do runs with different characters if you want.Yeah, that's it. Yeh. Yeah. Yee. 6.5/10			"

												Coin Crypt is an ambitious title that actually delivers in terms of replay value and fun factor.  The core mechanics are familiar but the game as a whole is so unique that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh.  The art direction is remniscent of a cel-shaded Minecraft-inspired Wonderland.  It's a real treat exploring this world each and every run.I'm actually very surprised that I never heard anyone talking about this game on any podcast, stream, or video.  Games like Coin Crypt, Crypt Of The Necrodancer, Speedrunners, and Dungeon Of The Endless take huge risks doing something very different..  But they are not merely noteworthy because they're different.  These are games that are TONS of fun and great to go back to any time.Admittedly, the only thing missing from Coin Crypt is some sort of online support or multiplayer.  I reckon this hidden gem got overlooked because it is a singleplayer experience.  I see they released DLC in 2015 so, hopefully, this game gets more of a cult following and steady updates to revitalize interest.  It's a game I can't recommend enough if you dig exploration, dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes, or just charming/cute games that are clever AND fun!			"

(A coin can cleanse these effects as a counter to this, but the coin is too expensive/uncommon to be able to balance this particular example of bad design)--I highly recommend this game to someone who enjoys the hardcore experience of a Roguelike but is not interested in any more platformer Roguelikes.

												With its cute and simple art style, and easy to grasp gameplay, Coin Crypt is one of the best indie games I've seen this year. Its relatively easy playstyle allows casual gamers to enjoy it, yet its also challenging for a hardcore gamer too. The whole coin combat system is unique, and I dont think ive seen something quite like it.

												To begin with; This is probably my favorite, simple game yet. Coin Crypt is rouge like looting game about collecting coins for battle. These coins are your offensive/defensive weapons that are spent to use their special qualities; they vary from plain damage, to casuing status effect to one or both parties. During battle the base player will be given a choice of 3 random coins from you bag to use. Some coins take longer to use than others and when two or three of the same coins are picked they will be use at the same time. One may also swap out their coins for a new set, but it takes time to swap them out, which leaves you vulnerable.Each coin have their own values; you can use these values to buy items from shops, or give them to statues, to please a diety.Along the way you find more coins to use in battle / more monsters to fight / and more players with their own unique traits.Favorite class is Demon			"

												A really cool rougelike that features CCG elements. You collect coins from chests and enemies while exploring a dungeon. Each coin has a different effect that you draw randomly from your bag. If your HP hits zero or you run out of coins its game over, you can defeat enemies either way as well. Battles are in real time. Each coin has a timer of many beats it takes to cast. Your enemy is also casting coins based on a timer. You can cast multiple coins if they are the same kind (a stack) but you lose everything you cast so managing your bag is important. Also if you want to donate coins to a deity or buy something from a shop you will need to spend your coins. The game is pretty easy to get into. And should be great for both fans of rougelikes and deckbuilder/card battle games. With plenty of charecters to unlock and different coins to find to customize the way you want to play.			"

Early Access Review
								Looking at an early access top down procedurally generated rogue-like, you'd be forgiven for thinking this is just like every other game currently on steam. But, Coin Crypt has an original twist that adds strategy, and enough polish to elevate it above most of the dross early access throws at people now-a-days.In this game, your battle moves are tied to coins. Once you use that coin on attacking, healing or any other move, it disappears. Every coin also has a monetary value that can be used to trade at a variety of points throughout the game. What all of this means is that you always need something, keeping every game exciting. If either side runs out of coins in battle, they lose, but if you defeat an enemy before they run out, you get all of the coins they haven't used. So you always have to becareful with your choices in and out of battle. You might end up with a bag full with attacks just when you're hanging on 3 hp and desparately need a heal, or a bag full of heal coins that limit your attack options significantly and leaves you to wait for the enemy to run out of coins, but then you don't get any attacks from the enemy at the end of battles!But most of the coins don't come from enemies, but from chests. You can only pick a limited number of coins from chests, giving you more choices to make. As the game goes on, more coins of different types get introduced with the enemies and chests, altering your deck to have more coin diversity. Naturally for rogue-likes, you will die quite a bit. When you die or win a run you get to spend the coins you got throughout the run into unlocking new characters. Every character plays differently but most if not all of them aren't objectively better than others. You unlock your first classes quite quickly to experiment with but the more you unlock, the more expensive they get. This is the game's way to give a purpose to each playthrough, some people will like it, and some will want a more substantial meta game. There are over 14 classes so to those who do care it will take quite a bit of play to unlock all of them!This is what early access should be, Coin Crypt was already functional from the first time it arrived on steam and has only improved ever since.So, yeah, this is worth a buy!

												With its cute and simple art style, and easy to grasp gameplay, Coin Crypt is one of the best indie games I've seen this year. Its relatively easy playstyle allows casual gamers to enjoy it, yet its also challenging for a hardcore gamer too. The whole coin combat system is unique, and I dont think ive seen something quite like it. Finding different coins throught the game allows the discovery of a new coin, and the ability to mix and match coins for ones playstyle. All in all, the game is simple, relaxed, and can make one have a night of fun. I highly recommend it.			"

												Originally my buddy had this game but he wasn't a fan. I tried it on his computer and liked it so much that I bought it and its expansion regardless of them being at full price.Why? I thought it was worth it. I like games that not only have full controller support but also games with quick >10 minute runs with lots of unlockables + procedurally generated maps. I don't normally go for those given that they're tough as nails generally, but coin crypt has just the right amount of challenge (the default difficulty is normal, I keep it on normal even though I usually play games on easy).So what do you do? Basically you're what's known as a ""Lootmancer"", a made-up type of magician I think specific to this game. You find various magical coins and use them in battle but also to unlock new areas, make offerings to gods (who get angry if you don't for a while), make wishes in fountains to heal, and buy items that give special abilities (such as being able to steal easier or +20% defense, etc). You have 2 things to look out for: HP and Coins, if either run out the run is over and you get a score based on how good you did, which you put towards buying new classes over time each with different abilities and playstyles that prioritize different kinds of coins. For example, one of my favorites is Templar and he starts weak but gets damage buffs when he uses healing coins (even if he's not damaged) so Hit (damage) coins and healing coins are more useful to him then stealing, for example.How's the controller support? I have the Steam Controller and I must say it works really well once you get used to it. It controls much different than the keyboard/mouse version or at least slightly different but it works.Who would I recommend this to? I'd recommend it to people looking for a game they can play in quick runs before work, school, or between events as the runs don't always last very long. However, I'd also recommend it to controller players that want a fun and honestly adorable game that they don't have to configure the controls for, as well as those that like a good challenge but aren't exactly into tough-as-nails games.Overall, I'd say Coin Crypt is a good game and well worth the $10 + $5 expansion, but if you get it on the Steam Sale then it's even more value!~Cat with Headphones			"

												I got this game in a humble bundle so didn't pay full price.  I was pleasently suprised by Coin Crypt. The gameplay in Coin Crypt definately comes under the category of unique. You collect a multitude of coins that have different abilities and then use those coins to fight enemies with other coins in coin related battles. The aim is simply to progress through the i'm presuming endless dungeons and unlock new characters. The game also has a daily challenge to keep things fresh. To my memory there are over 100 different kinds of coins so it's not like the gameplay will go stale quickly. A definite recommendation.			"

												Coin Crypt is a nice fun game to play a few minutes (or hours) at a time. Yeah.That's it. Not much to it.It's just a fun game to play, easy to pick up, and just takes up a lot of your time. Every run is different, level-wise. You probably won't get the same exact run two times in a row. You can do a lot of things. You can donate to only one god in one run, you can try only using certain coins in another run. You can just joke around and choose a card at random if you want. As you play this game, you can choose whether you want to save up your coins for a god, or to save that one key for a chest or another location that's blocked off. The whole game is full of these situations between your fights against others only using these coins. The further you get into the game, the more characters you can unlock. Each character has different abilities, or stats that make each of them unique. Go try to do runs with different characters if you want.Yeah, that's it. Yeh. Yeah. Yee. 6.5/10			"

												Coin Crypt is an ambitious title that actually delivers in terms of replay value and fun factor.  The core mechanics are familiar but the game as a whole is so unique that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh.  The art direction is remniscent of a cel-shaded Minecraft-inspired Wonderland.  It's a real treat exploring this world each and every run.I'm actually very surprised that I never heard anyone talking about this game on any podcast, stream, or video.  Games like Coin Crypt, Crypt Of The Necrodancer, Speedrunners, and Dungeon Of The Endless take huge risks doing something very different..  But they are not merely noteworthy because they're different.  These are games that are TONS of fun and great to go back to any time.Admittedly, the only thing missing from Coin Crypt is some sort of online support or multiplayer.  I reckon this hidden gem got overlooked because it is a singleplayer experience.  I see they released DLC in 2015 so, hopefully, this game gets more of a cult following and steady updates to revitalize interest.  It's a game I can't recommend enough if you dig exploration, dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes, or just charming/cute games that are clever AND fun!			"

												In this game you go from room to room, kind of like dungeoneering in Runescape… Kind of. The room “layout” thing.Anyways, you start with some coins, collect more coins, engage in battles with mobs that are hard to avoid and use those coins to do damage/steal their coin(s)/heal/shield yourself/poison foe and so on. It's quite fun as you need to think ahead what coins to use. You can't really do damage all the time, as each turn you can choose to use between 3 randomly drawn coins.The enemies are different, certain types tend to use certain coin types, which is neat. And the looks of the game is neat too. All in all a great game.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

There are also 20 different classes to play as, which all offer their own unique set of challenges and advantages. This game is difficult and has a massive amount of replayability. It has 6 different bosses for each path/difficulty (12 bosses total). Lots of unlockables which include new coins, classes, and more difficult enemy types.

												Coin Crypt appears to be a simple game, but it will crush you if you treat it like one. It offers a unique take on the rougelike genre that I enjoy. If you like a challenge, then I recommend the game to anyone who wants one.			"

												Very entertaining fast-paced coingame roguelike.  The different classes have vastly divergent rules, strengths, handicaps and resulting playstyles.  The art is quite unique, the music and soundeffects delicious.  With the ""Sea and Sky Expansion"" DLC, you can now also repair a plane and a boat!			"

												I highly recommend this game. It's short (about an hour if you go for the ""hard"" ending, 40 minutes if you go for the normal ending), but it is EXTREMELY replayable, as evidenced by my 200 hours on record. The combat system is fast-paced but strategic, and there's a huge variety of classes and unique coins with unique effects.The real fun of this game is in munchkin-ing it. Choose the right gods, coins, items and traits to turn yourself into the deadliest thing on two legs, or at least something strong enough to scrape by. The classes play very differently, as do the different coin builds the gods support. And unlike most hybrid roguelikes, you always have enough control to build the character like you want them, even though the exact coins available will depend on luck.If you like fast-paced combat and playing around with your character build, but don't like being stuck with the same character for hours on end, this is the game for you!

												Don't be thrown off by the visuals. This game has actually a lot of depth to it and can potentially be the cause of countless hours of fun.			"

												Coin Crypt is a fun dungeon crawler if you stick with it and learn to manage probabilities. However, the amount of RNG in this game is ridiculous and rage inducing because your run can end any moment. There's a certain depth to the game that isn't immediately apparent that I appreciated.

												Fun little rouge-like where you battle enemies with coins similar to a TCG. Coins also have value, which you use to buy/barter for items from shops, or donate to deities, which increase your luck, fortune, overworld speed, damage, healing, etc. Got it for free from a friend, but I would recommend it for its relatively cheap $10 price-tag			"

												A piece of gem in the market like no other. Combines the genres of deckbuilding, RPG and Rogue-lite; and wraps them up into a neat little package. DLC expansion is recommended --adds alternate paths, classes, another new god and a big reciprocal pile of new wacky coins.			"

												I was not expecting much going into this game considering I dont even remember buying the game, but apperently I did, and was going down my list of 400+ some odd games trying to find one that fit my fancy. So after playing this for an hour what have I to say? I am keeping this installed, this game is great. and totally worth the money. get it			"

												Could have used some explanation of the game mechanics, some kind of tutorial/introduction, anything! What's going on during the game/combat isn't intuitive and I was not interested enough in what was going on to learn by trial and error. While the blocky art is cute, the combat feels slow and I don't think the gameplay is my cup of tea.			"
