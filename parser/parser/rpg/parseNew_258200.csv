												""Prologue"" is a misnomer. This game is no more than a glorified tutorial for the main game, and isn't even worth the price they set during the Steam Sale. Just get the main game - it's not particularly hard to learn, and is a far more complete and worthwhile experience, even if you don't get any of the DLC.			"

												Difference Between Talisman Digital Edition & Talisman PrologueTalisman Digital Edition is the multiplayer form of the game, so you can play with other players or against the AI.  Talisman Prologue is completely a solo single player experience, so you will strictly play against the Adventure Cards.  Nomad Games does take it a step further than that, and they have quests designed per character on the main menu.  They also have characters available that are not currently available in Talisman Digital Edition.Just know that once you complete the quest, the game ends, whether you made it to the crown or not.  The only quest in Talisman Prologue that allows you to go all the way to the Crown of Command is The Magical Quest.  Some characters only have The Magical Quest available to them with no other quest options.  There is a distinct difference in the two games.  Be sure you’re buying the game version that will suit your play style, unless you want both, then more power to you. Truthfully I think picking one or the other would be best, especially if you’re not sure whether you are going to like it or not.Click this link to read more!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/10/review-talisman-digital-edition/#more-29260 "

												So, I got this game for free through Humble Bundle... In a way, it's bizarre that this... thing, actually has a price, as it's effectively a demo for the full game. If you can't be arsed to make your way through the whole of this review, all you need to know is, this is a great way to make you realise how this game could be fun with friends, but not on your own, and not as it is.Being older than I appear, and growing up in a time when Steam Sales would sound like magic beans rather than allowing me a way to convert pocket money into actual jollies, I would spend my time leafing through the back pages of White Dwarf, imagining what it would be like to be able to play the games contained within. One such was Talisman, and I spent a terrifying amount of time imagining what the fabled game would actually be like to play.Now I know. I'm really glad my 12 year old self got that gift for free.Should you pay for it? No. No. The game could potentially be fun with friends, and this version is fine for working out the mechanics of the actual game, which you are definitely not buying here. It's kind of astonishing they still charge you extra to buy the tutorial, although I have been informed it was originally released as a work in progress before the multiplayer was released. That still doesn't mean there is any point in paying for it now, and playing it alone seems desperately sad. I cannot imagine why anyone would benefit from playing this game rather than the main one.			"

												Talisman is an old board game which translates fairly well to the computer. This game was faithfully translated into the computer as Talisman: Digital Edition. Talisman Prologue is a single player version of that game. It is essentially a demo where you can attempt to complete various quests with different characters. If you are looking for a true Talisman experience, you should get Digital Edition instead.  "

												This is quite literally Solo, not a ""single player experience"", its a single character experience, its just you and you are alone WITHOUT even computer controlled (AI) players, as one would expect by it being a boardgame.  You wont get anything of value from Talisman: Prologue, accept if you are a huge fanatic of game specific achievment chasing.In prologue you are simply chasing trivial goals, for no real purpose than to achieve them, save your cash for the digital version.Even at less than $2.00, I feel its wasted money, and a completly pointless purchase.

												Although, I bought two versions of Talisman (Prologue and Digital Edition), I started with this. Yes, I got a good experience, playing and learning different characters, their advantages. This helps me to know the game, its rules. But after some games, this solo adventure starts to bother me. Quests quite frankly aren't interesting. Often you need to get to some place or monster, and you roll dice one by one until you get exactly you need (Sometimes I spent more than 20-25 turns just only to be on the same space as my quest's task). I don't persuade to buy Talisman, but don't waste money, buy original Talisman: Digital Edition, where you get better experience, fun and enjoyment playing with friends or bots. There you will not only roll dices, but also think about your next steps.			"

												Everyone else is right, you mostly just roll the die and see what happens. Not much more exciting than a video slot machine game in that respect. There is no AI, you are literally moving around a board by yourself. You even draw ""lose a turn"" cards - with no one to lose a turn to, and keep going. It seems kind of like a beta (It's complete however) demo of the normal game also on here. For some reason, it also randomly crashes on my desktop at work where I tried it.			"

												Definitely a 'Prologue' (introduction) to the Talisman Digital Edition. Consider this to be a tutorial to the extreme, enough to be able to sell it seperately.I consider it more of an occasional distraction, probably not one of those games that you feel like playing for hours on end...but one of those that you 'pull off of the shelf' here and there.After playing Talisman Digital Edition, I will say that I did miss the quests. Ultimately, it could be cool to blend the two and introduce individual quests into the Digital Edition.It seems that, at the least, Prologue will either be a quick distraction, or it will be one of those that you will enjoy here and there. (Obviously there is the possibility that it may just 'click' and it is played to completion).In other words, for the price ... not too bad.  I enjoyed it so far, but for me it is here and there.  It would seem hard to go wrong if you can get it in a bundle or, as currently under a couple bucks. (I'm buying a couple extra as gifts ... can't go too wrong for that price and maybe they will go for the Digital Edition and we can do multiplayer...)			"

												This is an attempt to add a single player focus to Talisman and it just doesn't work.  First of all i think Talisman is already a bad game, its slow and is mostly luck based.  The Prologue doesn't add anything, it removes your oppnents and gives you crappy little missions like kill 5 enemies or get to the end.  Stuff you'd be doing anyway in the regular game but with the added challenge of playing against other people (or at least the AI).The only tiny thing you get from this version is you get to play several characters that are DLC only.  but really you'd be better off just buying those characters for the regular game.  Or just not getting the game at all.I paid $0.69 for this and i'm still not sure it was worth the money.  I guess if your dying to know what Talisman is like but aren't sure about paying for it. then this could work as a cheap demo.			"

												First off: I absolutely adore boardgames. I own many and play regularly with my friends in real life and online friends through VASSAL.I always wanted Talisman (and subsequently Relic) based on their generally favorable reviews and the description of the game. I like similar games of the genre and planned on buying it down the road.Luckily I got the prologue in a game bundle somewhere so I could finally try it.I can't really say it's a horrible game, but to me it's really not that fun. Sure, this is a single player-based version and in a digital format, but the core mechanics are just rather bland. Reading the reviews on Steam before I got it I figured most of the negative feedback was based on people not well versed in boardgames and assumed they may just not have a taste for them. It truly is bland, however. The biggest problem I think stems from the complete lack of choices, tactics, and strategies. It really is random. Not just in combat, like most tabletop games, but every aspect is controlled for you. The game essentially boils down to what direction you want to travel and making a choice on the off-chance you land on somewhere interactive.All in all I know I will never buy the boardgame. If a friend had it I may just try it to see if it's any better in person and with friends, but we have so many better games to play I'm sure it would be a one time thing. I know I'll probably never revisit the video game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Talisman: Prologue ✭ 1 - So Many Characters, So Little Explanation 

			Views: 48		

			The game's very handhold-y in a lot of places... But not in anyway that's actually useful... My blind playthrough of the board game Talisman: Prologue on PC with live commentary.		

It feels more like a proof of concept than a fully-fledged game, offering you a few different objectives for a quest, rather than an actual grand adventure to embark on. Well, except some, which task you with; get to the centre of the board. Most are just; buy a sword, kill something, go get healed. Quest complete.There are some that are more interesting, like rescuing a princess and returning her to the castle... But the game doesn't go far enough with these tasks, nor is there enough of them.Also starting from scratch each time you play means re-treading so much ground they're just not that much fun to play after the first time.The gameplay loop is essentially; roll a dice, land on a square and do what it tells you to, usually draw some cards. The cards will have items, monsters or events... And that's it. There's not some opposing force acting against you, or for you to outwit, the cards are the only thing that affect the game.Levelling up your character is a fairly trivial affair; beat enemies that you take as trophies, if you have trophies whose corresponding trait adds up to 7 or more, you can exchange them for a level. Equipment cards can also increase your stats... Which means all too quickly you become the most powerful being on the board. Ultimately there just isn't really any difficulty to the game.That's where the event cards come in so you can randomly be reduced down to something that the enemies actually have a chance at killing... The funniest thing is that you can lose a turn... Which just means the turn counter increases by two. All I can gather is that the game rates you upon completion of the quest and I assume it just comes down to the amount of turns taken...I can see it being useful to learn the ruleset, and perhaps that's where the ""prologue"" part of the name comes from... But the mechanics aren't exactly difficult, or incredibly deep that they'd require such a primer.Annoyingly there is another version of the game released that actually has multiplayer... Which begs the question; why this version still exists… They say it focuses on the single player experience... But really, there isn't much to that experience. In so much that I can't imagine why someone who opt for this one over the other.I did enjoy my first game enough, but then when I went to play a second, even playing as a different character, I was almost instantly bored.

												Talisman: Prologue is a single player game. No AI to play against, but it doesn't really need it, because the gameplay is designed around quests with a 1, 2 or 3 star outcome based on how many moves it takes to complete the quest. (3 being best). Each character has about 6 quests each, most of them tailored to the characters abilities.There's a nice selection of characters, not just the base ones, and I'd quite like this quest based version of Talisman, BUT it seems to be fixed, and obviously so, which I find quite irritating, because I know the first two attempts on certain quests are going to be less than 3 star outcomes before I even start, and when you get the one that's going to let you win it's obvious that this is the one that's being rolled in your favor. At times it just feels like a complete waste of time, spending 42 turns rolling when you know it's for nothing. I'd prefer to win and lose based on randomness in the rolls, rather than it being stacked for or against you at the start.My other peeve with this is if I have 8 strength and my enemy has 2 WHY did you let it still roll like it has a chance. What a waste of time to sit and wait through that whole scenario with only one possible outcome, with no way to skip it and no option to just auto win those rolls. This on top of the obvious outcome fixing is really frustrating.Saying all that I wish, once again, that Steam had a neutral option, because even if I've been  annoyed when I'm done with a game session, I don't hate the idea of starting it up the next time. So do i recommend it, I've no idea, I'm so confused :P I selected yes since I will play it through, and I've played worse games. I really didn't want to select either yes or no though.So if you'd like to play through the quests and sample the characters and maybe get an idea of which one might be right for you, this is for you.If the obvious fixing and waiting through pointlessness will annoy you more than you'll enjoy the quest element, I'd avoid this and just buy the Digital edition.

												A friend gifted this to me, and for that I'm obviously grateful to him...we and a few other friends used to play the original (well, 2nd edition) board game TO DEATH back in the 90s, and more recently, another one of these friends rebought the ♥♥♥♥ing thing (4th edition), allowing me to get just a teeny weeny bit ""sick"" of it all over again.  Ah, memories!  I must admit to still being fascinated to see how this would all translate into a VIDEO GAME, however, so while this is merely the single player ""prologue"" to the multiplayer version (which has since been released), I must say I was quite impressed with how extraordinarily faithful the whole adaptation appears to be.    I say ""appears to be"", as I've only played so much of it, but enough to confidently opine that apart from reducing the epic ""get-to-the-middle-region-first-and-murder-the♥♥♥♥♥♥out-of-the-other-players-to-achieve-world-domination"" mega-quest of the board game to a number of small, character-specific mini-missions, it's, well...it's pretty much the board game.  Or at least a limited version of it, as this particular game doesn't have anywhere near all the characters, expansions, etc etc...though to the best of my understanding, the fully-blown Talisman: Digital Edition does or at least will do over time, and assuming its objective is to be as slavishly faithful to the source material as this prologue game, I can't see that anyone looking for a video game adaptation of Talisman is liable to be disappointed.  As for me, personally, right at this moment in time...I might have to give such a prospect a miss for now, not least of all because of that friend I still have who's only half-a-suburb away who, unlike myself, is probably up for reliving our wild 'n' reckless glory days of rolling dice and shuffling cards at relatively short notice.  I'm a bit over it all, truth be told, and have more than adequately sated my sentimentality for the time being, so I think I'll♥♥♥♥♥♥away my time with other, less painfully overfamiliar games (be they of a digital or more tactile nature; I still play board games, just not this one when I can help it).      Back to the Prologue for a moment, though.  This particular product would no doubt provide an adequate ""training ground"" for those too daunted to leap straight into the multiplayer game, though I can't imagine you'd get much replay value out of it beyond that.  Still, it's cheap enough, especially in a sale, and if you've never played a board game in any way, shape or form - or at least not one more complicated than Snakes 'N' Ladders or Trivial Pursuit - then this may give you an idea what dyed-in-the-wool nerds USED to do before video games progressed beyond one bunch of ugly pixels shooting at another bunch of ugly pixels with little dots or dashes for ammunition. Verdict: 7/10.			"

												A great job at showing how to finally bring this fun fantasy board game to the PC. While there's plenty of life in this version, there's a lot that would be added by getting the multiplayer version once it's out of early access. Many characters have a ton of quests tied to them to try to beat as well as the randomness of the core game. Hopefully once the multiplayer is out we will see the other board game expansions translated to the PC version.			"

												Talisman: Prologue is one of the adaptation of the classic fantasy board game. Talisman, if you don't know is like Game of Life, only you kill ogres and get cast spells instead of knocking up your crazy girlfriend from college and have a loveless marriage. Prologue, unlike the original game is single player only and quest based. Kind of like a time attack, you must finish them in the least number of turns possible, but there are no achievements or real leaderboards so it's little incentive to replay them. The same developer has already released Talisman: Digital Edition which is a more faithful, better designed adaptation which includes multiplayer, so you can say Prologue is obsolete by now. Still I feel that if you can get this for cheap is good enough just to play the custom quests, which take about 15 hours.			"

												This single player Talisman uses the whole game board but it makes you play the game over and over to fulfill different quests. It's MMO grinding except the quests don't actually give you anything of value except achievements. I find that very, very cheap of the devs and outright offensive, really. Instead of giving something of value they just deliver grindy content.The value is for people who are really into the game, like me, who want to examine different strategies. I'm really good at the game as it is, having beaten everyone and their brother on my real life gameboard, but when I want to reassure myself I load up a random character class and spend an hour leveling it in this game until I can tapdance through victory. That gets old really fast, though, and there isn't much left for me to learn.The Prologue is simply a very light story to introduce you to the grinding. It pretends that each character has a cool backstory.Would be more fun if it had more going on than achievements for playing it over and over.			"

												This looks like somebody took the board from 1980~whenever and scanned it in using a cheap scanner from the same time period. The graphics are crude, low quality, ""hand painted"" look and appear worse due to the interface being clunky and slow; from the menu system through to the in-game icons with no tool-tips or highlights for possible actions. The tiny golden glow around the right-menu icons barely acts as a highlight and does nothing to attract the eye. This certainly doesn't have any of the good design and eye-candy polish of other Games Workshop titles and looks to have been a cheap out-sourced project. There is no reason for this single-player only version to have not been built-into the other multi-player version instead of making them separate titles. It gives me the impression of a quick money grab from a small studio with no real love or basic interest in the Talisman games. Hopefully they won't insult us with a City / Dungeon DLC expansion pack later.			"

												Don't expect much from this game. It's pretty easy to learn but requires a bit of luck to actually win. There's a great variety of characters, but no real reward or progress for winning, taking away all replayability of the game. If there were achievments, at least I would have something to do, but instead I just played until I got all my cards.			"

												Well, this was cheap, so I bought it to pass a little time until I grab Talisman HD.Unfortunately a few minutes was all I could stand.  While the game itself is good, the board game mechanics are implemented reasonably well, there's one factor that's impossible to avoid, which in itself makes the whole Prologue idea redundant: It's single player.Thankfully, one of it's saving graces is the price, otherwise this would seem like a quite cynical move (wholly expected of Games Workshop i'd have to say, though I doubt they had much input into any of the games save charging a small fortune for the license - and no, i'm not a fan.)Talisman is a great boardgame, but it's multiplayer.  Would anybody buy a single player version of Monopoly before you bought the full MP game?  Of course not.  Save your money, put it towards buying the HD edition.			"

THIS IS NOT THE VERSION OF TALISMAN THAT YOU SHOULD BUY! This was an early test version of Talisman that the devs never should have charged money for, and they especially should not be charging for what is essentially a bad demo now that the real version is out as a separate game on Steam. The big thing that this version is missing is that this is an adaptation of a physical board game that's designed to be played with other people, but there is NO MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT and also NO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE players - you just travel around the board alone, competing against NO ONE. This version might have been tempting for die hard Talisman fans before the real version came out, but now it's pointless. And it doesn't even run on Windows 7 64-bit - even if you add it to DEP! Probably because, again, this was an early test version which has been abandoned.			"

												An excellent way to learn Talisman. Get used to the game, learn about the different characters you can choose and how they differ, and generally get your skills and enthusiasim up to the point where you are ready to get the full game (Talisman Digital Edition). That is what worked for me - learning the game via the Prologue edition, totally getting into the full game along with the expansions, and then also adding the Talisman Board game along with the Reaper and Frostmarch expansins to my board game library. For me Prologue was well worth  the modest price.Note: This is/was one of the Steam products with the Data Execution Prevention BS - a real major bummer . This issue, although eventually resolved, resulted in reconsideration of whether this amount of stress was worth sticking with STEAM. I am still here and I enjoy most of my STEAM games, but that was overall my worst expereince with STEAM and a game bought from them.			"

												Oh Talisman, you have sucked up so much of my boardgame playing time, and I loved almost all of it. This is a pretty darn good recreation of the basic vanilla Talisman boardgame with a few extra characters. I'm not sure if there are more end quests to unlock or not yet, having only played through once, but it's possible, given that the game's introductory screen asks players to choose a character and an end quest. I have only played the original Crown of Command one, because I don't see any choices for the end quest yet, but still... possibilities. Anyway, this is a single player only version of the game, and because it's faithful to the original, it includes turn loss cards and effects, which have no meaning in single player. Other than that and a couple oddities with the play itself that are evidently being ironed out by the devs, this is solid Talisman fun. Check out Talisman Digital Edition for the full game including expansions and multiplayer. And check this out if you want to spend an hour or two playing an old boardgame friend.			"

												Hey! Now, don't click the thumbs down button under this review just yet, read the whole thing first! I'm not trying to be rude to the creators, I'm just listing the negative aspects of this game so people like you don't waste your money on something like this, when you expect something like ""Talisman: Digital Edition"". If the developers fixed these issues, this would be a fantastic game! Sorry for rambling on. Enjoy!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I'm a big talisman fan and was happy to see a cheap digital version of the masterpiece, but after I played it for some time I noticed the many problems the developers probably shrugged off and thought ""It's cheap, let's just give it the quality of a flash game with great graphics!"" It was singleplayer, no multiplayer options at ALL. Later I noticed that it said ""The Solo Adventure Game""... So, that was MY fault, but that means there should be AI, right...? No. That would be too much effort. It would only make this game have a chance at being decent and not trash. Let me take a look at the box for the true Talisman board game. 2-4 players? Hmm, TWO to FOUR players, NOT one.Another thing I hate is that there is no save feature. Can you amagine playing talisman with no friends in ONE sitting!? I can't! Now, even games from the mid 1980s (The Legend of Zelda) had save features. Now, they may be save codes, but they still had them! Now it's like a requirement for even the most simple game to have one, as long as it isn't an arcade game, where saving your 10 minutes of playtime wouldn't be required. Here it is, though! Playing Talisman with my family in real life, takes weeks. We play for an hour or two, then leave it how it is, then come back a couple days, then we play again. We take our time. If we did it in one sitting, it'd take about 10 hour add or take a few. Now, I don't know about you, but I can't sit in a seat staring at screen playing a digital board game for 8 hours (With less people it'd take less time).  They have  more charecters which is slightly more enjoyable, but I never end up using them. These characters feel like cheap excuses to cover up the many problems with this otherwise decent game. They also have quests, which sounds fun, but It's basically chores to do while trying to get the Talisman. They're a LOT less interesting than sidequests in your typical RPG. Yep, that bad.This games acts like a demo, which would be fine, except it costs money. Imagine getting the demo for a game like Undertale, and then a screen pops up saying ""If you want to play this one hour demo, gimme a dollar. Oh yeah, by the way, I removed all NPCs. Screw you.""This game also acts like a tutorial... Imagine playing the newest ""Legend of Zelda"" game, except it was 6$. So, you get the game, thinking it was just an amazing deal, and you find out it's just an hour long game telling you about all the mechanics that you can use for completing puzzles. And that's all there is. Puzzles, and no monsters, no bosses, no shops, no NPCs; nothing but puzzles and dungeons that are filled with only puzzles. Now, obviously, this would never happen and Talisman Prologue isn't THAT bad. With the price, EVEN IF IT IS SMALL OR ON SALE is not a good deal and is NOT worth your hard-earned cash. This ""demo"" (even demos should be better than this) gets a 3/10. I would recomend this game, at MOST, 1$. 7$, is just too much for me.I tried giving this game a chance, I really did, but it does not feel like the vast world of Talisman. It feels like a dumbed down empty demo. If you want the true digital version instead of the demo, check out Talisman: Digital Edition. That one has multiplayer. And a save feature. Hallelujah!(The sad thing is, I probably spent more time typing this up than actually playing the game. xP)			"

												I bought this game as the multiplayer was an early access game and I don't buy unfinished games or ones I've read no reviews of. As this was a finished game, I assumed you would be able to upgrade it when the multiplayer was finished. However, after emailing the devs, I was told there won't be any upgrade to the multiplayer for owners of this game!So I'm left with a board game I can only play alone. There aren't even any AI oponents to play against!Would you play board games like Monopoly, Risk, etc alone? No of course not but that's what you're expected to do with this game.So avoid at all costs.			"

												Okay I never played the board game version of Talisman(Read: Non digital), but I was interested in it, I just did not see the point of spending 75 bucks for a game I might only play like maybe once a year. Then this came out, along with Talisman: Digital Edition, and I must say I reccomend them both, for different reasons. You see in Talisman: Digital Edition you get to play online or off and are up against up to 3 other human/AI players, it is fun and is a true original edition of Talisman(Or at least from what I read), but this one is different, you see in this one you play all by yourself, and you are on some kind of a adventure ranging from getting the crown of control in the magical quest, to something as simple as  finding a cave for the Troll(Harder then it sounds actually especially with the turn limit of 20) This has way more of a D&D feel to it then the normal version because of these quests, since your not just playing as a random character through one quest anymore,you can take a character through something of a small campaign of 6 total quests, and while you do not get to keep your items, or stats from game to game, it adds a certain level of interest and intrigue to these characters that the original lacks. Of course this is also a problem with this game too, you see apparently they decided to add some new characters in there, but then wasted some of their potential by not giving them their own campaigns and more or less just gave them the magical quest. (The one for the crown of control) These include the Vampire Hunter, Amazon, Minotaur, Leprechaun, Sprite, Sage etc. if you buy this you will know them, put this with the unfortunate circumstance that it does not appear that they will update, or give this a expansion to give these characters their own campaigns and it leads to a lot of wasted potential, in addition it would be great if they not only did this but came out with exapnsions for other characters as well, and put a nice campaign with them as well, (The Knight for instance). and while I will admit this is not Talisman proper, both this version and the Digital Edition has their places. This is for the fams that like the idea of different stories, and quests to do with the characters and don't mind going solo, where the other is for the fans of the game that really don't care about that. Overall a excellent game and well worth the purchase.Graphics: The board looks great, the artwork is nice, it is a step down on somethings from the digital edition, but the graphics are still good enough to please any fan, or anyone curious. 8/10Controls: Simple to control and fast and responsive. 10/10Value: I set my price for games at about 2 bucks per hour of play time I get out of them. I have already got the full 6.99 plus out of this and I am not even close to completing (much less mastering) all the quests. So yeah well worth it. 10/10Achievements: What are those? LOL, no seriously though, other then cards I have not noticed any. Not that there is any scroe for this, but if your a achievement hog, this might not be the game for you.Fun Factor: This of course will vary by person, or sometimes how long a particular quest takes(It can be brutal) but overall I give it a 8/10  It's not perfect, but it is fun and interesting.In the end: If you are just a fan of Talisman the game and don't care so much for additional quests, maybe you would consider them mini campaigns/side quests, then this might not be the game for you. If you love Talisman and are not afraid to try something different with the game, you may want to check this out, if your a fan of adventure boardgames and don't mind going solo, go for both this and the digital edition. You won't be sorry.			"

												If you like fantasy games and boardgames - check this one out. An interactive boardgame that is easy to play and very hard to master. I have gotten myself pretty addicted to this one, I admit. It's a novel concept, not one I have seen done that often before, and certainly not quite this well. Some of the classes are a LOT harder to play well than others, so be prepared for a challenge. Go on missions that are dominantly chance, or try to go through and win it all - it's up to you. I am looking forward to the full digital experience - this is a wonderful overture and introduction to it.			"

												If you're on the fence about picking up a video board game, please give Talisman a try.  It's a great price now during the holiday sales and a very good translation from the board game to the computer.  The main goal for the game is to move around and though the board to get the Crown of Command.  Each turn you'll move to a new location and battle monster, gain gear or followers, or have to deal with an event.  Talisman is a classic board game and this solo only version is great dip into video board games for anyone.The prologue has several different character to play and each one has a either a few different quests to explore or the standard game quest to go get the crown.  The prologue is single player ONLY if you are wanting multiplayer you'll need to pick up the main game. "

												It's fun, but limited. I've never played the board game, Talisman, but this is a single-player adaptation of it.You pick a class card with preset stats and special abilities that you use as you travel around collecting and fighting to get powerful enough to pass the barriers and reach the center of the board. For most of the classes, this adaptation tasks you with goals that are meant to teach you how to use their unique abilities and the general game mechanics. It's well-done and the mechanics are solid. The actual board game or a full multiplayer implementation would probably be better and this feels more like a demo or proof of concept. There's just not that much to do and, after you very quickly pick up the simple mechanics, the rest is repetition. In order to fully complete a mission, you often need to complete the goal in a certain number of turns and, even if that were not often so frustratingly dependent upon random chance, it feels like going through the motions. Achievements would have been a nice addition if only for something to shoot for.			"

												It's a board game. Except it's a computer game. Except there is very clearly a board there. Except there is no board, because it's on a computer. Then why are you playing on a board? Is the board the computer? Is the computer YOUR MIND?

Should I disrecommend the game because I paid for what is essentially a demo? Should I do this despite the fact that the demo is actually super fun?

												If you love the board game and want to enjoy the solitaire experience when you're bored in front of your pc or netbook, this is a really good game to kill the time. It'll get boring on consecutive sittings though. I honestly don't think this game has much replay value, at most finishing the game as 3-4 wildly different characters would be more than enough.			"

Its good that you have quests to actually complete as you go too. Lots of replay value and also helps you learn the game for the board game version too.			"

												Another great GW classic tabletop game perfectly translated to the desktop. It plays just like the original, sans the other players...but hey, this is the Prologue, right? Hardcore fans of the game will get this to practice for the multi-player. When the full version of this game launches, you'll wish you had the extra time to work out which class you like best and what the best strategies are with them.			"

												This single-player version is a great way to get acquainted with the game before purchasing the full fledged game. The best way to view this game is like one of those chess puzzle games. To accomplish the goals for your chosen class, you have to do so in as few moves as possible. Blending in the 'three star' point system with a classic Talisman flavoring adds incentive to play better. Granted, you can only play so well when your movement is based entirely on a die roll unless you have a special class ability or spell. My only qualm with this game is the lack of a free play mode where you can play the game against several NPCs which would allow more focus on gameplay in the Middle and Inner Region. However, I suspect that will be a feature in the full fledged game. Another thing that I'd love to see in this game is some of the classes from the mulitude of expansions.			"

												A digital clone of a popular boardgame, Talisman stands out from the rest because of the diversity of characters, encounters and play styles made available to you. Like any typical RPG you roam the world fighting monsters or finding treasure to increase your stats or survival chances. Ultimately your goal is to reach the centre of the board, but that'll require preparation, and in multiplayer matches, this race can turn brutal.Talisman: Prologue is a single-player variant of the game with specific quests for each character. The aim isn't to beat the other players, but to beat the clock. This eliminates a lot of the tension that drives the vanilla game, but the simplification makes progress faster and more personal.I'd recommend playing Prologue as a tutorial of sorts... and regardless they're both on the current humble bundle: Just $1. Why not?			"

												Wow. I disagree humbly with the negative reviews. The main game was daunting to me (a newbie). I got a new monitor and PC, and I installed both versions again, and love both games. There are many quests and replayablity in this one. It plays faster since it is solo. I commend the developers for making a solo game, even with the fallout from the hardcore gamers. It is not a cash grab- I got this with the Humble Bundle. Anyway, support the devs you like. Missed turns count against your time to get the 3 talisman level clear.Great tutorial and neat quests. I now know the game board intimately. Highly addictive. Not sure why some people think the gameplay is like slot machine/random. There is thought involved when it comes to choosing where to land, what to purchase, powering up, etc. In fact, it's kinda like Pathfinder. No crashes on my PC.			"

												Don't let my play time fool you; I have hundreds of hours on this game on the iOS and thousands of hours on the tabletop version. I've been playing the tabletop version of Talisman sinse the mid-80's and still play the current 4th edition rules on a regular basis with friends and family and as far as a solo experience with Talisman goes you can't beat this game. A lot of modern tabletop games offer solo playability but aside from a few clunky rules you can find online Talisman doesn't really lend itself to solo play. Until now that is. While Talisman:Prologue has been patched and newer characters have been added the core original characters each have several custom quests that loosely combine into a ""campaign"" and it's these missions which offer the most originality and variety in the game. So much so that if I ever did want to play my Tabletop version of the game solo I'd use one of those quests. But luckily this ""video game"" version exists so I don't have to pull out the box and go through all the hastle of setting it up and playing.  While Talisman has fairly easy rules it can be a bit difficult for people who don't have a great deal of experience with these types of board games but Talisman:Prolouge includes an excellent tutorial mode that can be turned on and off at the players will. By playing the first series of quests for the various characters new players can get pretty comfortable with the rules fairly quickly. I'd reccoment this to any gamer looking for a nice, casual bord game experience. The only down side is the lack of any kind of save function. Since most games of T:P can be finished anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes this isn't too big a deal.			"

												How do I even begin to describe this game? It is a board game remake, I think. You can chose between a variety of characters, all have their strenghts and weaknesses. You have to roll a die and that determines how many spots you move, each spot has its own actions, some have cards, some of which have monster you fight, others are allies you need to advance in the game to complete quests. It is very confusing and not my style, but I can see the work the developers put it, so I do believe this is a good game, just not one I want to invest time in.			"

												Talisman Prologue is an adaptation of the classic fantasy board game Talisman by Games Workshop. This version focuses on single player experience. An epic tale of dice rolling and card drawing takes you on a quest throughout the land to rescue Princesses, slay Dragons and recover lost artefacts. Play through over 50 quests using the Talisman board game rules, and learn the special abilities of all of the characters. It's important to note that this is NOT a multiplayer game based on Talisman, this is a reworking of the rule-set to allow solo players to experience Talisman in a different way.			"

												First let me say i wasnt aware of talisman till a few days ago and i have to be completely honest.This is a must buy. im loving ever minute, and yes i too read all the mixed reviews and in part i agree.but heres my way to decide if talismans for you.1. buy the multi player version first (at writing this review it was on sale £1.67).full price around £5.2. ( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.This is in main a tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismam.There are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.(at time of review it was not on sale ) .so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present. for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.you dont have to dig deep and buy all the expansions right away.theres plenty here to keep you going, for now.i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.

												A bunch of complete rubbish: all the fun of a table-top game without other players. Talisman itself isn't anything to write home about to begin with, and this is the far inferior experience still, being Talisman, but with major parts cut off. Do yourself a favor, and stay away.			"

												A solo version of Talisman sounded interesting, but this game is very poorly conceived. Many of the quests are simply tedious time-wasters that are tests of nothing but your patience. Half the time you won't actually be playing Talisman, but only mindlessly rolling dice waiting for a certain situation to occur so that it can trigger the end of the quest.			"

												                               About Talisman: Prolouge -I wouldnt like to offend the boardgame players of this game since i havent played the original Talisman, which im sure has its own lore and everything, but the epic fantasy achethypes in this game are fairly simplistic and on a basic level, the storytelling is pour in quality and equal to quest titles instead of quest-text, thou the drawings of the characters are kitch there as good as they can be with some exceptions. I dont support any game that promotes developing gambling habits with the use of cards and dice - the gambling part is also promoted in towns and outpost throughout the game itself as a feature - it is normal for boardgames and RPG to have it - but here its everywhere you stop to heal up trade and rest. The RNG is such a bad fator in this game that it requieres no skill what so ever to play- its just random results over and over. Only thing requiring a bit of added effort is making the onetime use raft after finding the axe and the right spot to chop tress and crosing the river to the harder part of the game - unless you wanna fight the nearly imortal Sentinel - and hope your armor will protect you so you can grind him down with multile tryes. The drawing of the Lion was the best drawing in this game all thou it posess an interesting invoirment it very much resembles the Monopoly board game setting, but im sure that the motivation for making this game wasnt only money but fun which the video game version offers very little becouse of the total lack of skill needed to play it -and when you do make a result its pure luck not effort or skill. So No -To playing cards and roling dice. Even thou its recourlered by a generic fantasy setting. -It may lead to gambling habits in Real Life which could be devastating for any person and all around them.  "

												This game is for people to learn how to play Talisman.It's a board and card game, and for single player only.The game is not bad to play, you can do quests, roll a dice and see your fate.But $7 for this one, just buy the Talisman Digital Edition.			"

												Talisman Prologue is just a small part of the Talisman experience but still a great one. Unlike the standard game Prologue is a purely single-player experience that acts like a tutorial. You pick from a smal roster of characters and go on missions that take place on the basic board to train you for the full experience.Give it a try if you wanna play the full game, it is classic dice rolling game at it`s best.

												The only negative thing about this game could be it's price. Everything else is great. What's with the mixed reviews, I dunno.So it's a board game (and I am not into board games) but it's fun. You roll dice for everything, moving, combat, choices, random events...You encounter enemies every now and then, and when you do, you roll to fight. The board is the map which you move along. There are spots all of which make you either draw cards, make you fight, or give you a chance to get or lose something. It's an RPG board game basically.I liked the sound effects. There is no animation so everything is static. There is replayability (which is always a plus in my book). There are I think more than 10 classes to choose from, each with their storyline and playstyle (wizard does magic, troll is str based, assassins fast silent deadly etc.).I liked it. 8/10			"

												I posted a negative review of the base game, Talisman, well all of that applies to this one and more.Just so you know it is Talisman BUT you playing by yourself. So there is no challenge not risk.  You just roll dice for as long as you want and are really really board. Its sad, as this could have been a wonderful game.  I also don't understand why they sold it like this.  Seriously they should have just let you play the original game with 1 player.  OH and btw some of the spells are almost impossible to get rid of becuase there are no other players.  I ended up having to throw away followers just to cast a spell to pick up followers from the board so I could replace it with a better spell.Ya don't play or buy this.			"

												Prologue is nothing more than a demo of the full game ""Talisman Digital Edition"" and should be for free, if you'd ask me. Prologue lets you play the boardgame alone and at the time I was playing it, it wasn't even a up-to-date bugfree version as the main game.Enjoyable for a few rounds, but then it's going to bore you sooner or later and either you are going to buy the full version or leave the brand it where it is. There is absolutely no good reason to buy this thing for 7€! Buy Talisman Digital Edition"" and you get all features of Prologue plus Multiplayer, what of course the heart of the  boardgame is.			"

												I'm glad I got this in a Humble Bundle rather than paying for it outright. I got both games, Talisman: Digital Edition and this one, and tried this first, since it said 'prologue'. At the time of writing this review, I have not yet tried the main game, but I do hope it is vastly more fun than this thing. God, it's boring, and it feels pointless. And now, reading all the other reviews and realizing what exactly this 'game' is, I'm glad to know my initial impressions match up so well with what others have said. Skip this, I beg you.			"

												I was excited about this game when released. It does use a talisman board and characters and provide solo quests. However the quests are not very interesting, primarily being ""use this ability a bunch of times""  or ""go to this space.""It has only a few classes. The interface has a number of issues that were fixed in Talisman digital edition to help speed up and streamline gameplay but on a turn with no events I had to click three or four times to progress. It might be helpful for teaching the classes and rules to someone new to Talisman, especially with some of the shorter quests. In the prophetess track, for example, you have to use her special ability thirty times which starts to show you when it is helpful and when it isn't. Some of the missions might help familiarize players new to Talisman or new to this edition with the Board. On the whole it reminds me of bad Talisman games of old when the game was decided but we'd be rolling repeatedly to land on a specific spot just to get to the actual end. A pretty major strike is that you can't (as far as I can tell) take a break from a game. Since most of the missions are time consuming and it is a slow moving board game, being able to save and come back to the game would be a plus and is available in Talisman digital edition. Ultimately if you are considering this, I would instead suggest getting Talisman Digital and just play with a single AI opponent to start so you can get a handle on the rules. I'll probably play it some more because I want to like it. Maybe somethign will change my opinion but it doesn't seem likely.			"
