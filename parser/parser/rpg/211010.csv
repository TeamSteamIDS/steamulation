												I recommend this game if you are into shooting things!There is a really good sense of progression in the game.  It bounces between leveling you up and giving you new guns, so that you continually feel like you are becoming more awesome.  The guns are varied and pretty insane at the higher levels, and it feels good to mow down 100s of enemies in that constant march forward.The game is around 2 hours in length for the first campaign playthrough, which feels about right for the game.  And you can always play the other modes or try to boost your score with an additional playthrough to get on the leaderboards if you want to spend more time with it.Also the boss fights are pretty great, I like the fact that they don't turn the gameplay on it's head.  They feel like they really belong in the game, while also adding a bit more of a challenge.Would buy again.			"

												First of all, you should understand that this game is the direct sequel to the Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded, so if you haven't played it before you should start with it. If you haven't seen that game consider reading thishttp://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/33120Now when you are familiar with the game itself lets go to the differences of this sequel:+The one and only big + of this game is the crapton jokes, you can see them everywhere - skills, weapon descriptions, replics etc. Big plus here!+More different perks to play with and you level up your stats faster.Now about all the problems of that game:-1st of all I see that new 16:10 resolution - 1280x800 - oh wow I can finally play with better resolution, really? NO. All the resolutions above 1024x768 - wider than my 16:10 screen. Really? and 1024x768 fits perfectly. WHY? Another problem that all the resolutions above 1024x768 have that problem when you cant move the camera with aim. So no high resolution.-YOU CANT PLAY AS A FEMALE CHARACTER!!! >:O-Game is shorter than the previous one-One of the significant features of AS2 was full voice over - here there is no voice at ALL, all the characters are mute :(-Less secret places = less money = less chances to get good weapons = less funIn conclusion - this is the less fun continuation of the main game (AS2) which is good to spend an hour if you just beat the 1st game, but not as much fun. Yet it's still pretty cheap.			"

PART OF THE ALIEN SHOOTER SERIES REVIEW OLD GAMES REVIEW! FEATURING: THE ALIEN SHOOTER SERIES Company Name: 
What Do They Mostly Do:
Where are they Now: Sigma Team
Making horde mode style videogame, Forever!
Making Mobile Games!IntroOh darn it, should have started from Alien Shooter 1 but whatever -shrug-So Alien Shooter series... if you had a computer back in the year 2000-20005 you probably heard of and played this game which was made by a russian team. Against all odds [and mostly because we dont have that many good action games back then] the game became quite famous and is probably one of those game that holds the most amount of sequel with barely any differences in between the series.With that said if you know what Alien Shooter is and probably want to validate your opinion on this game before buying it and killing hordes of aliens feel free to skip this section, I will talking about what the series mainly is. Now let me get this out of the way first, the game is old, ancient, archaic, obsolete, and fun. Which means you will encounter graphics from the early 2000s because this game is made in the early 2000s. Now shut up about the terrible graphics on the store page and listen.  Basically Alien Shooter series has you controlling a mute guy or gal who usually is either a mercenary or some other form of that. In the early game of Alien Shooter the guy has more health while the gal runs faster, easy. The newer ones might give you some preset personality and background and you can now upgrade your charcater stats. Still the same. Now the game is basically you taking this person and using the whole lotta weapons to kill aliens. Lots and lots and lots of aliens. Back  when it was release the amount of gib was pretty f***ing impressive because once you kill an alien the corpse will not despawn so you will see the map covered in literal amount of gore and gib. The game is so old [and the engine basically retooled over and over again from Alien Shooter 1] that you cannot even turn the camera, yes the background is static 2D with only the character and alien being 3D and every single alien has a canned animation in the way they die. Hahahah.And that is pretty there is to the game. Some version added objective then the next one improved on it by adding a story and finally you have a full blown campaign while still shooting aliens endlessly. There is something so heartwarming shooting and killing aliens across so many games. Its like a pair of well worn mitten that you slip on before drinking tea and engaging alien genocide. That is not to say the game isn't without its fair share of issues no. The camera angle is bad, sometimes the geometry decides to eat you, and progression in some of the game are f***ed because of how rushed the developement is. But hey it is still fun to shoot and kill aliens. ALIEN SHOOTER: CONSCRIPTIONRelease after reloaded yet features a far more shooter story, less weapon, and less time to level up and get more weapons so by the time you reach the final boss [who is pretty frickin dissapointing if I may add] you are probably quite underleveled and underarmed unless you pick the hidden area perk because in every single Alien Shooter hidden areas mean = money, guns, free armor.I honestly feel after finishing this in just over 2.30 hour that this is one of the weaker game in the second series. Reloaded gave us a full campaign, a narrative that ends properly, more level to grind and weapon to buy, plus a ,pre varied setting. In contrast Conscription narrative is a bit bland, disjointed, and just ends like that. It actually feels like you should play Conscription first before Reloaded because of the quality jump. Plus it's also shorter. So lets jump to the verdict.ConclusionNew Buyers: Familiarize yourself with the AlienShooter series before deciding to pull the trigger [heh] and buy the game. I suggest Alien Shooter 1, Conscription then Reloaded because of the quality and because those are the only ones on steam. Veteran Player: Better than some worse than some. Harder than most because of the short money collection and exp farming but otherwised the same donut filling with a different layer of doughnut. Pretty much that will be all. Hope to see you on Reloaded! [and maybe 1 but dear lord that is so archaic and ancient.]EDIT: I forgot to mention, no controller, 60 fps most of the time but due to the way the engine was made too much explosion will still reduce it to 15 for a few sec and it runs on a toaster. Literally Intel 4000 can play it. The keyboard control is good to. Sounds are pretty basic and I am pretty sure they just recycle it over and over again. Here at Just Review

												Another ""shooter"" game much like the rest.  They did improve some things - like the progression of weapons and stats really ramps at an understandable scale.Beyond that - you just go from mission to mission killing hordes of aliens (and some soldiers) in this gritty top down graphic 2D game.If you have a couple of hours and love these type of old school games, give it a chance.

												Great little game, but very short, which is the only negative point I have about this game in the series. Alien shooter is an isometric 2D game that floods the screen with often hundreds of aliens to fight at once, requiring you to constantly upgrade your characters stats and kit, kinda like an action RPG. The best thing about the game by far is the array of different weapons, with there always being something else to aim for. You can often make the trade off between very slow but hard hitting weapons (rocket launchers, some of the energy weapons etc) or the opposite scale of extremely fast firing weapons (uzi, machine guns, mini guns, plasma gatlin guns! etc). Basically, if you get a free evening and all you want to do is mindless violence, this will satisfy your needs nicely!			"

												the alien shooter games are none of that pseudo retro cr4p you get everywhere today. these games actually ARE retro!but take a look at the screenshots first. if they make you want to hurl then this kind of game certainly isn't made for you.if you don't mind the old graphics or maybe even like them then you're in for a good time!of course there is some kind of story going on but as you can imagine it's all about splattering aliens all over the place with really big a$$ guns.as you can see the graphics aren't exactly top-notch but i feel like they fit nicely into the whole old-school setting of these games.you gain xp, level up and distribute your attribute points pretty much rpg-like as you see fit. you loot the environment to get your hands on ammo and new items as well as collect money to buy yourself some decent gear and new shiny boomsticks at the trader.the map design is quite decent and there are even a lot of secret areas to be found.pretty straight forward gameplay but surprisingly big fun and entertaining.grab the whole package on sale or in a bundle and start mowing down the alien scum!special note on alien shooter 2 conscription:i would not call it worse than alien shooter 2 reloaded but it is really short and therefor feels kind of weak compared to the other games.the few maps are literally  stuffed with money and loot, otherwise there would be no way for you to buy the big guns before the end of the game.

												The game's name is self-explanatory. Essentially you run around shooting wave after wave of aliens. It's not an arena style game, although a few levels give you that feeling..., but mostly you progress stage to stage clearing aliens. Sometimes you're helped by friendly characters. Sometimes you have to protect the character and sometimes you can let them die if you want.The production value of conscription is somewhat lower than alien shooter two reloaded. The dialogue is very poorly translated English and the story, which is mostly nonexistent, is told only in a series of pop-up bubbles. I out about 2 hours into the thing and I'm still not quite sure what's going on. I also got stuck on the terrain far more often.If you've played alien shooter revisited will be familiar with a lot of the gameplay. They've gone back to some of the, in my opinion, cheap gameplay mechanics where you have a lot of enemies you have to fight through to get to the device that is spawning more to destroy it. The early levels of alien shooter revisited and many levels in alien shooter two reloaded were better designed. A lot of times aliens got stuck on things like stairs and I just stood back and picked them off.I enjoyed blasting things, but it just never was as much fun as I'd had in alien shooter 2 reload. I didn't enjoy the timed parts where you have to hurry to reach another area or the babysitting ones where I had to guard a character who had atrocious AI (they made up for it with insane number of hit points) who ran directly into the enemies and forced me to take hits blocking for her purely because she behaved so stupidly. This led up to possibly the most boring and stupid boss fight I've ever had, where I kept ducking into a side room, coming out, shooting the boss for a 30 seconds or so, then ducking back in, repeat. The boss barely seemed to notice/care I was blasting it.The weapons are also curious. When I played I never had enough money for decent guns, until the very end when it handed me the superpowered weapons to fight the end boss. I mean there was an $80,000 difference in the price of guns. Where alien shooter two reloaded let you work your way up a little more evenly. As with their other games, there is a level where you get to control a turret near the end, but it feels completely tacked on only lasts maybe 30 seconds.The game also has some now standard modes like survival and gunstand mode. That's a pretty fun level where you can use a turret to try to stop wave after wave of enemies until you eventually die. It's quite fun, but if you have any of the other recent Sigma team games then you already have these modes.The Doctor's Final Report: 3/10; My honest opinion, it's a fun game but ultimately, if you have both Alien Shooter and Alien Shooter 2 I'd avoid it as there's not a lot of point of buying this game. If you can get it on sale for a buck or two, it might be worth it, otherwise... nah... Its also worth noting that getting this game to work on anything higher than Windows Vista is a pain...			"

												As a sequel of AS2 Reloaded, this campaign introduced few elements new and totally did not fix any balancing issues occuring in its predecessor. Lot of items to pick up in the few scenarios HOWEVER you won't have enough money to buy a combination of decent weapons. The cfg files are nearly copies of AS2 Reloaded, and thus resulted into absolutely same survival modes to the predecessor. The new monsters in the campaign are totally not seen in the survival. A complete lack of sincerity and cheat to the fans of sigma games. A cheap remodel of AS2 BUT is marketed to be an individual game instead of a DLC.			"

												Yet another Alien Shooter. This time it's conscription. Oh well, like in other Alien Shooters, you shoot aliens. Anyways, if you like to shoot aliens up in a tad old-school style, this is for you. Don't expect many hours out of it though. There are tad kewl mechanics, kewl weapons (can't afford the best ones that easily), many aliens, tasks you don't pay much attention to, stupid lines said by the zeroes and ones you're playing as, and many aliens.All in all, this game isn't a ""must"" in any possible way, but if you like these kind of games, you can give it a shot!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												7/10Alien Shooter 2 Conscription, despite being a standalone game, feels a lot like an expansion to Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded. It's the same base game - same graphics and gameplay - with a different story and different levels.Which is to say that Alien Shooter 2 Conscription is an amazing game, just as Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded was as well. It's just as fun and action-packed as its predecessor was.That said, there are some things that Reloaded did better... For some reason, Conscription removed the different playable characters (which had different starting attributes). Enemy variety seems to be a little smaller well and it's a lot more linear, with less sidequests.Still highly recommended, but Reloaded is still the best out of the three games in the Alien Shooter series.One thing I'd like to see if they ever made another Alien Shooter game is to have its gameplay combined with Action RPG elements... Randomly generated equipment and levels (including items with different rarity levels), skills to use, etc. I personally believe it would be a huge improvement to this already awesome series.And as with the first two games, camera angle is still an issue once more. Same issues: fixed camera angle and lack of transparency effect will make it that some items and enemies won't be seen by the player because they'll show up behind walls.			"

												The idea behind this game is actually very good. Combining action and RPG usually makes for a solid genre. In this case it really is. Unfortunately Alien Shooter 2 is too outdated. Grab Alien Swarm instead, it's the same thing but it was released more recently.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												This game is really dumb, but I like it. It is ideal if you search for a uncomplicated, fast game, which you want to play for only about 30min after a long and exhausting work day. The mechanics are decent and the graphics are acceptable. Don't expect the character-development in this game to be as deep as in typical role-playing games. From my side a recommendation, although the game is surely not a very great game.			"

												what to mindlessly shoot enemys....hords of enemys then admire vast dead hord that u killed? this is your game mild story but thats not the focus of this game of course! Bottom line a arcade game worth playing once all the way throu ""that is fun"" then playing the challenge mode then beating it ""that is still fun"" then playing the next game in the series. The truh its worth buying and doing everything in the game at least once....a game that is uncomplicated-simple and fun			"

												...with dialogue written in broken english, a main character who looks like he's either constantly river-dancing or moonwalking, a screen resolution so far removed from HD it might as well be on another planet, AND, shockingly but performance issues (never mind the cr@p graphics / sound / etc) - this is one god-awful excuse of a game... AVOID!			"

												Great game.  The Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter series are short, but hectic games.  Definitely recommended.			"

												Ok it's not as good as AS2 Reloaded, it's shorter, but it's still very fun, I got it for 1$ and wasn't wasted. I only had 1 CTD and no bugs, but had to disable vsync from ini file, game was very laggy with it.			"

												It's like an isometric version of Serious Sam but with RPG elements. It's pretty fun though, keeps you on your toes, never a dull moment. People say it's ugly but i think it looks pretty damn good. The environments are pretty cool, obviously well thought out and the artists haven't cut corners. They did the best with whatever they had and pulled it off amazingly. All in all: If you wanna shoot $p!t til the sun goes down this is the game for you.			"

												Cons:- It's short (really short)- The AI is awful- Good gun at the end (2 last missions)- Terrain is poorly designed, you can be stuck in a corner .... I need to re-play through a entire level just because I was stuck just before the end :(Neutral:- Bad Dialogs, but I don't play a game like that for the dialogs ;)Pro:- It's a Alien Shooter- New monsters- Many many monsters per mapBuy it during sales only, or in a bundle like I do :D			"

												I think that the game started pretty cool!I was really enjoying it, even though its not the pretties one around. The controls are also basic and the its pretty much a mindless game where you just kill everything that moves.You have tons of weapons and lots of armor choices and, as I said before, I was having a good time with the game. Wasn't really minding how ugly and brainless it was...UNTIL THE ESCORT MISSION!Omigawd really? This mission kills the game. It totally makes you angry and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll forget any cool times you had playing it.I won't recommend it. Even though I had a good time 'till that mission, I believe that this is not the kind of game I'd recommend.			"

Product received for free
												Got this game for free during a giveaway to celebrate the new TD game. (which i should get as soon as i can)If you played previous Alien:Shooter 2 games.  --->  TLDR.Same engine, same soundtrack,same graphics, same guns, game still give rewards for a bit of exploration, Some nasty addition to the alien ranks, both melee and ranged, same action, and you get to fight more humans. less vehicle levels (its a good thing, since those are pointless missions that you can never fail to complete),  different campaign (shorter i guess, took me like 2 hours to complete). The game really doesnt offer anything new, except the campaign, new units hit hard, but wont matter much as you can take them out easily and wont really make an impact due to the lenght of the game.Im a big fan of the franchise, so i can only recommend, regardless of how i got the game.Im not entirely sure why Sigma deliver all their games as a stand alone instead of dlcs, but their games are usually cheap, so i guess doesnt matter. But seriously, this is virtually a dlc.If you havent played any games of the franchise, well, you should. And when you do, go back to the TLDR.			"

												Average isometric visuals. Average story. Average gameplay. Music is well... okay (not my kind ingame, but menu theme is memorable).Full price is rip-off and it feels more like DLC to AS2, however it was still somehow enjoyable, can run well even on old laptop =) (that's where I played this game originally). Slight advice: It's gets boring after some time, so you need to dose that game. Play hour a day maybe.			"
