												You like Diablo II? This is the game for you. It lacks Diablo charm and aesthetic, but the mechanics are pratically the same.Even if multiplayer is absent, the game is really good, and every Diablo fan should have it.			"

												That kind of game that keeps you from pretty much having a life. ""One more floor and I'll go make dinner""- you think.. 5 hours later: ""Ok, that's IT! This is the last floor and then I'm hitting the bed!"" Spoiler: It will never happen, you will never stop, Runic Games knows how to get ahold of your soul.. Nobody should be keener for fast runs with this one!Still loving the game,despite my lack of sleep. The classes aren't many but the characters adapt as you level up and allocate points.You get your very cute little pet,too. Despite starting with Torchlight II and only now buying Torchlight I, I'd say it's as addictive and awesome.TL,DR -> Go grab this awesome game!9/10			"

												This game is a great action rpg. It's not a refined as TL2, however there is more than enough game here to stand own it's own. The story isn't bad, the graphics hold up well. The end boss is actually an epic battle. A few downsides: drops do not highlight unless you hit 'alt'. I found my thumb perminately locked on the 'alt' key. There is not shopping list for your pets. If you do the Bard's quests you will have to town port after almost every level. Pets pathing and selecting drops is sometimes stressful. The goods: Lots of levels. It took me about 22 hours of play time to get to the final boss that was on dungeon level 32. There are 100 more dungeon levels past that. Character development is very open. Just because your a warrior doesn't mean you can't wear a robe and wield a wand. Potions drop from about 60% of the mob kills: This seems like a con in the beginning, but once you hit the lower levels you'll be thankful. If you have this and haven't played it, why not? If you can pick this up on a sale then I would definately recommend it.			"

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight II ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight is a Top-Down Action RPG Dungeon Crawler developed by Runic Games in 2009. The game invokes a Diablo-esque / Fate-esque gameplay mechanic mostly because the developers were former members of the teams that made said Diablo and Fate games.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game is set on the town of Torchlight, a small mining community who stumbled across a strange new mineral called 'Ember' which produces an unfortunate side effect to anyone who comes into contact with a corrupt piece. The player takes on the roles of the Alchemist, the Vanquisher or the Destroyer who makes their way through the deep mines and caves of Torchlight to stop a great evil from rising and destroying the world.PROS:+ Classical Formula: -(Also a CON, see below) Although the game is dangerously familiar to Diablo, Torchlight executes this formula almost to perfection. The loot system, monsters, player classes and gameplay mechanic were applied and utilized very well in a way that gives a renewed interest on the genre.+ Artistic: -Graphically, its not the most pleasing game, but its true artistic quality is with the style. It deviates from the regular dark, gothic themes of most games in the genre and instead, replaces it with a cartoon look in a steam punk setting.+ Map Variety: -Story wise, you're only headed down, but each map you enter has completely different themes. You can be exploring a dark dank cave one moment, and the next, find yourself in a long forgotten stone crypt or an ancient temple.+ Sound and Music: -The composer is Matt Uelman, Composer for works such as Diablo, World of Warcraft and Star Craft, and with a track like that, you can only expect greatness in the music quality.CONS:- No Multiplayer: - The game is a single player experience. No multiplayer mode whatsoever which disappointed many fans.- Story: - Rather weak and forgettable story with too few side missions.- Classical Formula: -(Also a PRO, see above), Strip it down to its bare minimum and you have a generic Diablo Clone right down to the Story. PERSONALLY, I think its GOOD since the newer generation of gamers who never got to experience the glory of the original Diablo can now experience it through Torchlight.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME FOR GREAT VALUE. Although some may argue that Torchlight (1) is obsolete because of the release of Torchlight II, the first title still provides a lot of entertaining hours with its Diablo (1) type of gamestyle.WORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game deserves your attention however, you may also want to check out Torchlight 2 since it expands the world and introduces multiple new classes.FINAL NOTES:You would think that its just your average Dungeon Crawler RPG and you would be right since all the elements of Torchlight are the basic elements to an Action RPG, HOWEVER, it's how Torchlight merges those elements that make it stand out from the rest. From start to finish, this game uses and applies the tried and tested classical formula to create a wonderful and memorable experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												I don't really play games like Torchlight. The style of action RPG proliferated by titles like Diablo never really interested me. It's mostly just a repetitive slog of killing and looting identical enemies who changed only statistically, becoming incrementally more difficult so as to retain the same amount of effort required for their deaths. While Torchlight is all that and more, it managed to keep me entertained for quite some time through diverse enemy types, artistic direction and engaging skill trees.The gameplay hardly needs explaining - it's like Diablo. You control most everything in the game using the mouse and some hotkeys. I chose to play as the 'vanquisher' class, focusing on ranged weaponry and magic related to it. The abilities of this class mostly serve to complement her ranged weapons, and I managed to completely finish the game without even equipping a melee weapon. I did find that the class benefited significantly from having summoning spells, allowing players to fire powerful ranged spells at enemies while minions keep them at bay. A lot of the more powerful weapons felt great to use, and I was impressed by the game's lenience toward players interested in multiple gameplay styles--nothing stopped me from summoning an army of skeletons, even though I didn't choose the class focused on that at the start of the game.Torchlight's balancing feels fine, though later levels do feature some enemies with huge damage output that were a pain to get past. I really liked the way the game's entire story takes place in a single dungeon, with the player's gradual descent into the earth beneath the titular town slowly revealing different fortresses and ancient ruins all lying beneath the ground. The game begins with entry into the mine upon which Torchlight's economy is reliant upon, but before the game's end you'll see a sprawling necropolis, colourful, flooded ruins and a fiery dwarven fortress. The graphical diversity keeps things interesting, and everything's quite pretty too. I liked the cartoony art style, but I found it quite curious how many enemies were simply recoloured, buffed up a bit and reused.On release, some criticised Torchlight for it's lack of any form of multiplayer component. I personally found this to be a good decision, as a single-player game tends to be more focused. Torchlight, despite the admirable streamlining of UI and gameplay still contains a large amount of engaging content, even after the final boss. I just don't know if Torchlight will be one of those games that the average player can get a huge amount of mileage out of--while I found the content to be sufficient, it certainly does get old after a certain point.

												Fun and solid dungeon romp reminiscent of the Diablo series. (Yep, it's going to get compared/referred to Diablo whether we like it or not)Randomly generated dungeons with tons of randomly generated loot. Cliche story with a tiny twist (didn't see that coming a mile away. Nope, nadda, nah). Solid gameplay, great graphics and music.Would have played this game much longer if Torchlight II wasn't already here (well, actually I did, since I already first played it off Steam). 10/10			"

												Thinking back on my time with the Torchlight campaign, the phrase “Baby’s First Diablo” keeps coming to mind. I think it provides a more accessible aRPG experience coupled with unusually light hearted and colorful world design. It’s by no means a game for children but for someone who is not a hardcore aRPG diablo master, Torchlight is a fantastic, more relaxed Diablo style adventure. It’s successor (Torchlight 2) is much improved in most of the gameplay aspects, but for the right price the original is a must buy and will not disappoint.			"

												A very, very enjoyable game.  If Diablo is the older, serious, stylish sister, then Torchlight is the younger, jovial, fun-loving twin.  At its heart beats a quick-based action RPG where performing story based kill or fetch quests, see you fighting through numerous levels of varying monsters and enemy bosses.  In addition optional sidequests though similar steal your focus from time to time allowing you to power-up your characters abilities if you so desire.  Now while you can expect alot of repetitive gameplay you can choose from three archetypal characters with which to complete the challenges ahead: Go hand-to-hand combat with the fighter, shoot from range with the archer or blast your foes with magic as the wizard.  Each character can assign skill points to four seperate skills: Melee, Ranged, Magic and Defense and each has a set of three skill trees from which to customize their style of gameplay further.  Through the clever use of item pre-requisites you can actually choose to use all three types of weaponary available to you.  So mix and match to your hearts content.  Players can choose to equip many aspects of their character with a truly huge assortment of equipment from armor types, jewelry and weapons - all of which are designed to provide you with a selection headache.  If that is not enough some items can be upgraded further by slotting them with magic igots called ember that boost certain abilities.  These igots can be transmuted to form bigger more powerful items, that provide bigger bonues if enough are found.Further to the base game you will be able to use numerous magic spells to augment your offensive and defensive capabilities from casting fireballs to calling on temporary npc allies.  You also possess an animal companion which can be used to send items to the town above when you can trade and upgrade items.  This animal companion can also be temporarily be turned into other creatures with other powers in your fight to reach the end of the game.Overall despite its functional story its graphics, music, voice-overs and design provide some nice touches filling with with atmosphere, providing a fun flilled blast-a-thon with plenty of action and reward for those of you who'd love a change from a deep meaningful game.Probably the only down sides is restrictive nature of the inventory which can be a pain when handling alot of items, its purely singleplayer aspect and also the expected reptitive nature of gameplay.  (If you want mp/coop try TL2)However I would recommend this to anyone who likes to try something different from shooters, strategy or deep RPGs.			"

												The dungeon-crawling genre has never had a complicated formula: you kill stuff, you get equipment, you kill bigger stuff, you delve deeper. Repeat as necessary. Torchlight is, well, no different. But it does it well. It refines many aspects of the genre, adds some more options to the top, and tops it all off with an attractive style that is pleasant to look at as you cut down swaths of enemies.You begin the game as one of three classes: the Destroyer, the Vanquisher, and the Alchemist. Despite the names, they're really just fancy ways to say Warrior, Ranger and Mage. Each of the classes gets a number of skills unique to who they are, such as the Destroyer having a lot of close-combat abilities to take down enemies, the Vanquisher having a number of traps and long-range attacks for their guns and bow, and the Alchemist has a number of spells that do different types of elemental damage to enemies. Each skill has only a character level as a prerequisite. No previous skills need to be taken, no amount of skill points need to be spent. This is a system that I'm not fond of. It encourages hoarding skill points, and can be a little dull to distribute skill points in.In addition to these class-specific skills, there are about ten skills that are shared across all classes, passive skills that do things like increase damage with martial weapons, increase armor defense, or increase the effectiveness of some spells. Based on what class you have, these shared skills are only available at certain levels. For example, as the Alchemist, you can get Magical Weapons Expertise immediately, while as the Destroyer this skill has a much higher level as a prerequisite. But these aren't all the skills available. There are also a number of spells in the game, scribed onto scrolls, that every character can learn. These spells range from healing yourself to attacking enemies, raising your damage, and so forth. These act differently from skills: they are learned just by using scrolls, not skill points; any character can learn them; each character can only have a certain number memorized at any time (they can be forgotten whenever you want); and to get a higher level of the spell, you need to find the higher level version of that spell on a scroll. The variation of class-specific skills, general passive abilities, and spells means that every character can be different.Each character also starts with a pet as well. With this pet comes not only a fighting partner in the dungeon - one that can equip rings and an amulet, in addition to two spells - but also something of a pack mule. You can throw a bunch of equipment onto your cat or dog, then send them off to town to sell all the equipment. It makes the action a lot more seamless, since frequent trips to the town are no longer required, breaking up the action all the time. Throughout the various dungeons you can also fish, the results of which can be fed to your pet in order to turn it into different creatures with different stats, abilities, and weaknesses.Attributes are handled a little oddly in this game. There's the typical Strength, Dexterity, Magic, and Defense, but they don't do what you might expect. Though defense is pretty much self-explanatory, all the other attributes do is increase other amounts of damage. Strength raises physical damage, dexterity raises ranged damage, and magic raises elemental damage. Like I said, it's weird (magic doesn't even increase your mana reserves), but it makes for some interesting builds. In other games, you'll always see mages, for example, have very high magic levels and a disregard for every other attribute. In Torchlight, while this is viable, spreading out your attribute points also works. You can put points into magic and dexterity to increase the damage of wands that shoot long-range magical attacks, or some points into strength to beat the enemies that get close to you with staves. It offers a lot more options than a typical dungeon crawler, though it may take some time to get used to.The dungeon levels are randomly constructed, but impressively so. I seldom encountered any lay-out that I considered strange or out-of-place. There are several different tilesets used, depending on the level of the dungeon, so the atmosphere never grows dull. Levels are littered with secret passages, multiple story construction, and the occasional trap to keep everyone on their toes. Each section of the dungeon has its own style, from the typical dank stone passageways to an underground greenhouse to the fiery depths of volcanic doom.And it’s not only the levels themselves that look great. All the graphics in Torchlight are top-notch. Torchlight sports a cartoonish look, keeping things from becoming too dark and dreary. The various spell and ability effects are solid, and everything runs along very smoothly. In fact, the system requirements for Torchlight are incredibly low even for a game that was released in 2009. The audio fares equally well, with solid voice work and a simply great musical score. The main plot demands about 15-20 hours of adventuring per character, and can be done at varying difficulty levels. Once the main story is complete, players can embark on a much deeper dungeon to further advance their character. Should players decide to be done with a character, they can “retire” that character from play and bequeath some bonuses on the next.I had an absolute blast with Torchlight, and I’ll be returning at least a few more times to try out some additional character concepts. There’s just a ton of well-done ARPG goodness here. And while I usually don’t comment on the price of the games I review, Torchlight brings all this goodness to players for just 14,99€. That’s an incredible amount of fun for a bargain-priced title. For action RPG fans, Torchlight is a title not to be missed.			"

												Diablo-inspired isometric hack-n-slash dungeon crawler (or ""action-RPG""), with many, so many levels filled with treasures and monsters, under seemingly common and peaceful village.Those of us who have played Diablo before, will recognize everything immidiately, and will be wandering only with cartoon-animated visual style and with the pet - which is quite nice and useful companion, generally, both in fight and in dealing with the loot (which was quite a problem back in time).Those of us who saw Fate, however, will not be asking any questions, as the Fate is just the base for the Torchlight, with the same visual style, mild music, and the pet. You may think of Torchlight as of much upgraded towards the more comfortable gameplay version of the Fate... And as of next of kin to Diablo Hellfire. And made by the same people, creators of Diablo and Fate.Torchlight is not a ""Diablo-killer"", as it goes with so many projects like Titan Quest, Sacred and so many others. On the contrary, Torchlight is actually made all this race to beat the fame of Diablo 1&2 looking even more out-of-order. As you don't need to be better than somebody else. You just need to be fun and complete all by yourself. And Torchlight is just that kind of game - with satysfying content, challenges, variety of features, and general fun-out-of-the-game.That I personally liked about Torchlight is the atmosphere, which is both quite reminiscent to the original Diablo, with the nearly same background and music... but much more mild and joyful altogether.That has frightened me there - is the same thing as with the Fate game - the amount of levels below the surface. Even after you'll beat the main scebario nemesis - you still have a long way down before you, with more and more powerful foes and more of the rarest loot.And it was namely the loot - along with other possibilities to enhance and empower a character - that frightened me the most. Really, while some people are starting to hate Skyrim for the hundreds of hours of adventures, in Torchlight the biggest blackhole, that has eaten the majority of my playtime - was levelling and redistributing items, perks and other enhancements. Yeah, just the same thing for which so many people love RPG systems in the first place - clear numerical system of your hero's progress - made me sick. For it seems so bottomless, that I've dropped the playing at one moment, realising that for every hour of dugeoning I'm spending 2+ hours just orginizing the stuff and making preparations... I'm not saying the game is like this. Actually, you can play it on the flow, and pauses for changing equipment and distributing stats can be as small as you want them to... It's just the way I'm playing the games and living life in general - if I can tune something to go with that in the field, I usually do that, ad perfectum.Summarizing. Torchlight is the one very nice and enjoyable hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, which can leave uncomfortable only those who can't play action-RPGs, sicked with cartoon-style animation, or completionsts like myself. One last thing to add is that I suggest to start playing right from the hard difficulty, for ""easy"" and ""normal"" settings are somewhat less inspiring. Overall mark is 7.8/10.			"

But if you look for a very decent Diablo clone with pleasant graphics, nice sounds and music and a very fluent gameplay, you found what you're looking for. I finished the main story, but the random dungeons still hook me to this game. Really an indie gem that lead to an even more polished sequel. Fully recommended if you're into action RPGs.			"

												I was looking for ARPG similar to Diablo and saw many recommendations for Torchlight and Torchlight 2. Coming from Diablo 3, the art style put me off at first but when both games went on sale, I decided to take the plunge. And I'm really glad I did.I've finished the main quest with my vanquisher and have enjoyed the game immensely. My favourite bit has got to be the pet. It's awesome being able to continue my mob killing badassery through the dungeons while my pet returns to town to sell my loot, especially on maps that don't allow porting back to town.A+++ will play again.

												This game starts off real nice. You get into it by recognizing the marks of the Diablo franchise. It is no surprise, because Runic Games was founded by ex-Blizzard veterans, and they intended to make a ""better clone"". So, the game is great fun for a couple of hours... but then the problems start to emerge. First of all, the levels are more of the same. The only difference is the texturing. Seriously, all levels play out the same - even the enemies act very alike, despite them being completely different looking creatures. Furthermore, you aren't really forced to evolve your character further and further. You can keep the same skills and just invest more points into them. Torchlight gets very boring and very repititive too early. I disagree with both scores on Metacritic (press + user). This is a mediocre game. Could have been a great game with a ~5 hour length, but no, they had to stretch it to be dull & tiresome. Runic failed with this first attempt. Maybe Torchlight II will be better.			"

												Wow, all I can say is this game is an absolute gem. I cannot remember the last time I played a game that I had this much fun while playing. This is an extremely well done hack and slash action/rpg, plays very similar to Diablo and Fate (which I finished a week or two ago as well), but there is something about this game that is head and shoulders better. Whether it is the cute cartoony art style, or the simplicity of the game play mechanics, probably a combination of them all. By the end of my first play through, my character was so overpowered that I was one hitting enemies and taking bosses health down by half each swing. I was a slow mace duel wielding warrior and it was hella fun. Another thing I like about Torchlight is there is endless replay-ability, once you finish the game, you open up a new dungeon with infinite amount of levels, each floor is randomly generated with enemies which scale to your level. This is a game to keep installed once you finish as there is plenty of reasons to keep coming back			"

												Very good game and well worth time spent playing it. Great Graphics. Characters easily customizable. Choose your class and customize it to your style of gaming. Multiple mods to choose from if that's what you like. I added one new character and a Loot Crate mod and that's all I use. No multiplayer that I know of? I've had no issues with the game and works well with M & KB. No need for any controller at all nor, needs to be changed to support them. If you can't play it with M & KB then, play something else. Price may seem a bit high but, it's money well spent for hours of endless fun. Sales are common so, if you don't want to spend $20 on the game, be sure to pick it up any time it goes on sale. 10/10			"

												A fun game that slowly starts to show you it has more to offer than just going around a mine. While the game is almost extremely easy, it does have it's difficult moments - however, the pacing and introduction of these difficult moments is odd. It's almost like the developers knew the game was too easy, so decided to throw a whole bunch of killer mobs and mob groupings together in the last few levels of the story mission. All of which leads up to the insanely difficult last boss - you will die several times fighting this large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Overall not a terrible game, and if Torchlight II hadn't been released I'd recommend this highly, especially given the cheap price point it seems to have these days. Interestingly, it appears as though the Story Mode is only the tip of iceberg, as the game seemed to open after killing the 'end boss'. New dungeons opened, options to retire hero appeared, all of which I now want to explore and play around with (at a later date).Torchlight's nods to Diablo are nice, and it's refreshing to see a game not denying the influence of Diablo to the Dungeon Crawler genre. The character models are nice and 'Blizzard' like too.			"

												Look, this game is great if you like a simplified Diablo type game. It has a more vibrant color palette than Diablo games, making it more cartoony and more accessible to young children, but the gameplay is solid and fast enough for anyone to enjoy. I'd rather play the sequel Torchlight 2 because it is twice the game this one is, and it has multiplayer which this one does not. The story is pretty bare and simple here. Basically this is a good game and I would say worth a playthrough, but if you want your money's worth then get Torchlight 2 over this one. However if this game's style is not to your liking then I would recommend checking out Grim Dawn which is graphically superior and mechanically similar to this and the Diablo series. If steampunk is more your style then give The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut or Victor Vran. If you want something more anient gods style then check out Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition.			"

												Torchlight one still holds up to this day. It is a dungeon based arpg without any surface missions. It has much in common with Diablo 2 but can't quite be as good as it's big brother. Still, all elements of a good addicting arpg are there. But that's also the only point which I can criticize, the game just doesn't try to push for more. The story isn't good but the combat and gameplay feels fluent. The fishing mechanic is a cool gimmick but I never really used it since it wasn't needed. Overall a good buy when on sale.			"

You have a dungeon underneath the town that leads to a boss that is ultimately corrupting the town. The townspeople will offer quests which you can complete and will give you rewards. (often non-consequential.) Where the game shines is in the huge amount of polish attached to that. Not only is it polished, it offers difficulties which tie to a level 1, something Diablo tied to tiers of levels.Something else I can rant and rave about is the fact that the game is essentially endless. The dungeon goes for 100 levels, and on top of that, there's maps which take you to a randomly generated map that you can trek through for even more content. Now enemies are pretty set to each map, unless you do the maps that are randomized per level.This game does only offer three classes, but those three each have three trees that are different in and of themselves. You have you brutish fighter with his defense, attack, and dual wield options. You have your archer that can either be a melee rogue, set traps, or go full on archery. And you have the alchemist that will boast summoning, and two types of spellcasting. (I played the Alchemist the least.)As for anything else, check the game out. It's definitely worth it if you enjoy Diablo style hack and slash games. I would honestly even recommended it to newcomers to the genre, since it boasts a casual difficulty, and even goes all the way to a Very Hard, which is definitely hard. It also comes with Hardcore modes for the masochistic, like myself.I cannot rant further about how amazing this series is, except I can, because there's a second installment that adds on top of every good thing here.

TL;DRA classic action RPG with a lighthearted attitude.+ Solid gameplay+ Classes (the classic trinity)+ Graphics+ Setting+ Loot+ Tons of mods (no Steam Workshop though)- Linearity- No multiplayer- No customisation (there are mods for that)REVIEWTorchlight is a classic action RPG developed by Runic Games. It features Diablo-esque gameplay with a cartoonish art style.There is not much to say about the story: Torchlight is a mining town where a magic mineral called Ember is stored. Alric, once an adventurer like you*, has been corrupted by the One Ring tainted Ember and fell to the Dark Side went rogue. You are to enter the depths of the underworld and track him down. The gameplay is solid and focuses on going deeper down while completing quests and eviscerating thousands of nasty creatures. The setting is an interesting mix of medieval fantasy and steampunk: magic and swords meet robots and firearms. One should not be surprised to see a robot bard who gives monster contracts.There is a classic trinity: a warrior (Destroyer, male), a rogue (Vanquisher, female), and a sorcerer (Alchemist, male). Each of the classes have 3 skill trees which provide a player with a variety of playstyles. Unlike in Diablo, some skills are shared among the classes (e.g. passive skills which provide an xp boost, dual wielding damage bonus, etc.). What is also unique is that every character can learn to use various spells (up to four at a time). Wanna be a dual axe wielding Destroyer who can also cast fireballs on demand? No problem!The art style is pretty much timeless: the graphics are decent even now (there are texture mods should anyone be interested). Even though there is not much freedom to explore, randomly generated dungeons are diverse enough to keep one entertained for hours. Moreover, the game is paced just about right – the ""just one more level"" phenomenon is real. Speaking of art, the soundtrack is just astounding which is hardly a surprise. It was composed by Matt Uelmen, the author of Diablo's soundtrack.It is a shame that there is no multiplayer, as gathering a group and venturing forth is a staple for action RPGs. The only companion a player will go with is a pet: either a cat or a dog. Pets can support you in a fight, cast spells (up to two at a time), and go to town to sell your items. The player can also feed them fish which make them change into different creatures. Speaking of downsides, there is no character customisation.In conclusion, Torchlight is a marvellous action RPG which can provide hours and hours of highly enjoyable gameplay. One should do themselves a favour and play this gem.*Wait, wrong game.P.S.

												I love fantasy and RPGs so that's the first reason I picked it. The other reason is that my PC is kinda old and Torchlight has low system requirements. The design is cartoony/real and colorful. I love the level design and it looks like modding will be doable...something to try in Torchlight 2 I think. I love the customization options. Its great that you can go on autopilot and grind for hours or solve puzzles and work your way around enemies. Plus the game has hours or replayability (is that a word?) by working your way thru extra maps acquired thru questing/purchase or playing as a different character class.			"

												I started playing Torchlight, because one of my friends played it, and it looked like fun.Before that, I never played any Diablo game (beside Dungeon Siege) and wasnt familiar with ARPG games.Having a simple story, you will forget, in the second it ends, Torchlight is mostly a game about monster hords, explosions and loot. Village gets attacked by evil wizard, heros help, heros save the day (and genocide countless minions).You have 3 playable Characters, without being able to edit their stats and looks: A melee, ranged and mage.Beside having classes with roles, every characters has 3 skill trees, that mostly provide main damage, support abilitys (buffs or debuffs) and summoning allies. Also each of these trees provide you with the abilitys to fight with the weapon, that was made for the class (sword for melee, guns for ranged and staff for mage) or buffing the damage with fighting with another class weapon, so the melee fires with staffs (why would he do that?).The loot is mostly randomized like in every ARPG. Exeption are uniques and set items, that also can have different stats, but have them always in a certain pattern.Also, the village provides you with different NPCs who offer you:- 3 traders- A quest NPC, that gives you tasks into special dungeons, giving you bonus dungeons as reward- a gambler that sells you items, that have random stats- two goblins, that can ether save sockets from items or clear items from sockets- an item enchanter, that can upgrade your items. There is always a chance to break the item, which chance increases with every use. Features like that were stupid like ever, because they can be bypassed by save and load (in this case, because the game saves automatically, you can crash your game to leave without saving).Having a campaign that is going through a dungeon with 34 levels, the bonus levels from the quest NPC and a endless dungeon, after you completed the campaign, you have enough time to enjoy the game.Contra:- The classes are really imbalanced:Having trouble fighting with the mage? You maxed your skills and still the enemy doesnt feel your hit? Play the ranged: I made a ranged fighter playthrough with every skill on level 1. How? The skills of the ranged character make damage based in % of your weapon damage. Most of the attacks of the mage do not. Who designs crap like that? Having a skill that gives you better mana regeneration and having the first ability on max, you can use it instead of your standard attack, blasting 300% weapon damage with every shot, with an attack, that pierces through enemys in a line. Why even playing the other classes.- The enemy damage is imbalanced:A big rock troll is hitting you? No problem, didnt even feel it. A little kobold mage casting a lightning on you? Dead!While physical damage gets blocked by your armor, elemental does not! So, you will be ignoring all enemys, only focusing on their mages. This can be so extreme that in the dark fortress levels you always look out or demon caster, because you will onehit them, and they will onehit you. It is who is spotting the other first. All that doesnt feel like it is right.- After lvl 50 the game starts feeling dull and unfinished:After playing through the campaign, you will notice that the drops of uniques will decrease more and more. Thats because instead having your level, most uniques have a certain item level they drop. Around lvl 50-70 the normal items will also start going rubbish, giving you sometimes lvl 40 item on lvl 70. After a time, normal playing is no longer possible, because the enemys get stronger, but you dontYou can have a lot of fun with Torchlight, but dont take it as serious as a Diablo.			"

												This is an excellent action RPG game. Maybe a bit more accessible for those who never played Diablo and don't want to really manage stats/builds and want a somewhat easier experience. Nice cartoony graphics, tons of loot and bad guys, good old-fashioned clicking and killing lots of things. The best part is having a pet that follows you around casting spells.			"

												After 125 hours, far more than anyone can say is reasonable for a game you're not enjoying, I can safely say that Torchlight is not for me and I wouldn't recommend it.It'd be tempting to nitpick, to try to justify my stance to be some semblance of reasonable, to browbeat others, but that's not what we're here to do.I can't recommend Torchlight because I don't like the core mechanic of pointing and clicking to direct and attack with a character in realtime combat. That's just a core disconnect that Torchlight is never going to bridge. I didn't realise it going into it, but after 125 hours of unenjoyment I had plenty of time to go over where I went wrong in life.""It's not a scam!""- Shopkeeper you're risking your life to protect.With that clear, subjective, inescapable bias out of the way:Torchlight is about descending below the titular Torchlight, through 35 floors with 6 themes to them, various bosses popping up along the way to say hi. It's Diablo but more colourful. The death-filled dungeon's environments are fairly nice, and provide an appreciable backdrop to endless slaughtering.Art design has some nice visual density without being cluttered or too generic. The ground being a canvas, combined with enemies not immediately despawning, leaves you knee deep in the dead after every encounter, which always a good look to end on.Environmental design covers levels that I couldn't tell you are procgen or not. Either they're tilesets or they're copied and pasted to death, but either way it's linear and boring. Your massive levels shouldn't leave me wondering why I even have a map.""Go on, get out of here!""- Shopkeeper you're putting your life on the line to keep alive.Character design fairs less brilliantly. Tends to stray into gaudy Blizzard territory, goofy - sometimes plain ugly - designs combined with giant pauldrons. The works. You've seen it all before, and it's never looked good. Not sure why character only have three fingers, either.Playing as these ugly characters, weird difficulty spikes abound; even on Very Hard, most of the time you're invincible. Nothing can touch you, doesn't matter what class you play as. Then boom, hitscan beam or elemental attack waterfall of pain that destroys you in a second. Pumping elemental resistance by spamming gems that, even when maxed to Perfect/Flawless, add pitiful bonuses that just encourages the pain. The Dark Zealot is infamous for a reason. It was less frustrating than just baffling, that things would be balanced like this.""I've got things to do.""- Shopkeeper you're fighting and dying to keep his way of life viable.Luckily it's mod-friendly. Extremely, extremely mod-friendly. I'm certain it wants you to mod it.Tired of potions refusing to stack after 20? Done.Tired of the default slow running speed? Fixed.Not quite sure that completing the game on Very Hard permadeath, with multiple Dark Zealots destroybeams hitting criticals, is even possible without continually running through the game to spam retirement upgrades? Nerfed.Mods could probably change how unbalanced the classes are, but in the vanilla state you really want to use Vanquisher. Every class can use every weapon and a good half of the skill tree (side note: every time a game with a skill tree is released without a respec, I commit crimes.) is universal, but it's simple logic:Ranged weapons have the same DPS as melee. DPS-based skills deal far more damage than flat-damage upgrades and summons are worthless. Your biggest dangers in this game is closing distance to kill high-value targets before they immediately kill you. So the Vanquisher creams where the Destroyer and Alchemist scream. Compared to her, they're almost painful to play.""DON'T. WASTE. MY. TIME.""- Shopkeeper angry that you spent 10 seconds of his time after hours of running through lethal gauntlets filled with killer goons.Postgame activities are in here, you've got the Shadow Vault, which is just running the same tilesets/levels with different enemies in them until you get bored, nary a boss or postgame questline in sight, and you've got fishing, which is worthless. After 1000 fish I got two permanent fish, so there's your payoff for that. You can probably mod it.You could make a case for there being a story, but I'm not sure I'd buy it. NPC shows up every now and again, and there's exposition between tilesets, that's about all there is.So I didn't have fun with, at all, so I couldn't recommend it. But as for saying whether or not it's good, frankly I don't think I'm qualified. If you like Diablo-likes, then I'm fairly sure you'll like this, but that's all I have to offer.			"

												The single player predecessor of Torchlight II, offers solid dungeon crawling gameplay reminiscent of the good old Diablo II days. With 3 main classes to select with a range a different skills and abilities, the game offers a multitude of gameplay experiences, with a permenant-death hardcore mode for the dedicated gamers. Fan created Mods offer various new styles of gameplay with additional pets, classes, skills, NPCs and more. Torchlight created a great fan base for its popular bigger brother, which I no doubt look forward to playing. Pros:+ Nice variety of player skills+ Fan created mods add plenty of replayability+ Added difficulty settings and a Hardcore mode for an extra challenge+ A wide variety of achievments to complete+ Good to zone out for mindless monster killing after a tiring day at the officeCons:- Many achievements are very tedious and grindy- Fishing is awful- The dungeons and enemies themselves can get repetitive after a whileMy Score: 7/10			"

												What if Blizzard and Runic had a debate on which game is better? It would go something like this:Blizzard: We have Diablo 1 and 2 that are the best classics ever! For only $20 each!(Might be more even considering Diablo 1 is hard to come by at stores that sell used games).Runic: We have Torchlight that has a level editor AND doesn't screw gamers over their money for expansions/dlc. Only $15!Blizzard: Yeah? We have Diablo 3 with stunning graphics! And that's for $40 new and $30 used!(Depending on where you buy it, and it's $60 at the blizzard store if you buy the digital deluxe edition, or $40 if you buy the standard for Reapers of Souls).Runic: We have Torchlight 2 with the steam shop. Only $20!Conclusion: Get Torchlight. While you're at it, get Torchlight 2. You could get Diablo 3 for the price of Torchlight 1 and 2. Just get Torchlight 1 and 2. They're a lot better and funner (I know funner is not a word, but it's the right word to describe this game). Torchlight may not have the best graphics, but it does promise you the best quality for playing through the game and not being bored one bit. If you play the game for the graphics, I do feel sorry for you. But, still tryout Torchlight.			"

												If your a fan of hack and slash RPGs like Diablo 2, you need this game in your life. While Torchlight doesn't really bring anything new to the genre, what it does bring is various vibrant and lush environments that can't help but draw you in and make you want to explore every inch of the landscape, leaving no stone unturned.An interesting point to make, regards your pet. The easiest way to put it is, you catch a fish, you feed the fish to your pet, your pet transforms into something you've probably killed. This adds a large element of versatility to how you approach each of the dungeons and may allow you a slight advantage in combat based on the abilities your pet gains as per the transformation.Long story short, get this game, you won't regret it at all.

I honestly enjoyed this more than I did D3.The game offers endless gameplay, side quests, heirlooming...My first character was the Warrior class, or whatever it is...Long story short, got him to level 32, beat the final boss (which takes a bit btw), and retired him.I'm now playing the Mage class on a higher difficulty and it's just as fun as the first play through!Just do yourself a favor and buy it, there's far too many aspects of this game to type out here, I can't say enough good things!

												Every time I play an action RPG I'm reminded of Torchlight. It's not even the first in the genre but I always remember it as one I never got bored with. I played floors the way I take my medicine, one a day. It's interface, challenge and loot always keep me coming back. Even after I finished the main story I still delved deeper into the extra dungeon that opened up if only to test my mettle.Let's take a look at the story though since I brought it up. You're helping this mild mannered swamp town inhabitants by venturing into a bottomless cave in hopes of uncovering the cause of the blight that has cursed this small mining community. More focused you're helping another adventurer find out what's happened to her friends. While you journey down the mines you read journal entries on what happened to the alchemist you're chasing. It all leads to an epic battle in which you see who's got the bigger magic stick. Really though, this is one of those games where the journey matters more than the destination.  I like the idea of the three classes as there's lots of ways to take down enemy hoards. You can even take your trusty pet with you. I prefer playing with the alchemist. I find that the best approach to taking on large groups of evil spawn is to summon my own to fight with me. The game is probably easiest with this class and I generally really liked the versatility with weapons and skills to choose from. The vanquisher and destroyer classes both have their strengths and weaknesses but I think the alchemist is more middle ground with the best of both worlds. There is loot a plenty. Weapons of all shapes and sizes. Many different things you can use to kill. There's also no shortage of quests. The one thing I think I would have liked was to have more towns or diverse number of people you could interact with. You are pretty much stuck with the same citizens of Torchlight throughout your journey but there's all the maps, quests and challenge that makes up for it. Also note that all the shortcomings of this game was made better in Torchlight 2. Though as the original I think it definitely stands the test of time.			"

												The best Hack 'n' Slash between Diablo 2 and this year's boom return of the genre. Torchlight and Titan Quest were pretty much the only Hack 'n Slash during this period, at least that I can think of, and Titan Quest weren't that similar to Diablo. Torchlight have a similar atmosphere to the Diablo classics, even though the art style and graphics are more colorful and high-res that those of Diablo 2 - They still have very similar atmospheres.A few guys in the Runic Games studio did work on Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, and therefore have a professional insight of what made the original game so great. I wish to prevent using the term Diablo-clone, because it casts a negative shadow over a great game, but Torchlight is a obvious success of cloning. In some regards, Torchlight is even better than Diablo 2 because of it's added genuinity.As every Hack 'n' Slash and RPG, you get to choose your class. In Torchlight there are only 3 classes; Vanquisher, Destroyer, and Alchemist. All three with different perks and advantages. Vanquisher is Range, Destroyer is Melee and the Alchemist is a Mage. Clear focus point for the three classes is speed, strength and magic in that order. You get to modify each class heavily though throughout the gameplay so each class can look very different in the end. There are a lot of different types of Weapons and Armors in the game, as expected from the genre! Loot is the most wonderful of things, see.One unique addition is the pet system, where you always have pet with you. This has a few advantages; for example can the pet go back and sell your loot, for non-stop hacking and slashing. The pet also helps out in the fights, and can never die only flee and run around like an idiot. You can boost your pet with armors and jewelry, as well as bind scrolls to the pet that it will cast by itself. I never upgraded my pet too serious though, I always forgot to give it new items - so it's not a game breaker. Just a neat feature.Sadly Torchlight lacked in a few areas as well, Multiplayer mostly so. Hack 'n' Slash is most enjoyable in co-op, where mowing through hordes of monsters become more of a sport. Luckily this year's sequel, Torchlight II, has improved the series greatly while maintaining the renowned Diablo aura. Torchlight offers rogue-like gameplay with the Hardcore difficulty settings, if you get tired of playing like a wuss. Worth picking up if you like Hack 'n' Slash and mindless killing, just be prepared to do it alone. Very good atmosphere and art-styleNote: It might be worth checking out Torchlight II (Review) as it only improves the original in all ways. As well as Free to Play game Path of Exile. "

												I am not sure I have much words to say about this game. While I did play the heck out of it, that was more for completion than for loving it the entire time.The game is definitely a Diablo clone, running through a dungeon over and over, getting down to the bottom of it, grabbing items and fulfilling quests along the way. Story is not a focus to the game. In fact, fighting, fighting, and some more fighting is pretty much the entire game.Honestly, the game was not exactly my favorite by any means. It pulled me in for a good while, as I thought it was nicely setup. But I don't think that this game has any amazing longevity because you just fight the same types of monsters forever. The game has mods that you can use to make things more interesting, so that is definitely a benefit.Overall though, games like this are a big hit in the community, so I can still recommend it for people if they enjoy Diablo-style games, even if I probably won't come back to it myself.

												Torchlight, like its sequel, is a quite enjoyable ARPG dungeon-crawler with a lot of loot, fun, and exploration to be had! I've enjoyed this game since 2013, and although I haven't played it in a while, it, along with Torchlight II, are probably my favorite ARPG games!The game is set in the small mining town of Torchlight, and the town needs help, as its mine is being attacked by monsters. As you continue further and further down the mine, you'll see a vast array of different enemies and environments, and quite a bit of loot to be had! There are three classes in Torchlight, and each one has different spells and weapon specializations. The Alchemist is a mage, specializing in staffs and wands, and has elemental spells and attacks. He has the highest MP of the classes.The Destroyer is a melee-oriented class that is best at using swords, axes, maces, and polearms. He has the largest health pool of the classes.The Vanquisher is a range-oriented class which has abilities that strengthen her ranged combat. She is best suited for long-range combat.Torchlight is an enjoyable game to play, and and its visuals nice. Its soundtrack is excellent, as well, and compliments the game quite nicely, giving it its cool style, just like the sequel has a nice style. The environments in the game are pretty fascinating as well, and sometimes quite varied, and there's many places to explore, and some side quests to do too.I also appreciate how lightweight it is, graphically. I think it still looks pretty good, while at the same time, being able to run even on old machines in my home, including old laptops!Throughout the game, just like with its sequel, there is a huge variation of armor, weapons, and enchantments that you will find, and you can also transmute items and enchant things at an enchanter. You can also find ""ember"" to socket items, which gives you various bonuses.Overall, I have no complaints about Torchlight. Its gameplay is very satisfying and quite fun, and I would certainly recommend this game, as well as its sequel, which introduces multiplayer co-op! Definitely pick both of them up, if you are someone who enjoys ARPGS, Co-op games, and loot games. ^.^			"

Both games go incredibly cheap on sales, a couple of euro/dollars if you want to wait. But I think both are worth it because they are both well made games from ex Diablo devs.			"

												It's like a cartoony Path of Exile mixed with some Diablo. I like everything about it but some things hereActual things wrong with the game- Tabbing out on fucllscreen causes the screen to bug out, getting rid of the hud or smearing characters across the screen. Minor Annoyances- Quests don't have a guide which can be a pain during the beginning where you don't know where anything is but some people would like this.- There really isn't a ""tutorial"" like in a lot of games that teaches you all the binds and what to do when you level up and such. It isn't too hard to get past this but it's a pain in the beginning.- Instead of phasing out a wall when you go behind it, you get outlined awell as everything else behind the wall.			"

												My travels take me into this small town called Torchlight which I get mixed up in someone else's problems. Always the life of the hero I guess. My mission was to go below the town into many floors of caves and ancient ruins to find a once good but now bad, like always, guy who was hell bent on awakening some all mighty evil. What he wasn't expecting was me, the all powerful bad guy killing machine and my trustworthy wolf.Torchlight was a pretty fun game to play. It's a massive dungeon crawler with loads of loot to grab, sell, upgrade, and use. The main storyline runs you down 35 floors which may take you some time to accomplish.  I clocked in a little over 27 hours to finish it but that is with some side missions too. You can put in tons of more hours into this if you want, specially if you like to collect achievements.Story is the basic good guy went bad and try's to bring some powerful evil out from below to take over the world. I didn't pay to much attention to the story since it didn't really grip me. This game also isn't really focused on the story since it is mainly a dungeon crawling loot grabber. After a while I did get a little burnt out playing and felt like the same thing over and over. Torchlight does look pretty good and play pretty good. There was a good variety of enemies to fight which would range in all sizes. Controls just had you clicking on enemies to attack which sometimes became an issue for me cause I would lose track of the mouse icon on my 46"" TV. You also had a pet to help you fight and carry loot. Both of you level up from XP to make you stronger throughout the game.Equipping your character and pet was pretty fun and a lot of work. You can equip every body part with armor and also have rings and a necklace. Your pet can also be equipped with a necklace, two rings, and two spells. All weapons and gear can be enchanted to add more stats to help you out. They can also lose all enchantments when trying to enchant them.Overall the game was fun and worth playing if you like dungeon crawlers. You also may want to just skip this one and go right on to part two as it has much more to it and it's co-op. This game can keep you busy for hundreds of hours just trying to accomplish all the achievements. You can definitely get your moneys worth out of it. Bear Rating: 8/10			"

												Torchlight was a one-and-done game for me - I beat it once, and had zero desire to play it again after that. It was okay, though it surprised me just how closely it hewed to the Diablo 2 formula. The addition of pets doesn't really change the inventory management game, it just means you're doing it in the dungeon instead of in town.I give Torchlight a tentative recommendation, but only if you are looking for a Diablo 2-alike that specifically isn't Diablo 2, Diablo 3, or Path of Exile.

												Repetitive, but wow, this is a beautiful game. It's fun, yes. For about 15 levels. Then the repetition kicks in as you grind your way to the conclusion.The initial feel of this game is much greater than it ultimately delivers. It's got all the bells and whistles you'd expect in a full-price Adventure RPG, but the main storyline is short, and when it's done, there's no compelling reason to keep playing. Even though there's an infinite (?) dungeon waiting to be plundered, I felt no compulsion to continue when there was no quest to fulfill.I am very much looking forward to Torchlight 2 to see if it's a bigger game. It may be a compelling alternative to Diablo 3.As this game is on sale often for $5, it's a great intro for first-time ARPGers. If you would prefer an ARPG a bit more satisfying, I reccommend Titan Quest: Immortal Throne.			"

												This is a great ARPG, but I'd reccomend it's successor, Torchlight 2, over this one. Torchlight, like Diablo before it, is a completely single player game. The music is by the same composer as Diablo and the game is created by former Diablo creators making it an excellent addition to anyone's collection. My biggest gripe with this game, however, is how ridiculously spongy the final boss is. If you're playing on Normal, you will breeze through the game, but you will still be nowhere near where you'll need to be to fight the final boss. I teleported back to Floor 1 and fought my way back to the end and tackled several Scroll Dungeons before I was able to defeat Ordrak and even then, it took me 15 minutes to drain his health. Great game, just be wary of this one major flaw.			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Torchlight skip to Results and read from there.Runic Games pushes the boundaries of RPG genre by providing a unique dungeon generation experience. Torchlight uses standard mechanisms for character development, but combines them in a unique experience that provides a fun and dynamic game. Story:In the relatively small town of Torchlight a mysterious element has caused a bundle of trouble. A special mineral known as Ember, popular for its unique traits, has been corrupted by a dastardly foe. A giant monstrosity has released his evil across the land and has corrupted the Alchemist known as Alric. It is up to you to fight through the layers of the mine and free the town of Torchlight from the evil daemon Ordrak who is forged from the ember the mine withholds. Campaign:Torchlight provides a relatively linear campaign filled with irrelevant quests that essentially provide a long-winded grind. The main story consists of 35-floors of a mine where each floor generally resembles the next with minor changes to the environment and foes held within. As you battle through the floors the enemies’ levels do not scale with the player; although, they do maintain a good consistency with the player’s level. To help separate the campaign each group of floors are bundled into segments that have portals connecting them: Orden Mines, Necropolis, Estherian Ruins, Tu’Tara Caverns, Molten Prison, Lost Fortress, Black Palace, and Lair.Each segment of the campaign contains a main boss which provides a unique battle experience that tests the player’s fortitude and skill.Gameplay:Torchlight offers a unique mixture of gaming by providing a generated dungeon element similar to Spelunky with a combat system such as Diablo the game provides a unique experience with each champion play through. In my personal opinion the campaign has little to no replay value when playing the same champion twice as the generated dungeons, although different are relatively the same.Similar to a standard RPG Torchlight provides classes that offer different combat styles: Alchemist, Destroyer, and Vanquisher. The Alchemist is your standard mage class and plays off magic attribute. The Destroyer is your standard fighting class and plays off strength. The Vanquisher is your standard hunter class and plays off dexterity. The gameplay elements are rather cumbersome and can be infuriating at times. There will be more times you will perish because of poor game mechanics than difficult curve. The player is required to move and fight by left-clicking with the mouse. This causes a lot of times where the players champion will run into battle when you actually just want to shoot from distance, this can also be annoying especially with fast moving and smaller enemies. Hints:>Do not waste your gems, using the Duran the Transmuter you can combine smaller gems into powerful gems that will have massive impacts on your champion. >Purchase Gems from Triya whenever you get back in town. She will sell them relatively cheap and if you keep using the Duran the Transmuter who doesn’t charge you can make powerful items.>Make sure to give your pet two spells, two rings, and a necklace. This will make them more powerful – I recommend Heal All and Frost.>If you’re ever stuck on a level just go back to an earlier part of the Campaign where the enemies are weaker and level up.>Make sure to send your pet back to town to sell items and heal up.>Defense is an important attribute – there is no tanking class so all classes need defense. Results:I played Torchlight after beating Torchlight II – this game is fun, but some elements are missing which cause the campaign to drain rather than provide enjoyment. The campaign is formatted in a way that seems like a grind rather than progression. The levels offer very little dynamics, meaning one portion of the campaigns play through is relatively similar to the next. Overall this game is relatively fun, and provides a good bit of enjoyment. It is a single player game and I’d really recommend getting Torchlight II over Torchlight, but if you are interested I’d say try to get this game when it’s on sale.Pros:+Lots of gameplay – estimated 40+ hours.+Unique character class with dungeon generation which causes acceptable multi-play through.+Pet which provides decent dynamics and intelligent character building.+Once the main campaign is completed the game goes on.+Two types of leveling: Fame and Experience. Fame gives you points to level your special abilities, while experience gives you points to level both special abilities and character states.+Amazing item diversity and item building. Enchanting items allows them to become stronger which makes key items very powerful and effective for building a highly custom character.Cons:-Poor controls moving and attacking utilize the same button.-No multiplayer-Pets stats are relatively low making them not entirely tank or damage.-Limited tutorial, this isn’t really that bad unless you are not averse to gaming.

												Initially I was extremely underwhelmed with this game. Poor class selection, rather simple combat mechanics, not huge variation in weapons, even the pet system could use some work. But what puzzled me the most is why this game had such good reviews for being as simple as it is. I mean, it isn't even unique, it simply takes parts from other games, dumbs them down, then integrates them. Then it hit me...That's why the game is so popular. You see, few people actually enjoy complex rpg's, which is this game's key to success. It makes playing extremely simple, with easy to understand mechanics and little variation. Considering that, this game really isn't all that bad. Would I reccomend it? Depends.If you are new to RPG's then yes, buy it.If you enjoy simpe games, then yes, buy it.Otherwise, buy Dungeon Siege 2 or get Neverwinter Nights or something.			"

												This is a really good Diablo 1 clone, with some neat features (like a pet that fights alongside you when he isn't running back to town to sell loot for you). There's one ""main"" dungeon with a couple dozen levels and then a number of side dungeons (including an endless one that open up once you've finished the ""main"" one). There are also 3 character classes to choose from (fighter, rogue, mage basically), and you can share items between characters in various ways. The story is minimal, and the quests are repetitive (usually involving killing a named enemy). The equipment and player stats are obtuse and unhelpful, especially for dual-wielding characters, but otherwise the equipment/stats system rivals that of Diablo 2. The game is also modder friendly, which is a nice bonus.			"

												Torchlight is an action RPG, made by ex-Blizzard employees.  You can tell as the feel is similar, though Torchlight does more and does it very well.  The graphics are crisp beautiful and somewhat cartoony.  The levels are randomly generated and they can go on and on and on too.  I think I reached level 100+.  The action is intense, but never too difficult to be frustrating.  The loot is remarkable, I've never seen so much loot.  It's nice that you have a pet as a companion to not only help with the fighting but to also go back to town with your loot to sell so that you don't have to constantly go back through a town portal to empty your bag.  The story is nothing new, we'll seen the evil take over a town, and the hero fights it back storyline.  It's the action, the gameplay and the fun that can be had in Torchlight that makes it shine.  One of the best action RPGs to date.			"

												Yes, I'm aware that Torchlight is a ""Very Positive"" game, but that does not make it immune to criticism. I didn't write this review simply to be a contrarian jerk. Videogames age, some more than others. At times, all it takes is for a game to receive a sequel, in order for its age to become readily apparent. Torchlight II improves on the original in every conceivable way. I'll even go as far as to say that Torchlight has been rendered obsolete. There's literally no reason to play Torchlight 1 over its sequel, or over the great many other loot-heavy action RPGs that have been released over the years.The absolute biggest problem with this game is the difficulty curve. I played through this game on normal, and for 9/10ths of the game, there wasn't any challenge. However, once I got to the final portion of the game, I started running into Dark Zealots. Dark Zealots have auto-targeting instant lightning. All it takes is a couple crits and I die. I admit that my lightning resistance wasn't up to snuff, but the fact that this attack is completely unavoidable is ridiculous. Once Dark Zealots start appearing, they're bound to show up fairly often throughout the post-game. I was on the 5th floor of the Shadow Vault and a Dark Zealot's lightning brought me from full health to death. I played through Torchlight II on hard difficulty. A veteran is likely to pop in here and say ""That's still way too easy."" but hear me out. Torchlight II on hard was more consistent than Torchlight 1 on normal. The game remained fairly challenging (for me) throughout the entirety of the main campaign. I didn't sleepwalk through the game, nor did I suddenly get a heaping helping of horse manure towards the end of it and beyond.By the way, why does Ordrak have 3 billion HP? Why can he summon countless dragons and skeletons? I'm positively boggled that anyone signed off on this nonsense of a finale. The ludicrousness of the final boss really stands out, when every other boss dies in a minute or two. Torchlight 2 was more consistent when it came to bosses.Loot. Now I know it's difficult to expect good loot. There is the almighty RNG, and I've never been very lucky. Nevertheless, there is a rhyme and reason to how this system should work, and players should feel like their time is rewarded, especially when they defeat bosses or discover secret rooms. Instead, you're just as likely to get a weapon that's usable for half the game as you are to not find any decent armor upgrades for 3/4s of the game. AGAIN, Torchlight II is more consistent. Torchlight II also has better quest-design, exploration, map-design, classes, skills, monster-variety, and so on and so forth. It's practically a revelation by comparison. Now I could download a couple mods to fix the Dark Zealot's insane lightning, or drop Ordrak's HP to something manageable, or improve the myriad of other things that need improving, but that's not my idea of a fun time. Mods are at their best when they add to a game, not just fix its problems. Besides, I already own the sequel. At this point, there really isn't an excuse not to. Torchlight II enjoys sizable discounts during all of the major Steam sales.On the bright side, when I review Torchlight II (eventually); I won't have to spend the entirety of it discussing why it's a better game than the prequel.

												This was truly a fresh experience when it came out 5 years ago. At the time Diablo 3 was far away from being released so fans of the prequel could really enjoy Torchlight as it had the same mechanics as Diablo 2 had in 2000.But what about now? In 2014? Is it worth playing?Well, it depends: The first game focuses on single-player only. Runic Games made the sequel an MMO so multiplayer and coop can be found in it and it offers a long-lasting experience.If you do not mind playing alone an RPG for dozens (if not hundreds) of hours then Torchlight is for you. If you prefer friends then you should purchase the sequel and you'll immediately see that even for one class there are many builds you can create so Torchlight can truly be a long game.  "

												Torchlight is a good game.  That being said, Torchlight exists in a world where it is overshadowed and outperformed by its sequel.  The original Torchlight game has a a very small world, and the game/ progress is incredibly linear.  Basically there's a single town and a solitary dungeon with numerous levels leading down that you work through.  That's it.  In addition, the story is pretty much an afterthought.  What the game does get right though, is the actual gameplay.  Combat is a joy, and honestly you rarely mind grinding through the same early stages as you try to progress deeper down into the dungeon.  My typical play session stretched to several hours and I think I burned through this game in two weeks, so that gives you an idea of how addicting the combat is.  Multiple classes, a great concept of a helper pet, and bright visuals make for a fun time.  If you can only pick up one game though, I would recommend the vastly superior sequel.  In addition, if you've already played the sequel then this game feels like a step down after that.  A solid game, but others (including the sequel) do it better.  7/10 for this one.			"

												Having not played the successor (yet), I can' t compare both titles... what I can say, however, is that Torchlight 1 is a good game by it's own right.The story is lovely but short (there are achievements for defeating the final boss in under 8 or even 5 hours), it has some very nice features regarding gameplay (most importantly the pet which fights alongside you and which you can send back to town to sell your loot) and the fighting system is fun too, although some people might complain that it's to easy - I only died once on normal during the main story, and that's because I was extremely unaware.A point of critique is that after you have beaten the main story, the only reason to go to the ""endless dungeon"" is to get the achievements related to it and to have some harder fights, so, in my opinion, the replay-ability is fairly limited. I will play two additional classes to try and get some hardcore- and speedrun- achievements, but not further.A point worth mentioning is that there exist a lot of mods out there to enhance almost everything - additional quests, monsters, dungeons, a new GUI, only to mention a few things. Even better: They do not disable the achievements (only a very few mods do) but rather there are 3! achievements for having mods active while playing.Overall, I would give this game a 7 out of 10 and can recommend it when its in sale, although you MIGHT wanna play the second game instead. Check the demo!			"

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.If Torchlight has solidified anything in my design preferences, then it’s my distaste for huge amounts of loot. I like Torchlight, I really do. It’s a fun isometric Action/RPG experience, with very precise, responsive and polished controls, good enemy variety, a nice skill system, and pets. When I first opened up the game and saw that you can have a dog or a cat I instantly went ‘OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL’, I didn’t even know what their purpose was at that point.But by Odin’s beard does the loot system just annoy me. It’s actually the very reason why I become bored with Torchlight after playing it for a while. Though the next day I want to come back to it, because the core gameplay is fun and addicting in a way (and although I guess this is contrary to the general opinion, but in my case loot doesn’t contribute to the addiction). But there’s just too many items with too little differences, that the joy of finding something is not there at all. For example, on one dungeon run I have found five rare chest pieces of the same type with little differences in bonuses they give. I couldn’t choose, it was really hard to make an informed decision based on minuscule distinction, so I decided just to sell them all, and try to enchant my current armor instead. And put a gem into the socket to give it additional stats I needed.And, you know what… This should have been the focus of the loot mechanic, of the whole equipment system. Enchantments and gems. In the game, whenever you visit an enchanter, you have a chance to add a random bonus stat to an item, or a socket for a gem (on another hand, there’s a chance that all your bonuses are going to be removed completely, and it increases with every enchantment of the item). You use different kind of ember gems to put into sockets, which give the items more stat bonuses. You can also combine (transmute) different tiers of ember gems to create more powerful gems.I haven’t played Diablo-like games in a while, so I don’t think the idea is new to Torchlight. However, it’s a very cool concept that increases the longevity of the item that you use. In fact, you kinda become attached to it, especially after a number of successful enchantments. But the loot system – the amount of all the stuff you find and how similar they are, it hinders the enchantment/gem system, because you are not quite sure which part of your equipment to focus on when there’s such a huge turn-over rate of the items in your inventory.Decrease the randomness of the items (and the loot frequency), increase the amount of ember gems that you find, and tweak it so every new piece of equipment you find would be (or become) a meaningful addition (and would make the choice between staying with current upgraded equipment or refocusing on new one more prominent). I would’ve had so much more fun with that. You can say, “Well, why don’t you go make your own Torchlight then (with blackjack and hookers)?” And hey, Runic Games allows us to do just that – they have released an editor for Torchlight which allows to edit… well, pretty much everything. So I might as well try to change how the loot system works. Modding scene is definitely one of Torchlight‘s strongest points, and they embrace it fully – there are even Steam achievements for using mods.Overall, Torchlight is a very good game. I really don’t agree with the loot mechanics, and the random dungeon generator sometimes creates exact same huge chunks of levels in supposedly different locations (so it’s somewhat jarring), but it has got fun hacky-slashy core mechanics, and everybody can tweak it to his or her liking thanks to the modding capabilities.

												A classic. A dirt cheap, balls to the wall, throwback of the century.The debut game for the latest label that a collective of Ex-Diablo devs operate under, since they left Blizzard that is, Torchlight is the definitive herald for a new era of ARPG's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what level of influence THIS, not Diablo, had on newer releases like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, and obviously its sequel, Torchlight II, which I recommend starting at unless you really care about that previous point.So yea, grab it, it's on sale for nothing all the time. It's also on GOG, often for less than here, and those copies are DRM free (can save the installer and give to friends freely, like a music CD.) "

												Not a bad game.  It's clearly a Diablo clone, but, after finding out who the developers were (mostly Diablo developers!) I can understand why that is!  They took a formula that worked, and tweaked it slightly.  If you enjoy ARPGs you'll probably enjoy this one.  Nothing terribly new to speak of, though the pet is a nice additional mechanic.If you're looking for a dungeon crawling ARPG with nice atmosphere that you can do a level or two when you've got some time, this will be a good pickup for you.

												A single-player only Diablo 2 clone with some refining for maximum efficiency of gameplay and less time spent doing inane things (auto gold pickup, for example). Though still a lot of fun, the lack of co-op multiplayer detracts from the one thing that made Diablo 2 such a fantastic game. At least we can look forward to this in Torchlight 2, I'm sure.			"

												A fun dungeon-delver that is fun for quite a while before it starts to get old. each ""theme"" gets longer as you go down, so the further down I went, the more tired of seeing the same environments and enemy models i became. Co-op would have been an excellent addition, but this game will tide you over until the sequel (or Diablo III) comes out.			"

Posted: January 26, 2016
												Single-player Diablo-like game (action role-playing dungeon crawler, isometric clicky clicky with randomized loot drops) that came out in 2009. The world was still waiting for Blizzard to deliver the next Diablo, and so, this was well-timed.  (Runic went on to release Torchlight2 at around the same time that Diablo3 came out.) It also has a pretty deep mod community, though I'll admit that I played the game vanilla on my playthrough.The game is polished: graphics aged fine, clean audio helps the game feel immersive and responsive, and the game runs smoothly on my high-end gaming rig. Did not try it on anything else, but I suspect it'll run just fine. The story is nothing new, but then again -- you're not really playing this game for the story. It's a game where you diablo diablo diablo til you diablo diablo diablo, while you diablo diablo diablo... diablo. In that aspect, the game entertained me 'til the end. According to the in-game panel, that was about 12 hours.One point of emphasis: the game difficulty runs easy. If you want a challenging game in which you engage all the mechanics, I'd highly suggest you nudge the difficulty up. In my playthrough, I didn't touch any of the optional map-fragment dungeons; simply the main dungeon and the ones that Hatch opens for you, in his Quest For Many Things. My character's levels almost always matched the number of the main dungeon floor I was on. Though I do have a habit of clearing each floor completely, I shouldn't have been overleveled for any part of the game. And yet, I never had to use a mana potion or any of the various mana shrines. Didn't touch a health potion until L25, and even then rarely. Never had to fiddle with my pet's form -- simply used him as a carryall back to town to sell my items. (So, that took the need to fish right out of the picture.) I had no real use for my currency. (Game only has one -- gold.) I was one-shotting enemies with the gear I found on the ground. I cannot imagine the devs intended for you to three-shot their bosses. At some point toward the end, I just decided to put 100k gold into enchanting a single item, you know, for funsies. I suspect the devs had intended for the enchantment system to work as a gold sink, but I simply didn't need the stat boosts to make the game less challenging. I'm afraid it would have become boring.I never once used any spells. I also didn't bother learning any non-passive class skills outside of the first available frost shot. Once I learned that, that's what I left my secondary attack on.Perhaps it was simply because I'd built up a ranged, spike character and the dungeons are designed with bottlenecks galore (hallways and corners everywhere, weeee), but giving the ranged player a NPC tank, a single-target spike, AND a piercing crowd-control projectile so very early in the game may have been overkill.Even if you haven't played a Diablo before, turn the difficulty up a bit.Other small notes:Pet pathing. I realize this is sticky for many devs to get right, but boy -- my pet did not know how to go up stairs when the stairs were perhaps seven feet away from him. It's a small irritant, of course, since I could simply spend the 5 seconds moving around to manipulate his pathing algorithm.Replayability. Once you beat the game with any class, a new ""Shadow Dungeon"" opens up. I fully admit that I will not be playing the game again (I have far too many other things to get to!) but that along with being able to ""retire"" a character to pass along a heirloom makes it seem as though the replayability is solid. And again, there's a pretty decent mod community.			"

												A classic. A dirt cheap, balls to the wall, throwback of the century.The debut game for the latest label that a collective of Ex-Diablo devs operate under, since they left Blizzard that is, Torchlight is the definitive herald for a new era of ARPG's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what level of influence THIS, not Diablo, had on newer releases like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, and obviously its sequel, Torchlight II, which I recommend starting at unless you really care about that previous point.So yea, grab it, it's on sale for nothing all the time. It's also on GOG, often for less than here, and those copies are DRM free (can save the installer and give to friends freely, like a music CD.) "

												It's like they took Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 and slammed them together for a *damned fun* adventure in the same style; when I mean they slammed them together, I mean the same people who created them made this. Rares, Uniques, Set Pieces, Town Portal Scrolls, IT'S ALL HERE. The game features the town of Torchlight, not too different from Tristram that has a massive dungeon underneath it; instead of the church, we have mines, but the end result is the same: evil corruption.You can play as a Destroyer, Vanquisher, or Alchemist. Each class has 3 skill trees they can go into, and each tree changes how the game is played. The Destroyer can be a Melee Warrior, Ranged, or Spell Caster, likewise the Vanquisher and Alchemist can choose as well: If you've ever played a Summoning Necro from Diablo 2, the  Alchemist can assume that role as well, imps instead of skeletons and a Beam Golem that shoots enemies.After you beat the game and kill it's final boss, a new, infinite dunegon will open.

The graphics are sharp, control is solid, and levels contain just enough environmental variety to keep things moving as the story progresses.If you're looking for a cheap alternative to Diablo, Torchlight is definitely a great place to start.

												An action RPG that resembles Blizzard's Diablo series in more ways than one and doesn't quite reach the same level. It's not far behind though and it's still a very great game. One of my favorite games at the moment.I'm more than a little annoyed that Runic Games have not made it available for Linux on Steam when they clearly have a flawlessly working Linux port. It may however be bought for Linux through the Ubuntu Software Center.			"

												It's like they took Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 and slammed them together for a *damned fun* adventure in the same style; when I mean they slammed them together, I mean the same people who created them made this. Rares, Uniques, Set Pieces, Town Portal Scrolls, IT'S ALL HERE. The game features the town of Torchlight, not too different from Tristram that has a massive dungeon underneath it; instead of the church, we have mines, but the end result is the same: evil corruption.You can play as a Destroyer, Vanquisher, or Alchemist. Each class has 3 skill trees they can go into, and each tree changes how the game is played. The Destroyer can be a Melee Warrior, Ranged, or Spell Caster, likewise the Vanquisher and Alchemist can choose as well: If you've ever played a Summoning Necro from Diablo 2, the  Alchemist can assume that role as well, imps instead of skeletons and a Beam Golem that shoots enemies.After you beat the game and kill it's final boss, a new, infinite dunegon will open.

												After many hours I can say it: I'm addicted. Play it and play it now. It's Diablo 1 in the year 2000. One dungeon, several levels, lots of loot, with satisfying side quests. Torchlight 2 is a superior game but don't overlook this little gem =)			"

Co-op would have been an excellent addition, but this game will tide you over until the sequel (or Diablo III) comes out.			"

Fun for vegging-out on.  The editors for both this one and it's sequel are fun to mess around in as well.  The sequel has a lot more depht, but it's worth at least $8.00.

												If you are like me, who don't have a good PC to play Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, or if you are a big fan of this genre and wanna know all the good ones out there, then it's still safe to buy this game.Really good game. Comparing to Diablo 2, it has a lot of improvements, but doesn't have such an immersive story.			"

												It's a good game, if your'e into the genre, but if you're not, it gets repettitive and boring fairly soon.The levels are a lot of the same, and it only gets hard when facing hordes, but for most of the game, I felt overpowered.It's still somewhat fun though.			"

												I wasn't really one for hack n' slash games until I played Torchlight. Only reason I got this in the first place was because my step-dad played a bunch of it, and I was pretty reluctant, but something about this is insanely addictive. I haven't spent a lot of time on the second version, so I can't compare, but God, this is good. Doesn't seem to get boring.			"

												Torchlight is a well done action RPG dungeon crawler. Not original by any means, but its simplified interface makes it very user friendly and easy to pick up. Three different character choices plus you get a pet. There's plenty of random loot which is ultimately why we put so many hours into these type of games. At the end of the day though, it does end up feeling a little empty having to play alone.			"

												Torchlight - a hack n' slash RPG comparable to Diablo II. I suggest this game on Hard if you want challenge (Normal is pretty easy). You have a choise of a warrior, rogue, or mage class and while there is no visual customization beyond gear, you can mix and match skills or specialize skill trees without fear of having a skill requirement for any skill TL gets somethings right: pets can carry the same amount of items you can, and can be sent to town to sell them, a shift-click will transfer your items to and from inventories and merchants. pets can retreive loot. Though you can't change the keybindings (except mapping skills to 1-0 and F Keys), some parts ore either too easy or too hard, and quest loot if often junk. If you're into this kind of game, you'll get plenty of replay value for $14.99. 7/10 Score			"

												Not an alternative to Diablo or Path of Exile, if that is indeed what you are looking for. It is a much smaller game in scope and size, with a unique approach towards the genre. The combat is highly satisfying, the progression is intuitive, and the art style is pleasing to look at. You can easily switch your playstyle or try a different class if it becomes repetitive. The level design is somewhat random and not particularly great, but it never feels broken or out of place. The rest of the game is solid with not much to complain about. I never felt bored playing it, but I also never felt too engaged. I often found myself playing other games over Torchlight, or just forgetting about the game entirely. So in that sense it's not particularly memorable, but whenever I rediscover the game I end up enjoying it just as much as the last time I played it.			"

												*cough* Diablo *cough *TItan Quest *cough* Now that I have your attention, I don't really think I have to say anything else. The two games mentioned at the beginning of this mini review tell you exactly what you want to know. Yes, it's an action RPG (all the mouse clicking is probably going to hurt your fingers). And yes, there's random loot. I hear you think; does this game show us anything new then ? Well... yes. You now have a pet that's with you 24/7. Your pet can kill, keep items and even sell your items. The dungeons are randomly created, meaning a level won't ever be the same and their are enough vendors in town (enchanters, weapons, random maps, you name it) to keep you busy for a long, long time. And the graphics are superb, love the style ! Also, they could've set the difficulty a bit higher, because most of the times there isn't much of a challenge. But I'm sure they'll fix that in Torchlight II. Now... what are you still doing here ? Go play it ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												I never cared for Diablo, so it's a bit puzzling that I put so much time into Torchlight, a derivative made in part by makers of Diablo & D2. Most tout D2 over Torchlight due to its multiplayer/larger class variety, but Torchlight's interface addresses my problems with the genre.The main problem with ARPGs (esp. Blizzard's) is ""tedium"" & ""excessive mouse clicking."" Torchlight takes real measures to reduce both. You can hotkey commands to ALL keyboard numerals. You get an invincible pet that not only doubles your inventory, auto-attacks enemies, and can pick up items for you, but can be told ""go back to town and sell your items to free up space."" THIS IS HUGE. You're also CONSTANTLY getting new gear, which makes Normal mode a breeze. Alas, you still left-click to both move AND attack.As far as aesthetics, I prefer that in this game, you can dual-wield GUNS and effectively set up machinegun sentry turrets. Hits have impact. Enemies can be pretty massive. One's even a chaingun mecha!			"

												Bwee. So this is one of those dungeon-crawler games where you click an insane amount of times. Indeed, you move and attack with the same button. Now it's been a while since I played this, so I might be wrong about that, but I am pretty sure I am not. I've got a pretty good memory for things that annoy me. Another such thing was having -all- of my save data for this game lost on a crash shortly after beating the final boss, ensuring that I wouldn't touch it again.So why review this? Because reasons. I guess it's a good diablo-esque dungeon game. I wouldn't know. Ask people who actually like those sorts of games, because I'm not one of them. I'll give this a ""yes"" anyway because it's good at what it's supposed to do, even if it is stuff that I have little taste for.			"

The amount of content and fun you're getting for the price you payed is just amazing in both cases. Definitely recommend both T1 and T2!

												A suitable ARPG to pass the time until Diablo III shows up, but there are a ton of glaring issues with Torchlight that prevent me from recommending it fully. For starters, the overall difficulty level is arbitrary, veering from too easy to extremely difficult in a matter of moments. Some monsters are impossible to kill without spamming unique abilities or spells, and oftentimes combat reverts to simply holding down a spell hotkey until spawning monsters are completely wiped out. The end boss is a supremely horrible example of game design, and the targeting system is far too finnicky to be of any accuracy - you have to click on the same tiny spot in order to target any opponent or else you'll miss completely. In addition, there are several game-breaking issues that can bring play to a halt and ruin a finely-tuned character forever.Not a bad game by any means, just poorly designed and executed by the developers. Hopefully Torchlight 2 makes up for all of this.			"

												I cannot in good faith recommend this to any fantasy or dungeon-crawler junkies.Yes, I know, it was made by former Blizzard (Diablo, WoW) Employees, and they set out to make a better game.They failed.-You cannot reliably fight on stairs, you always miss with spells.-Dungeons and Loot are randomized, making tracking down armor sets a complete chore.-Killing wave after wave of enemies gets VERY boring after about 10 floors of monotony.-The set-up ideas and setting are interesting, but so watered down you don't care in the end.-Main male npc dies in battle at the start.-Main female npc does NOTHING for the entire game, despite being a ""seasoned veteran hero"".-""Evil Wizard that wants immortality being whispered to by a dark deity/spirit/monster"" cliche.-On the 30th floor SUDDENLY enemies show up that can challenge you, blast away 2/3 to 4/5 of your HP in one hit, shifting the difficulty of the game drastically, regardless of what difficulty you're on.This game brings nothing new to the table, and the makers literally admitted they were making a Diablo 2 clone, but ""better"". You guys better shut your sacreligious mouths.((P.S. You can't leave Torchlight (the town) because some jackass parked a supply cart ON the bridge out of town. wth...))			"

												Extremely mediocre. I don't understand the hype behind this... how did it receive so many awards? It's basically Diablo 1's gameplay (including character customization/growth) with WC3/WoW graphics. Very derivative and only worth playing if you can get it on sale. Oh yeah, and no multiplayer. If you're looking for a Diablo clone please try Titan Quest or Sacred (original not crappy sequel) instead.			"

												Like diablo yet more stylized and cartoony. It's a bit more repetitive than diablo but the visuals really make up for it IMO. 3 different characters, tons of flashy skills for them all. Great fun if you're into dungeon crawlers. This game is usually pretty cheap as well, so it's definitely worth a buy.			"

												Some of the former Diablo 1 & 2 dev's who are now w/ Runic Games worked on this game, so expect more of the same - except MUCH more modernized in many ways (graphics, interface, etc). While the story is nothing spectacular (like many game in this ARPG genre) and the voice-acting is decent enough, you are really here for the addictive nature of the awesome combat, constant upgrading of your character & the crazy amount of loot. TL is very similar to Diablo 1 in style, as you'll keep going down & down deeper into the dungeons to battle forces trying to corrupt & ruin the town. TL sports a steampunk setting & is much more colorful than Diablo. One cool thing about TL is you can have a pet join you in combat...and have it run back to town & sell items back to town so you can stay in the action! This game is Single Player only, BTW. Torchlight is a great ARPG & very easy to reccommend to those who love ARPG's with constant action, character upgrading & tons of loot.Grade = B+			"

												While the story is different, the gameplay and game mechanics seem, to me at least, to be almost IDENTICAL to the old Diablo II game that Blizzard released over a decade ago.  I mean, everything from how you move and attack (left mouse to attack, shift+left  mouse to stationary attack), to the hack-n-slash style of the game's quests, to the scrolls of Town Portal, to socketed weapons and armor, to a three-pronged, Mana-powered skill tree, to the...well, you get the idea: it plays a lot like the old Diablo II game.  So, I guess one could argue that it's a Diablo II rip-off (and they may be right), but it's an extremely well made, easy to learn, fun to play game so it's hard to judge Torchlight too harshly.  I loved Diablo II and despite (or maybe because of?) the similarities, I'm having a ball with this game so far.  It's totally worth buying (especially on sale).  Yes, the story is pretty simplistic, but if you want a fun, doesn't-take-itself-too-seriously, hack-n-slash adventure game, then this is your ticket!  :)  Plus, the cartoony graphics sort of add to the charm of the game.

												*click*click*click*That's what you're going to be doing ALOT of in Torchlight.The game is an old school hack-and-slash RPG in the same vein as the Diablo series and all the clones that have spawned from that. Players who enjoy those kinds of games and/or are loot and stat junkies will absolutely adore Torchlight however everyone else will probably run out of steam once the main ""story"" is completed. There's tons of loot ranging from common stuff to rare items and sets of items to track down, you have three character types to choose from (the basic three: warrior, rogue, and wizard who each have three skill trees), you've got a pet that will carry loot and even transform into different things when you feed it fish, the different sections of the dungeon are artistically well done, and the range of enemies is definitely substantial.  Other than being a solid dungeon crawler though there's not much else to attract those who aren't quite fans of that genre. The story is paper thin, theres absolutely no characterization in regards to your own avatar or the very few NPCs, the sidequests are uninspired (get this, kill that, go to a different dungeon and get this) and the whole thing just feels like a time sink - one that will definitely appeal to some but will leave others bored and ready to move on to something else after a couple of hours.The best way to really describe Torchlight: you're going to love it or hate it. Unfortunately I tend to put a good deal of emphasis on narrative, the game world, etc and this game just straight up doesn't have that.			"

Dispite your heart conditions (i.e. black-hearted, heartlessness, icey heart, stoneheart, dragonheart, being named Ma-Ti, etc...), you've devepoled attachedments to a your current set of armor and weapons, despite being statistically unwise.

												Probably one of the best RPG games I've played. Much like Diablo, Torchlight brings forth a similar dungeon crawler play style with a third-person point and click system. However,unlike Diablo, the in-game system is much different. Take the fighting system for example, Diablo has a very straight forward story line. This requires the player to follow everything that is expected of them. In Torchlight, there are quests that can alter the path of the rest of the game. Character customization is huge in these types of games. Diablo forces you to choose from a few lousy skills, whereas in Torchlight, there is an abundance of spells and skills to choose from. I can probably rant for another few hundred words comparing the two games, but I don't want to denounce Diablo too much because I also play the Diablo series (or used to anyways). Although it says that I have 0 hours played on this account, I did play an insane amount of this game... Trust me, I'm a professional.			"

												Tight, clean and well made, it's a good game at first, with lots of action and nice details, but soon gets more repetitive than ""A-Team"" episodes. Nice for a pair of runs if you can get it cheap -or free. But use melee weapons, ranged characters are boring and useless, because field view is small and enemies are at♥♥♥♥♥♥♥range in less than a second.			"

												To put it simple the game is a traditional Diablo clone, but a real fun one, not to mention it has an official editor which allows to create awesome mods - starting with some new unique weapon additions ending with total conversions. The gameplay... well, you pretty much just smash and inicerate all the foes on your way, collect new equipment (Most of which you sell - most of stuff you find is not worth equiping) and level your character, unlocking new abilities. These are real fun and different for all three classes. You also get a dog (Or cat, or something weirder if you get a specific mod)  which can be sent to town to sell all the junk you don't need - works great for a speedrun. All the levels are randomly generated (That's what makes any Hack'n'Slash game so unrepeatable and fun) and all the locations look great. Only issue is that weapons and abilities are bit unbalanced - dual wield is best, 2-hands suck. Graphics are simple but neat and remind me of Warcraft 3.			"

												I really liked this game until it basically repeated the entire process; what you think is the main baddie just turns out to be the first big one... and then you literally ""start over,"" making it repetitive and entirely too long. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's really cheap.			"

												To be honest, I originally wanted this game to fill the void of Diablo, and it did that, somewhat, but I just can't process some of the absurdly streamlined mechanics, or the way that a single drop can leave you overpowered for the majority of the game.... So much so that fighting enemies is a lot less satisfying than it should be and making huge swaths of the game really boring click fests. Not super great imo.			"

Torchlight adds nothing new to an already stale genre.Pros: Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Story, GameplayTorchlight hits all the basics very well.  The graphics are varied and colorful, the sound and music are fitting and sharp, and the controls are simple and effective.Torchlight's story and gameplay, however, fall short.  Our hero will massacre thousands of creatures in order to save a couple of humans the trouble of moving.  The gameplay only matches the story's blandness.  Combat consists of clicking things, although this is par for the genre.  The leveling system offers too few new abilities or mechanics but instead too many stat dump options.  The loot system is largely irrelevant: equip anything with more stats, sell the rest.  The enemy variety means little after facing hundreds of the same things.Unfortunately, Torchlight never manages to shine with its nearly nonexistent story and boring gameplay.6/10			"

												So I've played Diablo 3 a ton and wanted to check out Torchlight since all the D3 haters say this is the real Diablo. Wait, hold on... why is game even more colorful than D3, I thought it would be all dark and scary like Diablo. Also where's my god damned guided arrow, I'm an Amazon for christ's sake. Er, I mean... a Vanquisher. Oh well I guess this ricochet shot will do, and let's not forget to max the passive critical buff, criticals are awesome. Let's continue deeper down.Sigh. The bottom rows of my inventory is literally filled with potions, Identify and Town Portal scrolls and managing all of it is making me crazy. Like stacks of 20? Seriously? I know Diablo had it as well but that was not why I loved that game. Anyway, I ain't picking up more of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'll just buy it from the vendor. If only my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat could teleport me back to town... I did teach him a friggin Town Portal spell after all. I mean what else is he supposed to do, he'll start fleeing immediately when engaged in combat.Um... why am I finding guns? This is not Dungeon Siege. Diablo had no guns. Oh great, now that I'm not picking up useless items anymore, I can't even see when I get rare or unique items because they're all hidden behind white trash and you need to be a surgical tech to pick them up. Honestly I can't even pick up what I want without picking up trash in the process so I'm just going to spam the click button.Yay, final boss time. I kinda rushed through the later game and I'm fighting him at level 25. Luckily I just got my raining arrow skill so I can kite him for 20 minutes while dying now and then, not that it matters cause I can be revived on spot. Okay dead. What the... the floor is getting flooded with hundreds of dragon corpses. This is weird. I guess it makes up for every annoying experience I've had with this game. Until next time.			"

												Torchlight is _______(randomly generated word here)  that tries to ________ extend it's total gameplay time by __________ . My experience with it was lots of grinding, spamming the same one useful special ability over and over. Because of it's randomization of equipment, and linear RPG nature the game gets less fun and more tedious the higher level you get.  Your super awesome equipment? Yeah, it's pretty much worthless when even against a common spider when your at a high level. The enemies stats all scale up, but yours rely on whatever crap you can find, so each encounter takes longer and longer just to kill simple enemies. If you expect story from this RPG you get what, like 10 paragraphs of dialogue throughout the main plot line. It starts of with a little intro whenever your about to enter a new series of levels that use a diffent palette.It's not challenging from either an action, adventure or strategy perspective, it's just large amount of grinding away.

												I believe the best description of Torchlight would be Diablo II for kids. I say this because many of the features, from the automap and music to the item sounds and classifications, are all evidence of the developers' previous works, which indeed includes Diablo II. I see this game as a kind of introduction to the type of game it is, whereas Diablo II is its apex. Despite my ""for kids"" label, this game is nevertheless fun and definitely worth playing. Coming from someone who has played Diablo II for years, this game constantly reminds me of its predecessor. If you like to play a Diablo II-like game, but without the dark, horror backdrop, this is a great game with which to begin your adventure.			"

												My opinion; better than Diablo 3. I liked Torchlight 1 a *little* more than this one, mainly due to a bit more freedom in customization. This game is a good grinding game, if you just want to zone out and use 4-5 buttons the whole time, this is it. Customization could definitely use some liberating, though.			"

												Too shallow. After playing games like Titan Quest and Diablo 2, I found this game did not improve on either nor did it offer me anything new or fresh. It was pretty generic and slow-paced.I believe the sequel is quite a bit better. Kudos to the developers for trying their hand at the genre. Outside of Diablo, it's incredibly niche and tough to get a slice of that pie. This series is generally held in fairly high regard but it's not for me.			"

												Torchlight torchlight torchlight. I remember when this game first came out. Remember too? The graphics were just plain ugly even back then.Torchlight's history in short is that most of the Dev team worked on Diablo 1, 2 and every expansion in between. And that is exactly what makes Torchlight a complete failure.From the very first second I played it, I didn't like anything. The style, the visuals, the setting.... It feels rushed and unfinished. Normally I do a Pro v Con list but there are no Pros here, so here are just the worst things about Torchlight.- Linear Gameplay: I can't stress this enough, It may very well be the only thing that's absolutely wrong with this game but it's a big one. Ever played a 2D platformer, like Mario? Well that's just about as linear as you can get. Just go from start to finish, no deviation in between. To have something like that in a 3D game is... is...what? Why? But that's what Torchlight is, constantly. You go down and then you follow the path, follow it, kill every enemy you see and keep following the path.- Music: Well the town music is very similar if not the same as in Diablo 1 and 2. Because they hired the same guy to make the soundtrack. It shows, it isn't good. They probably thought that it'd be nice to have music that sounds the same as a far superior game. But by doing so, they hit the same note when an awful movie refers to a better movie during the movie.- Classes: Three character classes...? This is an RPG right? What kind of RPG only has 3 classes? Maybe Torchlight isn't the only one, but it should be. There really isn't an excuse for that, most RPGs already have the same classes over and over. But Torchlight takes the most generic 3 classes too, Melee Ranged and Wizard/SummonerNone of which are any fun while running towards the next level down.- Graphics: I'm not a graphic freak, I honestly don't care about them, choppy framerate? I'm probably the last person to notice, but these GFX?! No! Just no, why is everything squareish? Was the Dev team all like ""We need something round but a dodecahedron is easier to draw."" I don't think so, don't like itFinal verdict, Torchlight is nothing more than a Diablo clone. But I've played several clones in my day, this is by far the worst one. Torchlight feels like an empty vessel, like a game without a soul. It has no identity other than the one it tries to be. I heard that the sequel is far better.			"

It's pretty easy, basic hack and slash, but you only go in one dungeon the whole game.

												If you are fiending for Diablo III and you havent given this game a try, do yourself a favor and preorder Torch II and get the free copy of Torch I.  If you like Diablo  and Diablo II and don't mind there being no multiplayer, you will love this game.			"

PROS+ Moments when the game feels like a great ARPG.+ Lots of loot.+ Some great ideas, especially with the pets...CONS- ...which turn tedious after a while.- Feels unbalanced at times.- Somewhat repetitive levels.- Fairly meaningless equipment customization.- A somewhat uninteresting story.- Utterly boring boss fights.- An unsatisfying ending.While the game does have its moments, the overall experience isn't something that I'd really recommend to anyone but the most hardcore of ARPG fans that are dying for something to play.

												I am in no way a professional critic. But I had a very bad experience with this game and I do not think I am the only one with these problems:At first, the game would not load, I had to fiddle around with the options and such to get it to work. This took me two days to do.After that, I thought I was golden, there were not lag (big ones at least, my computer is not the fastest) no crashes, it worked well! Than, as I was going down some stairs, a sign poped up and read: ""Thank you for playing the demo of Torchlight! If you wish to continue, download/buy the full game online..."" I did not pay 16.99$ for a demo. I tried it again, and again and again. Same message, and after I clicked out of the message I was sent back to the start screen.This was discouraging and so I deleted the game. For some people, it might work, some it might not. I am more dissapointed than angry, as I can't be the only one who had this problem, and ended up with a demo instead of the actual game when I bought it. If you want to take the risk, go ahead, there are a lot of people who it worked just fine for, so I may just be unluckey, but as much as I enjoyed what I was able to play, I am not going to redownload it.

												I originally picked up Torchlight after being disappointed with Diablo 3. I must say, it's refreshing to have a game that rewards you for playing it. But only to a point, it seems. There's a lot to like here, but obviously it is a few years old now - it is still a fun dungeon romp to introduce you to the Torchlight universe.That said, the game gets fairly repetitive, fairly quickly. If you've played 20 levels of the game, you've played 100. That can be fine if the game kept mixing things up somehow - but theres not enough here to hold your interest.That combined with that it's a single player only experience? Don't bother. Torchlight stands as good game, but a game that is showing it's age. Pick up Torchlight 2 instead. I can't recommend Torchlight.			"

												Buy Torchlight 2, it gets rid of every single stupid thing the first one has and improves the gameplay to be a lot of fun!There is only one reason I do not advise you to purchase this game, and it is that when you seek to upgrade an item you like, you have a very high chance of clearing that item of all stats. It will say a 4 or 6% chance, but that is complete crap. When it says 4 or 6% its really like a 25 or 50% chance that your best item will become worthless. This may seem like a silly thing to give a bad review about, but getting new equipment and experimenting with the gameplay is half of the fun in a game that is not very hard.  In addition, if you want to fix your favorite item to be like it was by using a cheat, the game locks you from all of your other characters and literally lables you a cheat.Other than that the game is okay.

												Torchlight is a 3d hack-and-slash modeled after games in the Diablo series. If you’re not familiar with that, it’s basically a lot of left clicking, dungeon roaming, and loads of looting. It’s hard to talk about this game without referencing Diablo, as even the music seems like it was pulled straight from that game and the visuals are reminiscent of the third game with their vibrant colors and auras.Torchlight adds to the familiar mechanic by giving you a pet that acts as both a defender and pack mule, able to be sent back to town to sell all your loot at a moment’s notice leaving you to continue looting and pillaging. There’s also a fame system that acts as a second “experience” meter and gives you a skill point for every level you gain in addition to skill points given by actual experience levels. Unfortunately, this game lacks a sense of excitement regarding gear. Frequently on my play-through I would see unique and set items drop, giving me a momentary rush that was quickly extinguished upon identification. It’s sad to say that I ended up simply buying and enchanting the majority of my gear in town, meaning the dungeon crawl was more of a means of gathering gold and experience to fuel my character development topside. It was about 20 or so hours before I finally got my first decent weapon drop…from the game’s final boss. The only use for it then was to do the infinite dungeons the game offers afterwards. Since Torchlight has no multiplayer, there was nobody to show the cool weapon to either. Some other grievances: the storyline isn’t particularly engaging and the bosses are barely memorable save for the one that caused tremors and the big bad at the end. The game also has an issue with the Z-axis and projectiles in many levels, making your attacks hit stairways and ramps inconsistently, even when you directly target an enemy (this is incredibly annoying). Lack of multiplayer was a serious oversight IMO as the thing I remember the most with the very first Diablo game was hundreds of hours spent playing alongside friends and randoms online. Torchlight isn’t a terrible game, but it’s not really good enough for me to recommend when there are so many other games around that do the same thing way better. "

												Torchlight: a dull glowI played Torchlight way back when it first came out, circa 2009. I enjoyed it, but there were some things that just nagged at me while I played it. Unfortunately, the more I played it, the less I liked it. Going further and further into the game did not increase my enjoyment. And I ultimately stopped playing.Sadly that perfectly describes my most recent experience with Torchlight.I’ve tried to figure out just what it is that I don’t like, but every time I formulate my thoughts I come up with the same conclusion:The game feels hollow and generic.It doesn’t seem to have it’s own identity or stand out as unique from other games in the ARPG genre. Hell, Torchlight is essentially an “HD remake” of Diablo from 1996… without the “Hell.” The game follows the same basic progression and is, in many ways the same game, but with less of an edge.I feel that really hurts Torchlight.Plenty of games can be fun without a cool in-game world or a “gritty” story hook to pull you in. It’s gameplay that matters in the end, right? Sadly I think that Torchlight also falls flat here as well.Torchlight is pretty a pretty shallow game, to its detriment. Killing monsters is fun in its own right, but only for so long. Other ARPGs alleviate this by giving you things to work for: new more powerful items, more powerful skills, harder challenges, etc. Torchlight does have all of these things… they’re just not interesting. So although the game does have the “carrot on a stick” incentive to continue playing… I’m, sadly, not interested in the carrot.I found the gameplay to be rather lackluster and boring. Torchlight’s art style does not appeal to me. The environments lacked feeling, and ultimately felt sterile. The items in the game were shallow, and only the “unique” items had any flavor. The various character skills weren’t very impressive, and didn’t feel very powerful.But let’s break down the individual pieces of Torchlight and critique it against the five points I mentioned previously.Atmosphere and StoryAtmospherethe pervading tone or mood of a place, situation, or work of art.Torchlight has little to no atmosphere. Certain areas in the game look pretty darn cool, but carry absolutely no feeling.My favorite areas are a necropolis found underneath the mines beneath Torchlight (Yes, that’s the name of the town) and the underground jungle-temple ruins beneath the necropolis. Why I like these two areas over all the others? Probably because they have the most ‘flavor’. But even then it’s spread pretty thin.There isn’t much to be said about the game’s various locales other than that they don’t make much sense and require a bit too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.Storyan account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.I consider story to be tied very closely with atmosphere, and like Torchlight’s atmosphere, there isn’t really much to be said about the story. It’s pretty generic and could be summarized in two sentences: “Torchlight was built over a corrupted source of magic caused by an ancient evil deep within the Earth. Go kill it.”More accurately: The town of Torchlight is mining a substance called Ember, which allows for the various forms of magic in the world, but it turns out the Ember under Torchlight is corrupt and will turn anyone who comes into contact with it evil! This is because the Ember Vein runs over an ancient evil, later revealed to be a dragon. You are called to Torchlight to help the mining operation, which is being attacked by monsters, but are promptly betrayed by the man who summoned you. As it turns out he wants to revive the dragon sleeping beneath Torchlight. And you, the hero, have to stop him by traveling deeper and deeper into the Earth uncovering older and older civilizations that fell to the corrupting allure of the Ember.Pretty good ideas! Not going to lie, there’s definitely a cool story in there. But it’s really only used as an occasional spur to remind you to continue murdering monsters as you travel what seems like miles into the earth. A shame, really.There is very little involvement in the story, and to be honest the voice acting is pretty hammy. If you like that sort of thing, then good on ya! I had to skip most of it.But hey, atleast you can skip it! Actually all of it! Which is nice.Enemiesthe persons who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.Unfortunately, the enemies in torchlight are boring. There isn’t any way around it. I don’t like their designs, and none of them really seem to have any interesting mechanics to differentiate them. They’re all just bigger and bigger punching bags. Some will revive their comrades, and some will leave noxious fumes after death. But by and large, the majority of them are meat sacks that fling their bodies against your weapons.It doesn’t help that the enemies have massive spikes in difficulty towards the end of the game. There is a LARGE increase in enemy health and damage in the last area. And every time I’ve played, it has come as a shock.I’ll be doing just fine, then I’ll walk into the last section of the game and be murdered. Only to find that I’m unable to deal significant damage to the enemies. Their scaling seems to be off, and it’s just not fun.Your Characterthe representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.Torchlight utilizes the typical stat system. Your RPG standards are all present: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Life, and Defense. Every time you level, the game gives you five points to allocate to each of these different parameters. Unfortunately it seems like the various stat points are really just a way of directing your progression. It didn’t seem as though loading a bunch of points into Magic made my Alchemist’s magic any more powerful, despite it being his main damage stat. It seemed as though it was just a holdover from previous games. “Diablo had them, so Torchlight will too.”Really the stats just felt like numbers I had to inflate in order to put on different armor. My character’s power seemed to be located in the weapons and armor he was wearing rather than the character himself.Skillsskill or expertise in a particular activity or fieldTorchlight also follows a rather traditional skill tree format, present in almost every ARPG. Ever.That’s perfectly fine. Skill trees are used so commonly because they work. Sadly, the skills in Torchlight are boring. Plain and simple. The coolest spells I got for my Alchemist were Chain Lightning and a laser. Everything else rather boring.I think that is was a major contributing factor to why Torchlight felt boring to me. The three different classes all had pretty boring skills. Nothing really stands out, and everything felt pretty lame.Itemizationthe balance and distribution of items, their types, and the various effects, powers, and statistics attached to themLast but not least, the items. Again, there isn’t a lot to say. Torchlight’s items were rather lacking. Most items are of the, “+10 fire damage,” “+20 lightning damage,” “+5% attack speed” variety. Nothing to write home about.This is probably the one aspect of the game where Torchlight tried its hardest to please me.I received about 7 unique items before reaching level 15. Unique items are Torchlight’s highest rarity item, apparently. They were all decent, and some of the unique wands I found had cool effects that altered combat, like shots bouncing and releasing arcs of electricity on the ground. But they were little more than more powerful versions of the base items. Not particularly exciting.Boring skills, boring monsters, boring items, boring combat.Very sad indeed.			"

												This game is about 10 hours too long. It was fairly entertaining at first, but constantly having to clear out my inventory soon became a tedious chore. The story and setting didn't do a good job of drawing me in - it felt like they weren't even trying. I was never really challenged to change up my play style - I basically got through the game spamming the same couple of attacks over and over, and had no major problems. The last boss took forever, and you'd think they'd at least throw in a decent ending after that, but no, just a quick ""thank you"" and you're unceremoniously dumped back into the world.I suppose overall it's fairly well made for what it is, so maybe I just don't like the genre, but for all the time it took, I never found it particularly rewarding, so I can't really recommend it.

												I'm giving this a thumbs down just because torchlight 2 is a far superior game. Don't waste your time with the first one.It's standard dungeon crawler fare but it's too simple, the class talent choices aren't meaningful enough, the loot is too generic and in general it's insanely easy. It's not bad but it's kind of bland. Torchlight 2 has way better classes, levels and loot. I admit I liked it when I played it at first but got bored and tried the sequel and now I realize how poor it is. It's kind of like eating at mcdonald's all your life thinking it's fine until someone introduces you to five guys.			"

												The Torchlight series is a kid-friendly version of Blizzard's Diablo series. However, I would not recommend this for Diablo fans. If you've already played the Diablo games, the Torchlight games present nothing new except make it more cartoony and accessible for younger players. If you want to play Torchlight, I would recommend skipping this game and just get Torchlight 2. Torchlight 2 has way more content and multiplayer. I found this game quite boring as a Diablo player.

												In Torchlight, you are drawn to a town, also called Torchlight, where a magical ore called Ember is mined. As you move down through the dungeon, you learn that Ember has a corrupting effect on any who use it, and has led to the downfall of a number of civilizations before yours. It's not the deepest story in the history of RPGs, but it is clear that the developers put real effort into it. The writing is miles better than that of many other hack & slash games I've played as well. The same can't really be said of the sidequests, which follow the exact pattern from Fate: your task is always to kill a specific boss and/or retrieve a specific piece of loot, with little real reason given. I don't think of this as a significant problem, though. Instead, I think it's pretty standard for action games.Torchlight may only be above average in the story department, but its gameplay is outstanding. It takes good ideas from the developers' previous games and improves on them in just about every way possible. There are three character classes (essentially, a barbarian, a ranged character, and a magician), each of which plays very differently from the others, and each of which can be viably developed in several ways as you level up. For example, my first character was a magician who focused almost entirely on summoning, similar to Diablo II's Necromancer. I could have put my points into casting spells, though, and been more similar to the Sorceress.Each class has three skill trees, although certain skills like ""ranged weapons mastery"" show up in the trees of all classes. I appreciated that, since I wanted my summoner to dual-wield pistols – something he's not necessarily good at by default. In addition, there are magic scrolls, found as loot or purchased, that allow you to teach certain skills to any character. I loved having that ability, because it allowed my barbarian to cast town portal spells and identify magical items; skills that many RPGs restrict to the magician class.In Torchlight, your character is constantly accompanied by a pet dog or cat. You can catch fish and feed them to your pet to change them (temporarily or permanently) into another animal/monster, and I was overjoyed to see that Torchlight doesn't make you waste inventory space on a fishing pole to do so. Your pet levels up along with you, and it can wear two rings and a necklace, which is nice. The pet also has an inventory, can be directed to pick things up, and can be sent back to town at any point to sell loot. Doing so really helps keep the game flowing because like any good hack & slash game, you'll pick up a lot of loot, and going back to town to sell it is annoying.Your pet doesn't just serve as a pack mule, though, or even as simply a meat shield. You can also teach it any of the spells learned from scrolls. It can only learn two spells, but the pet AI makes good use of whatever you give it. I liked my cat to be able to summon zombies and leech health from attacks, but a dog who can throw fireballs and heal the whole party sounds pretty awesome too.The main story takes you down through one long dungeon to a final boss battle, but once you've beaten it, a second, never-ending, randomly generated dungeon is unlocked where the monsters scale to your current level, so you can keep playing with the same character as long as you want. In addition, maps can be purchased from vendors that take you to shorter randomly generated dungeons. These serve as a nice break from the main storyline or even a place to grind for levels and loot if you ever find yourself in need of doing so. Interestingly, there are also random monsters called ""phase beasts"" that open a portal to a one-level dungeon when killed. Again, the only reason to go to these dungeons is to get loot and experience, but they seem to give good loot, so they are worth the time.There are a hundred other things I could talk about in terms of gameplay, but I won't. Instead, I'll limit myself to four brief things I can't leave out of my review. One: you can install gems in your equipable items, and when you're ready to upgrade something, you can destroy the gems and keep the item or vice versa. I would have loved this in Diablo II, where I agonized over actually using all of those runes I collected. Two: each character has their own inventory, their pet's inventory, a private stash in town, and a stash that they share with all of your other characters. If you love to hoard items, this is a dream come true, because it makes passing items between characters and creating ""mule"" characters a breeze. Three: Torchlight is designed to make modding easy. It's reportedly a piece of cake to create mods, and I can confirm that it takes almost zero effort to install them. There are a lot of mods out there, and they range from the classic ""I'm lazy, so I'll break the game's balance"" to simple, but really nice, things like changing the opacity of the mini-map. I even installed a mod that unlocks a ferret as a third pet option. Four: when you look at weapons in your inventory, you're shown their attack speed and the damage they do, but you're also shown their DPS (damage per second), which is a huge help when deciding whether to trade up to a new weapon.There is one thing missing in Torchlight's gameplay, though: multiplayer. I rarely play games online, so I didn't miss it, but I know that this may be a deal-breaker for some gamers. It stands up very well as a single-player experience, though, so if you're interested in this kind of game, I'd urge you to give it a shot despite that lack.Graphically, Torchlight made me very happy as well. It's not that this is the prettiest game you'll ever see, because it's no Crysis. It's that it looks great on even a lousy setup like mine. There's even a ""netbook"" mode to allow machines even weaker than mine to play.The game really does look good. Spell effects are plentiful, and weapons that do elemental damage throw the appropriate sparks, flames, or snow. The environments are rendered in full 3D, and use the classic overhead isometric camera. Like any game with that camera, it has to deal with the issue of environmental elements getting in the way, and Torchlight's solution is to render a sort of x-ray version of the character. Friends are blue, enemies are red, which really helps. Stylistically, it falls halfway between Fate and Diablo II.This game sounds great, both in terms of music and sound effects. Certain sounds are almost identical to their Diablo II counterparts, but that is so common in this type of game that I find it hard to criticize. My only true complaint is that when your pet gets injured, they whine, which can be annoying if they're surrounded by a huge pack of enemies.Torchlight controls very simply, but in a good way. You click on the ground to move or on enemies to attack them, and I like the fact that it's fairly forgiving. If you are pretty close to an enemy when you click, you'll attack, which really helps when dealing with fast-moving enemies. Skills, scrolls, and potions can be assigned to slots for the 1-0 buttons on your keyboard. You can equip two sets of weapons and switch between them at any time by pressing W, which came in handy for me on many occasions. Buttons are assigned to your inventory, your skill tree, etc., but they're easily accessible through on-screen icons as well. It isn't groundbreaking, it's just a good implementation of tried-and-true controls.In the broadest terms, there are two ways to make a great game: do something cool that hasn't been done before, or do a great job of improving on things that have been done before. Torchlight falls pretty firmly in the second category, but that doesn't make it any less great.Highly Recommended "

												From under an hour of playing Torchlight I got tired of it. I played FATE a long time ago, and playing this felt simply like FATE with better graphics and a different inventory setup. Literally every other aspect of the game felt the same, from the level setup, to the town, to the pet companion and its behavior to the color and naming scheme on items.No doubt if you've never played a game like this, Torchlight could be fun, but it just feels like the same game to me.It's too bad; I wanted to like it.

I'm not sure, I don't kow if all action hack and slash rpg's are the same and I mean the exact same where you have a pet companion who you can feed fish to and they turn into another creature. I 'm not sure, I'm not knocking the game and don't necesarrily want to call it a rip off, but it could just be me. Well made but all to similar to other games I've played. I could just be being silly or something.			"

												Without a story, an RPG is just lots of clicking. And in this case, picking up inventory that you can't use. Torchlight has virtually no plot, no lore, and maybe around a dozen characters. It's also really easy. I swear, I will click on stuff if I feel there is a purpose to it. But I didn't feel that here.			"

												The ONLY reason I do not recommend Torchlight is because TL2 is out. TL2 has improved on everything I saw in my limited time with this game. If you want to play through the entire series (I definitely wouldn't put the story on par with Diablo 1/2 even plenty of Blizzard North devs worked on Torchlight), go for it. Otherwise, grab TL2.

												Really monotonous from start to finish, the story was incredibly boring and so was the combat. The game is literally just running through a 30 floor dungeon while killing everything with one (mouse) button. Has none of the charm that the games in the genre usually have, upgrading gear isn't at all satisfying and doesn't change the game at all from start to finish. There are more spells, but there's really no point when you can just click fireball through the whole game and kill everything and drink a potion once in a while. Mainly played through to find out why everyone praises the game and it was nothing to write home about. Only way I got through it was by watching Family Guy on secondary screen while playing.			"

												Torchlight is bizarre in that it introduces a lot to the genre that is very convenient (larger inventories and smaller items, shared character stashes, minimizing town runs to the bare minimum), but the entire game is anemic to the point of boredom. At least, until the last five floors, when the game suddenly shifts to impossibly cheap. The lack of online play is only the beginning of this game's baffling flaws. It lays the groundwork for the genre's future, but is not a good game at all.			"

												First of all -- I should have paid much more attention -- truly revolting, cartoonish graphic. Moreover, I have found the game unplayable. Hordes of enemy coming in, I press secondary attack button a bunch of times, explosions fill the screeen, I cannot see anything but explosions, I stop pressing the button, enemies seem to have been destroyed long ago. Gets boring after a very, very short vile.I cannot identify myself with any of the characters, which makes immersion totally impossible.I could not get myself to get through the introductiory quest.

												Okay so I bought and played this game. After that process I cannot recommend this game. I know that TL2 is out, but I always like to experience the first in the series before playing the others. TL is a game that would suit youngsters that don't have access to the internet and do not have the ability to play WOW. To all others unfortunately in the current tiem i would advise to get TL2 and avoid this complete diablo clone with WOW visuals....even the music in TL has been completely copied to this game. My guess is this is a diablo mod with new WOW skin and package as an entirely different game. NO! It sounds, plays and acts just like diablo even down tot he narration. had this game came out in 2004 it would of been great as an alternative to WOW, but sadly this is lil too late and retro won't even save it.My biggest gripe is not the game, but the recent critics that reviewed this as decent.....yeah maybe 8-10 years ago!!! Seriously!!! Even @ $15 I can only recommend this game to toddlers that wanna play WOW but arent allowed. TL2 now that's a different story, OH well you live and you learn. ""I will say one thing about TL1; it's not horrible and there is alot worse out there, it's just why did the devs have to xerox diablo? Why couldn't they have created TL's own unique music and flavor?!!			"

												A good first attempt at a Action RPG but just does not excell at anythingGenre: Diablo clone/action RPGYea! -Cartoonish art direction is nice.-Pet companion is useful.-Decent story- Nice varitiy of enviromentsMeh!-Combat feels extemely slow and simple comapred to Diablo 3.Not much in the terms of equipment stats variation means you could use same piece of gear for quite a long time. -Not much depth, basically you spam most powerful attack and potion when needed from start to end, there is no need to change tactics at allBleh!: -The last boss is nothing but a test of patience then skill, has too much health and takes quite a long time to windle down as you run circles around him popping potions.-Even though you have quite a few skills to learn, expect to only use 1 or 2 and ignore the restLowdown:Torchlight at release before D3 would of been the goto game but after the release it just seems average. Combat seems like it takes forever and needs no real type of skill. You expect a dungeon crawler where the main premise is to keep upgrading gear to get better but Torchlight seems to fail at this as new gear for my character came far and few between. I ended up ending the game with a level 10 piece of gear at level 36 because it had better stats then anything i could find. At least your pet can hike this stuff back to town to vendor for you, giving him more then the benefit of a lowly ai companion And last the final boss was a letdown due to the fact that he is easy to deal with but the devs just gave him absurd amounts of health that took a long time to windle down. The game does offer great art style that is pleasing to the eyes and never gets dull as the enviroment changes often. 2.5/5**From what I heard TL2 improves on a lot that made this game average so it is best to go for that instead of this one if you want a Diablo 3 alternative**			"

												Reviewing Torchlight is a tough one for me. It’s not a buggy game, everything works very efficiently, and the graphics and sounds have a clear unity to them. But I will never ever touch to this game again if possible. It doesn’t have any charm, the setting is dull beyond all belief, the identity it tries to build falls flat, the combat is exhaustingly boring, and the item hoarding reached its new pointless peak. Like I said there’s a unity to the graphics but they possess no appeal whatsoever. They’re just there. They don’t add anything to the game — certainly not atmosphere. Everything looks like a kiddy cartoon and strips the experience from any emotion there was left. You never find anything useful in the dungeons. I bought everything I used and only gathered stuff to sell it. The spells are useless. I wanted a mage but ended up using the special skill that by the way don’t get bonuses from your skills that you can level up. The levels are so repetitive that I barely noticed when their themes changed. The general jist of it was: switch the doodads around a bit and put up different color wallpapers. Then there are the end bosses which bring the word “boring” to a new level. It’s just running and grinding. For minutes. Or in the case of the final boss possibly HOURS (I can’t know for sure because I had to use cheat codes to get through it before I fell asleep). This game does so many things wrong that it doesn’t deserve any sort of recognition. It is just horrible.			"

Same happens to me with all bioshock games, couldn´t play them because shooting all that mutated innocent people felt wrong or way too easy.

												Torchlight is a fairly mediocre diablo-like. I haven't played much of the diablo games so I would take this review with a grain of salt. I may just not like the genre. The levels feel bland, similar, and uninspiried. The characters felt different, but it seemed that all of them mostly ended up just pressing on of a few buttons until an enemy died. To be honest, it reminded me of the worst parts of playing WoW: Boring grinding and sorting through loot.If you could get this for very cheap, I could see you getting your money's worth, but with Torchlight 2 already out, I think I would have to recommend picking that up instead. I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.			"

												If ever there was a game that was overrated it would probably be the first Torchlight.People would say things like ""If you liked Diablo then there is nothing to dislike about Torchlight"" while completely ignoring that even the first Diablo had multiplayer and Torchlight does not.Torchlight has another problem where moreso then most games I've played with RNG loot like this, I seem to always be using gear that is at least 10 levels below my level because everything that drops is worse then what I already have. At about the halfway point in the story I had to rely on purchasing items from the Weaponsmith whenever something decent would show up, because all the loot seems to suck.At the end of the day, if you want to play a game like this you're probably better off getting the sequel or looking elsewhere entirely.

												This is a truly brilliant game for grinding. It has so much grinding in it, the publishers had better sell a physical version packaged with grindstones.On the other hand, if you prefer grinding, this game also has something for you. For instance, I tried placing a handful of black peppercorns on my desk while playing, and guess what - 3 hours later I found them ground to dust, perfect for cooking! Amazing!For the extreme gamers among us: you like listening to grindcore while grinding? With this game, you no longer need to! You immediately reach equivalent amounts of adrenaline and dopamine just by firing up the game. And when you start playi--sorry, grinding--oh boy, oh boy, the joy, the brain ground into nirvana!Last but not least, Torchlight II is a great continuation of the grind included herein, so your grinding in the first Torchlight will have its well-deserved sequelae of repetitive grind in the second.Can only recommend this to any and all grinders.

The cheaper it gets, the more awesome the deal with this title. It already is a good buy at the going rate though.Great game. Cynics might call it a poor man's Diablo 3. If only Diablo 3 was like this...			"

												Playing through as an Arcane Alchemist on Normal, I was enjoying myself for the first 8 hours. The next 8 hours after that, it became clear that if I wanted to progress at a reasonable rate, I would have to do some grinding. In a game that I actually like, grinding would be acceptable even though I think it's a stupid way for someone to progress in a game. Torchlight's endgame was complete garbage and I would not recommend this game to anyone. There are numerous problems with the spellcasting in this game like: not being able to cast up/down stairs properly, not being able to cast depending on what hand your casting from when there's a very small and almost non-existent object next to you, having to wait between casts (meaning if you want to drink a potion, do a buff, then cast, you have to wait until each animation is completely finished before you can do the next. This makes intense combat scenarios extremely annoying to get through when you have to shuffle between these things) and so much more. I could complain about this all day but I'll just end it here.Torchlight is not fun, it's annoying (as said before.) I beat the game and I'm obviously salty as all hell, but I had to get this out. Stay away from this trash heap of an RPG.			"

												Very basic Diablo clone with childish graphics and no atmosphere whatsoever that can be fun—for the first few hours anyway.The first few hours are quite fun due to its basic structure, which is very like the first Diablo (single town with a dungeon under it).  It can be addictive building up your character, and the game provides a decent amount of ways to power up outside of simply gaining levels.  You can attach gems to equipment, try to have equipment enchanted (and risk having all enchantments removed), and buy random equipment that could turn out to be enchanted.Unfortunately, there are way too many things holding this game back.First, the graphics and atmosphere.  It was designed to run on netbooks so the graphics are very simple.  That doesn't bother me so much... but the cartoony exaggerated look that couldn't be more generic means you'll be playing this for the mechanics only (more on that later).  The music, composed by the guy who did the music for Diablo 1 & 2, is just alright.  It sounds a lot like Diablo, but not nearly as good as Diablo.Second, the itemization is poor.  I found my best equipment not even halfway through the game on Hard.  Outside of finding rings that would give me +8 Dex vs +6 Dex, I had basically the same equipment loadout for the last 6 hours or so.  Nothing that dropped even came close to what I already had.Third, the dungeons are dull and feel way too long.  You have a mine, spooky castle, lava place, spookier castle.  That's about it.  The layouts are randomly assembled from larger pieces, but there is nothing whatsoever interesting.  Other than randomly coming upon merchants and bosses, there is nothing to look forward to or be surprised by as you explore.  Some unique hand-crafted rooms or levels or something would have gone a long way.  You have to go through 35 of these to beat the last boss, and once the item drops got boring so did the rest of the game.Fourth, the enemy variety is awful.  You typically have 2-3 enemy types per level.  Usually a small fast monster that just charges at you, an archer or wizard hanging back shooting spells, and a big tough monster that slowly comes after you.  That is basically it.  Each type of enemy will have some unique abilities (such as ""shoots fire"" or ""stun resistant"") but most of it is window dressing.  The bosses are just HP-inflated monsters that summon minions over and over.Fifth, the game is way too easy.  Diablo clones need to strike a good balance between being difficult and unfair, and need to give you access to skills and tactics that let you push the odds in your favor.  The only time I had any difficulty here (note: I played on Hard, which I know is code for ""Normal"" in this game) was in the last couple levels where they would routinely spawn demons that could basically instantly drop a two-hit kill spell on me.  If you die you can resurrect in town with no penalty, resurrect at the start of the level with some gold missing, or resurrect in place with a gold and exp penalty.  So in other words, there is really no penalty for dying, and once I learned that I totally lost interest in the game.All in all, a skeleton of a decent Diablo clone is here (as Torchlight II would go on to prove), but considering the competition (including the original Diablo which has actually aged remarkably well), Torchlight is a hard game to recommend to nearly anyone.

												Torchlight is, in every way, the successor to Diablo 1. It's a stylish Action RPG where you control either a warrior, rogue or wizard and venture into a randomly-generated dungeon. Torchlight improves on Diablo in that, in addition to your hero, you control a pet that has its own inventory and can be sent back to town while you are adventuring to sell all the goods that it is carrying. Torchlight will provide you with many hours of entertainment, although, much like Diablo, it can get somewhat repetitive.			"

												Its good. Lot of originality and the game world is nicely rendered. But the amount of weapon drops and items kinda kill the gameplay. You constantly are having to check bags and decide on whether to keep or drop items. Its like an MMO cept a bit more annoying on the loot. The lack of a variety of classes means each class has multple routes which change how it plays, but overall it also can complicate things if you want to change up play style. Lack of multiplayer is also a hinderance but not game ending. Buy it whenever it goes on another Steam sale. Its worth it then for sure.			"

												I played Torchlight for nearly 100 hours - very addictive hack-n-slash dungeon crawler. If you like Diablo, you should like this. The guy who did music for Diablo made the music for Torchlight - and it shows - amazing atmospheric music. They also really came up with solutions to many of the problems of action RPGs. For instance, the problem of having to slog back to town to sell your junk and get some gold. They give you a pet that fights alongside you (and can shape shift) that has an inventory - you can send it off to town to sell your items and come back with gold. So you get to enjoy the dungeon more - I stacked a bunch of enchants that made my pet leave and come back instantly, so I never had to go to town unless I wanted to buy something.They also let you buy a respec potion if you have the gold. It is also very mod-able. There are mods making your pet into a giant ferret or adding a new special dungeon or quest giver or a treasure vault.Highly recommended.  "

												When Blizzard North - the original creators of Diablo and Diablo II - wanted to start development of the third installment of the series they had a concept in mind, the concept of an MMO styled Diablo, years before World of Warcraft, in the era of Ultima Online, UO might have had a true competitor in a sprite world rather then in the 3D age.Alas it was not the desire of the company to follow that path for the series, and so several members of Blizzard North decided to go their own way. In time Runic Games was founded and with it came the true sequel game of the Diablo franchise, albeit disguised with a different name. It's name was Torchlight, and it was incredible.With the recent release of Diablo III now it's the best time to evaluate and see how different these games are. For an avid player of the previous Diablo II, the official sequel never quite felt 100% in place, now pick up Torchlight or the upcoming Torchlight II and you feel the difference right away.			"

												Made in large part by former Blizzard North employees, Torchlight 1 can be boiled down to a remake of Diablo 1. You're limited to a single town, forced to battle your way underground to kill an ancient evil, collecting loot and leveling up along the way. Torchlight doesn't stop there though, the loot and skills are much more fleshed out than D1, and there are infinite dungeons ingame thanks to maps that open portals to them. While the main quest is short, you can do new game +, but the main draw is the infinite dungeons. All in all a great remake of a great game, provided the cartoony visuals don't bother you too much.

												A worthy successor and interim title for fans of the Diablo games. It feels rather limited at times considering that the world's scope is only a village and the ground beneath it, and that there are only 3 character archetypes (Warrior, Mage, Ranger) but  it is nonetheless a simple game to jump into and waste time on. Just cue up your favorite music and beat, bash, melt, and pulverize your way through hordes of monsters and all manner of randomly generated dungeons. Its cheap and its fun. Buy it.			"

												If you want a game that you can put some music on and bash away at things with, this is pretty much it. While this type of game has been done so many times before, Torchlight manages to get it pretty smoothly done. While it's no Diablo it's enough of a dungeon smasher to keep interest for a bit. Customization is there, combat is fun enough, and the dungeons are randomly generated - that being said, I feel like story line is almost nonexistant. I know I don't pay attention to it anymore, anyway. There's also a shared chest between your characters which makes it easy to twink up different characters quickly (a plus or a minus). Overall probably one of the best options until Diablo III comes out.			"

												I would heartily recommend Torchlight to .....someone if they were approximately 10-12 years old and as long as they'd done their homework! Its easy, flashy,  harmless,  extremely superficial and an utter waste of time much like the entire ""Diablo"" formula. But that is often enough or at least  OK so to speak for a lot of people since it's based on gameplay that has a strongly addictive element especially for the naieve. I don't mean that arrogantly when I played my first computer game in 1982 it was the bee's knees... even if the dragon I was attacking on the screen was just a large number of ""Ds and Xs"" joined up! Now in the 21st century... if your sensibilities are for undemanding colour and movement the game will be a blast. Frankly, I found Torchlight shallow and often rather dull, especially some rather uninvolving levels deep in the mine where I plowed through enemies like I was harvesting a field of potatoes. To me it lacks something...best summed up as ""context"". Torchlight is shallow (rhymes with callow...oops). I want something more ....some emotional connectivity perhaps. I desire meaning, actual substance in the story, intellectual stimulation since I'm old and bored and graphics, colour and movement are just that. When it's all done right you get something special, something emotive and memorable. Challenging for a designer I know, my sensibilities get in the way of fun..oh well. Fun is however easy peasy, disposable but leads to jadedness. Torchlight has not a shread of ""context"" but it is likely to be fun at least.			"

												Torchlight is pretty much a clone of Diablo 2 and similiar games but with a more cartoonish style. You start in a town and work your way deeper and deeper into the ruins underneath the city, finding treasure, beating monsters in randomly generated levels. Every now and then you head back to the surface to buy new stuff, get skills and spells or do sidequests to gain experience points.It's overall a decent game if you like dungeon crawler. As for me, i quickly lose interest, the repetetive nature of these games isnt my cup of tea.			"

												Torchlight isn't a game. It's an addiction.Everything about Torchlight is very simplistic. From the fighting (which is as simple as ""point and click"") to the story (which I barely remember after 20+ hrs. of gameplay). It becomes mindless, and after awhile Torchlight made me feel like a rat hitting a feeder bar. I'd *click, click, click* to kill monsters, hope for some good loot, and repeat. Playing on normal mode was perhaps a bit too easy, as I only ever died out of stupidity. Even the bosses were very easy, with the exception of the final boss who was entirely unbalanced with the rest of the game.Though I'm glad I'm now free of its grasp, I must admit that I had fun playing Torchlight. Any RPG expert will have fun balancing player, pet, and weapon/armor stats, but the actual gameplay and story will remain a bit dull.My rating: 3/5			"

												Torchlight was developed by some of the guys who worked on Diablo 1 & 2. It's essentially very similar gameplay, the most noticeable difference being how bright and colorful the game looks in comparison to Diablo. This may be a turn-off to some, and very welcome to others who are tired to the standard dark and brown color schemes in games these day. If you're unfamiliar with Diablo, Torchlight is still a very accessible game. ARPGs are quite easy to get the hang of, as far as controls go (clickclickclickclick Q 124356 etc.) It's rather slow-paced, which might bug some people as it starts to feel boring after a few hours in a play session. Having a pet companion helps make the single player descent less lonely/ Pets will fight by your side, and also sell any excess items you give it in town for you. Dungeons are somewhat randomly generated. Loot drops also varies.The game is quite easy on Normal difficulty due to the abundance of potion drops, and the ability to just spam the potion button when you are in trouble. You shouldn't expect to die very often at all. Although this might give the game a bit of a casual feel, it is still an enjoyable single player game that isn't overly lengthy. You can get a good 25 hours in. Don't expect much on the story front; it's rather bland and not very memorable. Besides, the core of the game is centered on loot. While this game is worth the price, you may want to shell out an extra $5 for the sequel, which, in addition to fixing how rigged potions worked, the slow pace, adds much more to the game with regards to loot, classes, monsters, skills, and importantly, multiplayer.

												Torchlight is not the most optimised of creations - the camera view can be limiting and even on low graphics settings the game can occasionally chug along for no reason - but it showcases a wonderful art design consistently and not once are you jolted out of being fully immersed in its world.It caters to my own personal desire (in games at least) to ""Own All The Things"", although making me continuously chuck away / sell things due to lack of storage space is annoying (that is not a critique of Torchlight itself).It probably won't feature on my personal favourite games of all time list, but the fact that I keep playing it should speak towards its merits.

												If you are a fan of Diablo esk Dungeon Crawlers then this Is the game for you, being designed by the team responsible for Diablo and Diablo 2 it's got alot of talent behind it, The characters are well developed but lacking customization, otherwise the talents are great, some thing's wrong with it, but much more Right with it, It's a decently crafted RPG tale that should keep you hooked long enough to get your money out of it.  Worth a try.			"

												It's a great hackey-slashey dungeon crawler. Graphics are beautiful, the story driving you deep underground is well done, and if you think there's something missing there's a large mod community that may have what you're looking for. Mods are even endorsed by the developers, as evident from the mod-related achievements. The only thing that could make it better is multiplayer, but the devs decided to save that for the next one.

												This is my first game review since joining Steam, try not to rip me apart? :DAs someone who was more of a console gamer, I unfortunately had never gotten around to the the critically acclaimed RPG's like Diablo or Fate. That being said, I've done a little research and given thought to purchasing the titles; until I found Torchlight. This game has highly impressed me beyond what I gathered by first impressions. It has a familiar feel (err, in my case ""look"") to Diablo/Fate, yet brings a fresh spin to the mix. Picking up the game very recently, for a STEAL while on sale for $3.74, I haven't had a chance to drain too much time into it just yet. However, in the 3 hours that have literally flown by since playing I can say that I'm addicted. The combat is interactive and keeps you moving, items are bountiful and useful, main/side quests that actually feel rewarding, and lastly but not least the crisp, clean graphics. I can already tell that I'll be completing another 2 playthroughs with the other character classes and spending more time than what's healthy for me to grind out some of the achievements. TL;DR - I highly recommend this game for any RPG lover that's looking for a good dungeon crawler with replay!			"

												For a Hack and Slash, this game does okay. The graphics and game-play is smooth, there are a variety of weapons that are different only cosmetically outside of the stat vlaues they have, and skill trees reminicent of its Diablo 2 forebearer. The primary problem with the game is there is no multiplayer, a mod was supposedly in development, but it has never turned up. The plot is also rather bland, though the voice acting is decent enough.If you like single player, try the demo out, otherwise wait for Torchlight 2.			"

												Torchlight is a nice change of pace from the Diablo series. As a clone, as everyone else will state, it holds up as a great clone to Diablo. It's a milder environment to Diablo which is actually a refreshing change of pace. Instead of always being gloomy it has lots of color and different environments. It has some annoying characters like Diablo but nothing overbearing (like the Dungeon Hunter series).What I love. The ability to send a pet back to town with your loot to sell and not have to worry about town porting over and over. Also, pets, love the pets. I wasn't big on the fishing aspect of the game but loved having a pet around me. I also love the thriving community of modders and the ease of applying mods to the game.What I don't like. I wish I had more control over the character customization and appearance. Thankfully we do have some mods that allow visual skin changes. I have my alchemist set with a black goatee. But it would be nice to choose the sexe of your role. This was a limitation in Diablo too until Diablo III but still something that bugs me.I've tried out all 3 roles and enjoyed each. My favorite is the alchemist but there is something for everyone. Highly recommended.			"

So many potions, you'll be like ""Wow, I have so many potions"". Oh, and it runs on a toaster. The merchants have a ♥♥♥♥ing monopoly so they sell you♥♥♥♥♥♥at 200 times the price of what items are worth. Your pet is pretty great too, it gets stuck after every turn and has to teleport back to you all the time. Hulk Hogan is nowhere to be found in this clicking simulator, but you should buy it anyway.			"

												I got into this game not too long after Diablo 3 came out. I was originally playing that, but the servers were such a nightmare that I gave up. I went looking around and came across this game. This game is a good substitute to Diablo 3. I would even go so far as to say that it is better than Diablo 3. Sure the fact that it isn't always on DRM is pretty awesome, but the game is just generally more fun to play. It isn't as complicated as older Diablos, and I never really found this game to be difficult, but I have a real soft spot for it.One of the best things about this game is the pet system. It is so satisfying to be able to go into a dungeon, pick up every bit of loot, and when my bag is full I can just send my cat back to town to sell it off. I love that I barely spent time in town while playing this game, and when I was in town it was because I purposefully chose to go back on my own.Probably the thing that holds this game back the most is that choices are pretty limited. There are only three playable characters, and the skill trees aren't all that robust. The magic system is cool, but it's a bit annoying to have to switch out scrolls all the time. If you're looking to replace Diablo 3 this is a good choice. It might not have the shine of the other one, but it has more heart and it is more fun to play. Plus the sequel is even better than this one.			"

												Opinion: worth every cent of the $15 I paid originally, but on sale for less than $4? Buy this game! For that price I bought one as a gift and one for myself even tho I already have the game on disk with >L50 hero. The convenience of having it on Steam where I can play from any of the 3 computers I have access to is solid gold!Rating: 9/10.If you liked Diablo 1/2/3, you'll really enjoy TL! Looks like, plays like, and feels just like Diablo but with a pet (which gives you more inventory space, a way of getting rid of excess inventory without leaving the dungeon, as well as having another body to fight along with you)!Standard choices of hero: barbarian (melee), rogue (ranged), and magician (alchemist) altho you can customize all of these by using skill points to increase strength, dexterity, magic, and defense. Upgrade system for your armor or weapons by enchanting and socketing gems (""embers"") just like Diablo. These gems can be refined to higher grades of purity, giving better bonuses to your armor or weapons. Also a way of recovering either the gem or the socketed item without harm, but you have to sacrifice one or the other.Tons of loot generated with no (white), one (green), or more buffs (blue), along with unique (orange) and set (purple) items that when matched to other items of that same set, give additional buffs to your hero.Randomly generated levels so each playthru is different, giving unlimited replayability. Excellent game with the best of Diablo mechanics, wrapped in smooth visuals and seamless gameplay. 5 stars! Buy this game!			"

												""I can't believe its not Diablo!"" Dungeon Crawler style RPG in the same vien of Diablo and the like. It's charming low poly graphics, linear design, and creative construction between a good and well designed game and a strong support and love for modders and those who enjoy to use mods. You progress through the game with a well balanced difficulty as you follow a linear but expansive dungeon. Every few floors things change up and goes from flooded tiki pygmy's getting pushed of cliffs to volcanic subterean and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off goblins. Lots to explore but you can still maintain a solid straight through experience if you arent into all the secret finding and loot grabbing and Champion hunting goodness. Easy to enjoy, a great pick up and play. It satisying in Casual sir-gibs-alot, as well as the hard as nails Elite mode leaves you wanting to try it with all the characters. Also i totally probably wasn't a Rifle toting Alchemist with a super shield.... I've played the game alot more than i have on steam, played and beaten it before i had steam so some fore thought.			"

Its well-crafted and polished to be sure - nothing approaching the high intensity visual feedback of Diablo 3 but well enough for its time - but its tedious, and player decisions feel arbitrary and automated.

												Like RPG's but aren't super hardcore?  Is WOW a too expensive and massive for you to get into and enjoy?  Do you like to play RPG's alone and not have to rely on guilds, clans, and raid parties to have fun?  In that case, Torchlight is for you.  It is a much simpler version of WOW: 3 classes and only 3 skill trees per character.  Your pet can run items to town to sell and you would think that would solve your inventory problem but you'd be wrong.  Slots in your pack become prime real estate which can get frustrating.  Surviving in dungeons is easy since you never run out of health or mana potions and it also means that you can spam your best skills indefinitely.  When I have the itch to play an RPG and watch numbers slowly increase and I don't have a saved Final Fantasy record to play, this is a great substitute rather than just re-opening a WOW account when that itch comes around like some people.  Start a record with each character though so you can switch when you get tired of one.			"

												It's like Diablo, but better. The only consideration is its cartoony look and feel, but that is overwhelmed by the superior gameplay in all regards.The choice of character classes is greatly simplified over Diablo's complex set-ups of different characters; in some sense, there is less of a sense of reward when you create this godlike monstrousity of a character, but in another sense it makes it a lot easier for the less meta-gaming player to play the game; its less about statistics than it is raw fun.The choice of pet is also not significant, but the decision on whether to send your pet back to town or keep him with you in whatever form you've specced and spelled him up to be is also significant.In fact now that I think about it, I've basically been playing a massively simplified single-player WoW for the last week, so...wow.BUY THE GAMEor torrent it if you have to, but its worth the buy			"

												I got into this game not too long after Diablo 3 came out. I was originally playing that, but the servers were such a nightmare that I gave up. I went looking around and came across this game. This game is a good substitute to Diablo 3. I would even go so far as to say that it is better than Diablo 3. Sure the fact that it isn't always on DRM is pretty awesome, but the game is just generally more fun to play. It isn't as complicated as older Diablos, and I never really found this game to be difficult, but I have a real soft spot for it.One of the best things about this game is the pet system. It is so satisfying to be able to go into a dungeon, pick up every bit of loot, and when my bag is full I can just send my cat back to town to sell it off. I love that I barely spent time in town while playing this game, and when I was in town it was because I purposefully chose to go back on my own.Probably the thing that holds this game back the most is that choices are pretty limited. There are only three playable characters, and the skill trees aren't all that robust. The magic system is cool, but it's a bit annoying to have to switch out scrolls all the time. If you're looking to replace Diablo 3 this is a good choice. It might not have the shine of the other one, but it has more heart and it is more fun to play. Plus the sequel is even better than this one.			"

Especially since it consists of three character classes which is similar to Diablo 1's available classes, Warrior/Rogue/Sorcerer. Torchlight also brings some remenant of Diablo 3's map and dungeon styles. Gameplay wise, this game may last you quite awhile. Since I'm an old fan of diablo series, this game is great. All you people who liked the Diablo series, this game is recommended to you. Others who never tried it, should buy it if you have the extra money. Great alternative until Diablo 3 is release.			"

There's a lot of weapons, enemies to kill and places to explore in Torchlight and the deeper you go underground, the more the scenery changes.It's a good time waster and doesnt have too steep of a learning curve and is laptop friendly aswell.As for the cons: The game does take place for the most part underground so you dont see much daylight. And no coop mode.Hopefully Torchlight 2 will fix some of these problems but for now it's a fun game you can just pick up and play.			"

												 Probably one of the best indie games out there. This game has got everything one might want from a hack-and-slash genre representative: flawless and fluent gameplay, excellent music (with a new ""haunting guitar theme"" (tm)), nice random-generated level design, interesting art-style. Now the game has no co-op, but I don't care since I only play single-player anyway. Another debatable issue are the models used for enemies. Some like them, others don't. I personally find them a bit funny and well-fitting for an adventure of this type. Those looking for more grim environments can always play Diablo series instead. Another problem might be a very primitive story, but that has, unfortunately, become ""standard"" for most hack-and-slashers these days. This game deserves 9 out of 10 at the very least and I eagerly anticipate part II (like many others).			"

												This is a great Hack'n Slash! However haing played Diablo II it is obvious to me where the developers got their inspiration. I don't mean that is a bad way, Diablo II is a grat game but Torchlight just takes everything from it, and I mean EVERYTHING. The skills tree and attributes work the same way and are in the exact same form and place, all potions and sockettable Items are the same, well everything is the same, even the music is very similar. I would call this game a RIP OFF if I didn't think Diablo's gameplay was so good it was meant to be copied in every way. I actually didn't feel like I was playing another game my first thought when I started was ""oh I'm in tristram"". In a strange way the better graphics and smarter interface makes me think much of the time this is simply an updated version of DIablo II. Anyway I can't criticise something I enjoy very much, and this is a really good game and I can only commend the people who made it for having chosen Diablo as a template.			"

												I'm just about halfway through.  This game is a light and fun third-person RPG with a downright amazing selection of weapons and armor.  Want to be a plate-wearing arcane mage?  Not too difficult and fun as hell.  The game is pretty, extremely stable, and thus far, not terribly challenging on easy setting.  I'd recommend starting on normal.			"

												Torchlight scratched the Diablo itch for me, at  least for a while. While not as deep and rewarding as D2 it managed to suck enough hours out of me to complete it. The characters feel fresh and different, but do not feature the same diversity in terms of builds. There is not much choices to be had in terms of skill allocation. One will max out most of the skills and special builds taking advantages of novelty items or unorthodox combination are rarely viable or even playable. Nonetheless a great Action RPG for some weeks of fun.			"

												I bought this one when it was on sale through steam. My expectations were to play a Diablo 2 clone of sorts; also given that a bunch of former Blizzard and Diablo developers made this game. It does indeed feel very much like Diablo 2, in particular in music and sound effects, but still retains its own unique style.The game was a surprise and the typical hack&slash and scavenging mood quickly sets in to keep you hooked. HOWever, I recommend waiting on Torchlight 2 which will feature native co-op mode. Chances are it will hit the stores before Diablo 3 does anyway ...			"

												EDIT: Now that Torchlight 2 has released, I figured I should put a little update to this. This game still shines just as much as I wrote previously.. and if you like it, you should definately pick up the second game! So much more was added and it still retains all the things I loved from the first.OLD REVIEW: This is one of the best dungeon-crawlers I have played to date.  I like this game more than I like Diablo and Champions.  It is fresh, and since it is made by most of the original Diablo 2 team, they know what they are doing and they give players a game worth investing in.  Unlike most other dungeon-crawlers, this games only drawback is there is no multiplayer for it (but Torchlight 2 will be).  The story is good, graphics are pretty, and there are tons of levels to explore and monsters to vanquish.  The game supports fan-made mods, and so there is a ton of extra content you can get, varying from different classes, pets, items, levels, etc. I love it more than a fat kid loves pie.			"

												A great game! Lots of fun. TL2 is definitely better, though, in terms of the gameplay and the mere fact that it's multiplayer. So, honestly, you don't even really need TL1 unless you're interested in the storyline. (But if you just want to kill monsters, get loot, and play with another human, get TL2.) Anyway, I wouldn't even have TL2 if it weren't for TL1, so it's obviously a great game, and I enjoyed it muchly. If you haven't tried TL2 yet, get TL1 and work your way throught that first. But you'll certainly feel the difference when you move on to TL2. I tried to play TL1 again after playing TL2, and it's just not the same, haha.			"

												If you want a game that you can put some music on and bash away at things with, this is pretty much it. While this type of game has been done so many times before, Torchlight manages to get it pretty smoothly done. While it's no Diablo it's enough of a dungeon smasher to keep interest for a bit. Customization is there, combat is fun enough, and the dungeons are randomly generated - that being said, I feel like story line is almost nonexistant. I know I don't pay attention to it anymore, anyway. There's also a shared chest between your characters which makes it easy to twink up different characters quickly (a plus or a minus). Overall probably one of the best options until Diablo III comes out.			"

												I had TORCHLIGHT II for a few weeks on my wishlist. Now I bought both the first and second TORCHLIGHT via Steam sales for about five bucks each. Well, after I started the first one ""just to see if it was worth the 4 bucks"" I think I just might have overseen the part in the buying process where it states that TORCHLIGHT is one of the best RPGs you can get out there and that it will cause an instant addiction if you're rudimentarily interested in RPGs.But no, seriously - this game is as simple as great. The story is not too deep, but you can instantly start it without any problems and have fun. Tons and countless hours of fun.I'm not a programer and the last time I did play a RPG was the time when DIABLO 2 came out.If you can get it for a decent price / when it's on sale, do yourself a favor and buy it. You won't regret a single penny. Awesome. SImply awesome. Slashing, hacking, firing, collecting, collecting, collecting.			"

												Only to be outdone by Torchlight 2 (with its broad scope and multiplayer co-op), Torchlight perfects the Diablo formula, makes it fun and accessible, and adds a variety of new gameplay mechanics that take it beyond the usually hack & slash clones to be more than mouse-clicking and dressing paper dolls in new armor. Continuing from the Fate series, the designers take everything they learned and hone it into a fun and addictive game, only hampered by the fact that you can't play it with your friends.			"

												As a fan of Diablo and D2(LOD), this game is everything those 'should' have been.  One thing I should mention at the start, though:  I'm not positive, but I believe considering everything I've seen online, playing this game for extended periods can actually affect your hardware.  It may only be coincidence, but after playing this on my laptop for long periods, I noticed that my computer was starting to overheat to the point where it actually shut down.  Even on my current desktop system, I can actually hear my computer working hard to keep the game running.  It may be partially that my hardware isn't really capable of running the program at peak efficiency.  Anyways, with that out of the way, I love the game.  The character movement flows along very well, and with decent strategy, the game isn't too hard, but still presents challenges along the way.  And, there's still the extended levels which I have yet to explore (although it sounds like the tile sets are merely reproduced from the primary game levels).  A nit-pick is that it's sometime painstaking trying to conduct transactions with the various vendors (constantly moving back and forth, and with hovering descriptions obscuring the purchase screen).  The biggest advantages this offers over the Diablo games is the ability to save at any point, as well as being able to send your 'pet' back to town to sell off the junk items you collect along the way.  Another thing I like is that it's easier to collect pieces of equipment to complete a 'set' (unlike Diablo2, where I have yet to actually complete even a minor one).  Overall, I enjoy playing this little gem.			"

												PROS:- Three solid classes- You can equip anything on anyone- You got a familiar with you- Your familiar has travelling pouches strapped on, which means you can send him to the store to sell excess items!- You can equip a few pieces of equipment on your pet, and magic as well- Passive skills can be obtained (so if you're like me, you'll prefer those to manual skills)- You have multiple difficulty levels to choose from- You can also select Hardcore mode, meaning you pick any difficulty plus hardcore (this means death is permanent)- Auto save (saves to Steam and locally)- Enemy deaths are permanent (for the most part)- Mods are available, yay!- Mod editor available (I haven't tried it though. Library --> Tools ---> Torchlight Editor)CONS:- Only three classes to choose from- Character customization in the beginning is very restrictive- Skills and so on are very limited- Magics are very restrictively used. You can only equip a limited amount- Part of the storyline is confusing- Story could have been better plotted- Only around 25 hours of gameplay- Only 3 main characters + 3 secondary characters + the townspeople/miners and salesmen- Music is not horrendous, but uninspired and makes gamplay somewhat boring			"

												Torchlight is an Action RPG with Diablo combat mechanics. It has very fresh gameplay that never gets old. The story isn't engrossing, yet is an irrelevant aspect to the joy you will get from playing the game. The graphics aren't the best, although Torchlight has a great graphics engine that allows smooth gameplay for old PCs. This game is very appealing to fans of the RPG genre, although I recommend that every gamer at least give the demo a try, because the low price makes Torchlight a very good gaming investment.Gameplay: 19/20 ...

												You like Diablo? Cause thats what this is. Seriously, it's almost the exact same game as Diablo 1, but with the aditions from Diablo 2 and different graphics. If you close your eyes the main town theme sounds exactly like the theme from the town in Diablo, and the similarities extend to most of the sound effects and other music as well. It's not surprsing given it's essentially the same team that worked on Diablo 1/2. The slightly cartoony look doesn'y quite fit the dark mood they were trying to go for, but other than that the game is brilliant (if you are into diablo-esq l00t-fests).			"

												If you read the description of this game, you find out that many of the designers of this game were the makers of Diablo and Diablo II. With that being said, if you enjoyed those games and are a fan of them, you will definitally love to play this game. It has simple, basic functions which makes it really easy to control your character. It has a lot of the same features that were in the Diablo trilogy. There are many quests to beat with many monsters and bosses. Learn all sorts of skills with a giant amount of various and unique weapons. Also, I cannot forget that you also have a pet throughout the game as your companion and I'll say that this keeps you going through the dungeons and levels without having to make a trip to town so often as your pet can sell your items for you during the game. Less time trading, more time in battle saving Torchlight.What's not to like about it?10/10			"

												This is my first game review since joining Steam, try not to rip me apart? :DAs someone who was more of a console gamer, I unfortunately had never gotten around to the the critically acclaimed RPG's like Diablo or Fate. That being said, I've done a little research and given thought to purchasing the titles; until I found Torchlight. This game has highly impressed me beyond what I gathered by first impressions. It has a familiar feel (err, in my case ""look"") to Diablo/Fate, yet brings a fresh spin to the mix. Picking up the game very recently, for a STEAL while on sale for $3.74, I haven't had a chance to drain too much time into it just yet. However, in the 3 hours that have literally flown by since playing I can say that I'm addicted. The combat is interactive and keeps you moving, items are bountiful and useful, main/side quests that actually feel rewarding, and lastly but not least the crisp, clean graphics. I can already tell that I'll be completing another 2 playthroughs with the other character classes and spending more time than what's healthy for me to grind out some of the achievements. TL;DR - I highly recommend this game for any RPG lover that's looking for a good dungeon crawler with replay!			"

												""I can't believe its not Diablo!"" Dungeon Crawler style RPG in the same vien of Diablo and the like. It's charming low poly graphics, linear design, and creative construction between a good and well designed game and a strong support and love for modders and those who enjoy to use mods. You progress through the game with a well balanced difficulty as you follow a linear but expansive dungeon. Every few floors things change up and goes from flooded tiki pygmy's getting pushed of cliffs to volcanic subterean and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off goblins. Lots to explore but you can still maintain a solid straight through experience if you arent into all the secret finding and loot grabbing and Champion hunting goodness. Easy to enjoy, a great pick up and play. It satisying in Casual sir-gibs-alot, as well as the hard as nails Elite mode leaves you wanting to try it with all the characters. Also i totally probably wasn't a Rifle toting Alchemist with a super shield.... I've played the game alot more than i have on steam, played and beaten it before i had steam so some fore thought.			"

												Torchlight scratched the Diablo itch for me, at  least for a while. While not as deep and rewarding as D2 it managed to suck enough hours out of me to complete it. The characters feel fresh and different, but do not feature the same diversity in terms of builds. There is not much choices to be had in terms of skill allocation. One will max out most of the skills and special builds taking advantages of novelty items or unorthodox combination are rarely viable or even playable. Nonetheless a great Action RPG for some weeks of fun.			"

You can choose between either a archer, mage or warrior. They each specialize in their respective fields but you can still slightly specialize in the other two as well. It combines elements from diablo and fate. There are different dungeons but instead of different areas to go to, you just go deeper and the areas change as you go. The boss fights are great as well. You dont feel like you are just fighting a harder npc. You feel like you are really fighting a boss. The look of the game is really great too. It has a sort of cartoony look to it. I think this is a great game and I highly recommend it. The only setback is the lack of mulitplayer.			"

												With a linear, framework for a story, ""Torchlight"" has straight-forward ""click on everything"" gameplay with a skill tree. Hearing the announcer / narrator intone when one has levelled up adds to the feeling of accomplishment. Lots of loot with variety is available throughout the dungeons, but also not mind-numbing to gather sufficient pieces to make sets. The best part is the low system requirements; while saving money to get a nice computer, I was able to play ""Torchlight"" on a netbook.There are a few recurring bugs, such as getting stuck against the environment, especially in the ""pocket universes"" accessed via scrolls and a particular monster; the only way to get out of this glitch is to use a console command.This game's sequel is in development and you can get this first game for free along with the sequel... or buy it at various retailers for a very affordable US$10.I recommend this game if you enjoy the ""Diablo"" series, ""Titan Quest"", ""Throne of Darkness"" or ""Prince of Qin"".

												A very good Hack & Slash game for Mac and PC, somewhere between Diablo and WoW : Diablo for the game principles and music score, Wow for the toonish 3D graphics. The soundtrack is very pleasant and not agressive, just like in Diablo and Diablo 2, and the game is quite addictive, although, in the end, corridors and mazes become a bit repetitive, especially once you've beaten Odrack. One should notice that PC version benefits from a special toolkit that allows the user to create his own mods, toolkit which has not been ported to MacOS : (			"

												Since I'm not a big fan of Diablo, I usually tend to ignore hack-n-slash games. I decided to play Torchlight however after I got it for free with a gaming magazine and it really took me by surprise. The game has a great artistic direction and a cartoonish design as well as a great soundtrack that adds a lot to the fairytale feeling. It features 3 classes (Alchemist/Destroyer/Vanquisher) and a gameplay very similar to the one we've seen in Diablo I / II, with a few interesting additions. Among those, one that I found very helpful is the fact that every hero has it's own pet that can sell/buy things for you, as well as the possibility to teach your pet spells and use rings, amulets and collars to give it different abilities. The game also allows you to learn spells and to fish (normal fishing as well as dynamite fishing). Every fish has special properties and it can be used to transform your pet into various creatures with different abilities. And if the standard game is no good for you, you can use interesting mods to make it the way you like. Unfortunately it has a big downside: Torchlight seams to be a game designed for co-op but without co-op. 8.5/10			"

												Torchlight is, in every way, the successor to Diablo 1. It's a stylish Action RPG where you control either a warrior, rogue or wizard and venture into a randomly-generated dungeon. Torchlight improves on Diablo in that, in addition to your hero, you control a pet that has its own inventory and can be sent back to town while you are adventuring to sell all the goods that it is carrying. Torchlight will provide you with many hours of entertainment, although, much like Diablo, it can get somewhat repetitive.			"

												Its good. Lot of originality and the game world is nicely rendered. But the amount of weapon drops and items kinda kill the gameplay. You constantly are having to check bags and decide on whether to keep or drop items. Its like an MMO cept a bit more annoying on the loot. The lack of a variety of classes means each class has multple routes which change how it plays, but overall it also can complicate things if you want to change up play style. Lack of multiplayer is also a hinderance but not game ending. Buy it whenever it goes on another Steam sale. Its worth it then for sure.			"

												This game is a lot of fun and quite addictive.  It's basically a generic Diablo, but with excellent mechanics.  The biggest downside, and ultimately the reason I quit playing, is that its addictive kill monsters-get loot-level up-kill monsters loop is a bit too thinly veiled.  In other words, there's barely a story and the loot and monsters are just more powerful versions of what came before.  After a while, it comes to feel like a meaningless exercise in clicking in order to click more effectively.  Maybe all games are meaningless exercises in clicking, but at least the great ones fool you into thinking otherwise.			"

												For all intents and purposes, Torchlight is a Diablo clone. It's made by some of the developers who worked on the original Diablo, and it shows, it reallllly does. But does that make it a bad game, or unoriginal? Not in the slightest. In fact, it's as good if not just barely better than Diablo 2, and that's saying a lot. I wish the environments were more varied than the mines, and the final boss fight is pretty much impossible without godmode on, but I very much enjoyed my time with Torchlight. Also, pets that sell your inventory without having to make a trip back to town? INNOVATION OF THE CENTURY.			"

												A fantastically fun take on Diablo-style gameplay, only let down by the limited amount of content.Mechanics:The game is a procedurally generated action RPG with a heavy emphasis on loot collection, familiar to anyone who's played DIablo (it's actually made by the same devs as Diablo 1 & 2, just under a different company). You control a lone hero w/ a faithful pet as you delve deeper and deeper into a massive dungeon. Along the way you must fight hordes of monsters, including randomly spawning elites who have special skills. You can also discover hidden rooms full of treasure, solve puzzles to find treasure, and complete sidequests for treasure. Treasure!There are 3 playable classes, each of which can be built different ways via a skill tree system. You have a classic melee, ranged, & magic assortment, but with some unique twists. They're pretty good, but painfully limited. Not only are there just 3 choices, but you can't customize them at all. No apperance changes, no gender toggle, no nothing. The Destoyer is a giant hulking wrestler looking dude. The Alchemist is a skinny scientist with cool goggles. The Vanquisher is the only female character. These are your only choices, sans mods.Since the entire game is basically combat, it's vital that the combat be fun. Thankfully, it is. More than fun, combat in Torchlight is an absolute blast. I played as a summoner Alchemist and found the game to be a relaxing abnegation tool, delighting in hours of dungeon clearing and equipment upgrading.Level Design:The goal of the game is to keep clearing out a dungeon, defeating bosses along the way, until you reach level 100 and defeat the final boss. This inevitably becomes very predictable. In order to counteract this predictable progression, the game relies on randomized level design. Groups of floors (1-10, 11-20, etc) have set templates, so areas will appear congruous and monsters will change and scale over time, but the actual floors themselves are randomly generated, so the game is always throwing different things at you. This helps to keep things fresh even though you're basically doing the same task for 100 floors.You have a main quest line to string you deeper into the dungeon and three optional quest givers that always provide the same types of quests - one will reward you for killing elite monsters along the way, one will reward you for finding shards of Ember along the way, and one will open up portals to optional mini-dungeons for you to clear. In addition, such portals can randomly spawn in the main dungeon, helping to provide some variety.The floors are broken up by boss fights in set intervals, which provide exciting encounters to break up the flow of monster clearing and loot gathering. The bosses usually have unique abilities and badass appearances to make them stand out among all the other enemies. Once you beat the main story, you unlock an endless random dungeon that you can perpetually run, but I have exactly zero interest in that. It's an especially weird inclusion here, since there's no multiplayer mode for you to show off or share loot.Narrative:The mining boomtown of Torchlight is built above a rich vein of Ember, a mysteriously powerful mineral ore that is invaluable for enchantment. The Ember's power has a way of drawing people to it...including the heroes. Upon arriving in Torchlight, they meet a sage named Syl, whose mentor has disappeared into the mines. They delve underneath the town to help her find Master Alric, and soon find themselves traveling through layers and layers of collapsed civilizations. All of them succumbed to the power of Ember.The story is, sadly, the weak point of the game. It sets up an interesting world, but is itself pretty bare. You begin by venturing into the mines to find Alric, only to quickly discover that he's become tainted by Ember. Then you become tainted yourself, so the story becomes a dual quest of stopping Alric and curing your own corruption before it consumes you. This provides a rationale for why you keep dungeon-diving, and eventually provides a setup for the sequel, but Torchlight is primarily about combat rather than plot. The most effective storytelling in the game is environmental, as you see the ruins of several corrupted civilizations...more ancient the deeper you go. As shallow as the plot is, it does manage to convey this idea of power being a corrupting influence (especially if you play the Alchemist). However, it just sort of ends w/o closure. This is b/c the game was only ever intended as an intro for an eventual MMO that never got made.  Instead, the sequel provides the proper ending to this game.Aesthetics:Beautiful. The art design looks like something from a comic book, with everything appearing hand painted and gorgeously detailed. As you progress deeper into the dungeon, you're presented with older and older ruins, each with its own unique template and style. The 3 playable characters also have really cool looks. You can tell that a lot of love went into designing the world.The voice acting is dull, but Matt Uelmen's musical score is oustanding, really setting the mood for the adventure. It's slow and atmospheric most of the time, but becomes dark and brooding or energetic and adrenaline-pumping at just the right moments.Overall Rating:  4/5 "

Little goes wrong, hasjust the right amount of difficulty for players fresh to the genre, or those like me who have been playing since they could hold a controller.  Quests are fun, dungeon crawling is great and overall fun factor is high.   If you want a dungeon crawler but are put off by the monstrous beast that is Diablo III, look no further than Torchlight.

												Yes, it is a Diablo clone, but a good one at that. The graphic style is redolent of Warcraft 3/World of Warcraft, in fact some weapons seem to be a 1:1 copy. Yet Torchlight succeeds in having its own idenity. Combat is fast paced and fun, and the higher difficulties are giving me a good challenge. There are 3 distinctive classes (Rogue, Wizard and Barbarian) who in turn each have 3 different talent trees - so replayability should be ensured.I got the game for free by pre-purchasing Torchlight 2 for 20 bucks, a no brainer.

												A nice, little, rather stylized version of Diablo 2. Sadly without anything of Co-Op and the like it can be something of a lonly experance, but they did a good job overall with what you have. Decent loot tables so it never feels like you are outgunned for too long, or HAVE to farm your stuff up to move forward. The ablity to mix and match skill trees between the three varent's per class is also a nice touch, and the pet companion ( outside of them being pure invincable ) is such a freaking awesome idea that makes me wonder why not one ELSE ever did such. Still, if nabbing T2 and you get this, it'll make for a decent distraction and time killer. Don't go into it expecting a blockbuster.			"

												If you love action / hack'n'slash RPGs (and are old enough to remember) and prefer Diablo I to Diablo II and want some new thrill - don't skip Torchlight. Many games have tried and all have failed to extract the essence but Torchlight could successfully become the spiritual breed of Diablo. Among an ample of cool things in game mechanics, balance and combat system that is newly oldish, having just the perfect balance, you will find one of the key elements that Diablo I and II had but III did not: master composer Matt Uelmen who single handedly created the atmosphere here with his amazing tracks. Not as if GFX were on the weak side, they are just a little easy, cartoony and cheery for Matt's heavy and dark sonic texture - but that's just me, you can't go wrong with the game itself, it feels, plays and looks cool. It is like a little ninja among the 10+GB sized games: nimble, tiny (600MB or so installed) and very stabile. I played it on XP32, XP64 W7 and W8 and it worked perfectly on all the systems, not a single freeze, glitch or hiccup whatsoever. I guess, developers put an extra emphasis on bugfree coding. It plays extremely solid.Alsolutely recommended.			"

												When Blizzard North - the original creators of Diablo and Diablo II - wanted to start development of the third installment of the series they had a concept in mind, the concept of an MMO styled Diablo, years before World of Warcraft, in the era of Ultima Online, UO might have had a true competitor in a sprite world rather then in the 3D age.Alas it was not the desire of the company to follow that path for the series, and so several members of Blizzard North decided to go their own way. In time Runic Games was founded and with it came the true sequel game of the Diablo franchise, albeit disguised with a different name. It's name was Torchlight, and it was incredible.With the recent release of Diablo III now it's the best time to evaluate and see how different these games are. For an avid player of the previous Diablo II, the official sequel never quite felt 100% in place, now pick up Torchlight or the upcoming Torchlight II and you feel the difference right away.			"

												Made in large part by former Blizzard North employees, Torchlight 1 can be boiled down to a remake of Diablo 1. You're limited to a single town, forced to battle your way underground to kill an ancient evil, collecting loot and leveling up along the way. Torchlight doesn't stop there though, the loot and skills are much more fleshed out than D1, and there are infinite dungeons ingame thanks to maps that open portals to them. While the main quest is short, you can do new game +, but the main draw is the infinite dungeons. All in all a great remake of a great game, provided the cartoony visuals don't bother you too much.

												My first impression of this is very positive. Not only does the combat feel far more engaging than typical RPGs, the convenience of being able to send your pet to the merchant with a load of items halfway a dungeon and never suffering of the famous 'should I drop these boots to make room for this potion' line of thought makes me wonder why not all RPGs have a similar system.

												For all intents and purposes, Torchlight is a Diablo clone. It's made by some of the developers who worked on the original Diablo, and it shows, it reallllly does. But does that make it a bad game, or unoriginal? Not in the slightest. In fact, it's as good if not just barely better than Diablo 2, and that's saying a lot. I wish the environments were more varied than the mines, and the final boss fight is pretty much impossible without godmode on, but I very much enjoyed my time with Torchlight. Also, pets that sell your inventory without having to make a trip back to town? INNOVATION OF THE CENTURY.			"

My expectations were to play a Diablo 2 clone of sorts; also given that a bunch of former Blizzard and Diablo developers made this game. It does indeed feel very much like Diablo 2, in particular in music and sound effects, but still retains its own unique style.The game was a surprise and the typical hack&slash and scavenging mood quickly sets in to keep you hooked. HOWever, I recommend waiting on Torchlight 2 which will feature native co-op mode. Chances are it will hit the stores before Diablo 3 does anyway ...			"

												At first I had my doubts, since diablo 3 was such a let down. However this game is fantastic because while similar to the diablo series the subtle improvements and gameplay provide a very enjoyable experience. It feels like Diablo 1 and Diablo 3 combined together minus all the BS that made diablo 3 horrible. You can really tell that the orignal designers for Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 made this game! I bet they are having a big laugh over blizzard now! The pet system here is awesome too, and I love how you can send you pet to get potions or scrolls for you, or sell your extra loot w/o having to return to town all the time! Its also fantastic how 6 players can coop together instead of just 4! The online mutlipayer section is okay, and great if you have friend you always play with. I enjoy the fact our portals never go away in single player. We can also teleport directly to our friend in a multiplayer game so they do not need to constantly drop portals if a friend joins.I would highly recommend this game if you used to love playing Diablo 2 and were disapointed in Diablo 3!

												Many games have tried (with varying degrees of success) to capture the Diablo spirit and fill the vacuum that has settled in the more than a decade since Diablo 2 smashed PC sales records. But where other titles have imitated, Torchlight has abandoned all pretense and simply copied wholesale much of Diablo's content.Developed by refugees from the disbanded and reconstituted Blizzard North team that created Diablo, its hard to judge how legitimate the result is. Virtually every ability in the game can be found in Diablo 1, 2, or featured in a trailer for Diablo 3. The game follows the structure of the original Diablo so directly that you'll do a double take: your hero arrives in a town situated atop a massive labyrinth of evil, which you will descend one level at a time.It should therefore come as no surprise that Torchlight is nearly as enjoyable as its spiritual antecedents. If you have the Diablo itch and you can't for the next Blizzard title, Torchlight is worth a play!			"

												Diablo III is still a very long way away.  In the meantime, here is Torchlight: a high-quality action RPG developed by a lot of people behind the first two Diablos.  A somewhat refreshing take on the genre, Torchlight sports a unique and colorful visual style, along with a cheesy story that never takes itself too seriously.  There's a vast amount of randomized loot to grab in the game's 35-floor main dungeon (which is also randomized, of course), and your pet - a handy invincible companion who can fight unless its HP runs low - can also run back up to town to sell whatever you put in its inventory.  There's also an infinite dungeon, fishing, gambling for rare items, a shared stash, tons of sidequests, a level editor, achievements, Steam Cloud support, it's also on Mac, and there are a HUGE number of mods for it (google ""Torchleech""; you'll be glad you did).An absolute steal.  Reccomended for anyone who likes fun.			"

												This game is a lot of fun and quite addictive.  It's basically a generic Diablo, but with excellent mechanics.  The biggest downside, and ultimately the reason I quit playing, is that its addictive kill monsters-get loot-level up-kill monsters loop is a bit too thinly veiled.  In other words, there's barely a story and the loot and monsters are just more powerful versions of what came before.  After a while, it comes to feel like a meaningless exercise in clicking in order to click more effectively.  Maybe all games are meaningless exercises in clicking, but at least the great ones fool you into thinking otherwise.			"

												Torchlight is pretty much a clone of Diablo 2 and similiar games but with a more cartoonish style. You start in a town and work your way deeper and deeper into the ruins underneath the city, finding treasure, beating monsters in randomly generated levels. Every now and then you head back to the surface to buy new stuff, get skills and spells or do sidequests to gain experience points.It's overall a decent game if you like dungeon crawler. As for me, i quickly lose interest, the repetetive nature of these games isnt my cup of tea.			"

												After playing this, it felt more like a version of Diablo for children, with what constantly felt like Fable but on a budget.I Guess it's good for when you have never played the Diablo trilogy, or if you want to introduce your small children to the dungeon crawler but can't find a copy of Gauntlet for your Gamecube.The cartoony visuals are alright to lighten the mood of the game.Something like if Team Fortress 2 fused with Diablo, reduced the number of classes available, and made the gameplay rather shallow by comparison.I guess it's fitting for parents who want to introduce their kids to dungeon crawlers, but the shallow combat isn't really something for gamers who love a high level of intensity. It starts rather slow too, which isn't really exciting.Again, good to introduce your kids to dungeon crawlers, which fits well with your kids who play Wizard 101, but I would not really advise for high intensity gamers.

												Torchlight is, in a word, satisfying. Yes, it isn't some radical new game concept or an incredibly high-profile game that's been promoted and advertised as much as CoD, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad game. The story is decent, though not particularly remarkable; all it really needs to do is provide an excuse for you to go smashing your way through waves of enemies and leveling up. I love the graphics; they are colorful, detailed and hi-res. Two thumbs up for me.			"

The development team consists of ex-Blizzard employees who had a hand in Diablo, so that isnt a bad thing at all.  Great game and I enjoyed it.			"

												Since I'm not a big fan of Diablo, I usually tend to ignore hack-n-slash games. I decided to play Torchlight however after I got it for free with a gaming magazine and it really took me by surprise. The game has a great artistic direction and a cartoonish design as well as a great soundtrack that adds a lot to the fairytale feeling. It features 3 classes (Alchemist/Destroyer/Vanquisher) and a gameplay very similar to the one we've seen in Diablo I / II, with a few interesting additions. Among those, one that I found very helpful is the fact that every hero has it's own pet that can sell/buy things for you, as well as the possibility to teach your pet spells and use rings, amulets and collars to give it different abilities. The game also allows you to learn spells and to fish (normal fishing as well as dynamite fishing). Every fish has special properties and it can be used to transform your pet into various creatures with different abilities. And if the standard game is no good for you, you can use interesting mods to make it the way you like. Unfortunately it has a big downside: Torchlight seams to be a game designed for co-op but without co-op. 8.5/10			"

Well, after I started the first one ""just to see if it was worth the 4 bucks"" I think I just might have overseen the part in the buying process where it states that TORCHLIGHT is one of the best RPGs you can get out there and that it will cause an instant addiction if you're rudimentarily interested in RPGs.But no, seriously - this game is as simple as great. The story is not too deep, but you can instantly start it without any problems and have fun. Tons and countless hours of fun.I'm not a programer and the last time I did play a RPG was the time when DIABLO 2 came out.If you can get it for a decent price / when it's on sale, do yourself a favor and buy it. You won't regret a single penny. Awesome. SImply awesome. Slashing, hacking, firing, collecting, collecting, collecting.			"

It's too bad it's only single player, but because of that they made it very modable. So there are a ton of good mods for it. This is one of the best HnS RPG's out there.

												I would heartily recommend Torchlight to .....someone if they were approximately 10-12 years old and as long as they'd done their homework! Its easy, flashy,  harmless,  extremely superficial and an utter waste of time much like the entire ""Diablo"" formula. But that is often enough or at least  OK so to speak for a lot of people since it's based on gameplay that has a strongly addictive element especially for the naieve. I don't mean that arrogantly when I played my first computer game in 1982 it was the bee's knees... even if the dragon I was attacking on the screen was just a large number of ""Ds and Xs"" joined up! Now in the 21st century... if your sensibilities are for undemanding colour and movement the game will be a blast. Frankly, I found Torchlight shallow and often rather dull, especially some rather uninvolving levels deep in the mine where I plowed through enemies like I was harvesting a field of potatoes. To me it lacks something...best summed up as ""context"". Torchlight is shallow (rhymes with callow...oops). I want something more ....some emotional connectivity perhaps. I desire meaning, actual substance in the story, intellectual stimulation since I'm old and bored and graphics, colour and movement are just that. When it's all done right you get something special, something emotive and memorable. Challenging for a designer I know, my sensibilities get in the way of fun..oh well. Fun is however easy peasy, disposable but leads to jadedness. Torchlight has not a shread of ""context"" but it is likely to be fun at least.			"

Would have liked a little more content but the game is still good as is. I had alot of fun playing this game and will be playing it again just to kill time or for nostalgias sake.			"

												Very good game, you can feel the Diablo influence, and not in a bad way. The graphics are cartoony in a pleasing manner, so they will age fairly well, and looks good. Over and all, a worthy buy and addition to any Hack-n-Slash RPG fan's library.			"

												A pretty solid ARPG in the diablo style.  In fact the studio is staff with a number of Blizzard North that made Diablo 2.  While this game is better than D3, time is an enemy for it.  D3 has much better UI and graphics, but Torchlight has better gameplay and design overall.  Pick it up if you like ARPGs or want to be prepare for TL2 when it drops late 2012.			"

												I haven't finished playing this game yet, but 47 hours in is enough for me to say it's awesome :D  I'm not normally a fan of dungeon crawlers - one of the main reasons being they're an overpowering world of greys and browns.  Torchlight really brightens things up and manages to keep the exploration fresh and the various mini quest, hidden dungeons and looting mechanisms are sure to keep your dopamine reward pathways edging towards the computer for more (seriously, it's addictive - if you're an RPG fan this might be one of those where you lose sleep).  On the face of it things are pretty simple - the ""surface"" town of Torchlight is where all the quests and side quests are acquired, weapons/armor can be enchanted with upgrades, loot like gems or potions can be transmuted into more powerful versions etc - but the game's face and atmosphere change drastically as you delve deeper into the mines of Torchlight where the *ember* lies.  Floor 1 looks a million miles away from floor 30 - both in terms of visuals and the calibre of enemies you'll encounter.  It's very easy to do these kinds of fairly formulaic games wrong - and they often come out as boring Diablo clones.  This does not feel like that.  In fact, I'm not even a huge fan of Diablo, but I love this.  The makers of Torchlight found exactly the right balance between classic RPG elements and innovative and clever hooks to keep you interested.  If in doubt, buy it while it's on sale.  But honestly, I'd say it's actually worth the RRP in terms of the number of enjoyable hours you'd get out of it.  I am biased as an RPG fan though :P			"

If you're looking for a diablo type game, but less complicated or if you're looking to kill a few weekends, then I highly recommend plopping down your hard earn cash on Torchlight.			"

												One of the best RPG I have played since diablo 2. It kinda follows the concept on how the first Diable was made, where we decent through different types of dungeons till the final boss, 3 types of character class and only one safe haven. The soundtrack is amazing (same artist as diable 1 & 2 : Matt Uelman). The graphics is unique for this game's theme. For an indie game, I would say the game has the value of an AAA game.I considered buying this game after playing torchligh 2.I would recommend picking up both games.			"

												So where do I begin with Torchlight. I guess from where everyone else will see it. This is very simular to Diablo. There I've said it. Like it or not whenever a top down dungeon crawling hack n slash loot driven game is released the first thing it will be compared to is Diablo. So having said that how does it compare? Thats a good question. I'm glad you asked that. Torchlight is a brilliant game and has stood up against the ""Oh its just a Diablo Clone"" comments fairly well. Granted this hasn't been as big as Blizzards long lived and beloved game but this is the first of hopefully many for this series. So lets look at why this is such a ""Diablo Clone"". Simple really. Part of the old Diablo team (Not Diabo 3) left Blizzard and produced Torchlight. That is the easiest way to explain that. Their style of story writing and gameplay design will obviously come through in whatever game they make. But be rest assured this is not a ""Diablo Clone"".Now the elephant has left the room lets get down to Torchlight on its own. It has a very cartoony graphics. Which I for one love. I find that it works really well set in a fantasy world. You don't always have to have photo realistic graphics when you have such good gameplay. Which Torchlight has plenty of. The quests you receive are both fun and rewarding. You obvisouly end up in a lot of dungeons and caves and the such trawling your way through hordes of different mobs all trying to slay you. This all leads to quite an exciting time. Working your gear set up and moves set to make sure you are ready for the next dungeon run and boss battle. There are tons of weapons to find. Looting mobs being one of the biggest parts of the game. So you'll be sure to find great weapons and armour etc to make your character even more powerful and unstoppable. You dont have a huge selection of characters to choose from but the basics are covered. Melee, ranged and magic classes. Each with there own special skill sets to work through. Each has 3 skill tress to work up to make your character even more powerful.Theres also the ability to have a kanine companion with you fighting alongside. This can sometimes be more of an pain than a pleasure. But for the most part it is nice to not be alone in dark damp mob infested dungeons. Just a small issue to be noted as I know there are a lot of MMO players out there. This is not an MMO. It is stricly single player. Torchlight 2 has multiplayer so if it is a deal breaker go try the 2nd in the series.So thats the basics. All I would say is if your a little bored of Diablo and want to try something a bit the same but done a little bit different this could very well be for you. Failing that Torchlight 2 is even better.			"

												It's hard to play this game and not compare it to diablo 2. But that is to be expected since the team who made this made diablo 1 & 2. the game features random loot that varies in rariety and power, they can be upgraded thru ember gems and enchants from an enchanter, allowing your favorite weapon or armor to stay useful longer. game looks good and plays better. If you like games like diablo or fate then you'll like this game.now the downsides. Camera can be zoomed in and out but not rotated which is very annoying, there are a couple of mods to correct this oversite, but it really should have been included from the start. no way in the vanilla game to respec skill points if you made a mistake, luckily one of the game designers/ programmers made a potion mod that corrects this.finally the biggest issue i'm aware of is that loot is tied to enemy level and not player level. that means late game the hight tier loot starts to peter out and doesn't keep pace with character growth or progression thru the mines. once again there is a mod that corrects this, but it should have been spotted in playtesting.all that said the game is awesome and i'd recommend you pick it up.

												There are many critiques about this game, ranging from comments like ""THIS IS A DIABLO 2 RIPOFF!!"" to ""It's respectably unique in its own way.""  In my own opinion, I definitely choose the middle.  Indubitably, this game is a derivative from Diablo 2 because many people do not realize that a few creators of this game were the original designers of Diablo 2, thus it should only make sense that this game is much similar to D2.  From my perspective, Torchlight is rich in color and original in some aspects such as merging the powers of a nercromancer and elementalist from D2 into one being: the alchemist.  While the story seems to build of it's own foundation, the gameplay is painfully like D2, making it unoriginal.  But if we really think about games these days, aren't they mostly built off of other games?  Overall, Torchlight is fun and creative in its own sense, but lacks originality in gameplay and graphic features.  Thus, I give this game a 7.3 (C-).Signing out,Dante			"

												If for some reason you've never played Blizzard's renowned Diablo franchise and have wondered about the fuss surrounding Diablo 3, look no further than Torchlight to answer your questions.Runic Games consists of former Blizzard employees who worked on Diablo 2. As such, it should come as no surprise that the two games are extremely similar. Unfortunately, Torchlight has a few flaws that limit its potential:Repetition. Maybe I've outgrown the dungeon crawler genre, but I couldn't shake the tediousness half way into Torchlight's 12 hour campaign. Gameplay is primarily mouse clicking and neither the enemies nor environments were varied enough to keep my interest.The lack of multiplayer severely diminishes replay value. It's generous of the developers to add an infinite dungeon, but why should the average player care when he can't flaunt his spoils or successes?I do applaud Runic's inclusion of an editor, allowing fans to prolong the life of Torchlight. Kudos to that!Grade: B-			"

												This role-playing game takes dungeon-delving to a whole new level. Really. The game is all about running deeper and deeper into the town's underground to defeat a series of bosses. After you defeat the final boss, another such dungeon opens up. It's worth playing though if you're a fan of Diablo II. Its lack of a good storyline may be off-putting but if you could just sidestep that issue, it's worth a couple of hours.			"

												This game makes for an easy review in my opinion, It's fantastic. Steam has me clocked in (currently) at just under 6 hours of play time. I, however have tons more time invested in this game as I have also completed it on my Xbox 360. Owning this game on two different systems should be enough praise to get you to buy it. To add a little more fuel to this, if they add this game to the Xbox One list I will buy it there as well. I love Diablo....LOVE it. I've been playing the Diablo franchise since it was first unleashed opon the world all those years ago. It has everything I could want in a good game and Torchlight, being a Diablo clone (and very competent one at that) does it all just as well. Sure Torchlight has a more cartoon like feel and is more comic book like in its graphics, but that's not a bad thing. It deos everything right. Quests, gear, challenge..it does it all just as well as Diablo ever could. If you don't haver the money to get  Diablo itself, Torchlight is a great substitute. Hours of fun, great environment, excellent level design and you can tell the devs put love into its creation. Highly recommended.			"

												If you ever wondered why all your friends always loved the Diablo franchise while you absolutely hated it, you probably missed the mysterious initiation those complacent souls went through by the time those games were still fresh. Well, it's your chance again. Torchlight is your way inside the secrets of the hack-n-slash RPG's, and it surely can make you a lover of the genre, no matter how contrary to that you might think you are. It is a gem, no doubt, although it has some flaws too, but in the end, rest assured that the pros easily overcome the multiple cons. Let us talk a little about the cons. The story is not memorable, nor the characters, but we are all used to that already nowadays. Also, the game looks cartoon-ish. Even if that actually doesn’t bother as much as one could think, it’s still an issue. There are only three classes, and the characters are not customizable – except for their names and pets – but that’s not so big of a deal too. To be honest, the only real problem with the game is it being too easy overall. If you have half a brain functioning, you shouldn’t play it on any difficulty other than very hard. On normal difficulty, once past half of the game and with the latest skills at hand, one can pretty much one-click anything to death that is not a boss or a mini-boss – literally. Probably only on very hard some old good player’s awareness skills might be better than just spamming the RMB, the default character skills button – probably. We hope this game can be anything of a challenge somehow. On top of all that, the game also starts to get a little repetitive on later levels… Well, from what has been said, one can understand there are some issues, but despite all of that, the game is still so much fun it would be a shame to let it be overlooked, and nothing of that mentioned above should prevent it from being highly recommended for any kind of player. Torchlight is simple, colorful and fun. The entire monster killing and the beautiful visual effects keeps the player interested in the action. The weapons are interesting, so are the drops: one doesn’t have to go anywhere outside the run at hand for help with his survivability. Indeed, because of things like this, the simplicity of the game could arguably be a plus in its favor, instead of a detriment. If one doesn’t want to sacrifice all his spare time grinding, farming, and even buying from other players (sometimes even with real cash) only to be able to survive at later levels, like, for example, one is supposed to do in Diablo III, Torchlight offers a fantastic alternative. It is made for casual players, and anyone could play it on the hardest difficulties without having to resort to anything other than what he finds and does at that particular level with that particular character. Add to all of that the super low price and it becomes an absolute must buy, at least if you’re not a fool. Are you a fool?			"

												This is a charming, modernized spin off the Diablo 2 style of gameplay. If you were a fan of Diablo 2, chances are you will have no trouble deriving enjoyment from this game. It's all third person perspective with random loot and other roleplaying elements to give this game enhanced replayability. The storyline may come to an end, but the game itself is infinite. The dungeon generates an unlimited number of levels which make it possible to play this game continuing the adventure indefinitely. This isn't a game that competes well with other modern titles which offer more originality and hardware intensive graphics, but it was well worth the cost and won't soon be forgotten.			"

												It's a cute little Diablo / Fate clone with WoW-like graphics.  The battles are visceral enough to keep you hungry for blood, and the levels are fun to explore.  Socketing and customizing weapons is the center focus, while your character only changes looks based on what armor they're currently wearing.  I'm a big customization guy and not being able to customize your toon bummed me out.  The story is minimal, and the starting town full of NPCs is boring, making you disregard them to the point of not caring about their lives or stories.  Overall, For the price it's pretty fun, but not playing it won't have you missing out on anything.  It's a casual game for casual players.			"

There is also a ton of equipment to find and specialize. You even get a pet to accompany you that can help fight, cast spells, and carry loot back to the surface to sell so you don't have to keep going back and forth.Torchlight 2 will be coming out in 2011 and will have multiplayer capabilities. So get your training in and look for Torchlight on Steam; it goes on sale every so often for $5-10.			"

That is to say that it is more than just mediocre, it's good enough to keep you interested ad playing. The special items are fun and each class is unique enough that it's worth it to play through the whole game with each of the three classes. The price is a bit steep for a 4 year old game, but not too bad. A good play, and a solid recommendation from me.			"

												A fun ARPG/Hack and Slash with tons of content for it being such a inexpensive title, and at least three playthroughs for the three different classes. The game has a large amount of randomized dungeons, a ton of loot to collect/gem and enchant, and a solid talent tree system for each class that is spread between three different specializations. I recommend it if you're into this genre.			"

												Playing Diablo as a yong one, I forever became a fan of hack and slash RPGs.  I've played all kinds, from all different types of systems.  But I never expected to play one on the PC that rivaled the original Diablo.  That might be big statement to make, but Diablo is old.  What Torchlight does is slightly modernize the ideal behind Diablo.  Most of the team that created Torchlight was on the original Diablo team anyways.  This shows in the game's design.The Graphics and sound quality are great for such an under the radar game.  Thats probably why this game did so well, its just good.  Yes the game is a bit shallow but thats refreshing sometimes.  This game is the ultimate inbetween game, sort of like Minecraft.  There is a story and ending like most games, but the idea of dungeon crawling and getting loot its almosta  primal earge to destroy and collect.Finally, the trush is this is more light weight Diablo.  Less of the dread and difficulty and more of the heroic deeds and pretty colors and effects.  Please give this and Torchlight's sequel Torchlight 2. Graphics -  3/5 Sound -  3/5 Control -  3/5 Misc -  3/5			"

												Torchlight isn't a game. It's an addiction.Everything about Torchlight is very simplistic. From the fighting (which is as simple as ""point and click"") to the story (which I barely remember after 20+ hrs. of gameplay). It becomes mindless, and after awhile Torchlight made me feel like a rat hitting a feeder bar. I'd *click, click, click* to kill monsters, hope for some good loot, and repeat. Playing on normal mode was perhaps a bit too easy, as I only ever died out of stupidity. Even the bosses were very easy, with the exception of the final boss who was entirely unbalanced with the rest of the game.Though I'm glad I'm now free of its grasp, I must admit that I had fun playing Torchlight. Any RPG expert will have fun balancing player, pet, and weapon/armor stats, but the actual gameplay and story will remain a bit dull.My rating: 3/5			"

												""I can't believe its not Diablo!"" Dungeon Crawler style RPG in the same vien of Diablo and the like. It's charming low poly graphics, linear design, and creative construction between a good and well designed game and a strong support and love for modders and those who enjoy to use mods. You progress through the game with a well balanced difficulty as you follow a linear but expansive dungeon. Every few floors things change up and goes from flooded tiki pygmy's getting pushed of cliffs to volcanic subterean and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off goblins. Lots to explore but you can still maintain a solid straight through experience if you arent into all the secret finding and loot grabbing and Champion hunting goodness. Easy to enjoy, a great pick up and play. It satisying in Casual sir-gibs-alot, as well as the hard as nails Elite mode leaves you wanting to try it with all the characters. Also i totally probably wasn't a Rifle toting Alchemist with a super shield.... I've played the game alot more than i have on steam, played and beaten it before i had steam so some fore thought.			"

												When Blizzard North - the original creators of Diablo and Diablo II - wanted to start development of the third installment of the series they had a concept in mind, the concept of an MMO styled Diablo, years before World of Warcraft, in the era of Ultima Online, UO might have had a true competitor in a sprite world rather then in the 3D age.Alas it was not the desire of the company to follow that path for the series, and so several members of Blizzard North decided to go their own way. In time Runic Games was founded and with it came the true sequel game of the Diablo franchise, albeit disguised with a different name. It's name was Torchlight, and it was incredible.With the recent release of Diablo III now it's the best time to evaluate and see how different these games are. For an avid player of the previous Diablo II, the official sequel never quite felt 100% in place, now pick up Torchlight or the upcoming Torchlight II and you feel the difference right away.			"

												Made in large part by former Blizzard North employees, Torchlight 1 can be boiled down to a remake of Diablo 1. You're limited to a single town, forced to battle your way underground to kill an ancient evil, collecting loot and leveling up along the way. Torchlight doesn't stop there though, the loot and skills are much more fleshed out than D1, and there are infinite dungeons ingame thanks to maps that open portals to them. While the main quest is short, you can do new game +, but the main draw is the infinite dungeons. All in all a great remake of a great game, provided the cartoony visuals don't bother you too much.

												Torchlight was the Diablo everyone was waiting for when there were none left to be found. It has all the best from the genre with none of the negatives.There is random loot aplenty, your character develops significantly as you proceed through the game, you can combine gems to make them more powerful, and unique to this torchlight, you can even gamble on enchanting your gear; maybe it will become more powerful, maybe all of the enchants will be wiped away.Graphics are great, sound is great, and you'll enjoy every minute of it.4/5			"

The only reason why I am playing so much of it, is because I am writing a wiki for it.So for the person who doesn't play a lot of dungeon crawlers, then I would say this game is really really cool at first, but then it gets old quick.If you love this genre is game enough to play all the characters in this game, then this game is what Diablo should of been.It all depends upon how much you enjoy the genre.

												This game is a loot hunter's dream. The quest for better items to outfit my character kept me obsessed for the 20 hours I spent on this game. Other than that the gameplay was great, the boss fights were fun and the gameplay addictive. In other words, if you enjoyed Torchlight, you will REALLY enjoy Torchlight 2. I thought it was superior to part one in every way. HIGHLY recommended.			"

												If you're looking for a brilliant fantasy cavern simulator, then look no further, because here is Torchlight! It's a ton of that delightful, dungeon-delving, loot collecting, badguy beatdown kind of games that [for me] never gets old! With a random weapon system, you're always finding new and better equipment. With an interesting and charmingly odd fishing system, change your pet into all sorts of weirdness! Kill things! Take their stuff! SAVE THE DAY! Torchlight. Unh.			"

												I'm typically not a huge fan of RPGs. In fact, I only started playing this game tody because I noticed I'd bought it two years ago and never played it. However, this RPG has a lot of things going for it. The graphics are really nice, the voice acting is decent, and it's great to be able to send your pet to go on errands for you when you're deep in the dungeon.However, this game is really small. It's one dungeon with multiple levels and one town. I found the combat lacking slightly so far, but I haven't explored many of the other special attacks available. I also felt as though there should be some form of multiplayer element to it, since I personally enjoy getting a team to game with in RPGs. If there was some sort of multiplayer and a slightly larger map I would be even more impressed with Torchlight.Overall, good game. If you don't want to spend the $15, definitely get it when it goes on sale.			"

												To those new to the RPG-scene, read the last line.To those looking for familiarities and differences, pro's and con's compared to other games, read on.Torchlight is a creative tongue-in-cheek mix of a few RPG's, the biggest influences being Dragonica and Fable (1.. ). The graphics are 'chunky' which often invites thoughts of 'cheapness' and 'shortcuts', but was pleasantly surprised with the detail in customization it really goes. Spells are beautiful, the combat is amazing and the monsters are just hilarious sometimes. Those who've played Dragonica will understand the artistic style straight away. The Fable-side of it is almost entirely the mechanics. Things just work.. well. There's no shortcuts taken, everything in it seems meant to be there from pets being able to take loot back to town for selling, to the myriad of mazes and routes possible for each (and every..) quest.Buy it. Buy it now. It's not only a great first RPG, it's a great RPG to stand on it's own.			"

												It's a cute little Diablo / Fate clone with WoW-like graphics.  The battles are visceral enough to keep you hungry for blood, and the levels are fun to explore.  Socketing and customizing weapons is the center focus, while your character only changes looks based on what armor they're currently wearing.  I'm a big customization guy and not being able to customize your toon bummed me out.  The story is minimal, and the starting town full of NPCs is boring, making you disregard them to the point of not caring about their lives or stories.  Overall, For the price it's pretty fun, but not playing it won't have you missing out on anything.  It's a casual game for casual players.			"

Loot, monsters, quests, gems, you name it Torchlight has it. Torchlight 2 is coming out soon and it'll expand on the Torchlight game and add multiplayer. This will surely give Diablo 3 a run for it's money at a cost of only $20!I'd definitely look for a copy of this game and give it a go. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Torchlight is a fantastic little dungeon crawler akin to the gold standard of the genre, Diablo.  Probably has something to do with the fact that there were some Diablo developers involved.  The actual story basically doesn't exist (unlike Diablo) but who cares, you're here for loot and oh god is there loot to be had.  One really nice feature is your pet has an inventory you can stuff to the brim with loot you don't want then send him on his way.  He returns a short time later and gives you the gold for it.  Spells are varied, classes are relatively interesting, customizational options for playstyle is fairly impressive, zones are pretty neat albeit occasionally confusing but all in all for the price you can't go wrong.  The only major issue I have with this game was the lack of multiplayer, which can be ""fixed"" with mods, though the obvious solution is to simply get Torchlight II.Regardless you should still find it to be a fairly enjoyable trip and with how low this game goes on sales you can't really justify passing it up.Score: 7.5 / 10			"

												Torchlight is a amazingly well done hack and slash dungeon crawl but that is to be expected    since the same guys who worked on this game had worked on Diablo 1 and 2 as well as Fate and Mythos.So they know what there doing, granted it's a bit short if you just run through the main quest I say it's about as long as Diablo 1 was. But it's still very enjoyable and has plenty of mods and fan made new levels as well as a developement kit, which comes with the game, that allows you to make your own as well.

												Torchlight is an Action RPG with Diablo combat mechanics. It has very fresh gameplay that never gets old. The story isn't engrossing, yet is an irrelevant aspect to the joy you will get from playing the game. The graphics aren't the best, although Torchlight has a great graphics engine that allows smooth gameplay for old PCs. This game is very appealing to fans of the RPG genre, although I recommend that every gamer at least give the demo a try, because the low price makes Torchlight a very good gaming investment.Gameplay: 19/20 ...

												You like Diablo? Cause thats what this is. Seriously, it's almost the exact same game as Diablo 1, but with the aditions from Diablo 2 and different graphics. If you close your eyes the main town theme sounds exactly like the theme from the town in Diablo, and the similarities extend to most of the sound effects and other music as well. It's not surprsing given it's essentially the same team that worked on Diablo 1/2. The slightly cartoony look doesn'y quite fit the dark mood they were trying to go for, but other than that the game is brilliant (if you are into diablo-esq l00t-fests).			"

Its lack of a good storyline may be off-putting but if you could just sidestep that issue, it's worth a couple of hours.			"

												Before this game, I was never really a big fan of the dungeon crawl, hack-and-slash style of gameplay.  But it wasn't because I didn't enjoy playing them, it was because I had never given any of them a chance.  I just thought they weren't the type of games to suit my interests.  I've tried endless spawn, horde mode, etc. type games in the past - games where you basically do the same thing over and over again.  I thought Torchlight would be like that.  Instead, I was surprised to discover how addicting it was for me.  The levels are gorgeous and interesting.  The loot drops are rewarding and entertaining. What more can I say? Sometimes the game isn't about having the best gear, but rather the silliest.  Such as a staff that squawks every time you hit an enemy with it.  Torchlight is, simply put, fun.  I wish I could re-experience the wonder of playing it through for the first time all over again.			"

The special items are fun and each class is unique enough that it's worth it to play through the whole game with each of the three classes. The price is a bit steep for a 4 year old game, but not too bad. A good play, and a solid recommendation from me.			"

												Torchlight is a nice change of pace from the Diablo series. As a clone, as everyone else will state, it holds up as a great clone to Diablo. It's a milder environment to Diablo which is actually a refreshing change of pace. Instead of always being gloomy it has lots of color and different environments. It has some annoying characters like Diablo but nothing overbearing (like the Dungeon Hunter series).What I love. The ability to send a pet back to town with your loot to sell and not have to worry about town porting over and over. Also, pets, love the pets. I wasn't big on the fishing aspect of the game but loved having a pet around me. I also love the thriving community of modders and the ease of applying mods to the game.What I don't like. I wish I had more control over the character customization and appearance. Thankfully we do have some mods that allow visual skin changes. I have my alchemist set with a black goatee. But it would be nice to choose the sexe of your role. This was a limitation in Diablo too until Diablo III but still something that bugs me.I've tried out all 3 roles and enjoyed each. My favorite is the alchemist but there is something for everyone. Highly recommended.			"

												Opinion: worth every cent of the $15 I paid originally, but on sale for less than $4? Buy this game! For that price I bought one as a gift and one for myself even tho I already have the game on disk with >L50 hero. The convenience of having it on Steam where I can play from any of the 3 computers I have access to is solid gold!Rating: 9/10.If you liked Diablo 1/2/3, you'll really enjoy TL! Looks like, plays like, and feels just like Diablo but with a pet (which gives you more inventory space, a way of getting rid of excess inventory without leaving the dungeon, as well as having another body to fight along with you)!Standard choices of hero: barbarian (melee), rogue (ranged), and magician (alchemist) altho you can customize all of these by using skill points to increase strength, dexterity, magic, and defense. Upgrade system for your armor or weapons by enchanting and socketing gems (""embers"") just like Diablo. These gems can be refined to higher grades of purity, giving better bonuses to your armor or weapons. Also a way of recovering either the gem or the socketed item without harm, but you have to sacrifice one or the other.Tons of loot generated with no (white), one (green), or more buffs (blue), along with unique (orange) and set (purple) items that when matched to other items of that same set, give additional buffs to your hero.Randomly generated levels so each playthru is different, giving unlimited replayability. Excellent game with the best of Diablo mechanics, wrapped in smooth visuals and seamless gameplay. 5 stars! Buy this game!			"

The only consideration is its cartoony look and feel, but that is overwhelmed by the superior gameplay in all regards.The choice of character classes is greatly simplified over Diablo's complex set-ups of different characters; in some sense, there is less of a sense of reward when you create this godlike monstrousity of a character, but in another sense it makes it a lot easier for the less meta-gaming player to play the game; its less about statistics than it is raw fun.The choice of pet is also not significant, but the decision on whether to send your pet back to town or keep him with you in whatever form you've specced and spelled him up to be is also significant.In fact now that I think about it, I've basically been playing a massively simplified single-player WoW for the last week, so...wow.BUY THE GAMEor torrent it if you have to, but its worth the buy			"

												Torchlight is a cool simple RPG that has a slight feel of Diablo (every level deeper just gets harder and harder, and there's a central town to do your inventory/customization stuff) but with graphics and characters/enemies that resemble Warcraft.  The classes are good and there's a decent amount of tinkering you can do with items and spells.  The first play through may seem easy but after that you can start fighting harder enemies and challenges.It's a good alternative RPG to try out!  You've got a typical fantasy RPG story with it.			"

												It's hard to know where to begin with a game you've sunk more than 200 hours into (according to Steam's remorseless guilt-o-meter, that is). I suppose the easiest place to begin would be with the demo, which ultimately sucked me into buying my first-ever game on Steam and my last at full price, Was the price worth admission? Silly question really.This game, while not as diverse as its sequel, perhaps holds up as a stronger effort. While I'm not entirely sure about that statement, I have finished the first and grown incredibly bored with the second, which is still a mighty fine game ya hear!The concept of more is better is one I wrestle with constantly and, while I love a good story, do the Torchlight games actually benefit from convoluted yarns? I lean towards a negative answer on that front and would suggest that the first game's strength lies in the fact that its set up is so blindingly simple. Torchlight is a mining town and your job is to burrow down until you find the evil resposnible for all the ""bad things"" endangering the lives of the fine townsfolk above.What could go wrong? Very little really. The gameplay is astoundling tight, though, as you've probably read elsewhere it can become a little muddled when during large-scale fights. However, this is a piffling complaint considering how much can be going on at any one time with marginal slow down (system dependent!!). I put the bulk of my hours into the Mac version FYI. Sure, I game on PCs now, after a somehwta prolonged hiatus, but on an i5 MacBook Pro (2010ish) Torchlight stills gets along at a fair old clip.Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the gameplay. To complain because the screen fills up with enemies, summoned minions and fireworks seems a little churlish to me. Torchlight has  diferent play styles on offer and if you happen to go the ""mad necromancer"" route (using prolonged duration skeleton mods) as I did, then you only have yourself to blame when the screen dissolves into carnage!I could go on about why I love this game, but what would that achieve? Artistically, it still holds up by today's standards. Gameplay-wise, it's a great ARPG, but... what else were you looking for? Nothing to see here move along!While I do plan to get to the end of Torchlight 2 someday, perhaps the lack of a focused experience is what has left me disinterested. Mild warning, here! I like playing games on my own, so Torchlight's solitary dungeon crawl will probably appeal to a solo gamer such as myself more.Anyhoo... 9/10 - minus a point for how hard it was to find matching sets, boooo! ;)			"

												Three playable characters: a brute, a busty-archer, and a mage. A town atop an endless dungeon that’s randomly stitched together as you play. Hundreds of enemies that die in a torrent of clicks. Scrolls. Health and magic potions. Quests. Leveling. Loot. More loot.Diablo is the obvious comparison you could draw with this combat-heavy RPG, but Torchlight is more than a clone. This is like a super-clone with psychic powers. Choose a character. Choose a companion cat or a dog. Enjoy a quaint cutscene, and then wonder where your evening went.With Torchlight 2 on the horizon, and Diablo 3 even further down the line- enjoy this game as your go-to clicky-looty-action-rpg. The game just recently went on sale already, but perhaps we can see some deals when T2 releases.			"

												This is a Diablo clone, made by some of the original developers of that series. It retains the former's loot hunting addictiveness while introducing new and innovative features that gives it its own unique feel.The simple cartoony graphics might be abit of a turn off, but the true gem lies in its excellent gameplay. Controls feel tight and smooth, and the pet system lets player focus more on dungeoning and reduces mundane resupply town trips.Music is very good and is very musically similar to familiar Diablo tunes. Playtime was about 20 hours. It even allows modding for you to fully customize it to your personal tastes.Downsides, the major glaring flaw is the lack of a co-op mode. There are no ingame method of reassigning key bindings and the actual story isn't anything special. None of these flaws however take away from the good points of this game.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Definitely worth it if you are a fan of the Diablo series or Action RPGs. Don't miss it.			"

												I can't recommend Torchlight enough.  It's a action rpg, similar to Diablo. There are 3 different classes and each has several customization options within branching skill trees. There is also a ton of equipment to find and specialize. You even get a pet to accompany you that can help fight, cast spells, and carry loot back to the surface to sell so you don't have to keep going back and forth.Torchlight 2 will be coming out in 2011 and will have multiplayer capabilities. So get your training in and look for Torchlight on Steam; it goes on sale every so often for $5-10.			"

But it's still very enjoyable and has plenty of mods and fan made new levels as well as a developement kit, which comes with the game, that allows you to make your own as well. Also if you like this keep a eye out for the sequel which will be their equivlent to diablo 2 and will also have online multiplayer			"

												May not be the best but still is a great action rpg game.  Plays similar to the style of diablo series, seeing that the 2 co founders of blizzard north that worked on diable 1 and 2 (along with other folks that makes up runic games) worked on this.  The only thing I can complain about is only three classes, small choices of pets and the fact you can't customize your characters' looks, they're pretty much gender locked as well.  Despite all that, it's still a fun dungeon crawling aRPG worth the cheap price.  If you're looking for a on the side kinda game where you just want something to spend the time waiting on another game (like torchlight 2 :p) while still having fun, get this game!Also, torchlight 2 is going to be alot more fun than this!  I've played in beta and it is a great improvement of this game.  It has  four classes with fun skills, way more choices of pets and ability to customize your characters (both looks an gender) and offline/online play and it is still moddable!			"

												Delve deep into the dungeon in this hack and slash action RPG.From some of the creative minds that pioneered the genre with games like Diablo, Mythos, Fate, and Diablo II, Torchlight brings a great visual style and enjoyable gameplay and tons of awesome loot.A mysterious ember plague rises from the depths of the mine beneath the town of Torchlight, and with that dark taint comes hordes of monsters. It's up to you to discover the root of this evil, and stop it before it consumes all.You have your traditional 3 character classes, Destroyer, the close combat melee fighter. Vanquisher, the ranged class, and Alchemist, the magician of the group.Torchlight brings some exciting innovations to the genre, such as your pet who can run back to town and sell your loot for you, so you don't have to break away from the dungeon crawling monster smashing action.The mod tools are freely available, and many mods have been created by the community. Modify the game to play it the way you want.			"

												Short and sweet ARPG. Has some serious balance issues later into the game. Most ""old ARPG"" annoyances (that modern games like Diable 3 address) are rectafiable via mods. Class skill trees can be imbalanced, but again mods fix that. Actually, mods are a godsend for this game. Lots of quality-of-life upgrades immensely changed my satisfaction with the game. The story is completely throwaway, so if you're looking for a decent one then you better keep searching. Overall an enjoyable experience, but I would recommend just going straight to Torchlight II as it is vastly improved upon and contains multiplayer.			"

												If you like Diablo, you'll like this. The pet feature is cool, especially the ability to tell your familiar to go sell all the crap you've picked up for you. It's still the same wrist-mangling, click-click-kill-kill game that Diablo was, with clean graphics, interesting spells, and a easy to grasp class/skills system. I boot it up now and again when I feel like simply hacking up on stuff and seeing what treasures I might find in the process.			"

												Without mods, this game is lackluster. There's no palpable writing nor any good art. But! Wait until you get to know this game as it really should be played. Modded. The great Diablo 2 reminiscent gameplay mechanics and lots of interesting new nuances make it addicting. Even the cartoony visuals appeal after many hours well spent behind the relentless yet fluid, serious yet shallow game. 10/10 for mechanics. 10/10 for the community-oriented development. 1/10 story/characters. 1/10 artwork/graphics, 1/10 vanilla gameworld.

												If for some reason you've never played Blizzard's renowned Diablo franchise and have wondered about the fuss surrounding Diablo 3, look no further than Torchlight to answer your questions.Runic Games consists of former Blizzard employees who worked on Diablo 2. As such, it should come as no surprise that the two games are extremely similar. Unfortunately, Torchlight has a few flaws that limit its potential:Repetition. Maybe I've outgrown the dungeon crawler genre, but I couldn't shake the tediousness half way into Torchlight's 12 hour campaign. Gameplay is primarily mouse clicking and neither the enemies nor environments were varied enough to keep my interest.The lack of multiplayer severely diminishes replay value. It's generous of the developers to add an infinite dungeon, but why should the average player care when he can't flaunt his spoils or successes?I do applaud Runic's inclusion of an editor, allowing fans to prolong the life of Torchlight. Kudos to that!Grade: B-			"

One of the best features is a pet npc that everyone gets that you can send back to town to sell all your crap.  Very kool and flashy yet cartoony graphics.  Good skill tree, stat, and item system.  Everyones problem with this game is that its only single player.  Part 2 will be and looks way better.  I suggest you check it out (I pre-ordered, which is absurdly rare for me, its only 20 bucks new).  This game is worth 10 bucks if you would play a single player hack n slash rpg.			"

												If you want a game that you can put some music on and bash away at things with, this is pretty much it. While this type of game has been done so many times before, Torchlight manages to get it pretty smoothly done. While it's no Diablo it's enough of a dungeon smasher to keep interest for a bit. Customization is there, combat is fun enough, and the dungeons are randomly generated - that being said, I feel like story line is almost nonexistant. I know I don't pay attention to it anymore, anyway. There's also a shared chest between your characters which makes it easy to twink up different characters quickly (a plus or a minus). Overall probably one of the best options until Diablo III comes out.			"

												I came across this game by chance and loved it. At the time, torchlight was one of the few games for the OSX. Visually the game was asthetically pleasing while the graphics were nice too. I loved the music and story. Spending points while leveling felt meaningful. I got to build a hero and playstyle that worked for me. Loot drops frequently enough that you can upgrade your gear at a reasonable rate to complete the story. The ability to pay to change/reroll stats on gear makes gear drops meaningful. After playing this game for a while I kept hearing that torchlight was a diablo clone. I enjoyed torchlight so much it encouraged me to check out the diablo series. I have to say that I enjoyed torchlight far more than D3 and D2. I am looking forward to playing torchlight 2.			"

(Eg. lvl 40 necklace:  +5 Dexterity)Spells lacked in variety too.  There are about 10-15 spells Total, and came in levels.There was little to distinguish one from the other.- - Conclusion - -This game kept me Mildly entertained, but I felt like I was grinding the Entire Time!  Even bosses were boring..I beat one without even realizing it was a floor boss!!  I thought it was just a big tree.I had a Lot more fun playing FATE.			"

												I've never played any dungeon crawlers until this game and IT IS ADDICTIVE! This game is never-ending, literally. It may seem repetitive at some point but it has you coming back for more. This game is definitely worth it!			"

												Awesome Diablo Clone, but if you plan on buying this BEFORE the second game comes out, just preorder the Torchlight 2, and you get this one free.  "

												Lots and lots of clicking. Lots and lots of random dungeons. This game is really good, as you essentially hack and slash through multitudes of dungeons, all with different scenarios and art styles. You get quests where you then venture into the dungeons and grab what you need, or even just kill X amount of things. Many things drop a variety of items, from scrolls, maps and spells to weapons and armor which you can then sell. Good game.			"

												Very very good Diablo-style hack-and-slash lootfest with a cartoony art style that is quite honestly refreshing. Very satisfying combat too. 13/15 yogstars.			"

												Diablo 2 is far superior in every aspect, almost including graphics. The character choices are limited and the interface is less then steller. But nonetheless, it is still a good game.Hey, it's that dog.			"

												Even though it is a single player only this game, Torchlight is a perfect formula of RPG awesomeness.  It is easy enough to jump into anytime but can also be challenging if you fancy.  An excellent buy worth the small price tag.  Torchlight 2 will have multiplayer as well!			"

												Torchlight is one of those Rpg-Hack and slash games that just catch your eye the first time u see it or play it. one main reason this game stands out for me is because there's so many differnet combinations for your character, doesnt matter which class you chose there are still so many differnet choices.

												Realy good game for the people that only has time to play once in a while. The playstyle is like Diablo. Torchlight just has a lot more cartoonish look. Try it out, Its worth  it.3 out of 5 stars from me. Beacous of the lack og creativity regarding the levels they are all the same with some tweeks here and there. And that ther is no online mode just a 2 player co-op could have been AWSOME!			"

												Did you like diablo I and 2? Did you obsess over Thrones of Darkness, Titan Quest, and Sacred? Was it addictive enough? Torchlight brings you back to those roots of why Diablo was so successful. Simple, yet overtly complex in customization. This game is sure to keep you awake for that ""just a few more minutes"" before bed syndrome.			"

												I think the Torchlight series is great for treasure hoarders and explorers like me. I was a fan of the older Diablo games and this brings me right back. I wouldn't say the story is the main feature of this game, so it does have some replay value, especially if you're keen on trying the different jobs. Or there's always Torchlight II, of course!			"

												This game is pro.  The only thing it lacks is Multiplayer, but that's where Torchlight 2 comes in!  However, don't let the lack of Multiplayer deter you from getting this game.  It's worth it and the price is awesome, even when it's not on sale.  If you don't have this game, BUY IT NOW!!			"
