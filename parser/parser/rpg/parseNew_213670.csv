												Fantastic game.  The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.But the game isn't without its flaws.  I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.The game feels heavily ""consolized.""  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense.  Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs.  Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell.  However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC.  I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller.  Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game.  But not in combat.  In combat the controls felt great.  More on that later, though.On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts.  This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back.  I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere.  The loading screens are a real slowdown.So let's see.  The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention.  So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right.  As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight.  This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat.  Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability.  To use it, you select it and then choose a target.  The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button.  Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this.  When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time.  Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair.  The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls.  Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes.  Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by.  Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them.  Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them.  But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress.  As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in.  The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can.  It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.The writing in the game is spot on.  You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character.  I found the story largely fun and interesting.I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game.  This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style.  You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks.  As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories.  You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show.  There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park.  It's a funny game.There is also a difficulty slider bar.  Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding.  The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight.  I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately.  Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan.  I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews.  :)			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time. Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in.INTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park. The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay. Good job Ubisoft!PLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast. Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'.PROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game.+ High resolution art works and good animations+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast and Adolf Hitler[www.imdb.com]+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits+ Excellent Story+ Fun Canada mini-game+ Good amount of character customization however...(See CON #2)+ No Uplay account neededCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON- Useless DLC itemsNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well.)+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open worldCONCLUSION:EXCELLENT game for South Park fans all around. This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games. WORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at its full price only if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show.  However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during a sale. If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)Since 1997, South Park has graced television with its profane, unabashed, and satiric humor.  With its success it has managed to become a part of American culture and spawn a full length movie and several video games along the way but none are quite up to level as South Park: The Stick of Truth. With the help of Obsidian Entertainment, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the most accurate transfer of an intellectual property to games ever made.  That being said, this is a game made with longtime fans of the series in mind.  If you're not a fan of the show, or don't appreciate its style of humor your experience may differ drastically from the intended audiences.The Stick of Truth picks up shortly after the trilogy events of Season 17.  After an initial character creation screen you wake up as “the new kid” in South Park. Upon leaving your house, you'll befriend your neighbor, Butters, and venture on over to Cartman's house where he and Kenny, along with an ensemble of South Park regulars, are role-playing as a warring fantasy faction of humans that guard a sacred relic known as the Stick of Truth.  After a brief introduction and Cartman honoring you with a chosen name his kingdom is assaulted by a band of elves who manage to steal the holy object.  As in typical South Park fashion, the small and insignificant somehow manages to eventually involve the whole town and powers beyond as the story snowballs you through the town's workings, aliens, government interference, and of course... Nazi zombies. One thing that's blatantly obvious from early on is that this isn't cable television's South Park.  This is a humor much more akin to the 1999 South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, except on steroids and about 15 hours long, which is relatively short for a game of this genre.  Much of the humor is crude and meant to be insulting, but fans of the show will find it quite satisfying. The South Park writers were really on their A game and the show makes constant references to its own history, from every single piece of junk you pick up to who or what is in each of the boy's closets.  The amount of detail and respect this game has for the source material is really quite amazing. Its visual style makes you feel like you're actually playing the show and people walking by may not know the difference.  The game play involves you picking one of four classes, each with their own unique playing-styles. The combat plays out similarly to most JRPGs with a turn-based system that rewards timed button presses similar to Super Mario RPG.  You’re also able to choose one of six companions to follow you at different points of the game each with their own distinct abilities.  It's a streamlined but fun system that forces you to pay attention while you play, although its simplicity doesn't offer much in the way of a challenge.  Occasionally you'll also be presented opportunities in which combat can be avoided or reduced by taking advantage of the environment around the foe.  It's a great feature to have, as with most turn-based RPGs, combat isn't the high point and creates a nice rewarding dynamic when you see an opportunity to kill an enemy without direct confrontation.To offset the impressively accurate paper cut out visuals, Stick of Truth employs a very serious orchestral soundtrack.  You'll frequently be reminded of Game of Thrones and Skyrim while listening. Its contrast to the material creates a great comedic effect. The voice acting remains true to the show, with Matt and Trey supplying most of the voice work, often with the same voices for different characters, with the Nazi's having an effectively hilarious voice track.While the content provided is an impressive representation of South Park, its accuracy raises the expectations enough so that when something from the series doesn't show up, it can be a bit disappointing. Some characters and locations are missing and one can’t help but think they were deliberately left out to allow for DLC and/or a sequel. South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game for people who appreciate the show or have a similar taste in humor.  It can be a bit polarizing but that's to be expected with a title such as this.  The writing is rich and full of references that fans will truly appreciate, but sometimes, as with the show some of the jokes can get old at times. Luckily however, there are enough jokes in this game to be thoroughly enjoyable throughout its somewhat brief duration. A relatively easy difficulty, and lack of post-game content and a somewhat questionable quest reward system, where you'll frequently get items well after they've had any use to you can cause a bit of tedium to set in. The gameplay holds its own, it doesn't do anything new or amazing but the charm that saturates every aspect of it makes it feel special. This is, hands down, the best South Park game ever made.  If you're looking for the definitive South Park experience, waiting for season 18 or just want to laugh, this is the game for you.TLDR? Here's a video my friend and I put together:

												I have never watched the TV show before so my review may be coming from a more unique perspective. This game is just a blast to play. The combat is simple and easy to master. The writing and dialogue is where the game really shines. There are so many times where I was cracking up by the absurdity of what was happening (Looking at you Al Gore). I know a lot of the jokes are from the TV show so any fan of the series will feel right at home. If you are new to the series like me, don't let that discourage you. I still enjoyed every second of this game regardless. That being said, the game is very raunchy so that may turn some people off. I didn't mind it as I found most of it funny, but there were times I had to turn the game volume down because it was getting so bad haha. This is more of a warning than a negative for those of you who are more easily offended. If you are then stay far, far, away (like maybe somewhere in Canada)! If you are on the fence then pick the game. You won't regret it :)			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Obsidian Entertainment, South Park Digital StudiosPublishers: UbisoftInitial release: March 2014Genre: Active turn based RPG#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationShort version: Adult Costume QuestLong version: South Park the Stick of Truth is a turn based RPG with surprising depth. Likely due to our friends over at Obsidian known for their RPG game prowess.Now, this game is not for people who are easily offended . I hope anyone taking the time to read this already knows what South Park is as I'm fairly certain South Park is a known commodity. Using cuss words is the base value. One of the enemies you fight during a main quest of the game is an aborted nazi zombie fetus Yes, they ago all the places. I don't think there is anywhere else to go. SETUPYou are the new kid in South Park and all your favorite characters are here. (voiced by the real actors of the show) As the new kid you are told by your parents to get out of your room by your parents and make some friends. You leave your home and are met by Butters and he introduces you to Cartman and the kingdom of humans. Calling themselves the Kingdom of Kupa Keep. Unfortunately this name has the acronym of KKK. Which is clearly the joke but I thought I'd mention it anyways. After meeting Cartman, you get to choose 1 of 4 classes to play as; Mage, Warrior, Thief, or Jew. I played as a thief and as far as I can tell the only thing this effects is the equipment awarded at specific stages in the game and of course your special abilities. Upon choosing your class and getting a basic tutorial of how combat works you are told about the Stick of Truth and the LARP'ing begins. Though as you may have suspected, its not all fun and games. Things take a pretty serious turn even given South Parks satirical nature. GAMEPLAYThis borrows from the likes of Paper Mario and the newer Costume Quest. Turn-based combat while timing button presses to, on defense mitigate the amount of damage taken and on offense, increase the damage or in some cases hit at all. Your character has abilities based on your class which have specific interactions in order to be the most effective. There are also summons which you can earn from completing side quests. Each weapon is different, the effects as well as the way it attacks. Same goes for equipment. A nice touch is that there is no restrictions for class on clothing or weapons but it kind of breaks the role-playing bit, at least in my opinion.In The Stick of Truth you can customize your appearance; however it seems to not be entirely important as you can change your appearance with wigs, makeup and a number of other items that are available in the game. You cannot play as a female as there is a narrative reason why this is not an option. The game is surprisingly open world, not in the sense of being able to truly influence the world in the way you see fit (the narrative is very concise and pulls you toward the end regardless) but it allows you do side quests and actually rewards you for exploring. I remember multiple times having gone into someones house or down a sewer pipe on a whim and being given multiple new quests to complete as well as finding many new items I would have never found otherwise. THE GISTGreat fun little RPG especially if you already like South Park. To be honest I don't watch the show regularly but I was familiar enough to know all the main characters and even some of the obscure ones. But I'd guess even knowing nothing going in its still very easy to follow. I'm sure I missed some of the deep cuts of fan-service but the jokes stand on their own regardless.Follow my curation for more "

												 Much like the beloved TV show, South Park: The Stick of Truth is ridiculous, over-the-top, and crude. South Park has taken its shots at the world of video games before, but never with this kind of reverence. At the same time, the game is a celebration of seventeen seasons of the show, drawing references from fan favorites across the entire span of its run. Amazingly enough, the South Park stuff aside, it's actually a really good RPG as well.South Park: The Stick of Truth puts players in the role of the new kid in town. He and his parents just moved to the quiet, Colorado mountain town in order to get away from some bad thing that happened that he has conveniently forgotten about. After being shooed out the door by his parents and told to go make some friends, he discovers that the children of the town are embroiled in what has to be the most amazing LARPing session of all time, all to decide who controls the miraculous Stick of Truth, which gives its bearer control over the universe. He naturally gets drawn into the game, but behind the scenes, the weirdness of South Park is at an all time high. Aliens, secret government organizations, underpants gnomes, nazis, zombies, nazi zombies, and Al Gore all threaten to bring the town to the brink of destruction, unless the new kid can become cool.It should come as no surprise that Stick of Truth looks and feels just like an episode of South Park. The game begins with a terrific character customizer that allows players to generate their own nine-year old kid in the South Park style. Some players may be disappointed to learn that only male characters can be created, but there are story reasons for this, and rest assured, the girls of South Park get their day in the sun as well. Similar to Fallout 3, the appearance of the new kid determines the appearance of his parents as well. The town of South Park has been faithfully recreated, including the vast majority of landmarks seen throughout the show's seventeen-season run, including Jimbo's Guns, Skeeter's Bar, City Wok, South Park Elementary, City Hall, and even Canada. The story possesses unique elements, but also draws from the show's history for events, side quests, and even the miscellaneous junk items.Of course, exploring South Park isn't as easy as it looks. There are a number of places the new kid won't be able to get to, at least not right away. There are locked doors that require keys to open, and rooftops and small spaces that require special abilities to access. In fact, the interactivity of the environment is one of the game's strongest aspects, and even plays a role in combat. By using the various special abilities at the new kid's disposal, as well as the special abilities of his friends, players can find multiple routes through the game's areas, and even make combat easier by defeating enemies beforehand, sometimes in surprisingly ridiculous ways. Stick of Truth's combat involves simple but engaging turn-based battles reminiscent of the Paper Mario series. Near the beginning of the game, players can choose one of four classes — the fighter, the mage, the thief, and the jew — and each class has its own special skillset. Each class learns five special moves that can be used by consuming power points, and can spend points earned each level to upgrade their power. In addition, the new kid can also summon powerful beings like Jesus and Mr. Slave to assist in battle, and harness the magical power of... his farts. He can also bring a single ally into battle, though they can be switched out on the fly at the cost of a single turn.Once battle begins, combat takes place turn by turn, ""just like in medieval times."" The new kid and his ally can perform one healing ability and one attack ability each turn. All attack skills require some sort of timed button input to perform effectively, though they are mostly very easy to perform, and the ones that require a bit more finesse are still plenty powerful even if the player fails. Unfortunately, the game tends to be rather easy most of the time. This is partly compounded by the ease of which players can gain experience. The game caps out at level fifteen, and if players are ardent about completing side quests and exploring the town, the new kid will reach this cap well before the end of the game. The game is much more challenging in the first few hours than it is later on, despite an adjustable difficulty setting. That said, the ease of play is still dictated by successfully performing attacks in combat, and a string of bad inputs can quickly change the tide, right up until the end of the game.Players can also collect a huge assortment of weapons, armor, augmentation items, and accessories like wigs, make-up, and glasses to further customize their character. The number of customization options are mind-boggling, so players should have no trouble making their character their own. Players can also get permanent passive bonuses to various combat functions by earning perks. Perks are earned by gaining facebook friends in the town. One of the most surprisingly excellent aspects of South Park: The Stick of Truth is its audio. The fantastic voice talents of Trey Parker and Matt Stone are certainly wonderful on their own, but an even greater surprise is the music. Not only are there some terrific orchestral pieces that help set the tone, the game is filled to the brim with the goofier songs from the series' history, often playing on radios scattered throughout the town or during particular battle sequences. Some players may wish to be cautious, however, as even by South Park standards, Stick of Truth is particularly crude. Not since the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut has South Park pushed the boundaries of good taste as far as they have here. Players will engage in battle beneath the bodies of two people making sweet, sweet love, perform an abortion, and delve deep inside a man's ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are alien anal probes and just about every bodily function imaginable, and anyone who is even remotely offendable should stay far, far away.The best thing about South Park: The Stick of Truth is the little things that help bring the town to life. Fans of South Park are definitely not going to be disappointed, and fans of RPGs won't be either. Although the game is fairly short, the quality of the experience is undeniable, and the humor and multiple classes give it a fair bit of replayability as well. And as Obsidian games go, it's also one of the most stable. I didn't encounter a single issue. It took a while to get here, but the wait was well worth it: South Park: The Stick of Truth is sweet.

												South™ Park™: The™ Stick™ of™ Truth™ (tm.)™ is one of the best licensed-property games I have ever played, though it's not without its faults.Let's start with the good stuff. For fans of the show, it's hard to imagine a better use of the license. The designers didn't play it safe and crap out a generic game just to cash in. They took a great hook that was already built into the show (the kids of South Park™ live role-playing RPG-style) and ran with it. This is not a hard-core 100+ hour type of RPG, nor should it have been. Instead, it employs a more simplified style that requires timed button presses for attacks and defense. As a reference point, the gameplay is very similar to the ""Mario & Luigi""™ RPGs. This is not only a very good thing, but it also perfectly serves the source material. So while the ""RPG"" aspects of the game are not particularly hardcore, there is just enough depth to keep it (mostly) interesting throughout. What really take the game to a higher level are the production values. The game itself looks and sounds exactly like the newer HD episodes of the series. Just about every character you could possibly care about makes an appearance, and they're all voiced and written exactly as you would expect. Absolutely no corners were cut in this department - the game really makes you feel as if you are in South Park™, interacting with its characters. The story is also exactly what you would expect out of South Park™. Although the basic premise is very simple - the boys fighting over an ordinary stick™ - the story ultimately progresses in ways you could never have imagined (or perhaps you can, if you've watched enough of the series over the years). The dialogue and voice acting are excellent, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments from beginning to end. There are also tons of obscure references and cameos throughout, seemingly for no other purpose than to make the most hard-core fans chuckle. The whole game really is just a huge South Park™ love fest. In terms of difficulty, the default setting is fine, if a bit on the easy side. If you want more (or less) of a challenge, you can change the difficulty at any point, which is a great feature that should allow anyone to complete it if they put in the time.Unfortunately, along with all of the things that make the game good, there are also a few low points. Several sections involve slightly complicated ""quick time events"" (not exactly in the traditional sense, but used here for lack of a better term). Setting aside the fact that these sections seem randomly out of place in an otherwise good game, the real issue is that they just aren't implemented well. The tutorials for each action are executed poorly, which can be frustrating if you don't pick up on what the game is asking you to do, exactly. Another low point comes towards the latter portion of the game, which involves a series of ""fetch-quests"". While I am sure the intent of this section was to lampoon this tired video game trope, they succeeded a little too much, as it started to get fairly tedious. It also didn't help that at this point in the game, I had already maxed out my character's level, so there was really nothing else to strive for, in an ""RPG"" sense. It would have been nice if there was no level cap, with enemies scaled to your strength (or something along those lines). Lastly, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, but apparently there are several collectibles that can be missed if you don't get them the first time through - just a warning to those who enjoy collecting things or 100%-ing games.Overall, my annoyances with the game are fairly minor in comparison to all of the things I enjoyed. If you are a huge South Park™ fan, I think this is a no-brainer. The amount of care that went into making it is readily apparent, and worthy of your money (at least, now that it's only $40 - the original $60 price point was way too much). In terms of length, it's hard for me to estimate, but I would say it will probably take you anywhere from 11-18 hours, depending on how deliberate/OCD you are. It's really hard for me to imagine a South Park™ game ever being done better than this. Needless to say, non-fans should stay away. But for anyone else (assuming you can get into the simple RPG gameplay), it's definitely worth checking out at some point.			"

												Having just finished this game I can definitely say I highly recommend it. You will really love the cutscenes and story if you are a South Park fan, and the game is pretty fun too.Pros:Great cutscenes, lots of jokes and lots of easter eggs from South Park. Most south park characters will make an appearance in the game and it's always a good chuckle. This game is really like an extra long episode or even a second movie.Fun gameplay. In this game you do three things, you fight enemies in small turn based battles that are kind of like pokemon, the battles sound like they would be boring but they are actually quite fun since you have to use the right moves and need to time them perfectly. The second thing you do is explore south park searching for treasure, collectibles or easter eggs. Lastly you customise your character (a new kid to South Park) and dress him up in funny costums or with weapons and weapon patches that come with different bonuses.Battles are much better than you would expect, the battles are turn based and are very fun. You can use ranged weapons, melee weapons, magic (farts) or special abilities. You can set your enemis on fire, stun them, gross them out and send them to sleep. My favourite attack in the game is the Roshambo where you kick your enemy in the nuts! You also have companions with their own special abilities and playstyle.The story is also good. In the beginning you are playing a pretend fantasy game and all the boys in South Park are on one side or the other but later you need to fight a much bigger threat to the town. The fact that you start out playing a game within a game is pretty funny and the characters often reference it. The game is very well paced. It takes place over about 4 days, during the day time you do missions for the South park boys but at night time you do these huge boss missions. The game doesn't get boring and neither does the story as it quickly progresses. Certain secret areas of South Park also become avaliabe as you progress so you never really stop exploring.Style. The art style of the game is very good. It looks exactly like South Park does. Cutscenes are indistinguishable from South Park and the mini cutscenes for each character's special ability are very well done. The UI in batles looks nice and is easy to understand, as is the ingame menu where you customise your inventory, abilities and perks.Cons: The humour of the game is the same as South Park, it's very crude and vulgar. If (like me) you love South Park then you will love that kind of humour. But if you are not a South Park fan or have never watched it you might not enjoy the humour.Sometimes the objectives of missions aren't very well explained and you sometimes become lost when you don't know what to do, meaning that you have to google search the answer.The game is quite short and you should expect to finish it in a few days. I completed pretty much everything there is to do in the game in about 15 hours. I don't know if that is worth €30 so you should wait to pick it up on sale. (That's what I did and I got it for €7, which is great value).  "

												Stick of Truth is just one huge love letter to South Park, filled to the brim with references to things from throughout the show's run. The gameplay is like Paper Mario and while its not really challenging most of the time its still quite fun. Obsidian really outdid themselves and anybody who's ever liked South Park should play it because its an amusing ride.			"

												Simply one of the most amazing south park games ever made, simply the best, great story, good gameplay, you can see and meet all the characters from the tv series and you can feel that you are in the show as wellthe bad thing is that the German and Australian version are censored, but this can be fixed with the patch that will disable the censor from the game and you can enjoy it without seeing black squares covering the freaking nazi flag on the zombies, you'll also be able to play alien part without censor and hear the nazi zombies screaming in german as well xDanother bad thing is that the game doesn't allow you to pick gender, it automatically give you a boy gender, yes you can dress your character as w/e you want but is not the same.if you are a fan of the tv series, this is a game you must have, if you're not a fan, this is a game you must have xD because it will make you want more and you'll be a fan of the show :3if you see this game on sale or you have $40, you must buy it, i can assure you wont lost your money.

												This is definitely a game that is made for South Park fans.  Even though the game is rather short, has little variety in the player classes and is light on RPG mechanics, these shortcomings are more than made-up with the very well-written story, excellent voice acting, well-timed satire and faithfulness to the TV series.  I would have to say this game is among the best license adaptations I have ever seen.If you are not a South Park fan, easily disgusted or offended, or are looking for a deep RPG experience then you may want to wait for a sale or pass on this one.  If you are a fan of the series this is a must-have experience that cannot be missed.On a final note, this game is also the definitive Fart Simulator.  Be ready to FART. ON. EVERYTHING.			"

												Best movie license game I've ever played. I love it. The turn based RPG system fits so well with the animation. This is the game that south park fans deserve. I'll go over the positive aspects and the negative aspects. Positive:-This game is incredibly funny. It's raunchy and dirty sense of humor fits me so well. I love it. However, if you are not into that kind of humor, this game will not appeal to you.-The turned based combat would sound bad, and boring... But it actually has you involved. You don't just choose a move and then watch it play out. It's kind of like the Mario rpg games, where you have to put in some sort of actions to make a ""Perfect"" hit. The combat is also fairly fleshed out. There are status effects that can be inflicted on enemies. Also the unique ways each buddy can be used to suit your play style. You can even use the enviroment outside of combat using your abilities you get, such as your fart magic, and an anal alien probe. Skipping combat completely, but getting the experience.-Plenty to explore, and has some replayability. Although I never completed it after doing it twice.-It is creatively written. The story line is fantastic. Which it should be, being written by the developers of the show themself.-Due to the kids larping, it makes some creative items. You can literally take a crap in a toilet, and throw it at an enemy to gross them out.-The story line and all side missions can give you around... 20 hours, even more if you want to replay it.Negative: The negative aspects are just me nit picking a bit, but some of these can be an issue for others.-This game is for south park fans, and for people who are not easily offended. If you are not a south park fan? You might not enjoy this game, and not get most of the jokes. -The game is too easy on the default difficulty, and even on hard mode, it can be easy. I've found myself never losing a single battle when you follow the story line.-20 hours is a VERY short rpg game, when it ends, you just want more!!			"

												Hilarious, Disguisting, Epic. Those are the only three words I can describe this great game.The new kid is in town and is invited to Cartman's Human army. The stick of truth is stolen and must be retrieved but little did he know that his adventure is about to get even more epic as he retrieves the stick back from the elves. What went from just a kids imaginary war game to even something bigger was beyond anyone's comprehension.I beat the game in 15.6 hours finding almost every single sidequest of finding stuff and doing endgame bosses. There wasn't much after the game was done and was short on end game content but for the 15.6 hours of hilarity it was worth it along with collecting mini sidequests and other small sidequests. The voice acting is straight from the show, you'll feel like you're a part of the show. The music is also very well done and fits the game really nicely.The gameplay is quite unique for it isn't just your usual rpg where you click a command and wait for your character to attack, you'll be doing attacks from mashing certain buttons, or pressing certain buttons in a certain order to execute skill abilities. Also the battle engine requires you to press something when a key symbol, shape, or color is seen.You'll be picking from 4 classes, The Fighter, Mage, Thief, and Jew. Each with thier very own unique perks and abilities which makes it really fun.  The downside is there isn't really any stats to be messed with for your character. You'll basically outfit your character with gear which you can modify with patches on them granting you stats on each piece of your equipment. You can be literally anything you want by the end of the game and by that you'll be super powerful even in the hardest mode. Which I found is a - for me since the game only has 15 levels and it gets really easy to horde items and be all powerful making the game really easy even though the mobs sorta levels with you.Instead of a party of characters you have to manage you'll be playing with only one other buddy from southpark, There is a little variety of buddies you can pick from in your group but you can only switch them in and out of combat and also during combat when needed. Each with thier own attack + abilties but uncustomizable in any way or form. They level with you. This can get repetitive at time early on until you get buddies to join you.The story from the beginning to end is hilarious and can get quite disguisting at some points. Try not to get too offended since these are only jokes to touch you. You'll also see and hear tons of pop reference from games and movies.Anyways the game was Epic and the ending was quite Epic and this is a game truly for those who are hardcore South Park fans. If you enjoy South Park jokes you'll also love this game, it is quite well done. You'll also like it if you just want some laughs.+15 or so hours of one giant pack show.+Of course voice acting is spot on!+Hilarious+Animation is exactly like being part of the show in fact looks even crispier!+The battle system is pretty fun and epic at times depending on the moves.+The epic nonsense of a story flowed REALLY well lol.+Great music+- South park jokes, if you don't enjoy them you won't like this game.+- Some parts will gross people out.- Not much replayability since all you can do is choose different class or pick a different branch in the story which doesn't really change the path in anyways since it all comes together the same.- Battle can get repetitive- Not much customization, gear based game with item buffs.- More end game content would been nice.

												NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit  RealGamerReviews[realgamerreviews.com]BackgroundIt’s often said that licensed games usually don’t carry a lot of quality. Unfortunately, we live in an age where many good video games have such huge budgets that developers and publishers aren’t willing to take a risk on a new franchise, instead churning out poorly-made games based on franchises and preying on the fans of the franchise. This is not one of those cases. Though it had a somewhat tumultuous development cycle, the end product is a fantastic representation of everything that’s great about the South Park series. If you’re a fan of the series, or at least its style of humour, this is a no-brainer. For others that have never been impressed with the juvenile and tasteless jokes ubiquitous throughout the South Park universe, I’d recommend that you avoid this title. This isn’t because the gameplay can’t hold a candle on its own – It can, and it was a fun romp in its own right. It’s more that the developers spent so much effort on building the perfect South Park game and added as many of their well-renowned politically incorrect humour that it becomes unavoidable if it isn’t your thing. StorylineThe game begins with you, (“D-bag”) and your parents moving into South Park, Colorado. You’re then tasked with making friends in the new town, which isn't easy given that your protagonist is mysteriously silent throughout the game. Before long, you’ll find yourself involved in a real-life role playing game with the other kids in South Park. There are two factions – The humans, led by Cartman, and the elves, led by Kyle. Both factions fight over a stick – the titular Stick of Truth, which supposedly possesses the power to control the universe. Throughout your journey, you’ll encounter numerous (and often ridiculous) obstacles and hazards and meet a tonne of infamous characters from the South Park franchise and an even greater number of references to events that have occurred in the TV show.Fans of the series who have seen the South Park episode “The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers” will find the setting very familiar. As in the episode, the characters don costumes representing their class and/or position (including a cross-dressing princess Kenny) and are deeply engrossed in their roles, but they do occasionally have to break out of character in order to satisfy their real-life commitments, which more often than not involves the parents telling them that it’s time for bed. GameplayThe game itself resembles other turn-based, quick time event (QTE)-heavy RPGs such as Paper Mario and the dreaded Costume Quest. Battles aren’t random, but rather are usually initiated by walking into an enemy. During each battle, you’re given a party of up to two characters (your main character and a character that you can choose and switch between). Each character has its own unique set of attacks and abilities. For each action that you choose, there’s an associated QTE action that you have to perform perfectly in order to maximise the effect. This often includes pressing a certain button at some point in time, mashing another button, spinning the left control stick or some combination of the above. Unlike in Costume Quest where the timing of these was very lenient and forgiving even if you happened to miss it, The Stick of Truth requires you to be on your toes. The window of opportunity for pressing these buttons is fairly strict, and the consequences of missing button sequence can lead to severe consequences. For example, one of Kenny’s special abilities involves him calling a horde of rats. Once the rats appear, you’re required to rapidly and repeatedly pull your left control stick to the left and right. If you succeed, the rats swarm your enemies for significant amount of damage. Should you fail however, the rats will literally eat Kenny alive. When it’s your opponents turn to attack, you’re once again given a small window to press a button in order to defend their attack, which results in reduced damage or prevention of a negative status effect. Overall, actively pressing buttons at the correct time matters in this game, which adds a level of intensity to every battle. It’s a fantastic combat system that forces the player to be actively involved, rather than continuously mashing a single button and hoping for the best. Whist outside of battles, your character is freely able to roam around South Park, gathering quests and looking for loot (equipment, potions, cosmetic items or junk to sell), collectables (i.e. Chinpokomon) and even more friends to add to Facebook, which helps to unlock perks which will assist you in battle. Completing side quests usually rewards you with equipment, friends or even “summons” that you can call to battle when things get rough. The Mr. Slave summon ability literally causes him to violently shove an enemy up his butt for impressive, but disturbing results. The game also gives you access to certain abilities that you can use to solve simple puzzles that are strewn across the game. Whilst some of these puzzles have to be solved in order to progress, many of these merely offer you an easier way to deal with enemies without actually fighting them in battle. If there’s a rock sitting on a ledge above your enemy, you can shoot it with a slingshot and have it drop on your enemies, which avoids the necessity of combat entirely. There are many more examples of manipulating the environment in order to gain an advantage or avoid combat entirely, but I'd hate to spoil the fun of discovering these for yourself. Overall, it’s a very refreshing and unique mechanic that’s highly welcome in a game where things may otherwise get stale.PresentationVisually, the game beautifully replicates the aesthetic that the show is famous for. It’s not mindblowing by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s just the way any fan of the show would want it to look.More importantly, the developers, in conjunction with the creators of South Park, have done a wonderful job replicating the world of South Park.  Every building in town can be entered and interacted with. The game is chock-full of characters and/or references to characters or events from the series. The voice-acting is on-point, with the original voice actors of the show providing the voices of the characters. Characters have context-sensitive remarks. If Cartman is in your party and you walk into Kyle’s house, you bet he’ll mutter something about Jews and/or make a derogatory remark regarding Kyle’s mother. Ultimately, the game does a tremendous job at making you feel like you’re a part of the world that is South Park, and fans of the show really couldn’t ask for anything more than that. With that said, if you’re not a fan of the show or think it’s too vulgar, please turn away now. This game pulled no punches in vulgarity, and even as a long-time fan of the show, there are certain segments that I think are a little bit too disturbing or distasteful. Your mileage may vary.OverallAfter numerous delays, I’m happy to say South Park: The Stick of Truth is a tremendous title that successfully replicates both the humour and personality of the show, whilst providing a refined, tightly-controlled and satisfying combat system to boot. Whilst it's a solid game in its own right, your enjoyment of the overall experience will be very heavily influenced by just how much the humour that the show is famous for actually appeals to you. As a result, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that hates the show, but would recommend it without questin to anyone that is a fan.			"

For South Park fans a MUST PLAY gameThe intention of the creators was simple - it must be essentially playable southpark tv show. And they did it. It is all there - the jokes, the absurdities, simply all that we love about the show. Since it is an essentially a playable episode of South Park, it has the absolutely amazing story that drives you through the game. But the game isnt just the story, it is also the fine RPG system and the turn-based Heroes like battles. You (your character) choose a class at the game beginning (most definetly choose to play as Jew :D ) level up, gain and equip new armors and weapons and battle along chosen, our favourite and beloved characters from the tv show. Each character has his own special abilities, weapons so there is an level of ""strategy"" to your fights. Enough said. NAGASAKI FART!!! GOOD things:  Essentially interactive South Park Episode = typical jokes Quite long story = i think that without the achievement hunting it took me 20h Casual - Easy to play, no hardcore skill to learn BAD things:  Not everybody likes South Park, i guess they might think the game is as stupid as the show "

												Great game built on some smart ideas. So you play as a bunch of kids, who play a live-action RPG, which becomes a cRPG in your hands. But as the kids' play turns out not to be just a game, your game turns into cRPG and gaming parody, posing reflexions (among tons of fun) on how ""being a kid"" relates to games and play. Brilliant.Also, I got interested in South Park thanks to this game. Didn't even know the names of the boys before playing it.			"

												Take the role of the New Kid and save South Park from its near destruction!If you like South Park or if you simply want to relax and play a simple but effective game, do not hesitate.Is it worth the price? Maybe not, get it cheaper if you can. But what I can say, is that this is a must-play.This game should be played for the South Park mood, feel and humor obviously, and not for its RPG side, which is a parody anyway.PLAY IT!			"

												Honestly being someone who doesn't really watch South Park, I was kind of skeptical on purchasing the game. During the Autumn Sale I decited to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised.Playing the stick of truth kind of reminds me of games like Chrono Trigger, and as anyone of my friends know, I love me some Chrono Trigger. Positives- First off the game is full of personality, which is almost absent in modern gaming.- It's like an episode of South Park in an 13-20 hour game, and it's always finding a way to make you smile and chuckle, and some stuff just had me lol like crazy. Course it's using offensive humor to make you laugh, and it does it without mercy, and it's genious.- Combat is fluid, and it does a good job on making you want to plan out how are going to take down the opponent.The only real negitive I can think about is that I wish there was a way to obtain goods in a better fashion, if you didn't stock up eariler before you can't turn back, which will more then likely happen during your first playthrough you might be in a pickle.During the entire bedroom sequence it took me a good while to get out of there because I was un-prepared and I had to go into every fight with no healing items. Sure you could say that it was my fault, but how was I suppose to know about the underware gnomes and what they will do to you.Overall South Park Stick of Truth is a great RPG and a great game in general, if your looking for a solid RPG and something  that will make you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off. This is a worth while purchase.I'll give it a  9 out of 10. A great expirience from begining to end. "

Environment (5/5) - Right from the start of the game, you'll already have the South Park feeling, especially if you're a fan. All graphics and details are made just like in the series, and that is totally awesome. As if you're just watching another episode of South Park, but this time you get to be part of it as the 'New Kid'.Controls (5/5) - Nothing much to say here, but nothing game breaking bugs so far. Gameplay (5/5) - If you're not aware yet, this game is a JRPG-like game. And I'll be honest, of all my time playing computer games, I never had that much 'fun' playing these type of games. But this one is truly an exception.Entertainment (4.7/5) - Another confession... I HAVE NEVER EVER WATCHED A SOUTH PARK SERIES NOT UNTIL I PLAYED THIS GAME. But given that circumstance, I gave this game a try. And I didn't regret my decision at all. The dialogues are perfect, again, its just as if you were watching the show! And probably what made me like this game, would also be the dark humor/comedy. But you're probably wondering why its not 5/5 instead, right? It's because I wanted more. :(Replayability (3/5) - You have probably seen my hours played on this game... But anyway, I gave it a 3/5 because it isn't really necessary, only a few lines would be changed upon choosing other options passages throughout the game. If you're an achievement hunter, you'll be replaying this quite a few times. So you better back up those saves, because there's no point of return or replay other than the save that you have.Conclusion (4.5/5) - I totally recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a fan or not. Who knows? You might become one after playing this game. P.S. I've watched it from Season 1 to Season 17, can't wait for the next one! \m/NOTE: I idled the game for quite too long, resulting the hours played now. XD  Criteria Score   Environment 5/5   Controls 5/5   Gameplay 5/5   Entertainment 4.7/5   Replayability 3/5   Conclusion 4.5/5 "

												This game is Oustanding. My first thought was, What?! $60 for a game about poop jokes? But No, I haven't had this much fun in an RPG since the Original Pokemon, and that's what this game keeps reminding me of, with the added fun of the ENTIRE South Park universe. EVERYTHING IS HERE, everything from Tom's Rhinoplasty, to Al Gore hiding in the Bushes. Every line of Dialogue brings a chuckle after another, and It's all done right.The Combat is turn based, and s executed in a fun and engaging way, there is no waiting for the enemy to take their turn, you're constantly engaged with attempting to block enemy attacks and countering.For the first hour I just looked through Cartmans house, Played the ""taking a **** minigame, then playing with his moms ****Literally Skyrim+Pokemon= This game			"

Ok, so as a headline, just DO NOT HESITATE. Just buy this game!South Park: The Stick of Truth is a single-player adventure game and also a must play all at once. The diversity of the missions you get to have are amazing and the humor is even better than it is in the TV show! You do not need to watch South Park in order to play this and it will not gather you any possible spoilers upon the show. This game is a piece of art, a funny adiction and one of the best games I have ever played! (and yea, I played couple of 'em).			"

												This game is a blast! True to the show, great humour. You can be a Jew, and get various powers and magical spells of farting, to help you go on quests through space, time, sewers and intestines. It's an unique expirience. My personal favourite is being killed by exploding nazi zombie cows. The ending of the game is spectacular. Worth the time, worth the money, get it. Recommended.			"

												THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE....I want to get that clear because negitive reviews of this game all say ""i dont know what is going on?"" or ""this game is so inapporpiate?"" or even ""who are these characters, there is back story to them?"" I am not kidding i have seen that last one multiple times. If you are not a fan of South Park the TV show, do not and i repeate DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! You will have no idea why this game was made and who the characters are and what the items are that you find along the way. I have seen almost every South Park episode made, which is why i love this game so much. The comedy and lines are exactly the same as what would be said in the show, Cartman is still just as big of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as always, and Kyle is still the smart♥♥♥♥♥know it all. This game did a lot of things right, but the biggest was the setting. They made the setting exactlyyyyy like what it would be if it were a real episode. The next thing done right is the combat. It is just fun as hell, you dont get sick of it at any point and by the end of the game you are a baddass ♥♥♥♥ing everyone up. For some that may not seem like fun, butto me it is beacuse to me the learnign curve at the beginning of the game makes you wish you were a bad♥♥♥♥♥\Next the story, to me the story is a lot of fun. Not perfecty, but absolutely enjoyable every moment. What i love the most is the games story is like a long episode of South Park itslef. Like everything done is exactly the same as what would be done in an episode. But this game is not perfect, to me i wish there were more side missions, by level 6 or so i had already beaten every side mission, which was sad. Also i wish the level cap was higher than 15, maybe more around 20 would have been better in my opinion. Last the story is a little on the shorter side. Around 8 hours for most probably, which isnt bad, but i think 15 hours would have made the story perfect.With that all being said this game is still amazing and well worth the money IF YOU ARE A SOUTH PARK FAN. If you are not then this game is not for you.			"

Product received for free
South Park: The Stick of Truth is a turned-based RPG. As the new kid in South Park, you get involved in a LARP opposing Cartman's Humans against Kyle's Elves, while the quiet little mountain town is place to events beyond what the kids anticipated.Pros: This is a South Park fan's heaven, filled with fan service from across all seasons, with almost every characters from the show making an appearance or being referenced at some level. Most loot are winks to episodes: a sarcastiball trophy, a shake weight, an Antonio Banderas love doll, an Okama Gamesphere, and hundreds more. If an episode reference wasn't in the loot, it's out there on display in a kid's room or closet. Every shop or radio play songs from the show (Chef, Jennifer Lopez, DVDA songs, you name it). Matt Stone and Trey Parker's very-involved participation shows everywhere: the voice acting, the politically incorrect script and often down right disgusting language, the humor and how it critiques society. You feel like you're an actual character in South Park, forth wall breaks saved by the fact that you're playing a game about playing a game, and the kids' play-pretend opens ""spells"" and ""attacks"" effects to completely crazy scenarios. Graphically, it looks exactly like the show, nothing groundbreaking but exactly what you'd expect.Cons: The game is extremely basic with little depth in the mechanics, combat being a bare-bone turn-based system with timed button-pressing. You pick one of four unoriginal classes (""Jew"" is just a stand-in for the typical RPG ""monk"") with small skill trees each. You can equip up to 2 weapons and 3 pieces of armor, none of which are class-specific. Creating your own character in the South Park universe is unfortunately limited, most character customization will have to wait in-game for you to find wigs, face paint and armor dye, so that you finally have a character that looks like you want. The story is short with few complexity and relies strictly on its humor to keep it interesting. If you skip the exploration (something only fans will care for) and few optional sidequests, you'll probably be through the game within 10 hours.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your listIf you are not a fan of South Park, STAY AWAY! But if you are, this is an unquestionable must have. To the fan, it's a Season worth of content, jokes, running gags and nostalgia. If you have any interest in the sequel, South Park: The Fractured But Whole, you should start with this one first.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												After the steaming piles that were other games based off of TV series (Family Guy, Defiance, Walking Dead Survival Instincts, etc...) I was highly skeptical of this, especially after the loooonnnnngggggg delay.However, within the first 5 minutes of starting this up my skepticism was thrown right out the window.  This game is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!  I can't really think of any one thing that I can complain about.  If you have some money to burn, pick this up regardless of the price.  It's worth every single penny.VERDICT: PLAY IT, NOW!!!!!! "

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantasy-RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. It was released in March 2014. The game is set in South Park, where your family recently moved to South Park. You play as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who is instructed by his dad to make friends, which allows him to meet Butters and join the world of fantasy and the fight for the Stick of Truth. This review will cover the campaign, the gameplay, and the open-world aspect.  Campaign  South Park features a good campaign. The campaign is open-world and this involves main missions that advance the story and optional side-missions that do not overly amount to anything useful. I completed the game in roughly 14 hours, which most of this time was dedicated to the main missions. The overall campaign was beautifully constructed. It easily followed the atmosphere of the television show in which Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny are the protagonists. I also noticed that like any adaptation, the game tries to incorporate those memorable skits from the show into the game, such as the aliens invading South Park and Mr. Poo. Furthermore, the game uses comedy and humour to lighten the environment because the developers expertly created a serious-tone with the battle of the Stick of Truth. The comedy does not feel forced so it hits a nice medium for comedy and seriousness. For instance, during character selection you can choose between four classes that have different abilities. I ultimately went ''thief'' but when I would click Jew, Cartman would tell me ''I guess we can't be friends then'', which personally was hilarious. The missions individually are not repetitive and are not overly long because within a main mission there are smaller missions within, giving you constantly new objectives and new experiences with the game. South Park also features occasional choice-making that changes the narrative of the game in missions. I personally enjoyed the campaign and found barely any faults. As a moderate fan of South Park I expected wittiness and comedy and that delivered and I loved all of the characters. I did experience some negatives, particularly at the lack of explanation for useful abilities throughout the game, which made me have to google it or guess it a few times. I did feel as if the campaign dragged throughout the middle-portion, particularly when visiting Canada within the game.  Gameplay  The game features unique turn-based gameplay. I don't experience much turn-based gameplay in these sort of RPG games so I found it to be refreshing. The turn-based gameplay also incorporates effects. For instance, in one fight I had a burning boomerang and when I used it, it hurt the opponent but set them on fire so when they would attack me, they would lose a portion of their health. South Park has a variety of weapon abilities to improve your damage or versatility. Fights incorporate fourth grade humour. For instance, to restore a large amount of your health you would eat a box of cookies. If you wanted to get a speed boost, you would drink Tweek's coffee. These little things add to the overall South Park tone which I think improves the experience of the game. I also like the aspect of as you get stronger and gain levels, your enemies get stronger. This progressive system allows the game to become more difficult as it goes on and to better utilise more strategy to win fights, because it's better than a static system where enemies will always have the same health and abilities.   Open-World Aspect  South Park is an open-world game. So, the game beautifully showcases a South Park that includes Starks Pond, City Hall, Token's rich house, and Kenny's poor house. The map is very large and uses Timmy as fast-travel to help reduce the annoyingness of constant travel between one end of town and the other. There are very few locked houses but the majority of buildings can be entered, allowing you to search and find useful things and also grasp the geographical area of South Park. Therefore, I feel the use of open-world benefits the game because it allows the developers to incorporate more stuff from the show into the game.  Conclusion  South Park is a strong game. My review is not as in-depth as I would have preferred due to Steam's word limit but what I covered is the basis of it. You're playing an open-world South Park game that incorporates television show elements and character development into a fantasy setting. It features turn-based gameplay that incorporate 4th-grade humour to provide a better South Park feel to the game. It features geographical locations that resemble the show, which you can explore most areas. I personally felt it dragged in the middle-portion as all Ubisoft games do and provide a lack of tutorial throughout the game. I purchased this game for $7.49 on sale and if you're a moderate South Park fan, buy it on sale. But, if you really like South Park I totally recommend this at $33 because you get value out of it and have fun while playing it.  Rating  7.75/10  Pros  	- The atmosphere of South Park. 	- Storyline development.	- Comedy and humour.	- Unique fighting system.  Cons  	- Tends to drag at various portions throughout the game.	- Very forgettable side-missions.	- Rushed ending.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

-Quick Review-South Park: The Stick of Truth is an RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released in 2014. It's really like playing a series of South Park episodes in a video game format. Having Trey Parker as a writer and voice actor makes the game all the more authentic.-Detailed breakdown review-Disclaimer: this game (and the show) has earthy and shock humor, South Park is basically TRYING to offend you, and I wouldn't recommend it to most younger gamer's or anyone who is sensitive (...to political, religious, obscenities, cartoon nudity, fart jokes, you get the idea). Honestly I haven't even watched very many of the episodes but I have watched some.On that note though, think of this review as coming from someone from the outside. I kept having this sensations that there were a lot of in-jokes that I was missing out on, because I hadn't watched all the South Park Episodes. But that being said I still enjoyed the game as a whole, read on to see why.

A Screenshot of South Park™: The Stick of Truth™
By: Atratzu




Story: You play the game from the perspective of a silent protagonist who has moved to southpark to avoid.... something! You just overhear your parents talking about it, but you character is about as uninterested as possible. The dialogue is quite comical since your character doesn't speak and all the other characters acknowledge it.An example would be from the early dialogue in the game ""do you know why we moved here?"" *blank soulless stare* ""Honey, I don't think he remembers...."" ""Good! Now go out there and make friends, son.""Really the only type of interaction I had with the NPC's was by hitting them in the shins with my weapon, or farting in their general direction. (normally I wouldn't stoop to making French Knight - Monty Python jokes, but that one was too good to pass up. Also it's never stooping to make Monty Python jokes.)The story is surprisingly longer then I excepted, right when you're bringing one chapter to a close, you go home, go to bed, and wake up to find there's a whole new crisis to deal with. On that note the over all theme is that you're playing an ""imaginary"" (ish?) game with the south park kids. There are two factions, the humans and elfs, whom are at waring over the stick of truth.The whole inventory, equipment, quest log, etc, is all done like it's on social media, there are several hilarious jokes that revolving around this theme. Although I did feel a pang of guilt since I only check my own social media once a day and never touch it again. Maybe the game is presenting an allegory for our addition to social media? ......Or maybe I'm over thinking a comedy video game.Gameplay: The gameplay is solid; as usual the movement controls are my good old friends: ""WASD"", there are two active abilities you can use: you can toggle through all abilities with Q and E, and then use them with F and G. Or it's something like that, I kept getting them mixed up. I would be trying to throw a fart at a fire and instead throw a dodgeball or tell my companion to do something and butters would say ""Well that would be just silly"". DO WHAT I SAY BUTTERS!okay, So the controls aren't PERFECT for a keyboard and mouse, but it wasn't game breaking, just mildly annoying hearing butter talk back to me. (One does get the sensation it would be better to play with a controller though *cough cough cough*)When you first start up a new game you have different choices in difficulty. Being an avid middle-difficulty-man, I chose medium andddddd I think I under estimated my ability on this one, because towards the end of the game I found myself melting my enemies with my mighty mage spells.You have a choice between different classes: Fighter, Theif, Mage, and Jew. But you're not limited to your class, so you can set up your gear and build to let the mage focus on melee skills, range, etc. So yeah, I'll leave it like that, just think ""RPG customization builds"" and that sums it up pretty well.the combat is done in turn-based RPG style, where you execute specific actions depending on the attack. So for those that are unfamiliar with RPG-turn based combat, you select your attack/item/spell you > select your target > you do whatever action is required (for this example, right click when you see the flash effect) > you right click > you deal bonus damage or an effect. Next character attacks, and so on and so forth, and you keep going until everyone that stands against you is dirt napping. (I can't imagine this is a new concept to people, but if it is just ask in the comments and I'll map it out)


So Metal! - Combat Sample

Conclusion:As I've already said, the best way to describe South Park: The Stick of Truth, is ""It's South Park, as a video game"". If you don't like or at least understand South Park's background, this game will mostly be a loss on you.But as far as stories go, this one was amusing, and I feel that it was quite worthwhile playing through. And the gameplay was surprisingly solid, the theme amused me, the voices, music, and theme were completely authentic to the source material, I had no idea Trey Parker voiced so many of the characters!


You know, I think I prefer Canada in this game.

												I was not a big fan of South Park before this game. I had not seen the TV series and was completely new to the series. But The Stick of Truth blew me away. With fantastic writing and dialogues, this is one of the funniest games out there. The combat is somewhat difficult to understand with the blocking mechanic in a turn based battle, you soon get the hang of it. South Park : The Stick Of Truth is one of the best games I've ever played which is short but doesn't overcome it's stay. Brilliant.			"

												This game absolutely oozes flavor and character. It's undeniably and unequivically the best use of a television IP adapted into a game, hands down. The writing is spot on, and it's truly a love-letter to all long time South Park fans. There's so many references that even the most diehard fans will miss a few.What makes this game really amazing is that not only is the South Park lore respected so completely, it's that it's actually fun. The story pulls you in, and that's something I didn't expect. The RPG mechanics are solid - combat is never a bore or a chore, and it's pretty amazing to shove a kindergartner up your♥♥♥♥♥as Mr. Slave.How many other games can you say that it's fun to shove a kindergartner up your♥♥♥♥♥ That's what I thought. That's what makes this game unique, it's offensive and doesn't care. It's brash, and true to itself, and for that, I have to say I'm having a ton of fun. Some people have complained about the length only being 20 hours for the 60 dollar price tag, and I can only tell you that you're well-off ignoring them. Since when do we put an abitrary length measurement on fun? 20 hours of sensational bliss for 60 dollars beats 60 hours of somewhat-entertaining gameplay for 10 dollars, in my opinion.This is one of those games you actually remember at the end of the year.

												This was one of my favorite games in recent memory. What happens when you take the brilliance of Parker and Stone and pair it with the masterful skill of Obsidian Entertainment? This game.This is an RPG that features a more old school style combat system, where timing is as important as upgrades and buffs. Speaking of RPG, it in itself is simple and yet maximizes what it intended to accomplish, and your guy will be a bad ### by the end of the game. Speaking of your guy, if you DON'T name him ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", you aren't doing things properly, lolAnyway, playing through this game is basically like playing through an entire season of the TV show itself, with all the twists and turns a season might take. The town of South Park and all its inhabitants show up and are presented perfectly. The plot itself is also fairly well perfect, and I dare say that even if you aren't a fan of the show, you will still love this game.For me, this was easily a 10 out of 10. Cant recommend this one highly enough really.It's also worth noting that this game has a ton of replay value, not only for all the copious Easter Eggs, but also because the second playthrough will allow you choices that perhaps weren't available the first time around, and will also allow you to take different paths in the game as well (story choices, interactions, etc...) that have different consequences.

												If you like south park from TV, you should definitely buy this game, it feels like you are in the real south park.The way the people talk, how the act, and how they respond. But that is just one of the cool things about the game.You are a new kid in town, and your parents want you to make some friends, so you will go out and get friends in south park. there is a point where you need to choose by yourself, but wont spoil ofc. I really loved the game, the story is so weird, so stupid, but so freaking awesome <3. But i can say, its a little perverted. But as said, the game is worth the money!5/5 <3			"

												I’ve played your typical snow, lava, or water level but a rectal, yes rectal as in your butt, level has now completed every possible variation of level design. This is just one small over the top humor and craziness found in South Park. If you watch or have ever seen the show you know this is typical SP humor.In South Park you play as the silent new kid who just moved into town and are told to go outside and make friends. You meet Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, and a few others who are LARPing (Live Action Role-Playing) and playing as the humans. They ask you to join and help protect the Stick of Truth because whoever controls it can control the Universe. You start out fighting against the elves who are played by Stan, Kyle, and some other kids. Things just get even crazier though as you go onto fight aliens, bums, and Nazi zombies. Majority of the story takes place in South Park but will also see Canada and a spaceship along the way. The story is funny and enjoyable to go through. Especially if you love the South Park show.The game is a turn based RPG where you control a party of two but the option to switch one character with others who join you. When you pick your attack you try to hit the button at the right moment to get a perfect hit which can add a boost to the attack. Each character has one main weapon, melee or projectile, and magic attack except your character may do both melee and projectile. You can also do gaseous attacks which can explode or cause people to be grossed out.Throughout the game when you meet new people they will send you friend requests just like Facebook. After you become friends you will start seeing posts on your “Facebook” profile from them. These can be very funny and sometimes creepy. You also have many collectibles to find in the game like all the weapons and outfits. You can also try to locate all the Chinpokomon, which are SP’s parody of Pokémon in case you didn’t know. Hence the name.My only gripe with the game was it felt short and I would have loved many more hilarious side missions. Maybe we could get lucky and see some DLC or maybe even a sequel if it sells enough. The game was a blast to play and had a great story that had me laughing many times. If you enjoy South Park and are looking for some really good laughs or even disturbing images, some of these I can never forget, than this is the game for you to play. Bear Rating 9.5/10			"

												South Park: Stick of Truth is an adventure/rpg game with turn based combat. It looks and feels just like the cartoon it's based on. It has all the crude humour and maybe even more. You play as ""the new guy"". But you meet and group up with some of the familiar South Park kids like Cartman, Kenny and Butters etc. You can choose from 4 different classes, Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew.  If you are a fan of the show, this game is a must have. You might not get all the jokes if you haven't watched the show at all. However, even for people who aren't big fans of the show it's still a good game with some really neat ideas. For example using enviroment to take out enemies before the actual fight starts. There's also plenty of customization for weapons and armor or just your looks. The game is quite easy, so I suggest people to play difficulty set on hard.[Score: 85]			"

												Holy sh|t, what a ride.Obsidian hit every single mark and checkbox with this one. They hit the nail on its head, the plank on the jump, and the ball outta the park - and into space.Everything about the game is brilliant and so true to its origins that it's almost scary. More than anything, it feels like watching a marathon of all the best stuff the show has had to offer through the years. It's been a while since I saw any South Park episodes, but this game has convinced me to start watching the show again.I haven't laughed this hard and loud in what feels like forever - there where moments when I had to pause the game before continuing because my sides were hurting so much. I swear I had tears in my eyes at one point.Sure, the jokes may be hit and miss if you're not a fan of the show, but then again, why would you even have the game, or be interested in playing it? This is a gift to the fans and for my part, I loved every second of it. It put a big, fat smile on my face and wouldn't let go until my stomach had been churned to oblivion from so many insane pranks and jokes.I got this gifted, but would have been happy to pay full price for this South Park masterpiece. I see it has already Overwhelmingly Positive recommendations, both recent and old, and I just have to agree - this game is truly a gem and an absolute must if you have the slightest interest in South Park and its bizarre lore and inhabitants. Wholeheartedly recommended to every wizard, ranger, thief, druid, bard - and new kid around.			"

												This game is really funny even if you haven't seen South park series or completely never heard of it. You play as a nine years old kid who just moved in small american town called South Park and for some reason you can't speak, so everybody calls you New Kid. Your parents send you outside of house to make new friends and you will find out that kids split up in two factions elves and humans. They fight each other for the Stick of Truth because who holds it controls the universe, for some reason battles have rules, like you can use one potion and one attack per round and when you do, your enemy is on turn. Grand wizard Cartman asks you if you join his army and there the adventure begins. Prepare for that nobody will be spared, because South Park makes fun of everybody. 8/10Here's my favourite moment in the game. Small illustration.

												South Park the Stick of Truth is a game I was really hyped for. A game made by one of my favorite developers, Obsidian, working on a South Park game. Which has been a television show that hasn't really had a good game up until this one. The things Stick of Truth does that impress me the most are that it works as both an adaptation of South Park and as a game in it's own right. There was clearly a huge focus on authenticity, down to how the aesthetic near flawlessly mimics that of the show. It's clear Matt and Trey had a very noticeable hand in the game's development. All of the humor is spot-on with that of the television show. Where they not only try to satirize common video game cliches, but also take advantage of them to make a very competantly made rpg.When I said it worked as a game as well I wasn't lying. The game is a turn based rpg, and this was an extremely smart decision on Obsidian's part. Because of the turn based nature to the combat you can have humerous moments like Al Gore putting your cleric to sleep with a powerpoint presentation. They also have small real-time elements where you press a button to block and attack at certain moments. It all works so well and it's phenominal to see such an attention to detail in a licensed game.I'm extremely glad the game lived up to it's hype. There are very few flaws worth mentioning with Stick of Truth beyond maybe the lack of replayability. But it really is a game that appeals to fans of the television show and people who want a turn based RPG that succeeds in making you laugh.			"

Short version: 90%If you like South Park, you will love Stick of Truth. It combines the very essence of it with an old school role-playing game style into something that is practically an interactive version of the show. Long version:If you watch a Let’s Play of Stick of Truth, the only sign that tells it is not the actual show is the presence of a video game user interface. It is not surprising, since not only the full cast is here, but this also includes the show’s creators, who teamed up with industry veteran Obsidian to create something that may easily pass as half a season of the actual television show.Even the story is written like that. We start by playing a new kid in South Park, who quickly gets dragged into a live-action role-playing game of Cartman’s humans and Kyle’s elves warring for the eponymous Stick of Truth, where the kids just use a bunch of household items as their weapons (including the “magic” spells). As expected, their game not only functions as a social satire about xenophobia but also blows into something much bigger and crazier, involving aliens, nazi zombies, and betrayal from within.As a twist in the metagame, their make-believe war is turned into a classic style RPG for the player, where they can choose from a few classic Dungeons & Dragons classes—warrior, thief, mage, or Jew (monk)—so they can use those class-specific skills and equipment, or more universal traits and magic to dispatch their enemies in turn-based combat.Said combat is sadly the weak point of Stick of Truth, since the levelling system is unbalanced. The player is intentionally incredibly strong, but on higher levels enemies compensate by ridiculous amounts of armour stats, meaning if you don’t invest in armour-breaking skills, you are screwed—but if you do level up thing’s like the Mage’s starting fire skill, you stroll through the game unchallenged.Naturally, this should not prevent anyone from playing this gem, especially if they love South Park, but it is something they should expect if they come with some experience in cRPGs.

												You want a good laugh? Then get this game! Create your own character and become the New Kid who arrives in this little town called South Park. You can make friends with many characters and even fight with/against the popular ones. This RPG has turn-based combat, which I normally don't like so much, but in this game I do. Explore this open world to find funny side quests, fart on people, fight nazi-zombies, fart on even more people, summon Jesus, and finally: use your fart abilities to conquer your enemies in combat. It's a short game, but a very awesome one. I really recommend getting this game if you love South Park.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth, released in 2014 is a role-playing game, which puts you in the world of South Park. Gameplay feels like you are in an episode of Southpark, though combat is a little bit of a let down. You can play as one of several classes; Thief, Warrior, Mage or Jew, each with their own strengths. You can equip weapons and armor, change your hairstyle, add modifications to your gear, change your overall appearance and so forth. There is a lot of customization available within the game, though you can only play as a young boy. The game takes you through various locations familiar in South Park as you can explore the town. You also meet many of the familiar characters from the series throughout the game. They do a great job of making you feel like you are playing through an episode of the show and manage to find ways of ribbing just about every group out there, the same way the show does. I think if you are a fan of the show, you should give this game a try. The game is prefaced by a trilogy of episodes known as the ""Black Friday Trilogy"", including; Black Friday, A Song of♥♥♥♥♥and Fire, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and Dragons, all of which lead up to the timeline of the game. I recommend watching these episodes prior to playing the game so you have some context for the storyline.			"

												At its core, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a casual, story-driven RPG. More so than any other modern RPG, this game is driven on writing rather than any gameplay mechanics. And since this is South Park we're talking about, the writing consists of much shock humor and repeated WTF moments. In fact, I've come to accept that the game is so defined by its writing that any attempt at gameplay analysis is ultimately moot. Early on in my first playthrough, I thought I had discovered the optimal configuration of weapons, equipment and patches that would allow me to break the game wide open. Then I realized this was NOT Final Fantasy and such efforts were ultimately in vain. This is not a challenging game, even at Hardcore difficulty. The greatest mistake I made was searching the internet for that twelfth Timmy express flag and learning more than I wanted about the story. Whenever you read ahead, you lose the most important thing this game has to offer. There is little point in guides and walkthroughs in the first place. I suspect that Obsidian made it easy for you specifically so you don't feel the compulsion to search out secrets on the internet in the first place. On a second playthrough and for achievement purposes, sure! But it's not entirely inaccurate to call South Park: The Stick of Truth an extended interactive episode of South Park where you are the hero. Except that it prompts the question: who pays 40 bucks for an interactive movie? This is strictly a Steam Sale purchase; put it on your wishlist, avoid all spoilers and wait. So, is it funny? Well YMMV but on the whole I'd pretty much say yes. You don't have to be a South Park aficionado to appreciate the game and this is coming from someone who hates the politics of the series. The in-jokes are mostly relegated to the articles of vendor trash you pick up across your journey and without giving anything away, the humor mostly comes from trope lampshading, many instances of WTF, a dedicated fart button and boss fight music. I really, really wish you could do more with the combat system. There's a majority of enemy encounters that can be eliminated through clever interaction with the environment... but that just feels like cheating yourself out of more gaming content! You never have more than one party member at a time and can't even modify their stats/equipment, making for an extremely single character-centric RPG. Some people might have no patience for party management but this game is lacking in substance already, so any opportunity for customization would be welcome. I'd still recommend purchasing this game (20 bucks seems like a fair price) and experiencing it for yourself rather than following a Let's Play. There's plenty to discover in your small secluded mountain town and it's obvious that the developers spent a lot of time stuffing the whole place with secrets. South Park's distinctive ""cutout"" animation style and bright colors lends well to RPGs, making it easy to pick out which object you can interact with and the radial battle menu makes for clean, intuitive battles. Shallow as it is, South Park: The Stick of Truth makes for an accessible RPG.Just don't do like I did and buy the DLC. It's all level 2 equipment which you quickly outgrow into irrelevance. Speaking of which, I think it's relevant to say that the ""treasure location"" panel on the world map is bugged, just so you don't go wasting 20 minutes searching for nonexistent items. Apart from all that, you're fine.			"

												I am one of these players of this game that haven't whatched the serie so much before playing the game. But I enjoyed the game so much. The characters are so funny and are very precise to how they are in the serie (as far as I've seen.). The story is a fun and entertaining adventure you enjoy all the way through. Plus the side missions are so fun to do. I think that you should try the game if you get the chance. 30/30			"

												Let me start off by saying the following. This review is biased. I have been a fan of the show since I was little. (as it was against my parents rules to watch this show - so what does  kid do when he's told not to do something - he does it). I own multiple season of the show on dvd. And probably have seen every episode 5+ times (except episode 200 and 201, which I have only seen when it aired live).Story:I think the story to the game is marvelous. It brings characters you have seen throughout the show in the game (since they are part of the universe) and integrates each one of them into the story. Initially, the premise of role playing being brought back from Season 6 episode 13 - The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers. A continuation of our four favorite 4th graders and their adventures with magic, swordplay, archery, and of course flatulence.In turn, it introduces the new kid (you) into the story as you learn of the interactions between Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and of course the 5th wing - Butters. You make your way completing tasks as part of the human faction to raise and protect the stick of truth. Leads to a decisive will you side with Cartman or Kyle. The story then takes a turn for the worse when aliens are involved, green goo, Taco Bell. and of course The Government. As you work your way to finding the secret behind whats going on in South Park you find new powers and new facebook friends. Culminating all your work in a final battle for the Stick of Truth. (trying my best not to ruin this)I think the story did a good job integrating the characters, you, and like normal South Park's tendency to comment on society (in this case gaming society). The writing is that what you expect when Matt and Trey are involved in their characters game. And is an overall is great for avid fans and those who like the show but only watch when its on.Gameplay/Controls:I thought the turn based system worked well. ""Just like in Medieval Times"". I only had one issue with the controller and that was during the abortion jobs. However reverting to keyboard/mouse quickly corrected this and let me get past. Besides this I had no issues getting around south park, aiming my arrows and farts. Battles were pretty straight forward. Attack, do the button sequence suggested. You can use one item per character turn - straightforward. Sometimes finding items were sometimes difficult but if you explore anything can be found. On my first play through - I was able to find all friends, all costumes, and all weapons.Replayability.There are 4 different classes. Each play a little different. My first playthrough I played as fighter. I am currently replaying the game as a Jew. For me, I think this game can easily be replayed - choose a different class - choose different outfits, abilities, weapons to use. Language/Humor:If you can't stand foul language, toilet humor, references to fetus, abortions, nazis, zombies, germans, bobbling head Canadians. This is not a game for you. Let's just say if u remember the movie - Cartman's last ability to defeat Saddam Hussein...is one of his main abilities. So if you can not stand hearing that type of language this game is not for you.Overall:This game is marvelous. Average play is about 14-15 hours. And the game runs like a 15 hour episode of South Park. There are an abundance of references: Mr Slave's♥♥♥♥♥ Stupid Spoiled ♥♥♥♥♥ clothing, Christmas Critters, Anime Princess Kenny. I spent a good time just looking at billboards and closets seeing how many episodes I could point out from the items you see.Short Version:South Park show Great. Matt and Trey writing - GreatSouth Park Game + Matt and Trey writing/involvement = Stick of Truth = Amazing Game.This is a must play. "

Collecting underpants and chinpokemon as well as getting the people of south park on your friends list.Graphics:-typical south park graphics.Controls:-I used a xbox controller so the controls was simple and easy to use.Achievements:- 28 of 50 (56%) achievements earnedWhat Could Be Added:- DLC for another story, Option to pick sex, maybe a carry on mode where you reset the game but keep your items and equipment or somethingRating:- 9 / 10			"

												Great game, very funny, with combat somewhat reminiscent to the combat of mario rpg on the Super NES. At this point in time I can't really recommend it. The $60.00 USD price tag just seems too steep. It took me about 20 hrs to beat the game, and that's with me taking my sweet♥♥♥♥♥time, doing all sidequests and just randomly exploring everywhere. This dude I know pretty much beat the game in about 12 hrs.I may be a little out of the loop, but that seems very of short to me.If you're wondering the pre-order DLC (4 outfits) were pretty weak sauce. Very quickly replaced by other equipment.Wait till it goes on sale, then definetly pick it up.			"

												5/5For a movie or show to be properly adapted to a game (and viceversa) the writers/creators of such production have to be deeply involved in the project... The Stick Of Truth feels like an extension to the series itself, rather than just a filler product to exploit and make money out of the fan base they have created for two decades. Anyone familiar with the frase: ""Suck my balls Kyle!"" is going to enjoy this game for many hours.The Good:- Experience South Park as an unique character, explore, befriend and venture into this peculiar town and its residents.The Bad:- The Combat system feels a little awkward at first, and eventually ridiculously easy.The Ugly:- Kim Kardashian had an abortion and you will have to kill it while in its nazi form (the giant fetus not Kim).""Shut up and buy this game! Respect my authoritah!"" E. Cartman			"

												It was a long, tireless wait but my good god was it worth it. This game oozes genius and brilliance from the first seconds to the very last minute of the story. The delivery, perfect; the content, hilarious; gameplay? Repayable, exciting, fresh and surprisingly disgusting! Even by south park standards, creators Trey Parker & Matt Stone have raised the bar (much like James Cameron – “The bravest pioneer”) with revolting humour, storytelling and integration of their hugely rich universe they’ve created over the last 17 years. The Stick of Truth is not only the best south park game created, but the best game adaptation of cartoon or TV series as matter of fact, and that really says great things about the future of south park digital studios and Obsidian entertainment. This game is a steal at the price and I whole fully endorse it through and through, not only as massive fan of the show but as a gamer with more than 2 decades of consistent gaming under my belt and a love for RPG’s in particular. Ignore the criticism of the games ease and repetitiveness, both are integral to how the game is not only played but lived. There’s a good 15hours of main story without side quests and exploring, not to mention there will be some much welcome DLC on the way by the tell of the current map that will be every bit as grand as the release itself. I could bore you forever with reasons for why you should own this game and whip you endlessly for reasons as to why you have not already, the point is, if you are browising this game, you should own it and the creators and publishers are deserving of every damn, penny, cent, rupee, euro yaddadadad you get the point.... BUY IT!Bravo, Obsidian and Bravo, South Park Studios, the wait was worth it and the game, perfect. "

												First and foremost, this is a Ubisoft game that doesn't require Uplay. That alone deserves a ""recommended"" status.Beyond that, South Park is, regardless of having the South Park theme, an incredibly fun game.The mechanics are great, the turn-based fight system is really good and there's enough variety and excitement to it to keep you going for a good amount of hours. Generally The Stick of Truth is a really decent game. "

												Oh man! This! How many problems has this game been involved in? After THQ went under (so sad...loved them...), the future for South Park was unclear in the video game industry and we secretly wanted a GOOD South Park game...But then Ubisoft bought the license and the game for some weird reason got delayed YET AGAIN, but then it was actually coming and leaving development hell! It's here and we all know games from development hell never receive good criticism across the board (Duke Nukem Forever, Colonial Marines, can't think of anything else atm so, sorry).South Park, however...shows that development hell does not mean 100% certain game franchise death. It's brilliant! (almost, actually...)Well, the sound design + writing are the things that sell it the most. I mean, it's South Park! We all wanted to see how far Trey and Matt would go with the game! The show has always been an excellent and funny (though disgusting most of the times, lol) piece of social criticism, that surprisingly has gotten under me and opened my eyes on some stuff...but never without some laughs...The game succeeds at that with the great writing, the excellent voice writing and the overall feel of the game. It feels like a 15 hour long South Park episode, and a good one at that!First of all! It's an RPG, so is there character creation? Yes. Is it deep? No. Could it be deeper? Oh hell yes! You pick a race, face and hair. That's it... No initial atributes or such... you start off as a new kid in the lovely and quirky town of South Park. You have a face, hair, glasses or not, and finally, a shirt and pants + shoes. The first 30 minutes are linear, because they will get you to the KKK club (because why not?) where you meet the humans guarding the Stick of Truth (which is a stick...) and protect it from the elves who want it and with it, control the universe...The humans and elves and this overall story is a GIGANTIC larp/dress-up play... and it work on setting the vibe. At the KKK at first, you will put your name, and you are sent on an assignment to recover the Stick, because it got stolen (don't worry, these ain't spoilers, just the basic premise: basically, the first 30 minutes of the game) during an early game fight.In the fight, you will be introduced to the wonderful combat system: it's turn based! Alas Paper Mario (which I never played) and it reminds me a lot of Super Mario: SuperStar Saga (which I played to death! You should play it for the GameBoy Advance, it's an excellent Mario game: Open World RPG with tactical turn-based combat, amazing story and combat and exploration and main and side quests and stuff... Buy it! Pliszz!)The combat will give you this impression that it is deep with these buffs, de-buffs, huge amounts of consumables and quirky weird weapons...But, it's far from deep and has 1 major flaw which I will adress later. The game is deep at first. But once you get into like the 3rd or 4th or even 5th hour of the game (if you really explore everything, which I did), you will gain abilities and passives... these will overpower you so f*cking much! You have no idea! At the middles of the game I got one where if I killed someone or dealt a long-term damage (like bleeding or other stackable nerfs to the enemy), I would regain MORE PP (Power Points, which you consume to use your special attacks) than the PP that you actually SPENT ON THE ABILITY! I could just spam abilities every single turn without worrying about the using consumables, and trust me, 70% of consumables I didn't even touch! They just stacked there in the inventory (you can carry everything you want, there is no such thing as overencumbering like in Fallout or Skyrim which is good imo for this game in particular).The flaw I mentioned above: It seems like the QA team never actually got into this, (it's something that happens rarely, but it can totally screw you over in the rare times it happens!) but, I got a very few number of times this:-1 enemy left, he starts a riposte stance (which you can't melee, because you will be the one to take damage, not him).-I got stunned, couldn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥..-Side character: Butters! (Melee focused!). I had spent a consumable so I couldn't use a revival or another consumable. I had no PP to do a special attack or anything...So! I attacked, and he riposted, I took damage, and then everything went back to normal...What's wrong here?Yes, NO END TURN BUTTON! This made me damage my character due to no more options on what to do! This doesn't matter much, but imagine the same situation, but you are dead (not stunned) and Butters had 1 HP...You would lose... great!It's just not well thought out, you see?Anyways, dont think I dislike the combat... I actually love it! It's fun enough to make me want to keep on going and see what weapons and specials and new enemies I will face (enemy variety is HUGE btw)...With combat aside... graphics look exactly like the show (which is great), and the game runs on a 30 FPS lock which is FINE! Because with the graphical style of the show, it has to run at 30 FPS. This is probably the only forgivable 30 FPS locked PC game in history, so there you go...Sound design is solid (this next sentence, I'm going to repeat myself, but the voice acting and story deserve double praise, so... there you go), voice acting is amazing, possibly (possibly!) best of the year so far. Writing is excellent, it's South Park so, it's disgusting...ly funny. The story is solid, the twists and turns it takes are cool and make you want to keep going.The open world is great, it's the first time we get to see the actual map layout of the South Park, which is super cool. Every place has a story or quest of it's own (there is one where a priest tells you to ""Find Jesus"", another, you will have to kill a mouse with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attached to his back in a mutated process (it's a thing from the show)).It's great and rewarding to explore, every quest is fun and unique to do, not just a ""collect 10 of this""!The game's length deserves some discussing though: It took me 15 hours to beat it, with exploration, side quest solving and other activities that can be done. It's a good value for me, especially since I get bored of RPG's at about 10 hours (unless it's Fallout or something really exceptional). But for 40€? Heh... not really. I'm writing this review during the summer sale, and I remember it was 27 euros on a daily deal, (which is what? like 35-40 dollars, around that, I think...) which then is worth it completely. Anything around that 25 euro/35 dollar price tag is worth it; though it's sad there is NO New game +. There should be New Game + is games like this! Always!No multiplayer as well, which is good. Screw Multiplayer, we don't need that stuff! What we want is good writing, awesome story, tons, tons and tons and TONS of references to the TV show, good, fluid and fun combat, great and fun world to explore and just overall: we want a good f*cking time!And they gave us ALL of that, and the game is mostly perfect, there isn't much to complain, at all.My pointless and stupidly abstract score for this game is a 9/10... get it under 30 euros or 40 dollars and you should be good with your purchase.Never fart of someone's balls...

Product received for free
												Before you read this review be aware of the fact that I'm probably a little biased due to being a South Park fan. If you are a fan I certainly recommend it if you are not check the gameplay out first before making the choice. I got this one free with the preorder of the new game. Doesn't mean I didn't want to pay for this game at all. I have the xbox 360 version of this game that's why I didn't pay for it seperately on PC. Lastly the hours are sort of accurate to xbox and pc playtime combined since I did 4 playthroughs and most of the time I left the game running while I was studying for exams, oops, so don't be mistaken by the playtime it is accurate enough to make a review about it.This game has a lot of references to the South Park Universe also has a few to other things. In the intro I recall cartman looking like Gandalf the Grey from LOTR. The story is like you are in a South Park movie or an very extended episode for that matter. You can also expect the classic jokes and mockery that is in the series. In the game you also have access to Canada which gives me the feeling of playing an oldschool game. The ending of the game is so unexpected at the first playthrough that I laughed way harder than I should. I'm happy that this version was the uncensored one because my xbox version was censored. I'm doubting the decision if they needed the censored version. You could make a 12+ game as the censored and uncensored 18+ or so but you do not need to block countries with an older community by only giving out a censored game. Also for some reason the cutscenes can be doing some weird stuff like disappearing characters or grey screens with the subtitels.  Probably because I have a lot of tabs open or alt tab a lot to make notes or because I got a facebook/steam message  .Exploring the environment is worth it, you'll come across a lot more references and good items to equip. The game doesn't seem to support loads of back to back exploring because they game keeps track of how long you've been exploring, apparantly, and then when you explore for too long your buddy asks ""When we will continue our quest"" or something among those lines.The gameplay is pretty good, I'll be digging into some stuff deeper down below, I haven't really had problems with it aside from the control sets. You can't change them at all and some abilities require you to mash buttons which is harder on a keyboard or so. It could be useful when you could set your keys because each character requires different 'mashing', note: I'll be repeating that a lot sorry, to pull off abilities. Battles are good an active blocking system because some attacks are multiple or get executed slower or faster. Farting in this game is something they have worked on a lot in both games, refering to the nosulus rift for the next game, but in battles I didn't use it as much because I thought abilities did the job better. The summons in this game, you get them by doing side quests, are amazing and entertaining to look at when they instantly kill your enemies. The dificulty of the game is okay, I played from easy to normal to hardcore to hardcore (beating final boss with dire aids and lvl 2 armour with decent patches), I think I rarely died either to misplays and I once needed a summon to stop me from dying against the same enemy. Talking about patches, or armour effects, there are some which work when you hold two handed weapons but I didn't really get when you can use those. When you go to your armour screen you see your guy holding a weapon in his one hand but when he moves he uses his two hands to hold his weapon, unless he doesn't do that with all weapons, I still don't get it honestly. There is replay value in this game due to the several classes you can play.Buddies:In the game you always, unless certain parts of the game, have a companion at your side from the usual South Park characters. I'll be listing them here and what abilities I find the most useful.Stan, a very useful ability for shredding armour until you get Cartman.- 2: an ability that hits the first row and does the same damage for a couple of seconds, high damage against non-armour.- final: like his second ability but it removes armour per hit and the last hit does the most damage and adds 2 bleeding.Jimmy, he's only useful for letting enemies sleep or his buddy command.- 2: the ability that puts them to sleepButters is a good early game buddy until you get Stan, his special heals you.- 2: applies shock damage to enemies in a row.- final: a combination of everything he has but with more damage and extra effects.Kenny, grosses them out a lot but is able to kill himself in two out of three abilities.- 2: you mash and unleash an army of mice, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies.- final: he summons an unicorn which damages a line and applies bleed, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies.Kyle, Almost equal to Cartman in terms of usefulness but almost doesn't give any debuff to enemies.- 1: he kicks his little brother ike at his enemy, only one, and damages them plus a bleed.- final: he summons an arrow storm, doing damage either way, if you fail the button combinations or not.Cartman, The most useful buddy to me in any type of battle.- 1: a fire damaging ability in a linewith a burn.- 2: applies fire damage to every enemy and strips armour and add fire damage, no burn. - final: a masher of all buttons, easiest masher there is, does a 500-1K damage per hit (5 hits). It can kill anything without decent armourClasses:Warrior, my favourite one probably because any ability fully upgraded is wrecking.- Assault and battery: good for any stage of the game, upgraded gives bleed per hit.- Roshambo: good for the early stages, a stun.- Bull rush: good against any boss, it halves their armour and pisses them off.- Horn of irritation: A debuff to all and also pisses them off, from what I remember.Corrections are welcome- Ground stomp: applies 2-3K damage to every enemy, very useful lategame.Jew, this is a button masher class, good for with a controller.- Sling of david: mashing, hits them pretty decent early but if failed you hit yourself a little.- Jew jitsu: lot of mashing again, good early game ability that stuns them on hit.- Circum scythe: easy to pull off ability and upgraded a really amazing ability.- Dreidle: button mashing fest, hits everyone for decent damage.- Plagues of egypt: an ability that almost does every debuff if done correctly pretty equal to ground stomp in terms of damage.Thief, you thought assault and battery didn't bleed enough? Think again.- Backstab: an ability that you can use anytime that gives bleed.- Mug: typical ability, that stuns and gives you an item they hold. Mostly junk.- Execute: good against non-armour.- Stink bombs: you mash your mouse button to throw rotten eggs, gives gross.- Death of 1000 cuts: bunch of ninjas attack, system like plagues of egypt but harder, you direct your ninjas to where they need to hit and give a bleed if hit correctly.Mage, probably the most diverse class loads of burns.- Dragon breath: a mouse masher that hits in a line and final hit does more damage. It applies burn if done correctly.- Dust of dreams: easy to do stun.- Lightning volt: electricity damage in a line.- Funnel of forest: line ability that slows, if held long enough (like kyle his second ability) and applies slow damage.- Pyre ball, the best ability in the game hands down. At least 4K damage and applying burn after tapping the same combination 4 times.			"

												I have a confession to make, I have not watched an episode of South Park and I cannot be considered as a 'fan'. So going through this game, I expected crude fart jokes and the like. However, this game exceeded my expectations. It made me want to watch south park and I can't wait for the sequel. 10/10 would play again.The battle system and the environments going hand in hand is amazing. I have not been this engaged in a turn based battle system for a long time where I go out of my way to hit every dastardly elf. Especially for a game that is all about QTEs! I especially love how you can avoid encounters altogether by committing mass destruction.The story was super intriguing and I am honestly happy about the amount of customization they give you towards the characters.Now I just need to find out how to remove censorship since those Australian Koalas is killing my experience.

												**First of all, I got the game for $9.99 (in my region) during the recent Ubisoft sale. That, in my case, made a huge difference in my review. Why? Well, if I got it for $40-60 I'd say it's not worth it. It only took me 17 hours to beat it (15 hours if you subtract the strolling around and the unnecessary farting). I wish it was longer but for the price I got it, it's definitely a steal. This game brought out the kid in me. It's like how I used to see the world when I was I kid. How we pretend to be oh so innocent in front of our parents. The treehouses/camps. When anything fart-related was the funniest thing. I'm not even gonna mention the make-believe-we-have-superpowers. The stereotypes and the girls club, pretty accurate. Except, we girls never forgive! We girls never forget! If this was real life, there's no way we'd accept that two-faced biznatch back in the club. :P+ Great storyline+ Great art+ Great voice-acting+ Very fun(ny)+ Hits right in the childhood+ Easy controls (played with a controller)I'm a 23 year old girl, I enjoyed this game and I'm not ashamed. :))			"

												This is one of the greatest TBRPG's I have ever played. Hilarous Dialogue, Memorable Characters and Satisfying combat. If your a big South Park fan like myself this is a definite must have. Usually series and movie licensed games are an utter waste of time, but the great team at Obsidian takes that ""Stick of Truth"" and shoves it right up the non believers ♥♥♥'s. Final Score: 90/100			"

It's entertainment at it's finest: funny, laid back, engaging, AND every aspect of the game's design is fan-oriented.  The creators of South Park never disappoint.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth, Review:---------------------------------------------------------------Story:+Sticks to the shows fashion of jokes, but also adds a rpg feel to it aswell.+Plenty of side requests, that give the game many hours to it.+Involves as many characters from the South Park universe as it can.+Openly aknowledges the player and breaks the fourth wall in a humorous way.-Some of the side stories are short and boring.---------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay:+GREAT rpg elements when it comes to battling.+Plenty of upgrades, gear, weapons, and junk to find.+Has a free roam so you can walk around the town of SouthPark if you please.+Most of the gameplay really goes well with the current objective.-Some of the fights get boring.-Repeats itself.---------------------------------------------------------------Music:+Plays along with the current atmosphere.+Affects the player while battling.-Very basic and steryotypical (though this seems to be mainly because the game itself is a parody).------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Conclusion:South Park: The Stick of Truth provides endless hours of fun and enjoyment for any South Park fan, and can still be enjoyed if you do not watch the show. It has funny moments, great battles, interesting characters, and a amazing atmosphere. I would stand behind the statment that this game has the best RPG battling elements I have ever seen. Its easy enough for the new players to enjoy, and full of suprises that more experinced players can enjoy aswell.My Overall Score: 8.5/10P.s: I still have not found a proper template for these reveiws, I will stick to one style when I can find one I fully enjoy.

												Impressions before playing the game So before playing the game I thought It was going to be a major disappointment and a sub par game with the South Park brand on the box. How could I be so wrong!Graphics There is really no graphic option in game but I do not really think they are necessary since south park has a certain look to it and you do not really need AA, FOV or depth of field. I would love the support for triple monitors though. Character classes Fighter, Mage, Thief or JewStory (Spoiler free)There is two factions Kingdom kupa keep and the elves they are fighting for the stick of truth which gives the bearer control of the universe with everything you would expect from south park included.Impressions after playing the game This game is not your typical turn based rpg this has south park written all over it you can really see that Matt Stone and Trey Parker played a huge part in making this game it felt like I was playing a whole season of South park and I did not want it to end. The further I got in to the game the story got more and more crazy it was totally what I would expect from a South park episode and they delivered it flawlessly. As soon as I completed the game I wanted to experience it all again.			"

 SOUTH PARK: THE STICK OF TRUTH REVIEW   South Park: The Stick of Truth  is easily one of the funniest games I have ever played. The game visually is exactly the same as the show and on-point at that. The story is completely ridiculous, over the top, and extremely good. You are basically playing a long episode of South Park which is sick af. There seems to be a lack of soundtrack variety, but the soundtracks that are in the game are simply brilliant and are amazing which makes up for the minimal amount found in the game in my opinion. The game is a role-playing game and the RPG elements are surprisingly well thoughtout and very diverse for a game like this. The game is my ""Game of the Year of 2014"".   THE FUNNIEST ROLE-PLAYING GAME TO EVER TOUCH THIS EARTH. 10/10  "

												This game has got to be one of the games that did the job perfectly recreating the world of the series.The detail of the world they put it in extremely enjoyable thanks to Trey Parker and Matt Stone.Personally I was never a fan of turn based games,for a fact I actually avoided them like a plague but after Stick of Truth I always take a second look at turn based games.Now as for this tittle its an open world free roam South Park game!Thats pretty much the best description possible.If you're familiar with the series than you should absolutely get this one since it has all of your favourite characters which you can set to be your buddies which means they can follow you around while you do some exploring.The game mechanics and battle system is very easy to understand and easy to master,although the game is best to be played using a controller.Theres many things to do such as quests,from finding the collectible Chinpokomon,to the apparels and many other awesome weapons.About the requirements nothing much is needed to be said since it does not requre a tough system to run at all.This game has proved that games based on series and TV shows can actually be very succesfull and entertaining.Absolute 10/10 from me.Well worth the money,especially if its on a discount.

												Putting yourself in the middle of South Park's craziest adventure is awesome. We've all used that character creator online, you know you have. I'm going through my second playthrough, I'll workshop this as I go along.Pros:-Most of the children in South Park are playing a game... The most brutal ♥♥♥♥ing game of all time. Damn, I'm glad I didn't get beat up with a nail'd baseball bat when I played medieval as a kid-Insane amounts of little references to obscure things in the show. Hey, I remember that!-A ton of cosmetics to make your character exactly the way you want. You can look exactly like a number of characters from the show-Stays true to the hilarity of the show. It's basically a really long South Park episode-Infinite inventory slots, because inventory management really sucks-One companion at a time, can be swapped mid-battle. Each companion has different perks, strengths and weaknesses. Different companions depending on which faction you side with-It's really quite tactical, which is surprising-Fun dungeons-Customizable weapon stats, you can buy perks to attatch to clothing and weapons, and once you equip them, you can remove them without losing the clothing or the perks-Can color all of your armor to actually be yourself... No longer will you suffer non-matching color-schemes-Butters is enjoyable and useful this time... I'm gladSome serious cons:-Overabundance of money and healing items. You can have a max stack of 10 for each item, too bad there's multiple different brands of small/med/large health potions that do all the same thing, from basically the start of the game you could very well heal yourself every turn up until the end of the game, no joke-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game is easy. Unless you're playing for story only, you're going to need to make some of your own hardcore rules (exception of say, two fights)-That being said, unless you know exactly what you're doing and you can plan a few moves into the future-It's short. Holy hell it's short.-Warrior: Not experienced, but can taunt and focuses on mitigating a bunch of damage and being rather hard-hitting-Mage: Not experienced, but focuses on special moves and elemental damage (mainly fire)-Theif: Focuses on attacking back-line enemies (stunning and bleeding enemies in the back row), along with an armor-busting move. Great for people who can plan moves into the future.-Jew: Focuses on debuffs, incredibly, incredibly powerful/broken, I played it my first playthrough, take a Tweek Bros Coffee and circumsize every enemy for an instant win (nearly)			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth lets you take control of your very own South Park episode in an epic struggle to control the Stick of Truth. All the most popular South Park characters make one appearance or another, even Chef! Partner up with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and Jimmy to become the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag in Colorado. Vanquish enemies by farting your way to victory in turn-based style combat. Play the brown note and watch them crap their pants!I don't remember ever laughing so hard with any video game. This is every bit South Park as it can get--all the raunchy comedy, dirty language, and potty humor that fans have come to expect. So many South Park storylines from the original series come together in one fantastic video game. All South Park fans need to own this masterpiece--likely one of the best games in the last 10 years.			"

												The gameplay is Baby's First RPG, but everything else is excellent. If you're a fan of the show, it's a must-own. It's basically an interactive, twelve-hour episode (and in the best way possible).Stray Points:Zero replayability. Everything is samey and overly-simple for veteran players. Consider this a one-time investment (an excellent one if you can grab it during a sale).As noted above, if you're a fan, it's a must-own. That's because 70% of the appeal comes from the strange South Park mythos and all of the in-jokes and gags exclusive thereto. And, much like any quotationalist media, the more you know about the show, the funnier the game is. However, if you don't particularly like the show, you have absolutely no reason to play this game. If you have no idea what South Park is or have never seen an episode (i.e., You've spent most of your life living among wolves or something), the humor may string you along until the end, but the gameplay really isn't enough to sustain interest, otherwise.

												This game was pretty surprising to me. being a Ubisoft game i didn't have high expectations for the game but it was done really well. The game looks exactly like the game. Everything in the game is southpark related from the collectables to clothing. You will find things in this game that will surprise you in a never ending laughter. I have to admit i lost a few battles by laughing. The game is an RPG that took some aspects from different games. Final Fantasy and Skyrim are two i can name off my head. They're not exactly related to it but it has some references in the game that make you believe that. Now before you go off saying i don't like turn based RPG games... This game is actually a bit more interactive than your typical FInal Fantasy game. You play as the new kid and you get to design your character anyway you want. Ofcourse it'll be in southpark form and on top of that as you play the game you get more and more stuff to dress your character up in. I would recommend this game. Not only is it fun but theres something shocking around every corner!			"

												Being a huge fan of the South Park TV show I was hugely excited to hear when there was a game being released. Sadly I was always put off by the full price of £40. I waited until this years Summer sale and picked it up for £20 and was not disappointed.The game takes the style of a turn based combat title, much like Final Fantasy, but it is a much more mellowed down version. I was able to breeze through most combat situations without much attention being paid. The parts of the game which got me scratching my head were trying to work out how to proceed through each puzzle, often at times I had to refer to a walkthrough as I was starting to get a brain hemorrhage.The graphics and sound throughout the game are exactly the same as in the TV series, so if you enjoy that, you will certainly feel at home here. The ever so crass South Park esk jokes and one liners are here for the world to marvel at.Story wise, again, very much a South Park episode, you will almost feel like you are watching the show while playing. The length of the main story is about ten hours long, some may disagree but I think that is a little short for a game at full price of £40, but there are plenty of side missions and achievements to go hunting for if that is your thing.If you are lucky enough to find this game on sale for anything under £20. I would certainly recommend you give it a try if you have ever enjoyed the TV show, however you may not fully appreciate it. Certainly is not worth full price. But for the price I have paid, I still really enjoyed my playthrough. "

												If you like South Park, I don't know why you don't already have this. This is pretty much the ultimate South Park experience, and it's been perfectly executed in every fathomable way. The gameplay is easy to pick up, it's funny, and it doesn't bore you when nothing is happening in the story. The story itself, however, is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Not only that, it's deep and very immersive, which was kind of a nice surprise for a South Park game of all things. I've also enjoyed the game very much, finding all the easter eggs and references is a pretty fun thing to do while you're taking a break from story missions. There's also a ton of side-missions, so you won't be completely done story-wise after the main story is completed, there's plenty more to do.In regards to other gameplay elements and characters, Timmy is the best fast-travel system I've ever used. You have a few companions (or buddies as they're called in-game) to help you on your journey, as well as in every fight. Some of the ones early on are characters like Butters, Kenny, Jimmy, etc. It's great. And if I'm not mistaken, nearly every character in South Park is in this, even the one's that aren't most likely have at least one reference to them. You can clearly tell the devs cared about this game. I'm very satisfied with it, and I'm sure any other fans will be too. Even newcomers to South Park in general can enjoy it. So, finally, yes, I recommend the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, it's an easy 10/10 for me.			"

Story: You play the new mute kid in South Park who get to know the town and it's inhabitans there. While roleplaying with the neighbour kids ""Human's vs. Elves"", you slowly uncover all the madness this town has to offer.The Good:+ Nailed the typical South Park graphic, sound and humor of the series .+ Length of the game is good enough for people like me who just play now and then.+ Surpriselingy low on bugs for an Obsidian Game/RPG.+ Many items to use and combined on your avatar.+ Megaton of references to the series.+ Companions and their powerups.+ Getting old school in Canada.The Bad:- A few Quicktime events were more annoying then fun or necessary.- Two times it was not clear to me what to do (using specific companions).- Not balanced loot drops on ""Normal"" (too many health/mana/bonus items).- Don't feel any urge to replay it, since i think i have seen most of it after a single playthrough.- Terribad Nazi Censorship for German version- Not selling all the junk items at once.- Autolevelup for companions.Who should play it?* People who like/love South Park.* People who like a humors RPG.* People who enjoy the games of Obisidian Entertainment (Fallout: New Vegas). Final verdict:7/10 - Was a fun playthrough, but dont feel the urge to make another char and replay it though.			"

												Enjoyable adventure game for fans of Southpark. It is (although I don't know why) amazing how much the game looks like an episode of the show. I laughed out loud serveral times, and was super grossed out several times as well. The fighting system, leveling system and perk system are all well done and fairly interesting. Weapons can have patches which put additional damage or bonuses on them. The fighting system is turn based. Perks are achieved both through leveling up and obtaining friends on social media. It seems like this is a personal problem and not a problem of the game because it happens to me a lot but around hour 17, I really wanted to be done. The last bits have some of the grossesst/funniest parts so I was glad I ploughed through it but I am certainly finding that I am a fan of experiences that are in the 10-15 hour range. I'm a fan of Southpark from the first couple of years but haven't watched it in several. It was still a great visit back to Southpark, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and crew are still funny and it was great to revisit them. My only ""warning"" would be that this is not censored in any way shape or form. Not a game for kids.			"

												If you liked/like South Park this is worth playing, it really is just like playing an episode of the tv show.The comedy/South Park flavor is good, a lot of it taken straight from the show.The RPG parts are a bit light for my tastes, very easy, and stats/leveling up/equipment didn't seem to matter very much.Combat was very uneven, it felt hard at the start, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy, not very strategic.This game has a lot more in common with Costume Quest than Dragon AgeI enjoyed it very much and I'd probably play a sequel.

												I've played all the South Park games, and honestly I wasn't going to give this a try. But I said What The Heck and bought it for 40$. This game is really good. The story is fantastic, the humor is great, the gameplay is amazing, and I just love it all. First, the story. Talks about the Evles VS Humans. Cartman is leader of the Humans, Kyle is the leader of the Elves. They are in a constant war for the ""Stick of Truth"" because ""For whoever controls the stick, controls the universe"" Keep in mind that it is not real violence, and they're actually hitting each other with sticks, it's all imagination. It is made to look like real violence, but it really isn't. Second, the humor. I love the script of this game. Cartman has probably the best lines. It's just amazing how they got the humor so perfect. South Park fans will love this part.Third, Gameplay. It's a normal RPG with a few tweaks. First of all, enemies aren't random, and you can avoid most of them, except bosses. One of my favorite parts is that your PP (Power Points) and HP (Health Points) regain by themselves when you finish the battle. That way you don't waste your items. There are certain abilities you can have depending on your class, Jew, Fighter, Mage, or Theif. Each of these abilities are unique in their own way. For example, Theif has a backstab, and Fighter has a move where you kick someone in the balls. You can also get Fart Magic, which is honestly the funniest battle mechanic ever. You unlock the abilities the more you level up, and can level up each ability up to a certain level (4 or 5 I believe). There's also tons of sidequests. This is probably one of my favorite RPG's ever.Fourth, Customization. There are tons of customization options. Througout the game you can get wigs, facial features, and even clothes you can wear the make you stronger. Sadly you cannot be a girl, but you can make yourself look like one. You can modify your weapons and clothes to have certain colors or abilities. Things called ""Perks"" are unlocked by having friends in South Park. The more friends, the more perks. These perks make you stronger or weaker. You can modify your weapons and clothes by adding little patches that have certain abilities, like 20% more money, or Gross Damage, or even Bleeding. Tons of option here, you wont get upset by that.Things I don't like about the game: First, it's really freaking short. It's not worth the 60$ it used to be, so they dropped it to 40. I reccomend waiting for a sale at like, 35 or even 30. Now the Saving feature in this game is absolute bullcrap. When you save it might save a little bit before where you actually were, making you have to do a battle or 2 again. Another thing I don't like is how the difficulty suddenly raises halfway through the game. Then again you can customize the difficulty to your taste at any time. This game really is good, but it does have some faults. Also, you can fart on people, highly recommended if you're into this humor and gametype. I'd say wait till it's on sale though, not worth the 40$ in my opinion.			"

Its everywhere. Its hard to play this game for some minutes without came across a fun scene. + Good variety of missions+ I found the story surprisingly good!  CONS - Maybe a little short,  for an RPG. I guess that's what happens when you're enjoying a game so much.  OVERALL 8.6/10 -   OMG they killed Kenny!  "

												Rating: 8.5/10Overview: Turn Based RPGSimilar Games: Paper MarioThe Good: +Possibly the stupidest, most juvenile, absurd, disgusting, raunchy, ridiculous, bizarre game I have ever played and for some reason I thought the game was brilliant. Yet despite its crude nature, the game has a charming quality underneath all of it, the characters are funny and well written and the game does a great job of representing the south park universe. Going around the town, speaking to all the characters, finding lots of secrets as you unlock new abilities is  fun and really rewards the player with some valuable things.The Average:The RPG mechanics and combat can be pretty basic especially for veterans in the genre. Turn based combat is pretty simple; melee, range and abilities you can use depending on the class you picked. You can equip many different types of equipment that grant bonuses but I never felt they really made that big of a difference in the long run.  The game also happens to be very easy even on normal mode. Play this game on hard if you want some challenge.Conclusion:I'm sure if you are a fan of South Park you have already completed the game; if you are not a fan than you should still play this game if you want a light hearted RPG experience. If you are the type of person that is overly sensitive, you may want to avoid this game.   "

My only complaint is that it was over too soon.			"

												There are no words to describe this game. It captured the spirit of the show so well, and yet had successfully engaging gameplay. I walked in expecting less, and left with so much more. If you enjoy and are a fan of the show, recommending this game feels like an understatement. You MUST play this. If you dislike or are offended by the show, THIS GAME IS VERY MUCH NOT FOR YOU.I didn't purchase the DLC, but I've looked into the details/stats, and it isn't really worth it in my opinion. They look nice at first, but the core game gives so many more creative/powerful options you'll likely opt out for those without hesitation.			"

												I absolutely love this game.  It's like being a part of one big episode of South Park, but one that is entirely uncensored and no holds barred.  It's even better if you're a real fan of the show and understand the references in the game.Lots of crude humor.  I find myself grinning the entire time I play because of all the little funny things I find in game.  Heed the ESRB rating.  There are certain scenarios in the game that are pretty graphic.It's a no stress game.  Lots of fun to play through.  I'm not exactly sure of the replay value.  I know there are other classes to try, and--as I am a completionist--I want to try to get all the collectables and aim for all the achievements.  But rolling a new class just to go through the game again while knowing what's coming, so far that doesn't appeal to me.Definitely worth getting this game if you are a fan of South Park.			"

												This game for fans of south park, or people that just like that kind of humor. If you have seen south park and disliked it however, this game isn't going to be for you, as the strongest point really is the humor and characters. The voices are the same and the entire game is filled with references. So many references to episodes that I ended up surprised that going number two in a urinal with mr mackey nearby didn't give me any special comment from my companion. Which I didn't expect going into the game, but again... There was so many minor characters or item references in the game.I enjoyed every minute of my first playthrough as a fan of the show. (Just for the record far from the biggest fan, since there are a lot of episodes I haven't seen, and I am sure there were references to those that I missed.) Chances are that you will see your favorite character at least make an appearance. The combat is turnbased rpg with each character having different abilities and moves. And the abilities require different forms of excecution sometimes button mashing, hitting the right keys, click or hold the mousebutton, but each ability tell you how to execute it before you cast it, so it is nice and manageable.As for the story... It is southpark, don't expect the characters' actions to be logical. And the fewer questions you ask the better. Just enjoy the ride and expect that everyone around you is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or an idiot, or both.So yeah, if you like south park's humor, then buy this. If not... Then run. Really, this game isn't holding back on any of the jokes, and it is really immature and gross in its comedy. Because of south park's style I feel they can get away with more, because nothing really looks realistic in the slightest but still. If you think South Park's humor and characters are too offensive, then this game won't help.For me this is a great game, probably among my favorites because i enjoyed the entire experience. Which means, that the nitpicks I have are more... wishes for more features in future games. I wish that you could be a bit more unique character than just one of the normal boys. Maybe let you be a canadian boy, or a fatass like Cartman. Or let you be a girl, or a fat girl like the goth Henrietta. Is it needed? Probably not, but I would like it. I also would have loved more weird classes, like the Jew class already in the game. Maybe getting a princess/girl class like Kenny. Or a vampire class. Also would have loved just more. More of everything! :P I am finished, I want another.____On another note, that is not really a part of the review. The next game is called South Park: The fractured but whole. And this time they are going to be superheroes instead of humans and elves. And while I think the combat will be different, I think it is much like this one going to be dripping with the humor of south park. Preordering it means you get the stick of truth ""for free"" right away. Personally I see it more as paying 30 for each instead of 60 for one. Can't say if the next one will be good, but I loved the episodes I have seen in the show where they dressed up as superheroes.I know Cartman says the only thing you get for preordering a game is a big fat♥♥♥♥♥♥in your mouth. Seems good if you like me didn't already have stick of truth.			"

												This game was quite good all the way until the end.I spent a total of 37 hours along 3 playthroughs in order to fully complete this game. I wanted this game at 100% but unfortunately I missed out on a lot of hidden stuff that blocked me from certain achievements. That in itself is a good thing because for a partly open-world game, this game requires a lot of attention to detail. Thankfully the game has some amazing replay value provided by the humour and variety (by switching out your class and regularly used buddy).Here's a few awesome things about the game:- Lots of humorous collectibles. The game has some awesome names for the Chinpokomon and the various outfits/weapons.- Tons of references to previous episodes. The battle quotes from Cartman are especially funny.- Battle System is simple. The battle mechanics are easy to understand and there's not a lot of 'grinding' involved. You can gain experience for using smart solutions to progress through the levels so technically you are rewarded for using the environment instead of just bull rushing through hordes of enemies.- Short and sweet. The game has just the right amount of content for a 10 hour session (a bit longer if you want 100%). Although I don't necessarily agree with the current price tag, I am at least satisfied with how genuinely 'South Park' this game is.Here are a few things I'd like to mention:- The map that shows you how many collectibles are left in an area is a bit bugged. A few people (as well as myself) have reported seeing indicators that equipment could still be found in an area that has completely been cleaned out.- You max out in levels long before you complete the game. If you want a more challenging final boss encounter, you can skip out on certain content to be 'underleveled'.- It would have been nice to gain access to certain levels once you beat the game. Some areas are completely locked off after you clear their related quests. This makes sense for areas that are eventually destroyed in the storyline though.9/10 It was a fun game!			"

												Ah, South Park The Stick Of Truth. It took a year longer to release than it should've, but it's finally here. Is it the South Park game we've been waiting for ? 'Yes, absolutely !' is what I would say.Let's start with the graphics. The graphics are similar to the TV show, meaning they are 2D and have a bit of a grainy look. It's like watching the 2D show, there are basically no differences here. Gameplay wise it's similar to games like Paper Mario. You walk around the town completing quests, searching for loot and taking part in battles. Quests are handed out by the people of South Park and normally consist of defeating certain enemies or finding specific items. Most of these quests are simple and relatively easy to complete, which fits the game in a way, but thankfully the main quest has a bit more variation and depth. Note that the whole game can be completed in 10-15 hours so it's not the biggest game we've ever seen or played. And that's a good thing, because near the end of the game it starts to overstay its welcome with its repetitive nature. 'Why', you ask ? Well, the battles are turn-based and except for some stronger enemies halfway through and near the end they never become exciting or very difficult. The special powers and summons are fun to use but you've probably seen most of it, or maybe all of it, within a couple of hours. And the fact that summons can't be used for boss fights is slightly disappointing.The humor is just fantastic, as is the voice acting. You can tell a lot of work and love was put into it. This is one of the reasons you should play The Stick Of Truth. There's some hilarious stuff in it.One small thing that doesn't really affect my opinion of the game but should be said anyway is the fact that some of the collectibles can't be collected anymore once you've finished the story. So, to all completionists out there; make sure you grab everything before wrapping up the story.Anyway, to wrap up my review:South Park The Stick Of Truth is the South Park game we've been waiting for and if you even remotely enjoy the show you owe it to yourself to play it at least once. You'll have a good time with it, believe me.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												It'd be difficult to explain exactly why this game is so great without major spoilers, so I won't take that approach. Instead, I'll say some of the same things everyone else already has. It's like actually playing a season of South Park with your custom character, and the combat employs action commands ala the various Super Mario RPG titles and Shadow Hearts.While some of the humor falls flat, and there's a certain thing repeated a few times early on, the vast majority succeeds in prompting laughter, which is more than I can say for most media which claims to be comedic nowadays. At the same time, it's brutally self-aware, not only of it's status as an RPG, but as a South Park videogame. The voicework and animation is spot on with the show, and, honestly, if you didn't know it was a game, you'd think it WAS an episode or movie.Speaking of which, there's references to the movie along with the entirety of the show's 17+ year run, and yes, even music, which Matt & Trey are surprisingly talented at. The game's soundtrack takes on an absurdly epic style, with several of the main themes being very similar to that of ""real"" fantasy titles, like Skyrim, and with good reason. It also has a strong Earthbound vibe to it, because of the whole ""kids using toys to inflict terrible damage to hostile and weird enemies"" along the way.It's not perfect; unless you turn the difficulty all the way up, you'll likely breeze through 90% of the battles, and it's very easy to hit the low level cap. There's also a number of game-breaking attack combos you can learn with every class, and debuffs are so powerful that they're practically mandatory. But it's all worth it. Despite these problems, I've spent nearly 100 hours in the game, as I went through multiple playthroughs, and didn't regret a minute of it. Well, except for those minutes with the repeated thing I won't mention early on, that is.Oh, and no major spoilers, but I HAVE to share a minor one, which should tell you just what kind of game this is. The hardest boss, by far? Not the last one, or even the next-to-the-last one, both of whom can be tricky. But no.. it's Al Gore.I'm super cereal you guys.			"

												It's a good day when licensor titles actually have input from the creators. I was wary of this one for some time because usually licensor titles have huge flaws, but luckily this one's are minimal: The options are terrible, you can't rebind keys or do other basic functions you'd expect on a PC game. The whole feel is of a lame console port. The controls are a bit confusing since the console version relied on sticks, which keyboard/mouse users don't have. Some of the companions are embarrassingly weak, while Kyle is downright overpowered in almost all situations.But with the bad out of the way, it's a pretty good game. Naturally it requires that you've seen a lot of South Park to know 90% of what's going on, but it has the feel of a playable South Park episode. It has a script written by Parker and Stone, it's filled with eye-buldging moments, eye hiding moments, and WTF moments that you'd expect from South Park.  Think of it as a DVD with lost episodes, only they're playable...and they kind of resemble the three-part episode they did around Black Friday 2013.But don't expect a lot of replay value out of it. After the collectibles, that's pretty much it.			"

												Do I recommend this game? If you watch south park or have in the past - then this game is absoloutley for you. Challenging twitch mechanics, surprisingly detailed and hilariously funny.Al Gore also makes an appearance, between him, ManBearPig and punching children in the face - that should be more than reason enough to give it a look!

												This....game.....is amazing!I honestly though this game would sort of be a disaster, even before playing this game, i didnt read reviews, watch gameplay videos, so it was all new for me.The Battles, at first seemed like they would be boring and menial in a sense, but constant comments by friend and foe alike kept it amusing all the way to the end.The Story itself was pretty good, quite a few plot twists and things to keep the story interesting. Several refereneces to things throught the seasons as well makes moment hilarious and can make you fall off your chair (this happenned twice to me :s)And again several references to other games and shows really made this game become greater because of it. Even if your not a south park fan you can still get a good laugh out of this and if your are a fan and dont have this......im questioning whether or not you are  a fan. Either way 10/10 Must get. Ty for the extremely generous Gift Baby Iffy who made this awesome  experience possible :extralife:			"

												Stick of Truth is just as obscene and irreverent as you’d expect from a South Park game. It is also genuinely laugh out loud funny.  That’s basically all you need to know. The gameplay itself is basic. It’s barely an RPG: you don’t speak so there’s no dialog choices (or really any meaningful choices to be made) and everything from JRPG combat to equipment management is very simple. But really the game is a backdrop to the humour. This is a South Park comedy taking advantage of the medium of gaming more than it is a game taking advantage of the setting of South Park. The story takes some of the best bits from the show and it does what is does very well. The presentation is basically flawless, it really does look and feel like South Park. Yes there are jokes about farts and disability and ethnicity and abortions and... and you will try to pretend to feel guilty about laughing, but you won’t really because you’re having too much fun.

It's made me laugh so many times that I cannot keep count and reliving all the amazing characters we've seen over this illustrious run of episodes is worth playing the game alone. I sincerely hope they do another one for the new consoles, as the game may be even more their calling than the show, and that's really REALLY saying something.			"

												A love letter to South Park fans. Nearly everything from past episodes is referenced somewhere in the world, and the attention to detail goes above and beyond what I'd expect a game. Specific characters who you can completely avoid might make a joke if you do something specific, like farting or changing to a buddy (like swapping to Butters when you're in Professor Chaos' lair). The attention to detail on such small things is not something you see in many games. It feels just like an episode of South Park, comedic pacing and all.I had a few problems with the game. The shop system was probably made for a gamepad, since selling things takes too long. You'll find items which only exist to be sold, and you get them in bulk. You have to double click each and every single one, or if it's in a stack, select the item, then left click ""sell stack"". It's not horrible but it takes longer than it needs to. The more important problem is that the game is just too damn easy. At the 10 hour mark I put the game on hardcore difficulty (which I never do because I'm a filthy casual), and I still ended up destroying every boss in 3-6 turns, minus the final boss which was only slightly longer, but by no means difficult. Also my character kept cutting out during the pre-final boss cutscene, which kind of took me out of the experience.Regardless it's still one of the best JRPGs I've ever played, and it's totally worth your time and money.Five out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)			"

												This is a good game although the side missions and main story are only about 20 hours max. After that there's not really a whole lot to do, but I highly recommend it if it goes on sale, especially if you like the humor of south park, because its practically one giant episode. The combat is best described as a paper mario style rpg.			"

												South Park The Stick of Truth does a great job of making players feel like they are part of a South Park episode with the texture, atmosphere, and humor. Fans of the South Park series will love this game because of the refrences from the episodes of South Park layered in the game from the radio, characters, and much more. The gameplay is turn based with the player's charater and companions having to interact with thier desired move by timing mouse clicks or button presses at the right time. This mechanic makes the turn based gameplay a bit more interesting then choosing the desired attack by making players interact more in battle. It wouldn't be South Park without making fun of something or someone so the game makes fun of famous game titles like Skyrim with the use of 'dragon shout' by farting on players, which can be combined with your other attacks or used to interupt an enemy charging up their special attack. There are four classes to choose from one of them being the Jew class that can actaully be overpowered at times, but is a funny reference to one of the original characters from the south park series. The problems i have with this game are some of the achievements being difficult, some actions freezing up causing players to load from last save, and bad implemintation any replayability. The achievements are not only difficult but ridiculious because forgeting to talk to certain people to be on your friends list or missing a complete set of armor means having to restart the entire game to get back to the point you missed. The character freezing has happend only a few times but not manually saving before hand may cause people hours of backtracking as it only loads manual saves instead of auto saves. Replayability of this game is weaksauce as the end of the game is free roam with limited areas to go to and nothing really to do but walk around and finish up certain achievements. A new game plus would have been good here but I think the developers did this intentually so players would have to start over as a new character to get more hours out of this game. Overall this game is great even with some of the gripes mentioned. Fans and non fans of the South Park series will really enjoy this game unless you don't like crude humor then this might not be your game. I strongly recommend this game for the sheer fun and laughter it gives to players and hours of fun it has to offer. If you can get this game at a reduced price even better!			"

												I just quit the game just because my mouth is in pain from laughter. It's the game, where you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥out and even tho you not done with the first joke, the second bomb is already on the way. I want to tell you all the jokes, all the funny moments in the game. Not just tell, SCREAM. All the emotions you getting from Stick of Truth, you won't get the same from any other game, especially if you are South Park fan. It's really nice, that not all jokes tied up with the series — you may not know all the characters, but still will end up in a sea of tears. You literally screaming at the screen and start tell all your friends how hard you laughet at this and at that. If you play videogames, just press on buy. You won't regret a nugget.Plus it's really good turn based RPG. Side quests, new abilities, characters and all the other stuff you'll find in any other RPG. Just made in South Park style with all the consequences.			"

TLDR: I loved it.Currently I am about 6 hours through the game and I can tell any fan of South Park that this game is for them. Both blatantly and cleverly they have many references to the shows past storylines as well as awesome new content to be had. The story has been a blast so far and the mechanics for battles are loads of fun. A turn based RPG with some control over the action is actually pretty damn sweet. (think paper mario)I can highly suggest this to anyone looking for a light RPG game with tons of collectables and fun combat. As well to anyone that loves South Park.Disclaimer:For those that are offended easily the satire is ripe and raunchy while remaining smart and funny. They hold absolutely no punches in the Uncensored version. I can see it being absolutely devastating to anyone that is faint of heart. It gets pretty rude and crazy. I may be a monster, because while some stuff was wicked gross, I still laughed and never felt offended.UPDATE: I completed the game and stand by the statements I made originally, this game is fantastic and a total blast to play through. Nothing ever becomes overly tired like most RPGs, and it is hilarious through and through. Highly Recommend. One of the most polished and fun games I have ever played.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth...  It is definitely NOT for children.  There's a lot of gross material in this game and perhaps many adults will find it offensive (I know, I've been offended a few times).  And there's more to discover as I continue to play it.  However, put aside all of that, and it's a very entertaining game.  Funny as hell actually.  xD  IT IS South Park after all.  What did you expect?

												TL;DR edition:SP:SoT is a brilliant piece of fan-service and finally a South Park (SP) game actually worth playing. It is a surprisingly solid RPG that I played through twice.PRESENTATIONThe story is as ludicrous as you would expect and the town of South Park itself is littered with ""easter-eggs"" that refer to many of the more famous episodes. My only gripe with the presentation is that the game hinges heavily on the more childish humour of SP, and has very little of the more intelligent satirical humour that some SP fans prefer (myself included).VISUALSThe game also looks fantastic. In fact, I would say it looks perfect. It is presented so loyally as the TV show that you could easily mistake it for an episode. The movement in game uses 2D models on a horizontal movement plane with a little depth for 3D movement. The game allows you to create your own boy, but your ""new-kid"" can be heavily customised throughout the game anyway. Each individual weapon and armour also has their own model which is shown in-game.GAMEPLAYThe game plays very smoothly, both in & out of combat. Outside combat you move around and interact with the environment using several abilities. Combat itself is turn-based and others a selection of attacks, abilities, ""magic"", buffs/debuffs, and a quite large variety of enemies too. The weapons and armour you use can be modded a little too. I enjoyed the fighting in SP but it could be quite easy at times. As long as you show no sentimentality to individual weapons and instead upgrade whenever you can, you can breeze through the game's combat quite easily. The game also has quite a lot of environmental traps the new-kid can spring on enemies to KO them outside of combat which is a very nice addition.SOUNDMy favourite part of SP:SoT though was the audio. The characters are all voiced exactly as they are from the show, and the scripting is very loyal to the TV show style too. The scripting also pulls no punches. It would have been easy for this game to shy away from being controversial, but instead they just went all-in and stayed true to the show. There is also a variety of background tracks that you can stumble across too. There are a lot of sound effects in combat and also little one-off comments your companions will mumble every now & again.DRAWBACKSDespite all the good I have detailed above there are some downsides to this game.1) Censorship: the EU console versions are censored, as are the Germany, Austrian, and Australian PC versions. This game is outrageously offensive and is not ashamed of it, unfortunately this means that some countries do not have the full SP:SoT experience available. Check before purchasing which version you can get!2) Bugs: the game does have some bugs. I encountered two large ones.a -- The first was my sound would not play properly as I have 5.1 speakers (the game prefers stereo). In cutscenes I could not hear characters speaking at all. I had to set Windows to stereo mode and then start the game again.b -- The second was that a previous save kept replicating itself and overwriting all of my other saves. I almost lost all progress due to this and had to manually back up my savegame.3) Narrative: the story will only appeal to fans of SP. I honestly cannot see anyone who does not like the show enjoying this game.SUMMARYIf you love South Park, then you must play this game through to the end. It is worth every second you spend with it and is the game SP fans have been waiting so long for. If you dont enjoy South Park though, then just steer well clear of this as there is nothing here for you.			"

												""Respect my Authorita!""If you are a south park fan! This is the game for you!The gameplay is turn based with a lot of focus on quick button pressing for defending against attacks making it more engaging than usual. Lot of turn based games let you decide your moves and you can sit back to see them play out, but not here. You have to pay attention, you have to understand delays in enemy attacks and block when they attack. Similarly, when you attack, you need to time it to give maximum damage. The humor is good, did not find the rpg elements to bear me down with boring side quests. Everything is South Park related. If you know the show, you will get the references. Awesome game!			"

												Everything you've come to expect from anything with the ""South Park"" name attached!  It's a fun, over the top, hilarious, gross, rediculous, dumb, great time through and through.  Each step of the adventure with the boys carries you deeper into South Park for fantastic new laughs, and lots of old laughs and inside jokes from the start of the show.The gamplay elements are simple, straight forward RPG mechanics, but that doesn't take away from the fun of beating up kids, bums, nazi fetus' and Manbearpig.  In fact I found it a relief as it let me really, just have fun in game without having to focus on heavy mechanics.  Enjoyed the story that much more.  There are TONS of weapons and costumes for you to find, Collectibles and friends to make.  Keeping you busy while you explore the whole of South Park, and beyond,  in a new and awesome way.  The atmosphere and art work are spot on and I couldn't have felt more IN South Park.All in all it was a fantasticly fun experience, with lots of laughs and fun RPG elements.  Collecting most everything and beating the game should clock you in around 10-15hours.  Very well worth the long, long wait we all had for this game.			"

												El juego en si es un delirio  de risa desde el comienzo. Con todo lo que South Park puede llegar a aportar.Se siente como un episodio bastante extenso (unas 15 horas aproximadamente :P ) lleno de referencias hilarantes a episodios de South Park por todos lados.Algo que yo hice fué ver episodios de South Park mientras estaba disfrutando del juego, y créanme que cada vez que volvía a jugar, me encontraba con algo referido a ese episodio!! así!!! Los poderes de cada raza, los poderes de Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters, Jimmy y Cartman derrochan risa.Realmente es un MUST PLAY no solo para los que miran asiduamente South Park, sino para cualquiera que quiera reirse un rato mientras disfruta de un fichín.Mi única crítica negativa va hacia 2 cosas:- Algunas peleas las extienden demasiado- Las instrucciones para los poderes y ciertos ""minijuegos"" son las instrucciones peor redactadas de todos los videojuegos que he jugado. Parecen escritas por alguien que ni siquiera sabía lo que estaba haciendo. Recomiendo que para eso usen Mouse y Teclado, para el resto usen Gamepad (el de XBOX anduvo de maravillas).Juéguenlo, se van a divertir un montón!			"

												Its good. Funny and entertaining for about 2/3rds of the game. Gets a bit stale there by the end. Also there is simply no way to see this as being worth 60$ even if youre the most die hard of south park fan.  There is zero replay value with the game as is and I doubt the humor will hold up a second time as it didnt even make it through the first.30 bucks max sounds about right. Still worth a playthrough.			"

												This game is funny as hell, including the humor from the Original South Park series, and all of the characters for that matter, This game is very well played out. From hearing Hitler Speeches, to seeing a beloved character make its return, and redemise, this game is one of the best, and Funniest I have ever played, plus it is a very simple and easy to figure out game. So Please, go get anal probed in Southpark Today!			"

												If you're like me and you've seen every single South Park episode multiple times over, you'll instantly love this game. All the characters are there, all the tried and true South Park humor is there. Was this worth the wait since I preordered it at ComicCon and saw 3 episodes of SP making fun of those who pre-bought? Absolutely. Happy gaming!			"

												This Game is a Must-Play for every South Park Fan. It feels like a real episode and you are part of it. And the RPG-systems are surprisingly good. There are references to nearly every episode of South Park ever, so if you know the Series you will find alot of fun stuff all over the City.The Game is not very challenging, I could not make out a difference between Normal and Hardcore. The most challenging thing about his Game are some of the Fart-Tutorials and some QTEs, that are nearly impossible on a normal Keyboard. The PC-Port overall is not that great, the Mouse/Keyboard Controls have problems, so better just play it with a XBOX-Pad.Overall a very fun Game! You will need 10-15hrs for a complete Playthrough, so you may want to wait for a Sale. The replay-value is not that high, its exactly the same you just have others spells if you choose a different class.I paid 30€ for it and think it was worth it. You pretty much feel your Character is a important part of a long South Park Episode.			"

												South park the stick of truth is a game about the new kid in town who gets caught up in a LARP by the gang we know so well from TV, the new kid who quickly gets the name ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag"" has to pick between Cartman and Kennys Wizard and warriors guild or Kyle and Stans druid elf guild and help them recruit people for the battle for the stick of truth, a relic that can control the universe and the rules in it. However it quickly turns out Craig who has a grudge against Cartman wants the stick for himself to create his own faction in the war band so the wizards and the druids have to join forces against himThe game is undoubtedly a lot of fun with its intentionally offensive humor, while that may turn a lot of people off from purchasing it it's definitely worth the money if you're a fan of the show and know what you're getting yourself into. It is exactly what you'd excpect there's racism, sexism, jokes about pedophilia the whole package just like you have in the show, if this is something that offends you then you might be better off staying away from this oneThe combat system is pretty interesting considering your farts can be used as a weapon as well as being able to summon characters to help you out. It was also pretty nice to see you're actually able to block yourself, something that is very uncommon in turnbased RPG games.Lengthwise it should take you about 12 hours or so to complete the game if you play on hardcore difficulty which is something that's recommended considering the game is a bit to easy otherwise.So is the game worth buying? If you're a fan of the show definitely, it'll keep you entertained for hours, I'm actually working on my second playthrough and I'm gonna play through it at least once more to get the rest of the achievement and to try all the classes. If however you're either not a fan or are one of those people who gets very easily offended then it's better to stay awayThe only major complaint I have is that all the classes feels exactly the same except for the special attacks. I always went back to using the same weapons and armor sets and went for the same perks in all the play throughs, I wish there was some more unique armor and weapon bonuses and thst the perks were somewhat more beneficial to the class yoy play In conclusion though I find it to be a pretty good game despite the aforementioned shortcomings I can't wait for fractured but whole to be released. I'll be sure to write a review for that too.			"

												I got this game via Humble Bundle's monthly game subscription, and I mention this because I never would've gotten this game otherwise.  This game has surprised me in a few ways.  First off, I tried watching South Park when I was younger, and wasn't a fan of it in the slightest, so I assumed I wouldn't like this game.  Well, first surprise, I ended up enjoying it quite a lot.  The second way it surprised me was that ALL of the adult, raunchy humor you see in the show made its way into the game.  When I say all of it, I mean all of it!  In fact, its rating of 'M' has every category that the show does, including nudity, sexual content, and drug references.  I wasn't expecting to see South Park's full blown adult content in a video game.  If you look at some of my screenshots, you will see what I mean by this.  I'm no prude by any means, but some of the stuff in this game is why I never cared for South Park.  When you first start the game, you're given the option to create your own character.  You can choose skin color, hair color clothes, glasses, and one accessory.  While the customization is basic, it's very well done.  What really impressed me about this game was that during cut scenes I forgot I was playing a game.  It looks so much like the tv show, straight down to every animation, even the graphics style.  Wile on the topic of graphics, I never had issues with lag or FPS drops.  ST:TSoT is very well optimized, and runs good even on a laptop.My biggest critique is with the combat system.  I realize this game is not intended to be some in depth combat game, but it could've been improved on.  Something I noticed frequently was that it didn't properly register when I blocked attacks.  I'd block them right on time, but it'd say I failed.  This seems to be a an issue within the game.  The combat system feels too much like Pokemon.  You attack, your oppnent attacks, use food or spell to revive, same thing over and over until someone's health is depleted.  I would've preferred if the combat system was a bit more unique.SP:TSoT utilized very minimal quick time events that are used in combat for attacking and blocking.  The quick time event is quick time.  You have a second or less to respond or you fail, and when they're trying to teach you how to do it, you have to do it right in order to advance.  Not everyone has quick reflexes and can react in under a second.  I can already see people getting stuck and frustrated because they have to click that very second.This game has full controller compatibility, and that earns it a huge plus.  I find that games like this do better with controllers.  One issue I noticed was that once a controller is plugged in, the mouse and keyboard cease to work in the game.  I do not understand why it has to be one or the other, and why both can't work at the same time.Plot/Story wise, it reminded me of the old TV show Recess.  A bunch of kids just doing normal kid things that, to them, is serious/fun.  What I really enjoyed was that the entire story seemed to be based around kids roleplaying.  It wasn't anything real serious, just a relaxed, day-by-day of what these kids do.Positives: Had some very funny easter eggs and dialogue. Stayed true to South Park's animation and feel. Nice customization for character. Runs pretty well even on a laptop. Controller support. Good plot.Negatives: Poor combat system that didn't always register your reaction. Game forced you to choose between controller or keyboard,couldn't use both. Adult/sexual humor that went too far for a video game.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators. "

												Great open-world turn based combat RPG set in the world of South Park. The game is good enough on its own merit as well as satisfies the desires of South Park fandom. Pros•	Started the game with Woad Paint (they called ""Celtic Battle Paint"" or something)•	Custom character (who is also in all the cinemas).•	South Park graphics, sounds, and humor•	Fun/simple game mechanics •	Fun/interesting equipment•	The environment was true to South Park and appropriately done for an open world game.•	Reasonable achievements (this is a new pro and con assessment that I am starting to add). The achievements in this game are basically story related, collecting a reasonable amount of hidden items (ex: 30 Chinpokemons), and accomplishing tasks in specific ways.•	Interesting story with many fun South Park throwbacks but still be enjoyable even if you aren’t a South Park fan.•	Pretty much everythingCons•	I didn’t see Towlie, except on a loading screen •	The ending cinemas for me started glitching out and made my character invisible. Didn’t bother me too much because I basically played the game like 10hrs straight. •	A handful of times traveling the map became a chore but they had a lot of fast travel locations which helped make up the difference.•	Though this is simply nit-picking but equipment comparison stats didn’t seem accurate. It would tell me a melee weapon of 50-100 (x3) was better than a melee weapon that was 70-121 (x3) + fire damage. The weapon stats were accurate by themselves but a few weapons were indicated better or worse which were not.			"

												I never thought it was possible to laugh so much while playing a videogame.This game is basically like a long funny movie, and it has everything; Canada, Aliens, Gnomes, Man-Bear-Pig. What more could you ask for??? It's the first video game I've played through multiple times and gotten all achievements for- the game play is obviously very easy (even on the very hard setting) but the story was quite entertaining (to say the least).

												Great open-world turn based combat RPG set in the world of South Park. The game is good enough on its own merit as well as satisfies the desires of South Park fandom. Pros•	Started the game with Woad Paint (they called ""Celtic Battle Paint"" or something)•	Custom character (who is also in all the cinemas).•	South Park graphics, sounds, and humor•	Fun/simple game mechanics •	Fun/interesting equipment•	The environment was true to South Park and appropriately done for an open world game.•	Reasonable achievements (this is a new pro and con assessment that I am starting to add). The achievements in this game are basically story related, collecting a reasonable amount of hidden items (ex: 30 Chinpokemons), and accomplishing tasks in specific ways.•	Interesting story with many fun South Park throwbacks but still be enjoyable even if you aren’t a South Park fan.•	Pretty much everythingCons•	I didn’t see Towlie, except on a loading screen •	The ending cinemas for me started glitching out and made my character invisible. Didn’t bother me too much because I basically played the game like 10hrs straight. •	A handful of times traveling the map became a chore but they had a lot of fast travel locations which helped make up the difference.•	Though this is simply nit-picking but equipment comparison stats didn’t seem accurate. It would tell me a melee weapon of 50-100 (x3) was better than a melee weapon that was 70-121 (x3) + fire damage. The weapon stats were accurate by themselves but a few weapons were indicated better or worse which were not.			"

												I got this game via Humble Bundle's monthly game subscription, and I mention this because I never would've gotten this game otherwise.  This game has surprised me in a few ways.  First off, I tried watching South Park when I was younger, and wasn't a fan of it in the slightest, so I assumed I wouldn't like this game.  Well, first surprise, I ended up enjoying it quite a lot.  The second way it surprised me was that ALL of the adult, raunchy humor you see in the show made its way into the game.  When I say all of it, I mean all of it!  In fact, its rating of 'M' has every category that the show does, including nudity, sexual content, and drug references.  I wasn't expecting to see South Park's full blown adult content in a video game.  If you look at some of my screenshots, you will see what I mean by this.  I'm no prude by any means, but some of the stuff in this game is why I never cared for South Park.  When you first start the game, you're given the option to create your own character.  You can choose skin color, hair color clothes, glasses, and one accessory.  While the customization is basic, it's very well done.  What really impressed me about this game was that during cut scenes I forgot I was playing a game.  It looks so much like the tv show, straight down to every animation, even the graphics style.  Wile on the topic of graphics, I never had issues with lag or FPS drops.  ST:TSoT is very well optimized, and runs good even on a laptop.My biggest critique is with the combat system.  I realize this game is not intended to be some in depth combat game, but it could've been improved on.  Something I noticed frequently was that it didn't properly register when I blocked attacks.  I'd block them right on time, but it'd say I failed.  This seems to be a an issue within the game.  The combat system feels too much like Pokemon.  You attack, your oppnent attacks, use food or spell to revive, same thing over and over until someone's health is depleted.  I would've preferred if the combat system was a bit more unique.SP:TSoT utilized very minimal quick time events that are used in combat for attacking and blocking.  The quick time event is quick time.  You have a second or less to respond or you fail, and when they're trying to teach you how to do it, you have to do it right in order to advance.  Not everyone has quick reflexes and can react in under a second.  I can already see people getting stuck and frustrated because they have to click that very second.This game has full controller compatibility, and that earns it a huge plus.  I find that games like this do better with controllers.  One issue I noticed was that once a controller is plugged in, the mouse and keyboard cease to work in the game.  I do not understand why it has to be one or the other, and why both can't work at the same time.Plot/Story wise, it reminded me of the old TV show Recess.  A bunch of kids just doing normal kid things that, to them, is serious/fun.  What I really enjoyed was that the entire story seemed to be based around kids roleplaying.  It wasn't anything real serious, just a relaxed, day-by-day of what these kids do.Positives: Had some very funny easter eggs and dialogue. Stayed true to South Park's animation and feel. Nice customization for character. Runs pretty well even on a laptop. Controller support. Good plot.Negatives: Poor combat system that didn't always register your reaction. Game forced you to choose between controller or keyboard,couldn't use both. Adult/sexual humor that went too far for a video game.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators. "

												If you're a fan of South Park, purchasing this is a no-brainer. I'm so happy this game was as good as I hoped it would be and more. I used to play loads of turn-based RPGs back in the day but eventually became disinterested with them after a couple disappointing titles (Star Ocean 4, Tales of Vesperia and Final Corridor XIII), but Obsidian have created a combat system which is both simple and yet has complexities which fits perfectly with Trey Parker and Matt Stone's hilarious writing and sense of humour. At several points during this game I had to stop playing because I was laughing so hard.Being an Obsidian game, I was expecting a ton of bugs but surprisingly enough there were very few (mainly some patch equipping and stuck in cutscenes issues). I'm glad they took time to hire a competent QA department this time round as I think the amount of bugs present in Fallout: New Vegas upon release unfortunately impacted the reception of a game which ultimately was better than Fallout 3 in many ways.The Stick of Truth is one of those games where you can't talk about it in much detail with someone who is a fan of South Park but has yet to play it, because you don't want to spoil the sheer enjoyment they'll have from playing this game. You're actually excited for them to play and experience it for themselves - it's that ♥♥♥♥ing good.			"

												If you don't enjoy South Park tv series, I'm sure you won't enjoy The Stick of Truth - as this game is being closer to a long episode from the show than to a cRPG. Battles are easy and the system is very simple, yet I wasn't bored, as enemies are so, uh, unusual you are waiting what kind of wacky attack they will use next.I used to watch South Park season 1 back in the... 1998? but didn't come back watching after that (if it was on some public channel I would, most likely), so going back to South Park and meeting all these new (to me) characters was an awesome experience. Especially when this ""dungeons and dragons"" story is just a kid's game of pretending to be wizards, warriors etc., with everyone being fully aware of that and throwing comments like ""what's with this stupid turn-based system?"" and more: farts are ""magic"", coffee is a ""speed potion"" etc. and I enjoyed this aspect of the game world a lot.There is only one thing I didn't like (besides it being so short, as I really wanted the game to last longer and was sad it's already over): some songs are recycled from the show and don't fit the theme, for example there is Lemmiwinks song, yet you are the ""hero"" now...? Same goes with abortion song mentioning ""Christmas"", which is out of place in the context of the game story.Anyway if you enjoy South Park, you should enjoy this game as well, despite its simplicity.

												Spoiler warning--------------------------------When ""South Park"" came out in the late 90's, people's reactions equal part shock and euphoria. It was an adult comedy series that joked coarse and tasteless with everyone and everything, while it was sharp social satire far more daring than ""The Simpsons"".Although it has dropped a couple of ""South Park"" games, none of those have had the blessing from creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. that's one of the reason they set out to create ""South Park: The Stick of Truth ,"" in which they both wrote the script.In the Colorado town of South Park played out a bizarre story, where the TV show's most prominent figures - Cartman- Kenny - Stan - Kyle - playing fantasy war. On the ""magician Cartman's"" backyard, people have their base while "" Elvenking  Kyle"" harboring elves, and they fight over a tree stick called ""The Stick of Truth ."" You play a newly arrived nine year old who ends up in the middle of this death serious fantasy LARP . In typical ""South Park"" spirit the story takes an extra absurd turn when the town get's hit by a Nazi zombie virus.""The stick of truth"" is eerily like the original, with its expressive 2d graphics and its austere character animations. It really feels like ""South Park "": during the game, I get to interact with all the familiar characters, from Al Gore and goth gang to the Canadian duo Terrence and Philip.Although the story is wicked enough to be directly taken from the TV series, and scripted authors presence is palpable. The story is a mix of a sometimes incredibly entertaining operation with video-game conventions, social satire, American politics, infantile fart humor and tasteless joke.Sometimes it hits the humor just right and I choke with laughter: as when you finally get access to Canada and it appears to exist in 8-bit graphics, according to the old ""The Legend of Zelda "" formula. the jokes Sometimes miss the banter with the mile-long distance. The game has been censored in many countries worldwide. In particular two sequences , one of which takes place at an abortion clinic, and the other one which deals with♥♥♥♥♥♥ i did expect ""South Park"" to trample over all boundaries regarding which substances may be making fun about, but in the absence of satirical sophistication, as on these occasions, it becomes just sickening.It turns out to still be the meta fun and sometimes sharp script, along with the familiar characters carrying the game. Despite its twisted storyline and sick humor is ""The Stick of Truth "" namely a surprisingly standardized role play, with turn-based battles and focus on upgrading your armor. Although the childish armor and weapons makes me gigg. the fights quckly become repetitive. The fighting takes a long time, and I tire soon to dull stare at the same attacks again and again. The missions you should perform is even more monotonous, as most is to knock down a certain number of enemies or collect a certain number of gadgets. It is a boring and totally uninspired design.Although the game has its brilliant moments, it is uneven. Sure it's fun to watch ""South Park"" realized properly in the game medium, but it nowhere near as clever and thoughtful as I d expected.			"

												An exciting discovery, South Park: The Stick of Truth is actually a very good RPG.  The story is, to put it bluntly, fantastic as it feels like I played a fourteen hour South Park episode where I was starring as a fellow eight year old who has moved to the small town.  The mechanics are relatively simple but entertaining and engaging enough that they didn't feel like a negative aspect at any point in the game.The game is packed full of adventures that are new and yet familiar for any fans, or even casual watchers, of South Park.  You'll be running around all over South Park and the surrounding area and getting into trouble with all of your favorite characters throughout.  I haven't watched as much of the show as I would like though the person I was playing it with is a huge fan and we both laughed our asses off through the entirety of it all the same.  It even led to her bringing up clips of what certain items and locations were in reference to which made the game all that much more enjoyable.The combat mechanics are similar to what I remember of Mario RPG in that every character has a variety of abilities that require pressing buttons at the right time or rotating the stick to get the full effect.  It kept combat interesting and engaging even with the relatively simple system.  The item system was fun as you find the most obnoxious weapons and gear and you can customize them with ""strap-ons"" that you find.I had twice the blast I was expecting from this game and I was expecting a good game.  I highly recommend this game to RPG gamers, South Park fans, and anyone looking for an extremely inappropriate adventure involving elves, nazis, aliens, and giant fetuses.  Give it a go and you won't be disappointed!			"

												Assuming you like the ""South Park"" television show, I'm Recommending the game ""South Park:  The Stick of Truth.""  It's essentially exactly like the show.  In the same vein, if you don't like the show, I wouldn't recommend the game.  That said, I have no idea how they got this game to market without some kind of Adult Only rating.  There's a LOT of really foul and disgusting stuff in it.  But, again, that's just like the show.Anyway, I got 30 hours of really good game play out of it with 100% Achievements (10 hours for Day 1, 8 hours each for Days 2 and 3, and another 4 hours getting my remaining Achievements during the ""Day"" after the game finishes).  So, by my dollar an hour standard metric, I'd say it's worth buying at anything under $30.I do have some issues with the game:- My biggest problem is the huge number of missable Achievements (by ""missable,"" I mean that if you don't do certain things at certain times, the option to do so disappears forever and you miss Achievements).  This is extremely frustrating.- Even though you can save at any point, the saves only save back to the last checkpoint (which is usually very close to your current position (most likely when you entered the room)).  The problem with this is that you might have done a missable activity in that period between the checkpoint and your saving, think you've done what needs doing, and then lose it upon loading.  This happened to me with two separate Achievements.- Every time you start the game, you're treated to four non-skippable logo animations.  The only way to get rid of those is to rename four files.- The controls for magic (i.e., farting) are really confusing.  When you first get a ""spell,"" you go through some training.  Yet the method you're trained to use is never used anywhere else in the game.  Along with that, the method you actually use is different depending on if you're in combat or not.  Also, in combat during the early part of the game, you're giving an option to use the F key to ""cast"" the ""spell"" with some of your weapons.  That flat out doesn't work.  Later in the game, the instruction changes to say to use the W key.  That works.Other than that, no issues.  The game is a lot of fun that follows the South Park theme perfectly.  Recommended for those who like the show.NOTE:  if you're the type of person who doesn't do Achievements, then the game will probably be far shorter for you.  I've seen posts saying the game only lasts 11 to 15 hours that way.  I have no idea why someone would spend good money on a game and then not complete it (even though they've reached the finish line).  But, if that applies to you, be aware of the duration difference.			"

												In this day and age, the standard retail game costs around $60, and provides either 1-2 hours of gameplay, or a large amount of gameplay, with no replay value at all . South Park: The Stick of Truth is a funny, well made game that fits snuggly inbetween both examples above.  I finished the game after about 10 hours of playing, which is very respectable, and provides you with juuuust enough that, perhaps later on, you'll pick up a mouse and keyboard (Or controller) and try it again. The dialogue is hilarious, the gameplay is good, and Mr. Slave's... ""storage"" is scary. You can meet all your more known South Park characters, like Randy Marsh, Mr. Hankey, The Underpants Gnomes... Jesus... But its not necessary to do so, and you can just go along the story without giving a damn. I did not stray from the main quest, and to reach 10 hours with minimal sidequest completion is great. You don't have to go into places you don't want to, either. I know you can enter the sewers, but I decided not to unless the game forced me, after a long history of playing games with forced sewer gameplay. I was quite happy that I didn't have to go at all. As a result, I didn't meet The Christmas Poo, but I could live with that.The idea of a silent protagonist was obviously going to be a difficult thing to pull off, and South Park Studios and Obsidian Entertainment have pulled it off successfully. So congratulations to them. One thing I was unhappy with was the abilities, and how the were performed. almost everything involved mashing buttons on the keyboard or mouse. Wanted to poop? Mash a button. Want to use Jimmys abilities? Mash a button. Want Cartman to fat? Mash a button. It was very tedious and something I never really wanted to do after a while - But in order to win against many opponents, you needed to either A: mash these buttons, or B: use the normal attack, which did absolutely pitiful amounts of damage lategame. If you resorted to option B, you STILL have to press buttons, only this time, instead of mashing, it was timed with little ""Ding"" sounds, and a little flashing light. After a while, you could play the game with your eyes closed. In fact, to test this, I beat the final boss with my eyes closed (Except for the finale, which isn't really a battle. But I won't spoil it). Is the game good? I'd say so.Is it replayable? Maybe after a while.Do I recommend it? Well, if you don't mind mashing singular buttons, which are being timed against you, and are occaisionally difficult to pull off (such as creating♥♥♥♥♥♥Nuggets), then I guess its worth the money.

												This is just as fun as i thought it would be. Nothing is left out from the tv series, and theres even t!ts (more than kenny-chans.) Its by far the most expensive game i've purchased on steam, But..it seems worth it. Different classes and achievements to unlock, Its made me laugh numerous times and when i first bought it i played until i was too tired and about to pass out.. and then i played some more. So i can highly recommend this, I've not spotted any cons.			"

												South Park: The Stick is Truth is no doubt a fantastic video-game adaptation, and I can heartily recommend this to any South Park fan. The gameplay is, sadly, far too easy and at times poorly explained, but it is most definitely a joy to play. Though not very lengthy, roughly 12 hours, it is from start to finish fantastic. Again, the one glaring issue I had came down to the almost utter lack of difficulty (And I then recommend anyone to put it on ""Hardcore"" from the start, sadly that is still far too easy) but the amazingly true-to-South-Park style more than makes up for that, with fantastic combat variety. A light and yet highly entertaining RPG that feels and plays like an extended South Park episode. Simply can't recommend it enough.Full review:

												This game is simply amazing. Most tie in games are terrible and made only to make money or cash in on something that is popular at the moment.  Trey and Matt, along with Obsidian Ent. have crafted a wonderful game that looks and feels like South Park, on top of being very fun to play.This has been a dream type game for me over the years, something I would create in Game Dev Tycoon... take my favorite rpg developers and stick them with working with the south park writers on a south park RPG. It looks and feels like the damn tv show for crying out loud! Obsidian has done it again, managed to keep me glued to the monitor hours into the night. I have never laughed anywhere close to this much during a game, it is laugh out loud hilarious and will have you on the floor laughing non stop.There could be more pc settings and it could use a little balance in difficulty but those are the only negatives I can think of. The combat is fun, the story and writing is top notch, as is the atmosphere and the controls. They could have done a crap game and made money with the South Park license but instead the writers and Obsidian have put there heart and soul into this game.If you are a South Park fan or an Obsidian fan like me, don't even think twice go and buy this game ASAP. If you are on the fence about this game go read Giantbombs revierw (5/5), PC gamers review or even go watch Total Biscuits WTF is South Park vide on youtube, agree with those the most so far. Only 3-4 hours into it so far but boy have I had a blast! Cartman and all you're favorite south park characters are here as you (The new Kid in town) go on adventures while laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off. MUST OWN game, Obsidian and Trey/Matt deserve a pat on the back for a job well done. You can tell it was made with a ton of love and not just as a money cash in.			"

												I Havent enjoyed a game this much in years, and here are a few reason why;- You are a new kid, which works because you get to experence playing with the cast of south park- Magic farts- Every character you love is in it (even a few surprise appearances)- Turn based combat with some depth- Ways to win battles without fighting- 3 levels of difficulty (i played on normal and i had a few hard moments)- Butters, Jimmy, Kenny, Cartman, Kyle, or Stan fight with you- Tons of surprises for fans of the tv series- Collectibles (i got them all during my 14 hour run of the game)There are some things wrong with the game, they didnt ruin my experience but it may for some;- Travel in South park is tedius- Combat is too simple after you get the hang of it- Not much to do after you beat the game; no end game content or new game plus			"

												This game captures the spirit of South Park really well, and perhaps more surprisingly, has legitimately interesting and fun mechanics. The combat is fun, out of combat is fun, the story is fun, and, of course, the characters are fun. It's entertaining enough that you can play while someone watches and they won't get bored (my girl sat through the whole damn thing). It's not very long though, which isn't so much a hit against it, as it was just the right length to pick up and beat in a weekend (along with all the side quests). I will also say that it's not very challenging however. The pacing promises that you will always have more abilities than you'll really know what to do with, money and items come easily, and if you pay enough attention to the mechanics to have a specific build, you will steamroll most encounters (although the enemy variety may muck you up if you're too focused around one subset of mechanics).If I had to gripe about anything, it would be the inventory which felt clunky, and was organized alphabetically rather than say by level (the name of an item doesn't really provide as much context as the level requirements).Totally worth the sale price. Eagerly awaiting the sequel (or DLC xpac).			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is an amazingly crafted South Park game and an even more well crafted RPG. With typical South Park fashion, if you do not find the show funny I urge you to stay away from this game. It is South Park’s humor to the extreme. On the plus side, if you really enjoy South Parks humor, this is the game for you.9.3/10http://zombiesatemygames.com/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth/ "

												In brief: extremely high quality RPG that will definitely NOT appeal to anyone who doesn't like South Park.In boxers: Although South Park has had several games in the past (most notably the incredibly dull Turok 2 TC), it's only in recent years that the makers of the show, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have been directly involved in the making of any tie-in games, and it shows. The quality of these games has improved dramatically, finally culminating in The Stick of Truth, a truly fantastic experience that feels like a true labour of love from everyone involved.Playing as The New Kid (who you can customize to an almost insane degree), you barely last 30 seconds outside before  you're drawn in to the Warriors and Wizards-style LARPing of the other South Park kids, joining up with Cartman and (Princess) Kenny's humans to take on Stan and Kyle's Drow Elves for possession of the titular Stick of Truth - which is blatantly just a Macguffin designed to keep the game going.Trey and Matt directly approached Obsidian Entertainment to develop this game due to Trey's love of RPGs, and it turned out to be an inspired choice. The game is an RPG through and through, and a pretty damn good one at that. There are four character classes you can choose from - Warrior, Mage, Thief and (of course) Jew - though aside from the special attacks each class gains, there's really not a whole lot of difference between each one. It's the combat where the differences to standard JRPGs show up to add variety to things.First is the addition of quick-time style button prompts when attacking or defending which allow you to increase the damage you dish out or reduce the amount you take. Learning to use this is not only massively helpful in battle, but it also means you never feel uninvolved in combat, which is a welcome change from the norm. You can also use an item AND attack in the same turn, which, while offering a large degree of tactical usefulness, does mean that combat rarely becomes particularly challenging as a result, especially once you discover the importance of status effects.There's four main effects you can apply to enemies - Bleeding, Freezing, Grossed Out and On Fire. Each of these has its own pros and cons, but once you realise how easy it is to apply them (especially once you find ranged weapons that can hit multiple opponents), you'll quickly come to find that combat loses a huge amount of its appeal and ends up losing a lot of its appeal as a result.That said, if the combat ends up becoming a bit of a chore, then it's fortunate that little else about the game does.There is a surprisingly large amount to do in this game, from finding Jesus (twice) to catching all the Chinpokemon to dealing with the homeless problem, there's an absolute ton of things to do around South Park, which is rendered absolutely perfectly. It really does look and feel exactly like the TV show, to the point where anyone passing by might ask you what episode you're watching. A huge amount of work has gone into making this a faithful adaptation, and it shows.Length-wise, the game will last you anywhere between 12-15 hours, which may seem short, but unlike most RPGs there's very little wasted time here. The level cap is 15, which you'll hit around the 2/3rds point, and once you hit that you can pretty much just avoid combat entirely and focus on finishing the story, which is every bit as insane as the show itself, taking in aliens, goth kids, cootie-ridden girls, abortions, Zombie Nazis and Canada. Not necessarily in that order.Trey and Matt voice the majority of the characters as in the show, along with a few others helping them along the way, and although a few characters sound a little off (Officer Barbrady in particular sounds like someone doing an impression of him rather than the original voice actor) there's a huge number of characters from the show's history on display here in one form or another. There's a few people missing, but then again if they included everyone there wouldn't be much wiggle room for a sequel now, would there?Some people will tell you that there's plenty of replayability to be had, but those people are talking out of their anal probes. There's few differences between classes, rendering that aspect rather pointless, and there's only one point where the plot splits... which lasts all of 30 minutes before both paths snap back into one. Any replayability to be gained is simply from wanting to experience the plot elements a second time, which is certainly valid, but this really isn't a game designed to be played over and over again.Which leads to the price. I can't help feeling that paying full price for this game is really justified. It may be a good game - and trust me, it's VERY good - but on Steam they're asking for £40, which is far too much. It's worth around half that. Also, don't bother purchasing the clothing packs (the 'Samurai Spaceman' and 'Ultimate Fellowship' bundles), as they simply add extra outfits that, while nice, don't really add anything to the game itself and serve only as basic pre-order nonsense. If they decide to release story-based DLC (and I hope they do!), then that'll be worth a look, but I wouldn't recommend anything else.This is very much a South Park game first and an RPG second, so if you're not willing to get on board with the twisted, insane humour of the show then you won't find much to entertain you here, especially once the game really gets going. But for everyone else, this is a fantastic game with few flaws that I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending.Because really, what other game lets you throw a bloody tampon at enemies, then whack them with a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gross them out, circumcise them, cause them to bleed into unconsciousness and then fart on them when they're lying beaten and broken on the ground? (And no, I'm not making a word of that up.)			"

												I'm going to say this is one of the best RPG's ever made in my opinion. Yes, it IS short, be warned about that beforehand, you'll finish the game in 25 hours if you take your sweet time, and you should, because what makes this game so good it's the amount of detail put into it. Rushing past everything would be playing this game wrong, this isn't to be played in a hurry. Actually, the game expects a little of thinking and observation from your part with a lot of puzzles, for example those optional ones to take down enemies without the need to fight them. Even if you're not a fan of the TV series or RPG's in general you'll find that this is a well made game, with a good flow both in history and combat. The battle and overworld mechanics are fresh, entertaining and feel just right. Obviously there is a lot of foul language and even things that people might find objectionable, but that and it's blend of comedy put into a videogame is what makes this one a unique experience you will never find elsewhere nowhere soon, because what the creators of this game took is a big risk, the kind of risk that videogame developers are less and less likely to take when it comes to games of this budget. Why? Because the game has no real replay value, all the effort that was put into this game, you will experience it in it's single run. No grinds, no replays, no hooks. If you're looking for a different experience when it comes to RPG's I really think you should give this one a try.			"

												Start this game expecting a decent South Park game. It turns out better than my expectation.- An enjoyable RPG.- The story kept my interest throughout the game. - The content is good enough and doesn't feel draggy. The collectibles are fun to search and collect.- The turn based combat mechanics are not too complex but also not too simple. Although your starting job might impact your battle experience throughout the game. The companion system allows you to determine your own combat strats. - The most important thing is that it is a South Park game first . Every element in this game has that South Park feel.Would recommend to others. Onto the next game!			"

												Gameplay: Relatively simply turn-based combat, made interesting with many different weapons, spells, items and other variables that keep the action consistently engaging and fun throughout the game. There are also many different types of enemies that help to keep up combat variety (although there are occassional difficulty spikes with certain bosses). As you go through the campaign, you will unlock new abilities that will unlock previously unlockable parts of the map, which encourages you to explore the levels and also revisit them later on. Story: Typical South Park fare, well written with plenty of satire, relating to various worldwide events, art pieces and celebrities. The story has many twists and is deeper than it initially seems. Many of the side quests are creatively designed, with interesting plots and characters.Graphics: The game looks just like an actual episode of South Park, the animation is perfectly done and brings the town of South Park and its inhabitants to life. Each location is overflowing with various references to seasons 1 to 17 and each character/item/location is based on some aspect of the ongoing South Park canon. Sound: Each character is authentically voiced, and often have very funny dialogues. A surprising amount of wit is injected into various minor remarks and it is definitely worth exploring each characters range of lines. As well as the voice acting, the music is very well done, with various songs from throughout the multitude of South Park seasons (and even certain songs from the movies) making an appearance throughout the game. Just as good as these songs is the game's original soundtrack, which is an epic, lustrous score.Re-playability: The town of South Park is littered with collectables and loot, with quests abounding and secrets ever-present in each section. Replaying the game is also incentivised by the inclusion of character-specific achievements and abilities, and will be essential for the completionist or OCD afflicted.			"

												If you're a fan of South Park, you NEED to get this game. I got it on sale, but honestly, it would have been worth the full price. I'm a huge fan of South Park and have been for years. I've seen just about every episode, many of them multiple times. In a way, this game is a tribute to the TV series. It references past episodes and characters and is very nostalgic at times. That alone hooked me. There's so much charm to this game, but perhaps the most charming thing about it is it's authenticity in relation to the show. It's like you're playing through an entire season of the series and you really feel like you're in South Park. Story:You're the new kid and your family just moved to South Park. Your parents encourage you to go outside and make some new friends. Soon after leaving your house, you meet Butters, who becomes your first friend and introduces you to The Wizard King, better known as Cartman. While there, you'll also meet Clyde, Scott Malkinson and Kenny...Princess Kenny. Cartman reveals to you The Stick Of Truth and explains that there is a war between the humans (Cartman's group) and elves (Kyle's group) who are each trying to possess the stick. During the explanation, Kyle's elves attack Cartman's base and your journey begins.Gameplay:The gameplay is really fun and very immersive. You start the game by editing your character's appearance to your liking. You can choose your hair style, skin tone, clothes, etc. And no, you can't play as a female. If you've ever played Paper Mario, this feels a lot like it. Your party consists of Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, Stan, Kyle and Jimmy. Each of them you will meet and acquire as you progress throughout the story. You can battle alongside one party member at a time, who each have different and unique abilities. There's even special friends you can summon to help you in battle once per day, which consists of Mr. Lu Kim, Jesus, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Slave. As you win battles and progress through the game, you'll gain XP and level up. Once you level up, you'll be able to upgrade your abilities. The game also puts a heavy emphasis on farting. That should come as no surprise to any fan of South Park. You'll learn different types of farts throughout the game that you can use both in and out of battle. You can't run from random encounters once you're in battle, but you can attempt to run from an enemy before the encounter in order to avoid it. This is very convenient because it gives you a chance to continue with whatever you're doing if you don't feel like fighting and it keeps the turn-based system from being an annoying pest like it is in other RPGs. The game offers many side quests and things to collect. Sure, you could just rush the game and complete the main story, but you'd be missing out on so much. There's a total of 120 friends to make. Many of them will ask you to do something for them before befriending you. There's also 30 chinpokomon to collect as well as equipment and weapons to find and purchase.The Negatives:When it comes to the negatives of this game, many have complained that it's too short. After beating the game, collecting every chinpokomon, making every friend and unlocking nearly every achievement, my save clocked in at 17 hours. However, this doesn't include the amount of time I've spent playing and loading past saves after losing in battle or to get something I missed or forgot about. So if we're counting all of that, Steam shows I put in 30 hours, which I would say is a good amount of time. I still would have liked for this to be longer simply due to how much fun I had with it. I had a feeling of sadness when the end credits came on because I didn't want it to end. Another complaint some have had is that you can only level up to level 15. On the surface this sounds annoying, but you'll easily defeat most enemies at this point and leveling higher would be unnecessary. Other complaints I have is that there were some characters and locations that weren't included in the game such as Raisins, Hells Pass Hospital, Grandpa Marsh, Satan, Towelie and Kyle's cousin. Also, there are some collectibles in the game that are only accessible during a certain quest, leaving them forever unobtainable if you forget to pick them up. So if you're a completionist or if you're very OCD about collecting things like I am, this can become upsetting. Overall though, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I'm sure that many of the negatives such as the missing characters and locations will be corrected if we get a sequel, which I'm URGENTLY awaiting by the way. Make it happen, Matt and Trey.Conclusion:If you're a fan of South Park, I'd HIGHLY recommend this. The game stays true to the TV series. It feels authentic because quite frankly, it is. You feel like you're actually playing out a season of South Park. The game offers a good story, immersive gameplay and lots of laughs along the way.			"

												South Park™: The Stick of Truth™ Now that the new South Park™ game has just been announced at E3 2016, namely, South Park™: The Fractured but Whole™, I thought it would be a good idea to write a review, for perhaps one of the most ingenious and epicus Role Playing Games of all time. This review will definitely contain certain spoilers, which could, or could not affect your gameplay's sentimental value. You have been warned. To start off, I would like to introduce you to your character, and how your choice of class could affect the game.When you first start the game, you will be prompted to customize your character. Your character could become both male and female. Now, while I have done five different playthroughs, I still haven't had a chance to play as a female character, so I'm unsure on whether or not it will affect the gameplay or not. Take this particular part with a grain of salt. Anyways, after you're done customizing your character, you will learn that you and your parents has moved into a house, located in South Park, Colorado. After a cut-scene, explaining why you moved to South Park, you will be greeted by Butters the Paladin. He will be your friend from this point on. After that, you will meet Cartman, or rather, The Grand Wizard. You two will have a chat, and afterwards, it's time to do perhaps one of the most important choices, in the game - to pick a class. There are four different classes, these four classes are: Fighter, Mage, Thief or Jew. I usually tend to become a Mage, because as Cartman mentions in-game, ""a Mage is like a wizard, only not as cool."" But that's up to personal preference. The only difference is the fact that your special abilities will change, as well as a meet-able character, namely, Jesus, will ask you if ""we're cool?"" There are none other significant changes made, which could alter the gameplay in any way, shape or form. You will still be called a Dou*hebag, and the game will progress, as normally.Oh and... did I mention that one of the main ability focuses in this game, has to do with Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor, or FART, for short? However, I choose to call it flatulence, because it's a lot more mature.Now to the next part, the story-line. Now, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, has created the story themselves, with the assistance of other people over at South Park™ Studios™. Because of this, you will find a large variety of ""inside-jokes"", as well as references to previous episodes. In typical South Park fashion, the story-line will quickly escalate, and the Stick of Truth, which is the most powerful relic in their universe, according to Cartman - gets stolen. This does of course mean that you will engage into both the main quests in the game, as well as hilarious side quests, which varies from befriending Al Gore, to getting rid of Al Gore as an internet friend, due to him spamming your email with sightings of the very mythical creature, known only as the ""ManBearPig"". You will also be able to massacre the Mongolians, inside the Tower of Peace, thanks to the owner of ""Sh*tty Wok"". You can also help the mayor get rid of all of the homeless people around South park. As well as, helping the Underpant Gnomes getting a total of six underpants. The Underpant Gnomes does also have an influence upon the story-line, later on. I decided to make this specific part of my review, centered around the very mysterious and interesting beings, which finally had their own mission dedicated to them. I am of course talking about... the Aliens. Yes, the Aliens have returned, and they are not friendly. You will be taken to one of their ships, were on both the PC, and the none Australian or European console release - you'll get probed by the Aliens, which means that you will have to break the alien prober... while it's still in your rect*m. The object inside your rect*m will venture further inside of you, and it will become a special ability of it's own, allowing you to teleport to certain areas of the map, previously inaccessible. I will not comment any more on this matter, I'm just writing this of off what actually happens during that mission. Anyways, after a while, the UFO will crash. Despite many small pieces getting spread around the streets of South Park, the UFO itself, crashes into the South Park mall. This does of course lead to a massive cover up by the Government, which involves making people believe that they are actually making a new Taco Bell restaurant, even though the UFO clearly sticks out, for everyone to see. Later on, a person named the ""Big Bad Government Guy"", whose the main antagonist of this story - will, how can I say this without spoiling the ultimate series of plot twists ever done in a video game to my knowledge before? Let's just say that he sets a chain of events in motion... I will not say anything more than that. These are just some of the things you will experience during your playthrough, and I hope you enjoy the game, because I definitely recommend it, over literally any other game, except for a few triple-A titles, I will choose to not mention during this particular review. Just to mention a few guest apparences from the TV show: My Hankey, Nazi Zombie Chef, Al Gore (obviously), the Woodland Critters, Terrence and Phillip and many more! The final verdict? 9/10, or rather 97/100 to be even more specific. This game has everything you would have wanted from a South park™ game, and everything from the characters, to the gameplay elements, to the combat and even the Achievements, feels very South Park-esque. The only thing that actually bothers me, is the fact that there were several pieces of content that were cut for unknown reasons, I will not mention what type of content it was, but I advice you to check out the original E3 2012 Trailer and to search for ""South Park™: The Stick of Truth™ cut/scrapped content"". You will not like what you will see. Despite this, the finished product delivered more than expected, and to be honest, I'm more hyped about the new Sequel - South Park™: The Fractured but Whole™, than any other game this year. For future references, I will choose to display the date for today, as well as the current build version underneath this section of the review, because this review deserves a few updates every now and then. Have a great day! And thank you for taking your time to read my Review of South Park: The Stick of Truth. Bye! Adios! Auf Wiedersehen! Chao! and so on...Version 1.0.4 - 23th of June, 2016, 05:23 PM PDT - just because South Park™ Studios™ is located in California :D			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is game that will thoroughly please both South Park fans or anyone who enjoys its sense of humour. As apposed to the majority of the half-a s s e d movie or TV show video game adaptations The Stick of Truth is just as brilliant as it's source material being South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park) had a major involvement in the game creating all the story and dialogue, consulted on with the design, and they voiced many of the characters of the game and it's just brimming with personality. As for the combat and gameplay mechanics of The Stick of Truth, the battle system is surprisingly fun to use using timing with attacks meaning the combat requires you to participate. The abilities that are exclusive to each class are really fun and unique to use and do not go unused and are used frequently in battle as apposed to other RPGs which consist of turn based combat with the main use of neutral attacks. If you like South Park's bizarre and crude humour (whether or not you've been been a frequent watcher of the show) and also like RPGs this game is for you. It's really good, I'm super cereal.			"

												When I play this game, I feel like i'm literally in a South Park episode... except I can control whatever happens.Characters really stand out without feeling forced or weak in this... they will be exactly how they are in the show.Unlike most RPGs where you take turns fighting.. it's pretty much like that, except you can try blocking enemy attacks to weaken the damage or even make it backfire depending on how you're playing.Comedy is pretty good, loving the golden moments referencing stuff from the actual show.FYI - This game is not only perfect for fans of the show, but it's a darn good game on it's own. Side quests are actually fun to do and never feeling like a chore... thank god. Warning: A bit to sexual or gross sometimes, but if you can handle it, then go for it!			"

												VERY fun game.   I give it a 8/10It has a very good RPG element both in-combat and out of combat..  Alot of secrets can be found, as well as avoiding combat by finding various world items to use against the enemies.The jokes are hilarious, what you would expect from a southpark show / game.It does have uncensored things ( like swearing, and some people being fully Naked. etc) , so be warned.What I didnt like about it, was 2 things.. --The game was a bit to short.  I managed to beat it in only 5-6 hours of game time. for the story and most of the side quests. Not including the collections like chinpokomon.-- The other was that the villans of the game, While I wont say what they are because of spoilers, It is just an overdone enemy.  They even confirmed it in-game, which i found funny. they did try to mix it up a bit, i'll give it that. but in the  end of the day, the villans are what they are.Overall!   Though the game was short, and I rolled my eyes when I found out what i'd be fighting most of the game, I did have ALOT of fun. Worth the 30$ I spent.  I plan on replaying it as a new class.			"

South Park: The Stick of Truth - ReviewTable Of Contents: Gameplay Fighting Collecting Writing  Story Dialouge Conclusion  Final Thoughts Overall GradeGameplay Fighting      While most would believe gamplay and or anything for that matter would take a back seat to the comedy in a south park game, but no! Ive had many tense and tactical experiences while fighting nazi zombies, and nazi zombie...babies! This shows the writers, designers, and programmers came together to create comedy during extremely tense situations (the final boss omfg i wanted to kill myself it was so hard). Collecting     Often I dont perticularly enjoy collecting items in games, it feels random, like it was thrown in to elongate the game. While collecting everything in this game elongates the game from 15 hours to about 18 hours every moments is fun and interesting. I became extremely excited each time i saw the llittle sparkle letting me know there was a new item nearby. Each item was either a great callback to an episode or a laugh out loud joke!Writing Story     Ok. The entire rest of this game is amazing, but, have you ever watched a south park episode because of the compelling episode with twists and turns, no, you watch it for the funny jokes. Thats how I feel with this game. The story is obviously not terrible, but it could have been more developed.Dialouge     HERE WE GOOO! The main atraction of this game is the Dialouge, basically you are paying for a more expansive 18 hour episode of South Park. The dialouge between characters is natural and memorable. Any fan of the tv show will definetly be laughing every 15-30 seconds. Even if you have never seen the show or even dislike it you have to admire the expert writing.Conclusion Final Thoughts     I love this game. I can not wait for the next game to come from the partnership between Ubisoft and Southpark. Overall Grade      My final grade for this great game is: 9/10 "

												If you are a fan of the show, This is a must have. The game is very well designed and is also a blast to play through. Its story, Comedy and Characters are all what you would expect from South Park. This isn't just a good game, Its a brillaint game. The best part is, It doesn't feel like a game, It feels more like an entire series of South Park with you as the main character. It also has a lot of replay value to it, So for collectomaniacs, Its heaven. Its South Park at its finest, What else do I need to say. 10/10Just remember to harness the power of magic (Farts).			"

												Many times throughout this game, I forgot that I wasn't watching an episode of the show. The consistency is amazing.

												If you're a fan of South Park, you NEED to get this game. I got it on sale, but honestly, it would have been worth the full price. I'm a huge fan of South Park and have been for years. I've seen just about every episode, many of them multiple times. In a way, this game is a tribute to the TV series. It references past episodes and characters and is very nostalgic at times. That alone hooked me. There's so much charm to this game, but perhaps the most charming thing about it is it's authenticity in relation to the show. It's like you're playing through an entire season of the series and you really feel like you're in South Park. Story:You're the new kid and your family just moved to South Park. Your parents encourage you to go outside and make some new friends. Soon after leaving your house, you meet Butters, who becomes your first friend and introduces you to The Wizard King, better known as Cartman. While there, you'll also meet Clyde, Scott Malkinson and Kenny...Princess Kenny. Cartman reveals to you The Stick Of Truth and explains that there is a war between the humans (Cartman's group) and elves (Kyle's group) who are each trying to possess the stick. During the explanation, Kyle's elves attack Cartman's base and your journey begins.Gameplay:The gameplay is really fun and very immersive. You start the game by editing your character's appearance to your liking. You can choose your hair style, skin tone, clothes, etc. And no, you can't play as a female. If you've ever played Paper Mario, this feels a lot like it. Your party consists of Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, Stan, Kyle and Jimmy. Each of them you will meet and acquire as you progress throughout the story. You can battle alongside one party member at a time, who each have different and unique abilities. There's even special friends you can summon to help you in battle once per day, which consists of Mr. Lu Kim, Jesus, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Slave. As you win battles and progress through the game, you'll gain XP and level up. Once you level up, you'll be able to upgrade your abilities. The game also puts a heavy emphasis on farting. That should come as no surprise to any fan of South Park. You'll learn different types of farts throughout the game that you can use both in and out of battle. You can't run from random encounters once you're in battle, but you can attempt to run from an enemy before the encounter in order to avoid it. This is very convenient because it gives you a chance to continue with whatever you're doing if you don't feel like fighting and it keeps the turn-based system from being an annoying pest like it is in other RPGs. The game offers many side quests and things to collect. Sure, you could just rush the game and complete the main story, but you'd be missing out on so much. There's a total of 120 friends to make. Many of them will ask you to do something for them before befriending you. There's also 30 chinpokomon to collect as well as equipment and weapons to find and purchase.The Negatives:When it comes to the negatives of this game, many have complained that it's too short. After beating the game, collecting every chinpokomon, making every friend and unlocking nearly every achievement, my save clocked in at 17 hours. However, this doesn't include the amount of time I've spent playing and loading past saves after losing in battle or to get something I missed or forgot about. So if we're counting all of that, Steam shows I put in 30 hours, which I would say is a good amount of time. I still would have liked for this to be longer simply due to how much fun I had with it. I had a feeling of sadness when the end credits came on because I didn't want it to end. Another complaint some have had is that you can only level up to level 15. On the surface this sounds annoying, but you'll easily defeat most enemies at this point and leveling higher would be unnecessary. Other complaints I have is that there were some characters and locations that weren't included in the game such as Raisins, Hells Pass Hospital, Grandpa Marsh, Satan, Towelie and Kyle's cousin. Also, there are some collectibles in the game that are only accessible during a certain quest, leaving them forever unobtainable if you forget to pick them up. So if you're a completionist or if you're very OCD about collecting things like I am, this can become upsetting. Overall though, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I'm sure that many of the negatives such as the missing characters and locations will be corrected if we get a sequel, which I'm URGENTLY awaiting by the way. Make it happen, Matt and Trey.Conclusion:If you're a fan of South Park, I'd HIGHLY recommend this. The game stays true to the TV series. It feels authentic because quite frankly, it is. You feel like you're actually playing out a season of South Park. The game offers a good story, immersive gameplay and lots of laughs along the way.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a brilliant hilarious game, That brings the crude humour of South Park and mixes it with solid Turn Based Combat.One of the funnest gaming experiences I had in 2014.Pros+Hilarious story, with loads of references to the show that fans of south park will love.+Good amount of customization.+Loads of unique levels and areas keep the gaming feeling fresh.+Lots of favourite characters from the show voiced by the real actors.=Combat is solid, however as the game progresses I feel like you become hugely over powered by the end.Cons-For an RPG, the game is very short. Completed it in a litte over 12 hours.-Would of liked to have seen more sidequests to give it more longevity.Final thoughtsAll in all, this is a very solid game that fans of the show should not miss. However if you are not a fan of the show or do not enjoy crude humour then this game is not for you, as it is around every corner.			"

But I understand this, it would be extremely hard to do so many jokes in branching dialogues.			"

Product received for free
												Morgan Freeman's explanation:""You must understand that there is more to the hype for a proper South Park game than just the hopes and dreams of fans. The core concept of licensed video games hasn't gone well over the years for South Park, with the most successful titles being lousy 5 dollar Iphone minigames. The Stick of Truth did more than capture the feel of the iconic adult cartoon. It crossed the boundaries that we never thought that Parker and Stone had the courige to cross. But it was still only a mere baby step in what was to come. This game shall prepare you well for the next long journey of comedy.""			"

												I must say that all of the reviews were just about spot on.The game is roughly 15 hours long if you knock out all the side quests and get caught up in trying to pop some achievements. The gameplay is easy, the story is fantastic, and it's just a really well made game.You do get level capped at 15, and on normal you can easily take out waves of enemies.With all that being said I am easily going to play this again and possible again as this is the first game I actually want to 100% in a long time. It doesn't try to re-write the rules of how a game should be played, but it breaks everything down to it's simpliest form and then slightly expands it on gradually. If they do make a sequal I hope there is more to do after end-game, more make the main storyline longer. But honestly it's a minor gripe.10/10 - Would Douchbag Again.  "

It doesn't try to re-write the rules of how a game should be played, but it breaks everything down to it's simpliest form and then slightly expands it on gradually. If they do make a sequal I hope there is more to do after end-game, more make the main storyline longer. But honestly it's a minor gripe.10/10 - Would Douchbag Again.  "

Product received for free
												Morgan Freeman's explanation:""You must understand that there is more to the hype for a proper South Park game than just the hopes and dreams of fans. The core concept of licensed video games hasn't gone well over the years for South Park, with the most successful titles being lousy 5 dollar Iphone minigames. The Stick of Truth did more than capture the feel of the iconic adult cartoon. It crossed the boundaries that we never thought that Parker and Stone had the courige to cross. But it was still only a mere baby step in what was to come. This game shall prepare you well for the next long journey of comedy.""			"

												When I play this game, I feel like i'm literally in a South Park episode... except I can control whatever happens.Characters really stand out without feeling forced or weak in this... they will be exactly how they are in the show.Unlike most RPGs where you take turns fighting.. it's pretty much like that, except you can try blocking enemy attacks to weaken the damage or even make it backfire depending on how you're playing.Comedy is pretty good, loving the golden moments referencing stuff from the actual show.FYI - This game is not only perfect for fans of the show, but it's a darn good game on it's own. Side quests are actually fun to do and never feeling like a chore... thank god. Warning: A bit to sexual or gross sometimes, but if you can handle it, then go for it!			"

												VERY fun game.   I give it a 8/10It has a very good RPG element both in-combat and out of combat..  Alot of secrets can be found, as well as avoiding combat by finding various world items to use against the enemies.The jokes are hilarious, what you would expect from a southpark show / game.It does have uncensored things ( like swearing, and some people being fully Naked. etc) , so be warned.What I didnt like about it, was 2 things.. --The game was a bit to short.  I managed to beat it in only 5-6 hours of game time. for the story and most of the side quests. Not including the collections like chinpokomon.-- The other was that the villans of the game, While I wont say what they are because of spoilers, It is just an overdone enemy.  They even confirmed it in-game, which i found funny. they did try to mix it up a bit, i'll give it that. but in the  end of the day, the villans are what they are.Overall!   Though the game was short, and I rolled my eyes when I found out what i'd be fighting most of the game, I did have ALOT of fun. Worth the 30$ I spent.  I plan on replaying it as a new class.			"

												South Park™: The Stick of Truth™ Now that the new South Park™ game has just been announced at E3 2016, namely, South Park™: The Fractured but Whole™, I thought it would be a good idea to write a review, for perhaps one of the most ingenious and epicus Role Playing Games of all time. This review will definitely contain certain spoilers, which could, or could not affect your gameplay's sentimental value. You have been warned. To start off, I would like to introduce you to your character, and how your choice of class could affect the game.When you first start the game, you will be prompted to customize your character. Your character could become both male and female. Now, while I have done five different playthroughs, I still haven't had a chance to play as a female character, so I'm unsure on whether or not it will affect the gameplay or not. Take this particular part with a grain of salt. Anyways, after you're done customizing your character, you will learn that you and your parents has moved into a house, located in South Park, Colorado. After a cut-scene, explaining why you moved to South Park, you will be greeted by Butters the Paladin. He will be your friend from this point on. After that, you will meet Cartman, or rather, The Grand Wizard. You two will have a chat, and afterwards, it's time to do perhaps one of the most important choices, in the game - to pick a class. There are four different classes, these four classes are: Fighter, Mage, Thief or Jew. I usually tend to become a Mage, because as Cartman mentions in-game, ""a Mage is like a wizard, only not as cool."" But that's up to personal preference. The only difference is the fact that your special abilities will change, as well as a meet-able character, namely, Jesus, will ask you if ""we're cool?"" There are none other significant changes made, which could alter the gameplay in any way, shape or form. You will still be called a Dou*hebag, and the game will progress, as normally.Oh and... did I mention that one of the main ability focuses in this game, has to do with Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor, or FART, for short? However, I choose to call it flatulence, because it's a lot more mature.Now to the next part, the story-line. Now, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, has created the story themselves, with the assistance of other people over at South Park™ Studios™. Because of this, you will find a large variety of ""inside-jokes"", as well as references to previous episodes. In typical South Park fashion, the story-line will quickly escalate, and the Stick of Truth, which is the most powerful relic in their universe, according to Cartman - gets stolen. This does of course mean that you will engage into both the main quests in the game, as well as hilarious side quests, which varies from befriending Al Gore, to getting rid of Al Gore as an internet friend, due to him spamming your email with sightings of the very mythical creature, known only as the ""ManBearPig"". You will also be able to massacre the Mongolians, inside the Tower of Peace, thanks to the owner of ""Sh*tty Wok"". You can also help the mayor get rid of all of the homeless people around South park. As well as, helping the Underpant Gnomes getting a total of six underpants. The Underpant Gnomes does also have an influence upon the story-line, later on. I decided to make this specific part of my review, centered around the very mysterious and interesting beings, which finally had their own mission dedicated to them. I am of course talking about... the Aliens. Yes, the Aliens have returned, and they are not friendly. You will be taken to one of their ships, were on both the PC, and the none Australian or European console release - you'll get probed by the Aliens, which means that you will have to break the alien prober... while it's still in your rect*m. The object inside your rect*m will venture further inside of you, and it will become a special ability of it's own, allowing you to teleport to certain areas of the map, previously inaccessible. I will not comment any more on this matter, I'm just writing this of off what actually happens during that mission. Anyways, after a while, the UFO will crash. Despite many small pieces getting spread around the streets of South Park, the UFO itself, crashes into the South Park mall. This does of course lead to a massive cover up by the Government, which involves making people believe that they are actually making a new Taco Bell restaurant, even though the UFO clearly sticks out, for everyone to see. Later on, a person named the ""Big Bad Government Guy"", whose the main antagonist of this story - will, how can I say this without spoiling the ultimate series of plot twists ever done in a video game to my knowledge before? Let's just say that he sets a chain of events in motion... I will not say anything more than that. These are just some of the things you will experience during your playthrough, and I hope you enjoy the game, because I definitely recommend it, over literally any other game, except for a few triple-A titles, I will choose to not mention during this particular review. Just to mention a few guest apparences from the TV show: My Hankey, Nazi Zombie Chef, Al Gore (obviously), the Woodland Critters, Terrence and Phillip and many more! The final verdict? 9/10, or rather 97/100 to be even more specific. This game has everything you would have wanted from a South park™ game, and everything from the characters, to the gameplay elements, to the combat and even the Achievements, feels very South Park-esque. The only thing that actually bothers me, is the fact that there were several pieces of content that were cut for unknown reasons, I will not mention what type of content it was, but I advice you to check out the original E3 2012 Trailer and to search for ""South Park™: The Stick of Truth™ cut/scrapped content"". You will not like what you will see. Despite this, the finished product delivered more than expected, and to be honest, I'm more hyped about the new Sequel - South Park™: The Fractured but Whole™, than any other game this year. For future references, I will choose to display the date for today, as well as the current build version underneath this section of the review, because this review deserves a few updates every now and then. Have a great day! And thank you for taking your time to read my Review of South Park: The Stick of Truth. Bye! Adios! Auf Wiedersehen! Chao! and so on...Version 1.0.4 - 23th of June, 2016, 05:23 PM PDT - just because South Park™ Studios™ is located in California :D			"

South Park: The Stick of Truth - ReviewTable Of Contents: Gameplay Fighting Collecting Writing  Story Dialouge Conclusion  Final Thoughts Overall GradeGameplay Fighting      While most would believe gamplay and or anything for that matter would take a back seat to the comedy in a south park game, but no! Ive had many tense and tactical experiences while fighting nazi zombies, and nazi zombie...babies! This shows the writers, designers, and programmers came together to create comedy during extremely tense situations (the final boss omfg i wanted to kill myself it was so hard). Collecting     Often I dont perticularly enjoy collecting items in games, it feels random, like it was thrown in to elongate the game. While collecting everything in this game elongates the game from 15 hours to about 18 hours every moments is fun and interesting. I became extremely excited each time i saw the llittle sparkle letting me know there was a new item nearby. Each item was either a great callback to an episode or a laugh out loud joke!Writing Story     Ok. The entire rest of this game is amazing, but, have you ever watched a south park episode because of the compelling episode with twists and turns, no, you watch it for the funny jokes. Thats how I feel with this game. The story is obviously not terrible, but it could have been more developed.Dialouge     HERE WE GOOO! The main atraction of this game is the Dialouge, basically you are paying for a more expansive 18 hour episode of South Park. The dialouge between characters is natural and memorable. Any fan of the tv show will definetly be laughing every 15-30 seconds. Even if you have never seen the show or even dislike it you have to admire the expert writing.Conclusion Final Thoughts     I love this game. I can not wait for the next game to come from the partnership between Ubisoft and Southpark. Overall Grade      My final grade for this great game is: 9/10 "

												Longest South Park Episode/Movie ever, that is what this game feels like. It has all the elements and the stories that could be in a South Park tv episode, which is what makes this such a great game. Viewer descretion is advised. This is definitely not a game for those under the age of 18 due to graphic violence, cursing, nudity and adult material. If you are a fan of South Park, you will be a fan of this. I'm already 12 hours into the game and still not finished, so you will get some good play time out of it, along with frustration, anger, OMG's and wtf is that... Great game, I am happy with my purchase.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: If you don't enjoy south park as an animated show there's nothing here for you. But if you enjoy it from time to time or love it like I do, then by all means, buy and play the Stick of Truth. This is by far the most faithful adaptation of any TV show I've ever seen for a video game. It feels like you're playing a season of South Park. A good season at that. The game is a japanese-style RPG similar to Costume Quest and Mario & Luigi RPG series. There are a lot of great environment puzzles to get itens and avoid battles. The combat can feel a little too easy most of the time, but nothing that can ruin what is likely to be a great experience for you.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth follows the story of Sir ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (The new kid on the block) Who moved to South Park  during the children's ""Stick of Truth"" game. Without revealing too much, it's a gimic of an old dungeons and dragons game with aspects of turn based combat games. Their are two ""Teams"" both fighting to keep and hold the ""Stick of Truth"" They are, The Humans Of Kupa Keep, and, well the Elves... It's an easy smooth running game that, well has a lot of content.Negative and positive listed below. Positives:   Just like watching an episode of the show South Park we've all come to love  Voice acting is perfect for all characters throughout The Artwork is consistent and lovely The Sidequests are compelling alongside a good main story  It's humourus 90% of the time Negatives  Lip sinking isn't perfect A few random crashes but nothing major Slightly unbalenced combat at some points Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped you. "

												South Park The Stick of Truth [ 10 / 10 ]I feel like I am playing an actual episode of South Park. The Stick of Truth is funny and seriously still enjoyable after 15 hours of game play. Easy to pick for a non RPG player. This has great turn based combat needed for noobs like me. This is probably what should be called a Light RPG - and hats of to the developer for making this accessible to fans of South Park even though they may not be big into RPG. I know the South Park episodes inside out.... and this game is spot on and faithfull with all the detail.... lots of fun and humor. I am going to marathon this game.... it is so much fun.....			"

												Ok, there's a lot to cover on this game, but I'll just lay out the most glaring feature - it looks and feels exactly like you're part-taking in not just an episode, but in a whole interactive season of the show! The presentation is pitch perfect and all the characters are voiced by their original voice actors (mostly Trey Parker and Matt Stone). Perfect characters aside, the combat is another robust feature. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master; even if you've put hours in it. The story makes you feel both like an observer and a vital part of it at the same time, since you get to witness epic cutscenes and make crucial joices which influence the unfolding of the story. The humor, however, is what takes the ovations from the crowd, but beware - only long time South Park fans will get all the nods and references to various episodes, as well as feel more closely bound to classic characters. It's crude, offensive, with poor taste sometimes, but that cynical attitude makes South Park stand out from the crowd of mainstream TV flicks.  All and all, the game would be perfect if it had been a little more appealing to the newcomer audience, but I urge you to at least watch some episodes before you buy it, prefferably from the newer seasons.

												Truly a game for south park and rpg fans alike , altho if you're only here for the south park thing you can enjoy it anyways because combat system is simple yet rewarding.You're the new kid in town and on your first day there you meet main character kids like Butters , Cartman , Princess Kenny and learn about the stick of truth which is an ancient artifact than whoever gets to control it , controls the universe and recruit you into their ranks to fight the Drow elves obviously leaded by Kyle because south park.The combat system reminds me of the old paper mario or supermario rpg games where you need to input certain buttons during attack and skills to make the best out of them , your main character can do melee and ranged attacks along skills according to the class chosen ,  Fighter , Mage, Thief or.... JEW!!! o.o yes really jew class , eventually you will learn the way of the fart and  learn Fart skills like Dragonshout because of course THEY HAD to put a skyrim reference somewhere lol.Explorating town you visit many great locations in town for the fans like Each main kid room where you get lots of references to the cartoon in their closet,  find jesus and mr slave , have  a encounter with the mongols who just took over Mr Kim shop and more much more , you even get to visit Canada , no south park game would be complete without T & P.There's a ton of collectibles but they glitch on you sadly , in my run one of the last chinpokomons didn't spawn which prevented me from getting a final facebook friend to get all facebook friends in the game which btw facebook friends unlocks perks to improve your character in game.Must buy and must play for any south park gamer , hopefully your version of the game is the uncensored one so you get the most out of the dark humor south park brings.

												It's definitely a great turn-based RPG for both avid fans of the series and newcommers alike, although fans will appreciate the satire a lot more. Overall I am greatly pleased with the game and hope to see DLC additions added to the game in the future as there is a lot potential with this. only complaints I had with it were:1. WAY too short (100%'d all quests/ Max level in 15 hours)2. Item organization could be vastly improved3. Classes could be a bit more clearly defined, The abilites are great but with no gear restrictions, you can handle anything with anything, There is very little advantage to playing anyone one particular class archetype.All that being said, it is still a super awesome game and I'm glad South Park finally got a game worthy of the series.

												SPOILERS: I was a fan the moment I pooped for the first time in-game. Seriously, though... after 5 full play throughs and acquiring all of the achievements, I can say that I've checked out every nook and cranny of this game. It's genius. For me, the game and gameplay itself is not complicated at all, as there is no real crafting or spellbooks and the kinds of things we've all come to expect in fantasy-themed games. For me rather, it is the script/plot, the characters and the environment that are beyond brilliant. As many other reviewers have noted, you are basically in one long episode of South Park. The humor is crude, the items you find are equal parts filthy and ""cute"", the farts are deadly, and the snuke is buried deep within the most cavernous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (pun intended) that you can possiby imagine... I can only say that to me the wait for this game was entirely worth it and I hope that we get more SP games or DLC like this. I will still play this again in the future, as even by the end of the 5th play through, I found myself laughing so hard I was in tears at points in the game that I'd already been through... like a favorite episode of SP that you can watch over and over again, this game is hilarious.

												The Stick of Truth is at its best when it straddles the incredible - but true - ability of a bunch of kids to bring a game of pretend to extreme heights of seriousness, with limited stakes appearing huge.It's at its best when it is about play.In these phases, the succinct turn-based combat, the battleground navigation, the limited character interaction and shape of the world exist as a masterful and coherent whole. They generate this fantastic flow that - in one trick - justify the game pretense while engaging the player in it, epic battle throughout fake taverns and parental curfew taken in strides.When the world of 'normal' adult gets involved or when the game brings back some of the series lore along with stalwart tropes, it is far less successful: the veil of pretend falls and what's left is a giddy but dull self-awareness that highlights the least  flattering parts of the game structure. Chief of these is the turn based combat and its place in the progression: it allows for tedious conservatism (same moves all the time) instead of encouraging experimentation with your equipment and with your buddies during encounters. In the same way, the block system has very unreliable sign and feedback; which makes it difficult to use.Beside that, your mileage may vary: South Park has built several facets during its run and I don't care for the scat humor from the first seasons or the easy lampooning of popular culture icons that recent years have brought.Some people do and I expect they'll enjoy the game to through and through. I couldn't because what really interests me is the writers harsh tackling of controversial topics or of the darker aspects of the  logic and ecosystem that you'll find in a pack of kids. There's a significant amount of that (along with a nearly invisible touch of social commentary), but the scat and the pop-ref ARE what the last two thirds of the game ride on.And I can't support that choice: it makes the game less of a beast of its own - self contained, designed for the experience - and makes it rely on a bunch of crutches that are offputtingly obvious and ultimately unnecessary.The music is awesome though.

												The Stick of Truth is a pretty good game. I'm a fan of these type of games, turn based combat with you on the left and the enemy on the right. These kind of RPGs are some of the best of the best. It's not a very long game, but the time spent is worth it I'd say. This satisfies my hunger for a decent Paper Mario game, which this reminds me of quite a bit. Also.. make sure your parents aren't watching when you play this. Guy Fieri rates this game 9/10 and would like to induct into the Flavortown Game Library.			"

												It might sound like a backhanded compliment to call something ""The Best South Park Game"", but it's probably something South Park Studios would gladly slap on the box of this thing with all the underhandedness that that would entail, so we'll run with that. It's relevant that it's actually the best South Park game by a massive, orders-of-magnitude margin and actually manages to be a halfway decent game in its own right.The plot revolves around your character, the New Kid, moving into a vacant house in South Park with your mom and dad. Within short order you stumble across the kids from the show who are fully wrapped up in a 4th grade LARPing session revolving around the Stick of Truth. You're quickly enlisted to help in the conflict between the Humans, led by Cartman, versus the Jewish Elves led by Kyle.  If you saw the ""Console Wars"" episodes of the show, they lead directly into this game in a way I don't think I've actually seen a licensed product do before. It's legitimately worth streaming them online prior to playing the game, as the game could really be considered just an extension of that plotline. It's also a fun contrast to see what happens when the writers of the show aren't bound by Comedy Central's standards and practices. South Park as a show is known for pushing the envelope pretty seriously. South Park the movie had something like 250 uses of the word ""♥♥♥♥"", was obscenely violent, had Satan in a gay relationship with a (then still alive) Saddam Husein, and featured a giant talking clitoris onscreen as a plot macguffin.The game puts the movie to absolute shame in terms of pure raunch.This is easily the most gleefully offensive South Park has ever gotten, and they have things in this game the MPAA would've balked at. Were this a film it would've quite easily landed an NC-17 rating. I don't even want to spoil any of it because it's been a really long time since I've been genuinely shocked by a game, and this game managed to pull it off several times over the course of its 15 hours or so. Just by way of a comparatively mild example: You get ""summmon"" items in the game in a nod to Final Fantasy's summon mechanic, but here it's assorted bit characters from the show. One of them is Mr. Slave, who pulls his pants down and lands♥♥♥♥♥first on your enemies before stuffing them inside of him while he moans with pleasure (in my case he performed this move against a 4th grade hall monitor, which means I've played a game where an adult stuffs a child up his♥♥♥♥♥as an attack. Try to imagine if they'd put that in a movie, even as a joke.)Get ready for a lot of cartoon nudity, basically.It's not all sex jokes, either. The plot starts as a bunch of 4th graders playing live action Dungeons and Dragons but things dramatically escalate from there and the stakes become much more real-world and cheerily violent and dark, even as the game (very amusingly) never loses sight of the fact that you're just some 12 year old kid playing pretend. This is used to attach a lot of legitimate RPG mechanics onto the game as well.You're given the ability to customize your character's appearance, though not their gender -- you're always male. To be fair the game does give a perfectly sensible plot reason for this and it's played up for humor later. You can find and equip new gear as well as ""Materia"" of a sort (here called ""Weapon Strap-Ons"" because of course) and as the game progresses you get a series of spells that can be used outside of combat for environmental challenges, like using your ""Dragonshout"" power (which is a fart, naturally) to ignite open flames and light anything behind them on fire to clear a path.Bosses include the denizens of a meth lab, red headed hall monitors, goth kids, 16 year old girls, drunk hobos, assorted wildlife, nazi zombie cattle, aborted fetuses, and in one memorable instance your father's swinging scrotum which you have to dodge using a quicktime event. Somehow it all actually holds together in the gameplay department. Part of this is due to the game being made by Obsidian who know their way around an RPG and have a good sense of how to interweave gameplay and narrative. The game's pacing is almost weirdly solid, even as it sticks to the fundamentals. There's a definitive first, second, and third act; sub quests are handed out at an even clip; you're given a narrative break after major plot events in the form of the day ending. It has the usual South Park problem where they never seem quite sure how to end the thing and it winds up getting so ridiculous that when it finally wraps everything up it kind of just...Stops, anticlimactically (which the game promptly lampshades and mocks, so). On the downside, the game is really easy, to the point where combat actually gets kind of boring because some of the crew's powers are so overbearingly good. You're allowed to use an item at every turn before attacking; there's an item (coffee) that allows you to attack twice. If you're willing to just stock up on coffee and pound it every round for the difficult-ish fights they become snore-inducingly easy even on Hardcore difficulty. If you want challenge out of this you sort of have to make it yourself, because you almost have to try if you want to lose. It also means that while there's a good amount of variety to the jokes, just because of the nature of turn-based RPG games you're going to start eventually hearing a lot of the same lines over and over again. Attack animations also cannot be skipped or disabled, which gets old quick as the really good ones come with comensurately lengthy animations attached to them. It's stuff that probably could've been ironed out if the game had a little more time in the oven, but if you've read about the very troubled history of the development of this game it's actually pretty wild that it turned out as good as it did, where I have to scrape a bit if I want to find things to complain about.Basically, it's short but it's reasonably mechanically solid, well voice acted, looks exactly like the show, and is honestly pretty funny and worth playing for the jaw-dropping level of objectionable content they managed to cram into basically every section of the game on what seems to have been a dare. Needless to say if you're easily offended or like to consider yourself above relentlessly juvenile humor because you worry deeply about what others will think about your values system instead of, say, reviewing the game in a public place so everyone will know you played and enjoyed it despite said objectionable content, then you should probably not bother with this game at all. If the idea of jokes about abortion, nazis, pedophiles, Canada, things that can be found inside Mr. Slave's colon (condoms, puppets, live bats, a working flashlight, an iPhone, etc.) and so forth doesn't sound like your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this game will probably be somewhat limited.

												Only having a few hours in South Park I can already tell you that this game is AMAZING if you love the immature comedy that is South Park. What I wanted most out of this game is for it to bring me into the world of South Park and allow me to join in on the wacky rides that Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman get into. And that is exactly what is going on. I didn't expect the absurd amount of detail that you find throughout the world. It's not just do that quest do this quest move on, really take some time to explore you'll find countless amounts of subtle farts of hilarity. What else that shocked me is how good the combat it. Let's face it turn based isn't for everyone, but I can't help but adore it when you get all these wacky weapons and skills. It also takes some strategy to get it right, sometimes you might not simpily have the right companions or maybe you're too undergeared or maybe you just have bad reaction time and missed a few blocks that killed you. Overall the RPG aspect of this game is amazing as well.As a game reviewer on Youtube for over two years now I've seen my fair share of awesome and equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. I don't know what it is about South Park: The Stick of Truth but it's easily one of my most cherished additions to my collection.I HIGHLY suggest you buy the game and experience the game first hand but if you don't have the funding or simily prefer playthroughs I have started one on my channel and you're more than welcome to join me on my adventure. But please consider buying this game and supporting the wonderful people that took the time to make this.

												As for the South Park, and Paper Mario fan I am, I have had alot of fun playing this game. Surely it's not the lengthiest RPG (with a barely 15 hour long gameplay time), and while the combat is rather tame with the lack of depth, balance and variety, as some spells or attacks are more ineffective than others, while you'll find some devastating attacks which will prevent you from varying the way you play, but for it's short storymode it should keep you entertained until you've played through all the sidequests and the main story.As for a South Park game, it truly feels like you're watching an actual South Park episode, or even a whole season, at the same time while playing.Also, important mention is how the game plays alot like Paper Mario, with ''active turnbased combat'', by which I mean every move you perform requires you to either tap a button, or time a button pressing in order to successfully perform an action.The game also has partners, which all have their own unique abillities and spells, like such as Butters's Professor Chaos transformation (which by the way, is my favourite pick).However, if you have no interest for South Park, or even have a certain disgust for it, you won't be missing out at all if you're not going to buy it. A must have for a South Park fan however.8/10			"

												This will surely be one of the best games of 2014. People may think that is just an overpriced game about fart jokes, but it's way better than that.In this epic game, we play as the New Kid, after he and his parents move to South Park, a quiet little mountain town. But there is a reason for this change. The kid has a power, for wich he is wanted by the goverment.As for the gameplay, it's awesome. We get to freely explore South Park and all its iconic places and see all the characters from the series (and then, there's 16 bit Canada).The combat is way better than would be expected in this kind of game. In the early game, you get to choose your class: you can be either a warrior, wizard, thief or jew. Each class has its own attacks. The combat is turn based and very complex, as we learn new attacks and magic moves and... farts.The story is also very good. This is just an innocent game by the kids of South Park, based on the ""Stick of Truth"", but as the game continues a lot of changes are made to the world and there are a lot of plot twists. There are even choices that the player can make! Altough they don't make very significant changes to the story (still better than Call of Duty).Long story short, you should buy this game now, as the price of 39,99€ is definitely worth it.			"

												I really enjoyed this game!  Combat is pretty easy, at least if you have a min/max mentality when it comes to choosing companions, gear, and spells.  Fortunately, there's just enough combat in the game to balance out the exploration aspect without become too overly boring by the end of the game (for South Park fans, at least).  The game does a super job of recreating all the landmarks of the TV show and the voice acting is exactly what a fan would hope for.  I do get a little bit of screen tearing that I haven't been able to get rid of, but it's not enough of a problem to sour the game for me.  Stick of Truth features superb controller support and I appreciated being able to earn Steam achievements and play without launching UPlay even though this is an Ubisoft game.  This is an easy game to recommend for South Park fans.			"

												What can I say?Its South Park alright and its JUST like the TV series we all love. Its brutal-honest, rude, sexist, racism and overall butt-jokes all over. I gotta say I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at first because of the stupid region lock and censor version I get in germany but BOY....I sure as hell wouldnt let MY kid play this game.....no sir......not for the nazi signs but the overall expressions and topic of the game isnt for minors.Okay so its South park all right. We love it and theres enough to laugh about. How does it fare regarding RPG mechanics?Surprisingly its a solid even tho old-school system in place. The items and powers are good for a chuckle and give enough complexity to keep you min-maxing as it ""should"" be. Whats new are the mini-games tied to combat attacks and moves. Its more then just buttom smashing and requires timing and overall awarness. I m not to the end yet but I m itching to restart the whole thing just with another class.The save system is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you can only have one save at a time. It gets auto-updated whenever you do certain stuff in the game. You cannot save manually (well you can but it doesnt do what we expect it to do)So far I feel like playing and watching an episode of South Park which is probably the best compliment you can give to this game. Atmosphere is great and I find myself laughing out lout often enough to keep drawing the attention of my wife and cats )8/10Theres only minor things distracting from a ""perfect"" experience. This well is well worth the prize if you are into RPGs :)			"

												This is easily the funniest game I've ever played. If you are a fan of the show, I wouldn't listen to any one who complains about length, price, etc. This game is totally worth it. You get a season's worth of South Park in one package. This is one of the few games where I actually cared about the achievements and wanted to go out and get every single one. After giving it a bit of time to breath, I'm definitely going back in for a second playthrough.			"

												Hmm what can i say about this game.Its south park, but also its a role playing game set in the south universe.It took a while for the developers of this game to release it, after having the studio that was making it kind of get split up and sold.  The creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had a huge hand in helping make this game become a reality.  They of course do most of hte voice work, but also it seams they had a say in how the game characters should move and feel when you play.When you start this game you get treated to a great introduction that you will say to yourself...this is definately south park.  All the way down to when you create your character and move them around it will look like a south park cartoon.This game impressed me alot, by the care and work done on it.  The humor is outstanding well at least to those that like the south park genre and I am sure even non-fans and those who dont know what south park is will like this title.Among other things there is a bit of fan service at places....like being able to see inside for example cartman's closet and see all those things that where from differing eppisodes of the TV show.I like this game and i do recommend at least a try by anyone who has the money and time to play it.Combat like other RPG games is kind of turn based at times.....but the interesting part is that they give you ques to do things during this combat...instead of actual turns.The rest fo the game features puzzles and over area exploration.  Included inthe game is also the silly internal menu whihc they took the time to make it meaningful.  What i mean by this is....you use a cell phone to manage your equipment and friends and things....the funny part is...there is an in game social network where you can see differing things your friends say about each other or things that you do or dont do.All in all I would say this game would delight everyone who tries it.However I am not sure if anyone should let their children of too young an age play this one....due to the fact it does have violence and some harsh language.

												Despite the few minor graphical glitches I've encountered on day one, this is a great game.  I swear Square Enix could take a few pages out of this games book for the next Final Fantasy when it comes to the combat.  It's feels really tight and takes a decent amount of skill to hit all the perfect blocks and attacks.  If you are a fan of the show it does a good job of fan service.  It really feels and looks like an episode of the show.			"

												A fantastically fun game with some hilarious humor (though you will need to be a fan of South Park's brand of humor for much of it). It's impressive that the comedy is so closely tied to the gameplay as it is. It also stands up as a very, very good roleplaying game - with excellent character customization and a wonderfully fun combat system. I can't recommend The Stick of Truth enough.			"

												Genuine south park experience. A bit over-hyped and hard to avoid spoilers. Best served with no previous review consumption. Game mechanics are OK, although the end game is driven by story not the mechanics since you can easily become a bit overpowered and each battle can be won by the same moves over and over again, accordingly the beginning of the game is a bit slow paste and story begins to shine after maybe 6 hours (or less) of game play depending on how active you'll be with the exploring and side quests. Side quest count is really low and most of them can be completed and accessed early on in the game. There's little value for playing it few times and content will cover around 12 hours.When it comes to censored scenes by Ubisoft - realistically there was just two scenes where I though that it could't be shown on TV. If you think otherwise - watch south park few seasons back. Again, it's bit over-talked and over-hyped, it's not that bad and could go further in some cases.All in all - it's a fun trip for the south park fans and good standing grounds for future releases. Regards the price - I would wait for a sale.			"

												South Park : Stick of Truth delivers a true RPG experience to fans of the series, while delivering all the side-splitting laughs fans have come to expect.  The game follows you, as the ""New Kid"", throughout your quest to make friends with the town people of South Park.  To begin, you choose which class you wish to play, either Fighter, Mage, Thief or Jew.  Players can customize their avatar with a wide variety of South Park / RPG themed costumes / weapons / hair / oddities found throughout the game.  In addition, throughout your quest, you'll acquire a party of iconic characters, from which you can use one at any time as a ""Buddy"" in combat.  And ""as is tradition"", everything spirals completely out of control and you will find yourself caught up in a larger than life quest filled with poop, pee, aliens and sphincters - OH MY!  ""We want: more... money!""""Yeah! More money!""""More money from where?""""Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other contries have lots of money; we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!""""Yeah! Give us Internet money!""Is this South Park title worthy of all your ""Internet Money""?  While the quality of the game is greater than any of my expectations for Obsidian, the notorious studio behind the butchery of several games, the volume of content is rather short.  You'll find that you have completed the main quest line in approximately 12 hours, and in addition, a vast majority of side content.  While ultimately, the game can be replayed as any of the classes for a different experience, the experience will ultimately be the same since the story is distinctly linear.  Fans of the series will be pleased with the quality of the end product, but ultimately disappointed in the lack of content brought together for a game that doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.Overall, my experience with South Park : Stick of Truth was fantastic.  The combat of the game is rugged and well polished, rewarding players for successfully completing various quick time events to deliver devastating damage.  The story of the game is hilarious and includes many head nods to nostalgic South Park episodes.  True fans of the series will find that the game is one of the best liscensed games to date and delivers a unique, fun, and exciting experience that many RPG's do not deliver nowadays.Rating : 9/10Recommendation : ""If you're a die-hard fan of the series, don't hesitate, just buy the game! If you're more of a casual fan of the series, wait until the price comes down from $60.  Currently, the product pricing is likely only to satisfy die-hard fans of the series who have waited for this game.""			"

It is a SouthPark RPG and it holds nothing back when it comes to humor or attention to detail, it's an RPG making fun of RPG's and yet it's more enjoyable than a lot of RPG's that have come out in recent years.

The attention to detail is insane. So many little references are throw in everywhere. The ""world"" isnt very big at all but they have detail packed into every square inch. Like I said the world isnt very big but there are 12 fast travel station which are really nice to have. I cant really find much to complain about with this title. If you can afford 59.99 GET IT NOW!

												10/10Having read the reviews, but played none of the earlier South Park games, I went into Stick of Truth expecting a marginally above-average game that I'd have a 50/50 chance of hitting ""delete local content"" on during the first hour.What I actually found was:1/ A legitimately funny game - funnier than a good 60% of South Park proper;2/ Turn-based combat I not only enjoyed, but took seriously and implemented strategically;3/ A coherent story that held my interest from beginning to end.The Stick of Truth is definately not the sort of game I've historically sought out, or enjoyed. However I find it hard to find any fault with this game, and without reservation recommend it to anyone that's ever got a laugh from a South Park episode.			"

												Okay. So just sit back in your chair, and start to imagine a town. A very, very messed up town. It's name is South Park. Now imagine a ton of random kids always getting in trouble and stuff. Then think of them in medieval costumes, all trying to fight each other. Also imagine ManBearPig. Then a new kid comes into town, which is you, and starts making havoc break out. Yeah, so, are you convinced yet? No? Then imagine a ton of girls, like 8-10 years old. Then put them in a secret organization in the girl's bathroom at a park. With ponies and stuff. If you are not convinced yet, then go back to your Fun-Fun-a-go-go toaster and bunnies.			"

												This is the must-have game for all South Park fans. The entire town of South Park is finally mapped out in detail; this matched with great dialogue, a superb plot and fantastic gameplay. Some of the content is a bit grim and or absurd/perhaps vulgar; but I guess that’s what you expect for a game from Trey Parker and Matt Stone.It’s somewhat surprising all the content which is crammed into the game, with the added bonus of it being easily re-playable. You have: The great battle between Men and Elves. The on-going mysterious tale of The New Kid. Strange happenings regarding abductions! This game has this and so much more without pulling too much focus from the main plot.8.9/10. I think it’s a definite Buy. I’d happily (and eagerly) await for another. "

												It does feel like you are in a South Park episode, being able to roam the town, apart from the unlockables and the sidequests make the exploration enjoyable. The writing and the pacing of the story are great and most of the jokes deliver. The plot does have a lot of twists and turns so you never feel like it gets stale. There are a ton of references to the show too.On the badside, the game is rather short and the combat is somewhat inconsistent, also if you have played rpg's before the game becomes too easy. Also the classes dont affect the gameplay that much apart from the name. "

												All the heart of South Park's wit and humor in a JRPG reminiscient of Paper Mario for the N64. This game captures South Park in its essence and does the name well.That said, there are a few graphical glitches which may detract from the experience.			"

												If you're a south park fan this is the greatest game ever made. There are ofcourse a few things in the game that are a bit obvious en others that are like a puzzle you need to solve. All in all it's easy to play en it's a game you would play over and over again. It's basically an interactive episode of south park. Loved it.			"

												Best movie license game I've ever played. I love it. The turn based RPG system fits so well with the animation. This is the game that south park fans deserve. I'll go over the positive aspects and the negative aspects. Positive:-This game is incredibly funny. It's raunchy and dirty sense of humor fits me so well. I love it. However, if you are not into that kind of humor, this game will not appeal to you.-The turned based combat would sound bad, and boring... But it actually has you involved. You don't just choose a move and then watch it play out. It's kind of like the Mario rpg games, where you have to put in some sort of actions to make a ""Perfect"" hit. The combat is also fairly fleshed out. There are status effects that can be inflicted on enemies. Also the unique ways each buddy can be used to suit your play style. You can even use the enviroment outside of combat using your abilities you get, such as your fart magic, and an anal alien probe. Skipping combat completely, but getting the experience.-Plenty to explore, and has some replayability. Although I never completed it after doing it twice.-It is creatively written. The story line is fantastic. Which it should be, being written by the developers of the show themself.-Due to the kids larping, it makes some creative items. You can literally take a crap in a toilet, and throw it at an enemy to gross them out.-The story line and all side missions can give you around... 20 hours, even more if you want to replay it.Negative: The negative aspects are just me nit picking a bit, but some of these can be an issue for others.-This game is for south park fans, and for people who are not easily offended. If you are not a south park fan? You might not enjoy this game, and not get most of the jokes. -The game is too easy on the default difficulty, and even on hard mode, it can be easy. I've found myself never losing a single battle when you follow the story line.-20 hours is a VERY short rpg game, when it ends, you just feel like you want more.Do I recommend this game? Yes and no... It is most assuredly a yes if you enjoy south park and LOVE inappropriate humor used in a clever fashion. No, if you are not a fan, and you are easily offended. This game is best for south park fans, and I thank the developers for making a brilliant game, when they could of easily screwed it up. I give it around 8/10. A good experience.			"

												Stick of Truth's a surprisingly engrossing RPG, and a good entry point to the genre for South Park fans.It's clearly a console game, with limited options and no modding ability, fairly low difficulty level, and plays very well on a gamepad. And it's not particularly long for an RPG - you can get through the meat of it in around 16 hours without rushing.However, it's great fun. You can explore the entire town of South Park, sifting through shops and houses for items, and as you progress through the main story, you'll unlock new abilities that allow you to reach new areas of familiar locations. Levelling happens very frequently, via two separate systems - one skill tree is unlocked by amassing 'friends' on South Park's pseudo-Facebook (accomplished by completing quests or exploring), and the other is unlocked by gaining XP from combat.Combat happens very often, whether you're just wandering round the town or engaging in quests. It's turn-based, with you controlling an ally (such as Kenny or Butters) as well as your own character. There are several different damage types, which can multiply each other (for example, if you set an enemy on fire, then farting on them will cause much more damage). Weapons range from throwable tampons to ninja stars to Cartman's ""respect-mah-authoritah"" truncheon, and you can modify all of them to have additional properties.Player customisation is epic. There is a VAST range of outfits, ranging from SWAT uniforms to Crab People cosplay, all of which give you different perks, and can be customised with different colours and abilities. You can find glue-on facial hair, makeup, wigs, and get a nosejob at Tom's Rhinoplasty to look like David Hasslehoff. And though you can only select a boy (for story reasons), you can get a makeover to pull off a very convincing lady-boy.Graphics are... South Park. The whole thing's totally seemless, with your character appearing in cutscenes with full outfit customisation, and it does feel like a really long episode of the show. Particularly given that the voices are all accurate (most of them being performed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone anyway, who were intimately involved in the game's development).Writing's a little bit hit-and-miss. Though you can thoroughly explore the town, meet most of the show's characters and perform sidequests for them, most of these off-piste sections aren't particularly funny, and are more fan service than anything else.The focus of the writing is very clearly in the main story. It's funny, imaginative and shocking, and doesn't *require* you to have a knowledge of the show (though it helps). It doesn't have the rapid-fire succession of inspired random weirdness that made the show great originally, or the cutting satire that's kept it so successful in recent years, but it does have a gargantuan helping of the body humour (toiletry and sexing, basically) that's always been a South Park staple.Let's put it this way. If you like the idea of slapping Nazi zombie cows with large pink vibrators, or of harnessing the aromatic powers of your colon to subdue gun-toting SWAT agents, stop reading and hit the 'buy' button.

Thanks to help from the series' creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, this game looks and feels just like a season of South Park, with everything you would expect from one.

												The game is exactly as good as you'd expect it to be. Filled with references and line-crossing South Park humour, you'll get your money out of it if you're a fan of the show. The gameplay is simple but well executed too, helping with the whole 'barrier of entry' issue that comes into turn-based RPGs (It's closer to Paper Mario than Final Fantasy). As far as the story goes, it's essentially one of those three-parters put together into an ongoing narrative, with your character being implemented surprisingly well as a central plot element. It's not mind-blowing and it comes just short of being great in the end, but the writing is very sharp by game standards.A word of warning though: While the censored content isn't anything special, the absence of it is incredibly jarring and breaks the flow of the narrative. It's also highly inconsistent. If losing chunks of exposition to censorship is intolerable, I'd sadly recommend you pass on this game, because it's particularly blatant here.			"

												Fantastic game. Took me roughly 14 hours to finish, making it alot longer of a game than I figured it would be. Replay value is definetely there, with each class (mage, warrior, thief, and jew) all having their unique abilities and playstyles. I do plan to playthrough one more time, as there is also room to miss some stuff (collectables and what not, appealing to perfectionists). The gameplay itself manages to not become too repititive, with new enemies and buddies (companions) constantly being introduced. Finally, if you enjoy the humor that the show contains, then this game is pretty much just that. Long time fans will love all the referances to past episodes there are, but theres still plenty of new material for anyone somewhat new to South Park.			"

												Feels just like the show - the writing and animation are great!Combat and exploration are very well done and fun.The save system is probably the worst thing I've ever seen - you can save whenever you want, but that save is only up until the last time it decided there was a checkpoint.  I've definitely lost progress this way.And while I do really like the combat system generally, a lot of the weapon and armor properties are bugged.  Additional damage bonuses sometimes don't work, whereas thorns on armor applies also to weapon damage for some weird reason.There's mandatory farting tutorials, but then farting works differently than how you were forced to do it in the tutorial.I realize this sounds pretty negative, but honestly the game is so amazing that you can forgive all the bugs.  You knew it was going to be buggy as soon as you saw ""Obsidian"" on the box anyway, didn't you? :D "

												It looks, plays, and feels like a 15-20 hour episode of South Park. Whether that's a good or bad thing depends on your own preference for the show.Despite the reports of the game being bug-ridden, I've only encountered about three instances of buggy behavior: one random (and irreplicable) crash, the game looping on load until a restart, and cutscenes flickering after a rather long alt+tab out of the game. None of these issues were happening in a frequency that I'd call game-breaking.Do you like South Park? Do you like doing a season-long marathon of South Park? Did you enjoy South Park's recent Game of Thrones parody? Then get this game.			"

												What an absolutely brilliant game from start to finish. I have just finished it and I'm honestly stunned at just how good it was, I was expecting it to be good but not this good. I am left with that ""I've just experienced something special"" feeling that I'm rarely left with after finishing a game. I have to say the last few hours of the game were some of the most enjoyable I've ever experienced, they really turned it up to 11 towards the end. If you're a fan of South Park you know the type of humour to expect and The Stick of Truth is South Park at its absolute best, the writing is huge reason as to why it's so amazing. I have never laughed so much while playing a game, every time you thought it couldn't get funnier or more ludicrous it did, some of the stuff they have you do is beyond offensive and I absolutely loved every minute of it. Looking past what you'd expect from a South Park there's also a decent turn based RPG underneath, the combat felt great if not a little unbalanced and easy (I highly suggest playing on hardcore) but there were some really tough fights a long the way, surprisingly not the last one which I one shot, though. Overall the gameplay was solid and didn't hurt the game whatsoever but it could definitely be improved upon for the sequel. I honestly think even if you've never watched South Park you can fully enjoy this game, assuming you have a good sense of humour and aren't offended easily (or at all in some cases). Whether you're a South Park fan or not I highly recommend this game as it's an absolute blast to play that will have you howling like a loon every 10 minutes!			"

												A hilarious epic based on the TV series we all know and love, South Park! An open-world RPG game that finally lets you explore the ins and outs of the famous ""South Park"" (among other things such as their take on Canada..... which is hilarious). You can team up with or fight against all the beloved characters we have met over the years such as Kyle, Cartman, Stan and Kenny. The game length is a bit short unfortunately and there are few side quests. But all in all if you're a South Park fan this game is a must have.			"

												Absolutely loved my time with this game. A single play through took about 18 hours. Being able to enjoy southpark is a lynchpin to recommending this game and if you do you'll have a great time. I haven't actually watched the show in many years but I felt like I was playing an episode and had a blast.The gameplay itself is fairly easy even on the hardest difficulty and calls back to the likes of paper mario. The game is rife with those little touches that can make you smile, almost every character sporting unique attacks and animations relevent to who they are in the quiet mountain town. I enjoyed it enough to start another play through with a different one of the 4 available classes, however at it's core it doesn't have much replayability.It's abolustely wonderful to know this game exists and is good, it's an example that we can indeed have nice things.

However I find it hard to find any fault with this game, and without reservation recommend it to anyone that's ever got a laugh from a South Park episode.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth, to be honest is a milestone in gaming in my eyes. Not only is this licensed game functioning and playable, it's actually good. No, it's more than good. It's brilliant. The gameplay and world fits the South Park license so well and as a long time fan of the series, I've nothing but praise for this game. When I first heard about Stick of Truth, I wasn't too excited. Licensed Games weren't exactly high art and I wasn't a fan of the Lord of the Rings setting because the only South Park episode with that setting I really liked was Return of the Fellowship of The Ring. But when more information came out about it, it slowly began to win me over. This wasn't this setting. It was a parody. It was still the characters and universe that we knew and loved, but using the LoTR settings as a tounge and cheek joke and it honestly worked in my eyes.The gameplay really does fit the South Park setting with it being totally in 2D and it also helps brings fun to the turn based fighting in the game. In most RPGs you just hit your attack, and then wait to dodge your enemies attack. In Stick of Truth, they've added a mechanic where you need to time your attack to get maximum damage out of it as well as other variables, such as archers, multiple hit enemies, shields, and more. It really works to help keep the game out of repetive areas in my opinion.The graphical style is of course the same that's been featured in the show. Normally, you'd be thinking ""lol how could a 2013 game have these graphics"". But considering the art style and joke about the South Park style, I find the graphics very charming, and helping add to the feel of the SP universe.On top of that the game is absolutely filled to the brim with nothing but in-jokes, references, and more to the most popular and even the least popular episodes of the series. Little things like finding the Gamesphere from Towelie's episode, or finding Butters' The Poop That Took a Pee book, or even finding a certain character inside Stan's closet who refuses to come out. This game is a love letter to South Park fans everywhere, and if you are a South Park fan, this game is an absolute must buy. There is so much love put into this game to make it a game that caters to the South Park fans.As for non-fans, I would suggest maybe watching a few episodes of the series before deciding to jump onto the game because the humor is very much like South Park's actual series, so unless you think you'll really love the gameplay element, I think you should see if the show's humor interests you beforehand before you decide to get this game. But in my own opinion, South Park The Stick of Truth is a excellent game, and shows that when developers put actual effort in, they can make a truly special game for TV Shows.			"

												This game is not a shabby game adaption of a succesful franchice that completely fails like any other game adaption. This is a game that was written, designed and developed by the original South Park creators. Including original voices and all the trademark (dark) humor the TV show has become famous for.Because of this, South Park: The Stick of Truth feels like you are watching a feature length South Park movie. Everything is just there. The characters are spot on. The voices are spot on and the storyline is traditionally 'wtf am I watching' good/fun. Even when you're actively controlling your character the world around you feels 'real'.You play as 'the new kid' who's parents moved to South Park after some incident involving you. And as you go out to make friends you run into the South Park cast who are in the middle of a very very serious role playing game involving humans vs the elves. The role playing game mechanics the children have made up is translated into gameplay mechanics. Foods are health potions, energy drinks are power potions and anything that gives you serious gas are mana potions.The gameplay is fairly fun, though also fairly limited. You are free to explore South Park as much as you wish and interact with its inhabitants. Meanwhile you can raid their houses and garages for items and potions without consequence. The world is fairly interactable. Often you are able to shoot things or break things outside of combat. Sometimes leading to taking out enemies before a fight actually starts. This is a good thing because the fights tend to get boring fast.Fighting occurs when enemies tag you during exploration. You can also tag them first, whoever lands the first blow gets to take the first turn during the combat phase. The combat mechanics themselves center around turn based combat. You and one compantion have to battle up to six enemies at a time. During a turn you may consume an item to give you a bonus and perform one attack. When all enemies are defeated the fight is won and you go back to exploration.The fighting mechanics work and are fun. But they are only fun for so long. Especially in the beginning you are regularly jumped by enemies who force you into a fight. For me this started to get annoying because I just wanted to get to my next objective, not do all kinds of random fighting. Later in the game this becomes increasingly frustrating because fights become more frequent and enemies become harder to beat and/or appear in larger numbers.The actual attacks are also confusing. There is a whole range of buttons and combos to use various attacks, but none of them seem to make any sense. One sword requires a left click, another sword requires a right click. The 'spells' are taught to you through a complicated 'find the right frequency' tutorial but this is never applied again during actual fights. Blocking enemies can get tedious and frustrating. The game will indicate when you need to block, but this turns out to be highly inaccurate. There is also the use of shields and armor which are apparently two different things but are never properly explained. A lot of fighting mechanics are just thrown at you and you are left to figure out how they work on your own.All in all this is a very good game. True to the TV show and fairly ok gameplay to boot. But this being South Park, be prepared for some extremely weird and grotesque scenes. From visuals of anal probing to Nazi zombie fetuses (including swastikas) that spew various Adolf Hitler soundbites at you. If you think you know what to expect from South Park, be prepared to see them push the limits of the acceptable.Recommended to get this game on or off sale. It's worth full price if you ask me.			"

												South Park the stick of truth is a love letter to fans of the show. While playing the game you feel like you’re watching an entire season of South Park which stars you. The game’s presentation is outstanding from the voice acting, to the animation style, to the music. The game is laugh out loud funny. However, if you’re easily offended it’s best to stay clear. The humor is shocking, crude, and insulting the way it’s meant to be.As far as gameplay goes it’s a turn based RPG like super Mario All-stars where you have to time your attacks and blocks with a button press. There are four classes to choose from expect the standard three classes (fighter, mage, thief) and the south park exclusive Jew class. The actual RPG elements are pretty simple but with the south park flair. For example, all the health potions and consumables are items from the show like cheesy poofs. There is also some small customization you can do with weapon and armor patches that give certain stats. While the RPG elements are light it’s simply a joy just to see the south park flair on certain attacks and summons. For example, you can summon Jesus to do your bidding, turn into professor Chaos to wreck your enemies, or watch how Cartman does a fire attack.There are a ton of references and hidden Easter eggs in this game. Almost every major character from the show makes an appearance in some way. It was simply fun just exploring the town and seeing what people had in their houses.The one downside is that the game is a little on the short side. It’s about 15 hours long if you do all the side quests as well. However, there is no grinding in this game to fill the time. Not once while I was playing did I get bored. If you’re a fan of the show definitely pick this game up. It’s worth your time and your money. The creators of South Park and Obsidian Entertainment have possibly made the best licensed game besides the excellent Batman Arkham games. "

												A very good 12-14 hour long South Park episode, what could be bad about that?  Combat is simple and straight forward.  Exploration is rewarded with a collectibles type system.  I have enjoyed this game since they have fixed a couple of bugs that made it unplayable at release.  Do not expect much of a challenge, you will not be dying over and over.  If you have children or people in your family that are easily offended it would probably be for the best not to play this one when they are present.  This is another game that is better when played using a controller of your preferrence.			"

												This game is hilarious and offensive. It's mostly linear, but the gags are great. When the game is over, it lets you continue to finish up any side quests, but there's nothing to do after that but wander around. Buy it on sale if you're not the easily offended type!			"

												♥♥♥♥ing amazing! Lads 'n lassies who love South park show: You must own this game. It's so rare we see a great game licenesed based. What to say about this game? Well imagenie that one day, you became a SP charecter, right after Season1 7 finale; Kids still playing Dungeon and Dragons combined with Game of Thrones, adults are just same dumbarses they usually are in show, and ones again a great danger rise (or should i say decent) upon quiet little mountien town. Telling more -- would be revealing spoilers, and that would be a crime. I will just say that: Playing Stick of Truth is like watching another 3-5 episodes of South park.There are a lot of content for fans, easter eggs here and there, references, infamous satire.Gameplay itself is solid and will keep you interteined. A mix between JRPG and WRPG, made surprisingly well. Classes, diffrent tactics and combat moves, partners, gear and so on. Nothing that ye haven't seen before or any inovations. But it works.The game have flows; It's short (even if you will go crazy and complete all side quests), level cap issue, and if you are not SP fan... you will not get this game. A minor issues here and there, but overall, this is a good game by itself and masterpiece fans deserve!So, if you one of those SP fans; gear up, buy a few Cheesy Puffs, tell kitty to go away and remove children and easy to offend people from the monitor. Because South park is a show that no one suppose to watch and game should not be played. Got the idea?			"

												One of the best JRPGs that have come out from the West. It's the classic story of four young American children from the state of Colorado who take on an epic adventure to defeat space aliens and the government. Through imagination comes great victory for the children.If you're a fan of the TV show, then there's really no reason to skip this. It's totally authentic to the show and their most vulgar episode.			"

												I love SP! Its rare that I purchase a game based on a movie/tv show. Also, turn based combat wouldnt be a selling point for me personally either, I just had a good feeling about this game and am now a happy owner :)The game pretty much does what you would expect (if you have seen the show and any bit of a trailer for this thing). Plays perfectly with controller/big picture. Easy to pick up. Many laughs from references to the show, either seeing something in one of your neighbours closests or something on the tv (Had forgotten all about the Martha stewart queefing LOL, worth a google if you missed it).In a time when my library is growing faster than I can play things, and typically a game doesnt get turned on at all or for an hour or 2, the fact I am on my way to finishing this game says a lot.

												If like me you're a big South Park fan who needs his memory refreshed, then you're in for a ride ! For the best and the worst, this game recycles most of the horrible events that happened in South Park over 17+ years. And you will keep thinking ""OMG it can't be more shocking than that !"" till the next sequence which will feature something even more horrible..! ;-)The only downside is that there's not much true original content story-wise and joke-wise, but in term of fan service, it's hard to beat that, you'll feel like living in the South Park world and it's (nearly) priceless !The major downside of the game is the RPG gameplay that is really basic despite a lot of (duplicate) items and gets really repetitive over the course of the adventure. It's not too bad so it's still bearable, but don't expect anything challenging or interesting combat-wise ; you'll get a few good laughs, the 1st couple of times you'll try out the new abilities, though ! :)Pros:- you'll be living in a South Park mini-series !- you'll relive most of the dire moments of the series (you know what a dire moment is, right ?)- extremely well crafted, with a bunch of good ideas that make exploring the world challenging & interesting- the ""RPGization"" of the South Park world is well-though and work pretty wellCons- RPG comats are very basic ; they're cumbersome at 1st, and repetitive afterwards, and require too much reflexes & QTA- about 20-hour of gameplay, which would have been enough if there was more story & jokes and less RPG combat- could have used a bit more original content (a lot come from existing episodes ; although they did so much already in the series that it can't be easy to come up with too much fresh ideas :) )Bonus note :- if you haven't played Skyrim, you'll miss out a bunch of the RPG jokes			"

												Simply put if you enjoy South Park the TV show you will enjoy this game. A lot. Being a fan of RPGs or not will have zero effect on your enjoyment if you enjoy the show. There are some negatives though, most having to do with it being a bad console port;-Price. I got it 66% off and that's pushing it when it comes to gameplay value. But well worth the entertainment value of the story and comedy.-Loading screens between nearly every single area or transition. -The controls are pointlessly clunky in parts; You will go through a tutorial learning a move one way only to find out it is completely different in combat and then different yet again in the World Map.-It was admittedly very easy but I did grind and explore quite a bit. -Menu system for equipment modification ""patches"" is clunky.-I had an audio clip drop during one part but had subtitles on luckily. Only happened once. Things that didn't bother me but might bother others;-30FPS cap.-Shop menus are slow when it comes to selling junk.-Some cutscenes are a pixel off to the right and down.Basically it really is a horrible port to the PC.BUT!The good far outweighes the bad if you're a fan of the show. Endless references. Nearly every character makes a cameo. Well written. Very very often laugh out loud funny. And the gameplay itself is way deeper than I could have ever imagined. And although it was easy, it was also rewarding. I grinded and explored the town multiple times over the course of the game just for the pure enjoyment of the easter eggs. Any South Park fan has to play this. Pick it up if it is 66% or more on sale. DLC's can and should be skipped entirely even when they're on sale for pocket change. Best enjoyed spoiler free, so no 'Cartman Brahs' kiddos!			"

												As a game, it's not a big deal, but not bad either. It's a turn-based RPG, Final Fantasy style. Although pricey, it's very easy on Normal, the map is not huge and the quests are not numerous _ I finished it after 29 hours, getting a little more than half of the achievements. The reason for playing is to enjoy the story. And that's where the game shines. As a gigantic ""South Park"" episode, it's amazing. A no brainer, if you're a fan of the show. A lot of references from the classic episodes. Several fart jokes and other examples of anal obsession. And Canada is mocked. And you can get dire aids (do you know what dire aids means?). I only missed a zombie Saddam Hussein. I remember playing the first (and abismal) South Park game on Nintendo 64. They've come a long way. I'll probably buy the sequel, when on sale.			"

												Put down your dice.  Take a breath.  Listen.  Roleplaying games are not about orcs and dragons and ogres.  They're not about swords and axes and fireballs.  They're not about Excel spreadsheets generating potential damage through complex algorithms and random number generation.  Roleplaying games are about roleplaying.  When a roleplaying game succeeds in drawing you into its story, it's good.  When it makes you feel like you're a part of its story, it's great.  South Park: The Stick of Truth is great, and then some.  A mash of RPG and JRPG, you'll never know it.  You won't care about mechanics or which armor gives you a 0.01% better chance of surviving a hit.  You won't care that you can't see all of your stats and fiddle with them endlessly, taking half an hour to determine whether to put your point in STR or END.  You won't care because you are a fan of South Park, and a fan of RPGs and YOU are a character in your very own, full length, South Park movie.  Make no mistake, under the crude humor, this is one of the top two RPGs of all of 2014, with the to be released DA3 its only competition.  The only complaint you can really make is that it is a bit short for an RPG at <20 hours of gaming time.  HOWEVER, this is easily offset be wanting to ""watch the rerun"", replaying/rebooting as a different New Kid.  South Park.  RPG.  You NEED this.			"

												Well, there is a lot to say about this game but I'll keep it short.Is it worth the $60 they're asking for it? No. The game play is totally fantastic, the combat system is smooth and is pretty good and simple to use. The storyline is captivating, it kept me interested for the whole 14 hours it took to complete it, which for the price is a total joke.No online feature, why? The game is perfect for it, and would make more sense for the price they ask.I would recommend to buy this because there are a lot of funny aspects to the game, and it was very fun to play. But not at the price they're asking. Maybe $20 tops? I paid double that, and I feel kinda ripped off. Seems to me they just sold the name more than anything.			"

												There aren't too many 'funny' games that have come out in the past ten years. You have Portal along with a few other gems here and there that have had competent comedic writers, but for the most part every other game is 10-15 years old borrowed internet humor (see: star wars kid, all your base belongs to us, Leroy Jenkins) or cringeworthy regurgitated memes from the depths of 9gag/Reddit (Borderlands 2).South Park: The Stick of Truth on the other hand has made me laugh quite a bit. If you're a fan of the earlier seasons of the show (season 1-5) like me, then you'll love this game since it includes a lot of the highlighted references throughout the entire game along with other later episodes from the mid 2000's such as Al Gore and Christmas Critters. Best part is, it does not contain any celebrities or product placement that has plagued the show for the past ten years...outside of Taco Bell.The game is pretty damn short and linear but everything feels like South Park and it genuinely feels like you're in an episode of the show. Each battle is hilarious, especially the boss battles like with Al Gore and the Underpants Gnomes and the special attacks are icing on the cake, especially Kenny's chance of dying. I wish they did something more like make jabs at other games, the game industry, or game journalist like they do with celebrities or well known people on the show. The game is also pretty easy, but you have an option to make it harder.Good game and I would recommend it...only when it's on sale though just because of the length of the game. Somewhere between $5-$15. $30 is just not worth it, unless you're a hardcore South Park fan.Also, the sequel I'm not too sure about. I think The Coon and the superhero thing that's been going on for almost 8 years was a lowlight of the show. That's my personal opinion, so let's hope the sequel is more in depth and as funny as the original.			"

												So my review of Stick of Truth is going to be pretty much a carbon copy of every other reviewers'. Why? Because the truth is that the game is very fun, funny, and off the walls insane but it suffers from serious issues with quality assurance. The only time in the game I wasn't really having fun was during a section where the game plays the same 20 second loop of stock porn sounds while you explore the inner walls of your house. The major bugs I ran into were a crash to desktop error during a cutscene that forced me to skip it and the occasional sprite flicker of my character during cutscenes. There are a myriad of other reported bugs in the game that I didn't run into but I imagine they are still a pain. In spite of this, I found the game incredibly fun and funny, though I imagine you do have to be a South Park fan to truly enjoy it. I was very skeptical about the game seeing as it was made by Obsidian who are notorious for extremely buggy games and considering that it's a turn based JRPG and I'm typically not into JRPG's. But the game stayed fresh, fun, fast, and hilarious throughout and that speaks very heavily towards the source material. If you're a South Park fan, you'll most likely love this game. If not, then check out the show first before shelling out the cash for this game.			"

												A pretty solid RPG that walks on the casual side. It's like a much better version of Costume Quest so if you liked that then you'll love this.My only complaint is going with the blank slate silent protagonist, which is so cliche by this point that even as a parody it's tired. You only control this one character with one ""buddy"" party member at a time, and the buddy you start out with (Butters) is better than all the others so you'll never use anyone else. While I enjoyed the game, I never really laughed because there's only so much comedic possibilities with a silent protagonist. It would have been much better if you played Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny the entire time. You would have gotten their interactions  and been able to control 4 party members.			"

												Feels just like the show - the writing and animation are great!Combat and exploration are very well done and fun.The save system is probably the worst thing I've ever seen - you can save whenever you want, but that save is only up until the last time it decided there was a checkpoint.  I've definitely lost progress this way.And while I do really like the combat system generally, a lot of the weapon and armor properties are bugged.  Additional damage bonuses sometimes don't work, whereas thorns on armor applies also to weapon damage for some weird reason.There's mandatory farting tutorials, but then farting works differently than how you were forced to do it in the tutorial.I realize this sounds pretty negative, but honestly the game is so amazing that you can forgive all the bugs.  You knew it was going to be buggy as soon as you saw ""Obsidian"" on the box anyway, didn't you? :D "

This game is awesome, a complete and utter masterworks. The combat is great, the graphics are as good as can be for an animation title and the story will keep all fans happy till the dying end of ""the new kid's"" journey. If you even liked one episode of the classic tv show then pick this up straight away. Even at full price this is a great buy and I hope they continue to build on this with future installments.			"

On the ~20 hours I spent on this game I occupied most of my time doing the side missions and exploring, and that was incredibly fun all on its own. The game has a lot of humor to keep you entertained throughout, and the story has enough twists and turns to keep gameplay diverse.If you come to this game looking for Skyrim or Final Fantasy, then you're coming to the wrong place. If you want to find yourself completely immersed in a 20 hour long South Park episode. It's everything you know and love from South park, including several nods and references to the series which are very welcome. The game is amazing, and if you like good games then you need to get this game! It's seriously the best way to spend your money, buy it pls 10/10			"

												As a dedicated South Park fan, I can truly say this is the game any South Park fan has been waiting for. It pays the perfect amount of tribute to classic and new episodes alike while creating an experience and story that is unique, much like any other thing Trey and Matt have produced. The gameplay is indeed simple, a classic turn-based RPG, but still incredibly fun. Everything from your equipment to your abilities and enemies are truly fantastically designed to fit right into the South Park universe, and there are a lot of hilarious enemies and boss battles that all seem to keep the game different as you continue to play through it. While I haven't beaten the game just yet, I have heard it is a bit on the short side, but with the great mix of fun gameplay, hilarious comedy, amazing story-telling by Matt and Trey(as usual), I think it's well worth the price tag. Plus the town of South Park is chock full of fun places to explore with even the ""junk"" items you find lying around being little easter eggs for both longtime and newer fans of the show. I totally recommend this game for any fans of the show, or even anyone who is just curious what it's all about, as it is a perfect snapshot of the genious comedic minds of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

												When South Park originally came out, giving away some of my age here, I think I was in Junior High or High School. At the time it was an amazing show, that made fun of a little current issues and politics. Somewhere over the years it went from funny to overplayed jokes. When this game came out I was very hesitant as I assumed the same overused jokes were going to be repeated. However, it was on sale and a lot of my friends recommended it. Overall, I wasn't dissapointed and while there are some things I would possibly change to make it from good to amazing, it is well worth the money. You start off as the new ""mute"" kid to South Park and are promptly named Douchbag by Cartman. In a turn style action based game, you can choose from different classes of Mage, Warrier, Theif, and of course Jew. You get to dress your character up with different armor and attach bonuses. Special attributes are given, and overall it has decent gameplay. The overall story line is creative, and a huge bonus for me is the characters like Stanley, Kyle, and Cartman giving commentary to certain situations. You even get to give an abortion to a man and fight Nazis! A lot going on here. The two things I would probably change in this game that would have improved it greatly is implement crafting. Throughout the game you collect a lot of junk, and other than acheiving a gaming award for your collection, you can't do anything else with it other than sell it. I really wish some of the junk could be crafted to make some weapons or enchantments (patches in this game) to help improve combat. I would also add the ability to modify your party members. I would have loved several times to give my partner Butters an awesome Axe, or Cartman some better gear. The game says it updates the stats on the armor and weapons as you level up, but it doesn't quite feel the same as hand picking it yourself. Now, if they made a sequel or prequel to this game and added maybe some form of these compoenents I would buy it in a second. Really love the creativeness that has gone into this game, and hope that they make another one in the future. Would definetly recommend.			"

												A true pleasure of a game that follows the spirit of Southpark. It has a Final Fantasy turn based feel to it. The story is very fun with all the unique stuff you'ed come to expect from Southpark. I had a blast playing this game and would like to see some DLCS that lets you go back to each day so you can get all the collectables in one playthrough. (there are some you can miss that dissappear or you lose access to if your not careful). In all this game was exactly what i hoped it would be if a bit short. I can safely recommend this to everyone who enjoys old school turn based rpgs as well as anyone who loves Southpark.			"

												Okay, so, if you are a South Park fan, this *review thingie* or whatever this is (but definitely not a review) will be very short: BUY IT. YOU'LL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS GAME. You also wanna know why? Well, okay... dialogues are AWESOME, the story is practically a huge interactive episode of South Park, it's full of easter eggs, references and little details about all the things you loved most in the show. I really don't want to spoiler anything but trust me, it's great. Gameplay wise The Stick of Truth is a fairly simple JRPG, if I had to say something I didn't like is that the game is a little too easy, so you don't have time to use all the party members unless you farm certain enemies at a particular point of the game. But let's be honest, you don't play a South Park game for the RPG mechanics (which aren't bad by the way, the game is fun to play), you play it for the story and the dialogues, and those things are GREAT. A lot of achievements, collectibles, excellent player customization, good replayability, the whole package. Thumbs up.			"

												1. Amazing music.2. Lots of variety in the battle system.3. It's freaking South Park.4. Butters!This game is really awesome. I couldn't stop laughing at one point several times... but of course it eventually got way too disturbing to watch. Ah, South Park. I still don't know how they manage to have so many obvoius references to practically everything and not get in trouble.Particularly the Elder Scrolls. I swear, Skyrim always comes up at one point in my mind whenever they say something. I pratically heard Dragonborn more times then Kenny died.By the way, the age restriction HAS to be respected this time. It's not like Call of Duty, or Skyrim, or GTA V...Parents, DO NOT LET KIDS PLAY THIS.10/10			"

This game is awesome, a complete and utter masterworks. The combat is great, the graphics are as good as can be for an animation title and the story will keep all fans happy till the dying end of ""the new kid's"" journey. If you even liked one episode of the classic tv show then pick this up straight away. Even at full price this is a great buy and I hope they continue to build on this with future installments.			"

												This is the must-have game for all South Park fans. The entire town of South Park is finally mapped out in detail; this matched with great dialogue, a superb plot and fantastic gameplay. Some of the content is a bit grim and or absurd/perhaps vulgar; but I guess that’s what you expect for a game from Trey Parker and Matt Stone.It’s somewhat surprising all the content which is crammed into the game, with the added bonus of it being easily re-playable. You have: The great battle between Men and Elves. The on-going mysterious tale of The New Kid. Strange happenings regarding abductions! This game has this and so much more without pulling too much focus from the main plot.8.9/10. I think it’s a definite Buy. I’d happily (and eagerly) await for another. "

												The Stick of Truth was fun and funny. There's a decent sized quest, around 17hrs to finish everything.  The game reminds me of the fantastic Super Mario RPG series.  The game is set in a cartoon world and has simple yet engaging battle mechanics and there's some solid humor to the game. However, I have a feeling this game will not be fondly remembered in the years to come. A lot of the jokes are rehashes and sometimes not even really jokes, but more just references to various different OLD episodes. There are some really funny new villains to battle. The game is really easy. After the first real boss battle, there wasn't any challenge to any of the battles afterwards. The character becomes so over powered.  Another thing that annoyed me was something that's been dragging the show down too is the product placement. A certain famous diarrheatorium is prominently featured in the plot and it's weak that I'm paying out money just be shown commercials. The game is rough around the edges, but there's obviously a lot of talent that went into making the game, but the sense I come away with strongest from the game is that it just feels like wasted potential. It could've been great and it ended up decent.			"

												South Park the stick of truth is a love letter to fans of the show. While playing the game you feel like you’re watching an entire season of South Park which stars you. The game’s presentation is outstanding from the voice acting, to the animation style, to the music. The game is laugh out loud funny. However, if you’re easily offended it’s best to stay clear. The humor is shocking, crude, and insulting the way it’s meant to be.As far as gameplay goes it’s a turn based RPG like super Mario All-stars where you have to time your attacks and blocks with a button press. There are four classes to choose from expect the standard three classes (fighter, mage, thief) and the south park exclusive Jew class. The actual RPG elements are pretty simple but with the south park flair. For example, all the health potions and consumables are items from the show like cheesy poofs. There is also some small customization you can do with weapon and armor patches that give certain stats. While the RPG elements are light it’s simply a joy just to see the south park flair on certain attacks and summons. For example, you can summon Jesus to do your bidding, turn into professor Chaos to wreck your enemies, or watch how Cartman does a fire attack.There are a ton of references and hidden Easter eggs in this game. Almost every major character from the show makes an appearance in some way. It was simply fun just exploring the town and seeing what people had in their houses.The one downside is that the game is a little on the short side. It’s about 15 hours long if you do all the side quests as well. However, there is no grinding in this game to fill the time. Not once while I was playing did I get bored. If you’re a fan of the show definitely pick this game up. It’s worth your time and your money. The creators of South Park and Obsidian Entertainment have possibly made the best licensed game besides the excellent Batman Arkham games. "

I have enjoyed this game since they have fixed a couple of bugs that made it unplayable at release.  Do not expect much of a challenge, you will not be dying over and over.  If you have children or people in your family that are easily offended it would probably be for the best not to play this one when they are present.

												I wasn't sure if I wanted to play this after watching the trailer but once I gave it a shot I loved it.  Great RPG with lots of fun content from the show.  The only complaint is that if you don't know that there's a chimpokomon in the military base when you're in there you won't be able to get it once done the game.  Game play is great and the quotes are funny. I recommend this for anyone who was in question as I once was			"

												If you like South Park, you'll like this. There were some real laugh-out-loud moments. Gameplay is fairly simple, nothing too complicated. If you like simple RPGs with turn-based battles and you also like South Park (and are familiar with its characters), then I would recommend this game.			"

												My only real gripe with the game is that it is 60 dollars currently, that being said the game has kept me busy for about 12 hours at this time and I plan on playing it a lot more to try different classes and make different decisions. It is a SouthPark RPG and it holds nothing back when it comes to humor or attention to detail, it's an RPG making fun of RPG's and yet it's more enjoyable than a lot of RPG's that have come out in recent years. I have no regrets on buying it and hope they develop more content for it in the future			"

												There are two kinds of people I can think of that will buy this game: One is the kind of person that really likes South Park and the other is the kind that likes turn based RPG's. Both of these kinds of players can expect a very solid product on both fronts.The writing and art style is very faithful to the IP because Matt and Trey were given complete control over the game from the very beginning. The combat system reminds me a lot of the two first Paper Mario games where you have complete control over the overworld in which you can loot, interact with the townsfolk and buy and sell inventory. When you come across an encounter you're taken to a stage to combat the enemy party. There you use abilities that require PP, normal or magic attacks, and the buddy in your party has their own attacks, abilities magic and so on. No option to run away though, the kids must not like being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even though that would be helpful.All in all, I would happily recommend this game who is a fan of South Park's unique brand of humour. And even if you're not, you can't knock the gameplay. It is fun, and for the three hours I played I will definitely play it even more.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing amazing! Lads 'n lassies who love South park show: You must own this game. It's so rare we see a great game licenesed based. What to say about this game? Well imagenie that one day, you became a SP charecter, right after Season1 7 finale; Kids still playing Dungeon and Dragons combined with Game of Thrones, adults are just same dumbarses they usually are in show, and ones again a great danger rise (or should i say decent) upon quiet little mountien town. Telling more -- would be revealing spoilers, and that would be a crime. I will just say that: Playing Stick of Truth is like watching another 3-5 episodes of South park.There are a lot of content for fans, easter eggs here and there, references, infamous satire.Gameplay itself is solid and will keep you interteined. A mix between JRPG and WRPG, made surprisingly well. Classes, diffrent tactics and combat moves, partners, gear and so on. Nothing that ye haven't seen before or any inovations. But it works.The game have flows; It's short (even if you will go crazy and complete all side quests), level cap issue, and if you are not SP fan... you will not get this game. A minor issues here and there, but overall, this is a good game by itself and masterpiece fans deserve!So, if you one of those SP fans; gear up, buy a few Cheesy Puffs, tell kitty to go away and remove children and easy to offend people from the monitor. Because South park is a show that no one suppose to watch and game should not be played. Got the idea?			"

												When South Park originally came out, giving away some of my age here, I think I was in Junior High or High School. At the time it was an amazing show, that made fun of a little current issues and politics. Somewhere over the years it went from funny to overplayed jokes. When this game came out I was very hesitant as I assumed the same overused jokes were going to be repeated. However, it was on sale and a lot of my friends recommended it. Overall, I wasn't dissapointed and while there are some things I would possibly change to make it from good to amazing, it is well worth the money. You start off as the new ""mute"" kid to South Park and are promptly named Douchbag by Cartman. In a turn style action based game, you can choose from different classes of Mage, Warrier, Theif, and of course Jew. You get to dress your character up with different armor and attach bonuses. Special attributes are given, and overall it has decent gameplay. The overall story line is creative, and a huge bonus for me is the characters like Stanley, Kyle, and Cartman giving commentary to certain situations. You even get to give an abortion to a man and fight Nazis! A lot going on here. The two things I would probably change in this game that would have improved it greatly is implement crafting. Throughout the game you collect a lot of junk, and other than acheiving a gaming award for your collection, you can't do anything else with it other than sell it. I really wish some of the junk could be crafted to make some weapons or enchantments (patches in this game) to help improve combat. I would also add the ability to modify your party members. I would have loved several times to give my partner Butters an awesome Axe, or Cartman some better gear. The game says it updates the stats on the armor and weapons as you level up, but it doesn't quite feel the same as hand picking it yourself. Now, if they made a sequel or prequel to this game and added maybe some form of these compoenents I would buy it in a second. Really love the creativeness that has gone into this game, and hope that they make another one in the future. Would definetly recommend.			"

												So my review of Stick of Truth is going to be pretty much a carbon copy of every other reviewers'. Why? Because the truth is that the game is very fun, funny, and off the walls insane but it suffers from serious issues with quality assurance. The only time in the game I wasn't really having fun was during a section where the game plays the same 20 second loop of stock porn sounds while you explore the inner walls of your house. The major bugs I ran into were a crash to desktop error during a cutscene that forced me to skip it and the occasional sprite flicker of my character during cutscenes. There are a myriad of other reported bugs in the game that I didn't run into but I imagine they are still a pain. In spite of this, I found the game incredibly fun and funny, though I imagine you do have to be a South Park fan to truly enjoy it. I was very skeptical about the game seeing as it was made by Obsidian who are notorious for extremely buggy games and considering that it's a turn based JRPG and I'm typically not into JRPG's. But the game stayed fresh, fun, fast, and hilarious throughout and that speaks very heavily towards the source material. If you're a South Park fan, you'll most likely love this game. If not, then check out the show first before shelling out the cash for this game.			"

												A pretty solid RPG that walks on the casual side. It's like a much better version of Costume Quest so if you liked that then you'll love this.My only complaint is going with the blank slate silent protagonist, which is so cliche by this point that even as a parody it's tired. You only control this one character with one ""buddy"" party member at a time, and the buddy you start out with (Butters) is better than all the others so you'll never use anyone else. While I enjoyed the game, I never really laughed because there's only so much comedic possibilities with a silent protagonist. It would have been much better if you played Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny the entire time. You would have gotten their interactions  and been able to control 4 party members.			"

Later watched some gameplay and it completely turned me around, game is insanely funny and enjoyable.About 14~15hours of gameplay, but I plan on playing it through a few more times to clear on each class and get achievements.If you were on the fence I recommend checking out some ""let's play"" videos to see what it's all about, but easily one of my favorite games in the last year or so.

												Genuine south park experience. A bit over-hyped and hard to avoid spoilers. Best served with no previous review consumption. Game mechanics are OK, although the end game is driven by story not the mechanics since you can easily become a bit overpowered and each battle can be won by the same moves over and over again, accordingly the beginning of the game is a bit slow paste and story begins to shine after maybe 6 hours (or less) of game play depending on how active you'll be with the exploring and side quests. Side quest count is really low and most of them can be completed and accessed early on in the game. There's little value for playing it few times and content will cover around 12 hours.When it comes to censored scenes by Ubisoft - realistically there was just two scenes where I though that it could't be shown on TV. If you think otherwise - watch south park few seasons back. Again, it's bit over-talked and over-hyped, it's not that bad and could go further in some cases.All in all - it's a fun trip for the south park fans and good standing grounds for future releases. Regards the price - I would wait for a sale.			"

You also wanna know why? Well, okay... dialogues are AWESOME, the story is practically a huge interactive episode of South Park, it's full of easter eggs, references and little details about all the things you loved most in the show. I really don't want to spoiler anything but trust me, it's great. Gameplay wise The Stick of Truth is a fairly simple JRPG, if I had to say something I didn't like is that the game is a little too easy, so you don't have time to use all the party members unless you farm certain enemies at a particular point of the game. But let's be honest, you don't play a South Park game for the RPG mechanics (which aren't bad by the way, the game is fun to play), you play it for the story and the dialogues, and those things are GREAT. A lot of achievements, collectibles, excellent player customization, good replayability, the whole package. Thumbs up.			"

												Fantastic game. Took me roughly 14 hours to finish, making it alot longer of a game than I figured it would be. Replay value is definetely there, with each class (mage, warrior, thief, and jew) all having their unique abilities and playstyles. I do plan to playthrough one more time, as there is also room to miss some stuff (collectables and what not, appealing to perfectionists). The gameplay itself manages to not become too repititive, with new enemies and buddies (companions) constantly being introduced. Finally, if you enjoy the humor that the show contains, then this game is pretty much just that. Long time fans will love all the referances to past episodes there are, but theres still plenty of new material for anyone somewhat new to South Park.			"

On the ~20 hours I spent on this game I occupied most of my time doing the side missions and exploring, and that was incredibly fun all on its own. The game has a lot of humor to keep you entertained throughout, and the story has enough twists and turns to keep gameplay diverse.If you come to this game looking for Skyrim or Final Fantasy, then you're coming to the wrong place. If you want to find yourself completely immersed in a 20 hour long South Park episode. It's everything you know and love from South park, including several nods and references to the series which are very welcome. The game is amazing, and if you like good games then you need to get this game! It's seriously the best way to spend your money, buy it pls 10/10			"

												As a dedicated South Park fan, I can truly say this is the game any South Park fan has been waiting for. It pays the perfect amount of tribute to classic and new episodes alike while creating an experience and story that is unique, much like any other thing Trey and Matt have produced. The gameplay is indeed simple, a classic turn-based RPG, but still incredibly fun. Everything from your equipment to your abilities and enemies are truly fantastically designed to fit right into the South Park universe, and there are a lot of hilarious enemies and boss battles that all seem to keep the game different as you continue to play through it. While I haven't beaten the game just yet, I have heard it is a bit on the short side, but with the great mix of fun gameplay, hilarious comedy, amazing story-telling by Matt and Trey(as usual), I think it's well worth the price tag. Plus the town of South Park is chock full of fun places to explore with even the ""junk"" items you find lying around being little easter eggs for both longtime and newer fans of the show. I totally recommend this game for any fans of the show, or even anyone who is just curious what it's all about, as it is a perfect snapshot of the genious comedic minds of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

												As a game, it's not a big deal, but not bad either. It's a turn-based RPG, Final Fantasy style. Although pricey, it's very easy on Normal, the map is not huge and the quests are not numerous _ I finished it after 29 hours, getting a little more than half of the achievements. The reason for playing is to enjoy the story. And that's where the game shines. As a gigantic ""South Park"" episode, it's amazing. A no brainer, if you're a fan of the show. A lot of references from the classic episodes. Several fart jokes and other examples of anal obsession. And Canada is mocked. And you can get dire aids (do you know what dire aids means?). I only missed a zombie Saddam Hussein. I remember playing the first (and abismal) South Park game on Nintendo 64. They've come a long way. I'll probably buy the sequel, when on sale.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is everything that fans of both South Park and classic turn-based RPGs are looking for. It plays just like an episode of South Park, and it's snarky humor and references to the show are great. I find myself unable to put it away sometimes, simply because it's a blast to play through, and it's hilarious. The replayability has a pretty steep dropoff, since after just a couple of playthroughs you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer, but I still find myself going back just for the pure entertainment. Definite 9/10.			"

 South Park: The Stick of Truth  So in, I forgot I was outside... I have a problem, my problem is that I have little to nothing to say about this game...Seriously, I've had a few games where I've had the same problem. For I feel that they manage to do wat they set out to do, so damn well. That I'm having to really strain myself to find something to gripe about....I quess I could grumble a bit about the turn-based combat system, it feels a bit too standard, run-of-the-mill, copy-paste..Several battles became too easy after I found the most optimal way around them, I believe (if my tally is to be believed) that I died the total of 4-times. During the total of.... 15-hours of gameplay that it took me to finish the game, I feel that's a rather positive ratio.Whilst on the subject of combat, I'm not that impressed by the small amount of input lag I got when using a 360-pad. I've heard that it might have something to do with the game being locked at 30fps, it's a bit annoying when a perfectly timed block decides that it happened a split second too late and this happened way too many times to count.The Audio-Visual style follows that of the TV-series, characters bob around imitating walking, the original cast does what it does best, everything looks like paper cut-outs.. The works.The game has a lot of in-jokes and references to the TV-series and those who haven't seen much of the series might feel a bit left-out, but luckily being a keen fan of the series is not reguired.There are collectables, yay... (HURRRGGGGGHHHH)There are items to use, the same way as they do in other RPG's.....SIGH...Do you know how hard it is to find something to grumble about this game?...You know what? I'l just give up now.. I'm going to Skeeters.			"

												This game is honestly way better than I thought it would be. I'm not a fan of South Park, but my husband received this gift for Christmas and as I watched him play this it looked really cute. So I played it and it's a really well thought out turn based RPG. It makes many fun references to other science fiction, fantasy, video games, and RPGs so you don't /have/ to be a huge fan of South Park to find yourself laughing throughout this game. Only thing I found myself wanting in this game was a crafting system, but if that's really my only complaint then that should tell you how good of a game this really is. Would recommend.			"

If you love offensive/crude humor and watch the television shows you will certainly enjoy the messed up adventure of South Park: The Stick of Truth. A game you could play over and over it will still be funny to experience every part. And nothing is more hilarious than watching a friend whos never experienced the game cringe and laugh at the the best, the worst, and the horrible humor southpark offers. If you cannot take crude humor, racist jokes, or sexist jokes then you probably shouldn't get this game. But overall i recommend this game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E14 South Park: The Stick of Truth 

			Views: 164		

			South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great love letter to fans. Its role-playing elements may be simple and easy but, if you enjoy the humor of South Park it will be more than enough to go through the...		

South Park: The Stick of Truth: It’s a very rare thing to see licenses from television shows or movies be made into a videogame and actually turn out to be a great game. South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of those rare occasions. A great role-playing game made by Obsidian Entertainment (creators of Fallout: New Vegas) along with the creators of South Park (who also do a lot of the voice acting) to create a funny and simple game in which to celebrate the world of South Park and also to give fans something to enjoy for years to come. While relatively short by most role-playing game standards, lasting between 15-18 hours, The Stick of Truth gives enough variety and plenty of humor to make it an easily enjoyable experience and worth the asking price. Everything in the game is wholly belonging to South Park, it has songs from episodes dotted throughout the game, voice actors make a return to voice their respective characters and everything feels like South Park. Visuals also feel directly translated from the show, the game feels like a very long episode of the show. Controls are simple and easy to learn, the game overall is pretty easy with only a few enemies posing a decent challenge so you won’t feel very much pressure from the combat portion of the game. The only real detriment to South Park: The Stick of Truth is the fact that it is everything South Park. While I personally find the game to be funny and enjoy the jokes, it is easy to see how this game can turn away those who aren’t huge fans or hate the humor that South Park has and there isn’t an amazing enough role-playing game here to win those on the fence about South Park over. The other minor gripe with the game is the controls when using the mouse and keyboards. Some of the abilities didn’t feel like they responded as well when using their respective keys versus a controller. I also experience a few glitches such as Jimmy not getting out of his stuttering loop and some minor glitches of my character flickering in and out of a scene during a cinematic. Overall I enjoyed my time with South Park: The Stick of Truth, there is a fun role-playing game here along with the great humor of South Park. Those who won’t enjoy this game are those who are going to be offended by what is displayed in the game or just don’t enjoy the humor of South Park. If you are middle of the ground and don’t mind the humor the role-playing game beneath may not be enough to warrant a full $60.00 USD price tag. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Review: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												It’s really quite remarkable how South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have slowly ramped up the shock value over the past 17 years to keep the show sharp. Whether they and developer Obsidian could pull off the same for a 14-hour game instead of a 22-minute show was never a sure thing. But there I was, shrunk down to Underpants Gnome-size, crawling up Mr. Slave’s orifices to retrieve a WMD, slicing through gobs of bodily fluids in turn-based JRPG combat and climbing up half-digested corn-on-the-cob as I went, laughing hysterically the whole way. I’m floored at how consistently funny it is, and at how well the outrageous comedy melds with the relatively simple gameplay to create not just an amazing South Park game, but an intelligent and witty satire of roleplaying mechanics.As for the story, it’s a clever premise that allows The Stick of Truth to take place in a recognizable and painstakingly recreated South Park setting, but also brings in all the usual fantasy roleplaying tropes through the power of children’s imagination. It’s a trick used many times in the show, and it works great for the game, too. An epic LARPing session (as casually set up by last year’s “Black Friday” trilogy of episodes) has your custom-created new kid in town joining either Cartman’s Humans or Kyle’s Elves, all dressed in amusingly bad makeshift cosplay outfits. True to the show, things escalate wildly and hilariously, leading to conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and Taco Bell.Though it manifests itself in typically over-the-top South Park-ian ways, The Stick of Truth is a Paper Mario-esque RPG-lite. You and your single extra party member (you’ll unlock several South Park regulars, though only one can fight with you at a time) take turns battling formations of enemies, be it the Gingers, crazy homeless guys, aliens, and more. Typical buffs and debuffs are ably skinned in screwed-up fourth grader verbiage (throwing feces to add “gross out” effects) mixed with mana-powered spells and timed button-press attacks and blocks to keep you on your toes during combat. It keeps things simple enough while still leaving room for some tactical depth. And Obsidian refreshingly leaves out time-sink annoyances like character encumbrance and random battles you can’t avoid.I couldn’t resist the curious lure of playing as the Jew class over the archetypal Fighter, Thief, and Mage options, but the differences between them turned out to be South Park: The Stick of Truth  March 4, 2014 Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman set out to kick role-play gaming in the nuts with South Park: The Stick of Truth, an RPG set in the town of South Park.  →  Much More Ryan McCaffrey Says Try This Game If You Liked: South Park: Bigger, Longer and UncutSouth Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!Paper Mario disappointingly slight. Sure, each has their own special abilities, but there are effectively no class-specific weapons or items, and there’s nothing to stop a Mage from choosing melee-enhancing gear and carving up foes with a blade just as well as a Fighter. All classes eventually learn special farting magic (a crude parody of Skyrim’s Dragon Shouts) though both the thumbstick motions and especially the tutorial sessions for your powers of flatulence tend to be cumbersome. Achievement or Trophy hunting aside, this lack of class differentiation or significant choices in the story are big reasons why I don’t feel much incentive to replay the campaign. The other unfortunate offense is that some extremely useful things are poorly explained, if they’re even mentioned at all. Tricks like being able to switch your Buddy at any time by pressing down on the D-pad to access the Party menu, or taking the first swing at overworld enemies so that you get the first turn when the battle starts, and what your Buddies can do and are specifically good at are all up to us to discover accidentally. One other puzzling issue is the slipperiness of the action-selection wheel during combat – it’s strangely difficult to get your pointer to stick on the option you want, particularly if it’s in a diagonal slot on the wheel.But that’s about the extent of the damage. Aesthetically, The Stick of Truth might be the most beautiful crappy-looking-on-purpose game I’ve ever seen. While it may seem trivial to make a role-playing game resemble the crude, construction-paper cutout style of the show, it’s executed so well here that the two mediums are almost indistinguishable. You’ll never see a HUD when walking around town, for instance, unless you tap the Y/Triangle button. Only the very rare stuck animation on an overworld enemy and (on both consoles, but not a capable PC) the occasional frame rate stutter when a new area loaded in for the first time reminded me that this was a game and not the show. And that was the extent of the technical problems I encountered.The VerdictThe Stick of Truth makes one thing abundantly clear: I never want to play another South Park video game made without Trey Parker and Matt Stone's direct,			"

												Fun game if you're a South Park fan. My only complaint is the fact that the storyline and game is VERY short. I picked up the game on sale and only played every couple of days for a few hours max, and beat the game in under 20 hours... And no, I didn't only complete the main story missions. I collected everything I could find and did tons of side quests for friends and just to extend the game. I belive the $30+ reguar price would be more justifed with some cheap DLC packs for extra missions (they wont make DLC for free...). Don't get me wrong, the voice acting and humor is exactly what you see on TV, this is basically a playable South Park episode. I just wish they added some more missions/quests to keep me coming back....TLDR; Get the game on sale. You can beat the entire game in under a day so try to limit yourself to a couple hours at a time to maximze playtime. If you are a South Park fan you will enjoy the game.			"

												First off, let me start by saying this game is FANTASTIC. I'm not a huge turn based RPG player, but I picked up the game with skepticism because I'd heard good things about it and it's South Park.The game is funny and engaging. It has a lot to do and I found myself spending entire afternoons and evenings playing this game (which I don't do very often). As I walked around South Park doing side quests I found myself laughing at the dialogue of people I passed by or my buddy when I did certain things or went certain places. There are so many Easter Eggs in this game that you can find while walking around looting (Butters' Creamy Goo and Chinpokomon to name a couple) and a lot of them are cleverly placed. South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic turn-based RPG and doesn't disappoint. The game feels like a very long episode of South Park and it actually looks like one too. I can recommend this to people who have only seen the show a few times and you'll still love it to death. 10/10.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great story driven RPG, which perfectly recreates the aesthetic and humor of the South park tv show. The way this game manages to integrate mages, rogues, paladins, bards, elves, etc. into the South Park universe, and create a fun and involved combat system around it, is just interesting and enjoyable.So, for everyone who enjoys the South Park brand of comedy, and wants to play a fun story driven RPG, I highly recommend purchasing and playing South Park: The Stick of Truth!

												one if not the best licensed IP game ever created, to any developer or company thinking about making a game, take note about this one.The game succeed 100% at getting the feeling of watching one episode of the show, the gameplay elements and the way they are implemented work nicely with the writing of the game and makes fun of some common tropes on video games.maybe the combat is not as depth as you want, but the writing of the game is so good you'll find yourself wanting to explore south park and talking to the people more than fighting or grinding exp.every item on the game, and I mean EVERY single item even the useless junk you get to only sell it later has something to do with the show and some chapter of it, trivia everywhere for hardcore fans of south park or just funny writing if you don't get it.get this game, I can't recommend it enough.

												Plain and simple, this is a full interactive South Park season filled with adventure, satire and a multitude of favorite characters, from Cartman to Al Gore. The core gameplay consists of point-and-click adventure with RPG elements featuring combat moves that will be sure to crack you up more than once. The story is solid and dare we say upholds the lore of the show. If you don’t mind a dirty obnoxious hilarious joke every now and then (ok, all the time), pick this one up.			"

												This is the greatest South Park game of all time. In its own right, this is a pretty great adventure/JRPG hybrid. Although every game mechanic has been used hundreds of times in every game, they've never been combined in such a way like this before. A JRPG with a full collect-a-thon system set in South Park, CO? That's a huge undertaking, and Obsidian have stepped up to the plate.The game is also relatively bug free, although its menus and interface look like♥♥♥♥♥ I have to assume that they did not have an interface designer, because the interface is both ugly and hard to use. Luckily, it's not too important, and beyond that the game is quite beautiful in its own South Park way.The biggest selling point of this game is the ability to play the game and have a hard time finding graphical inconsistencies that make it seem like you're not just watching an episode of South Park. This is a long, 15-hour episode of South Park, and it is pretty fantastic.However, do not buy the DLC. I picked them both up, and never used the equipment and items provided by the DLC.			"

												It’s really quite remarkable how South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have slowly ramped up the shock value over the past 17 years to keep the show sharp. Whether they and developer Obsidian could pull off the same for a 14-hour game instead of a 22-minute show was never a sure thing. But there I was, shrunk down to Underpants Gnome-size, crawling up Mr. Slave’s orifices to retrieve a WMD, slicing through gobs of bodily fluids in turn-based JRPG combat and climbing up half-digested corn-on-the-cob as I went, laughing hysterically the whole way. I’m floored at how consistently funny it is, and at how well the outrageous comedy melds with the relatively simple gameplay to create not just an amazing South Park game, but an intelligent and witty satire of roleplaying mechanics.As for the story, it’s a clever premise that allows The Stick of Truth to take place in a recognizable and painstakingly recreated South Park setting, but also brings in all the usual fantasy roleplaying tropes through the power of children’s imagination. It’s a trick used many times in the show, and it works great for the game, too. An epic LARPing session (as casually set up by last year’s “Black Friday” trilogy of episodes) has your custom-created new kid in town joining either Cartman’s Humans or Kyle’s Elves, all dressed in amusingly bad makeshift cosplay outfits. True to the show, things escalate wildly and hilariously, leading to conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and Taco Bell.Though it manifests itself in typically over-the-top South Park-ian ways, The Stick of Truth is a Paper Mario-esque RPG-lite. You and your single extra party member (you’ll unlock several South Park regulars, though only one can fight with you at a time) take turns battling formations of enemies, be it the Gingers, crazy homeless guys, aliens, and more. Typical buffs and debuffs are ably skinned in screwed-up fourth grader verbiage (throwing feces to add “gross out” effects) mixed with mana-powered spells and timed button-press attacks and blocks to keep you on your toes during combat. It keeps things simple enough while still leaving room for some tactical depth. And Obsidian refreshingly leaves out time-sink annoyances like character encumbrance and random battles you can’t avoid.I couldn’t resist the curious lure of playing as the Jew class over the archetypal Fighter, Thief, and Mage options, but the differences between them turned out to be South Park: The Stick of Truth  March 4, 2014 Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman set out to kick role-play gaming in the nuts with South Park: The Stick of Truth, an RPG set in the town of South Park.  →  Much More Ryan McCaffrey Says Try This Game If You Liked: South Park: Bigger, Longer and UncutSouth Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!Paper Mario disappointingly slight. Sure, each has their own special abilities, but there are effectively no class-specific weapons or items, and there’s nothing to stop a Mage from choosing melee-enhancing gear and carving up foes with a blade just as well as a Fighter. All classes eventually learn special farting magic (a crude parody of Skyrim’s Dragon Shouts) though both the thumbstick motions and especially the tutorial sessions for your powers of flatulence tend to be cumbersome. Achievement or Trophy hunting aside, this lack of class differentiation or significant choices in the story are big reasons why I don’t feel much incentive to replay the campaign. The other unfortunate offense is that some extremely useful things are poorly explained, if they’re even mentioned at all. Tricks like being able to switch your Buddy at any time by pressing down on the D-pad to access the Party menu, or taking the first swing at overworld enemies so that you get the first turn when the battle starts, and what your Buddies can do and are specifically good at are all up to us to discover accidentally. One other puzzling issue is the slipperiness of the action-selection wheel during combat – it’s strangely difficult to get your pointer to stick on the option you want, particularly if it’s in a diagonal slot on the wheel.But that’s about the extent of the damage. Aesthetically, The Stick of Truth might be the most beautiful crappy-looking-on-purpose game I’ve ever seen. While it may seem trivial to make a role-playing game resemble the crude, construction-paper cutout style of the show, it’s executed so well here that the two mediums are almost indistinguishable. You’ll never see a HUD when walking around town, for instance, unless you tap the Y/Triangle button. Only the very rare stuck animation on an overworld enemy and (on both consoles, but not a capable PC) the occasional frame rate stutter when a new area loaded in for the first time reminded me that this was a game and not the show. And that was the extent of the technical problems I encountered.The VerdictThe Stick of Truth makes one thing abundantly clear: I never want to play another South Park video game made without Trey Parker and Matt Stone's direct,			"

 General Idea If you enjoy the show South Park, then you will enjoy this game! That being said, if you don't like the show, then you probably won't enjoy this game, as it is basically a 16 hour playable episode. Gameplay This game is absolutely hilarious! What you see in the TV show is pretty much what you can expect to see in this game. You can go into most buildings and houses.  In some houses that you try to enter, you will find people masturbating, people screwing horses, or naked dancing ladies.  You can raid people's houses of all their personal belongings and valuables, and nobody gives a damn. The only authority to you really is your parents,  and in one mission a hall monitor, but they don't really count.  There is a point at the beginning of the game when you realize that a fart is bound to the right mouse button. It is at that moment that you will realize what kind of game this is. You probably will love it from this moment on, as most players probably did. The missions are intriguing, and humor is scattered throughout the game everywhere. The one thing people may not like is the combat style. It is a turn-based combat sort of like the game Wizard101. This game is pretty much a single player RPG. You do missions and fight to get experience and level up. As you gain Facebook friends with the people throughout South Park, you will be able to upgrade your player.  Levels I will start by saying that the max level in this game is level 15. It is like many other RPGs, in that all items have a level requirement. I must say, in my opinion, that it takes a while to level up. In just about 9 hours of gameplay, I have only gotten to level 13. Based on this, it probably takes between 10-12 hours to get to level 15 and complete one of the classes. Campaign You start the campaign as the new kid who just moved to South Park, CO and the hope is that you will help the humans secure the Stick of Truth so that they can rule the universe. The war is between the Humans, led by Cartman, and the Elves, led by Kyle. There are 4 different classes you can choose to be, and they are:  Fighter, Mage, Thief,  and  Jew.   You are able to type a name in at the beginning of the game, but you are assigned the name ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" by Cartman.  The campaign is very fun and immersive, and you could easily find yourself sitting and playing this game for hours at a time. You will find out that it can be very hard to get up and stop playing this game. After you complete the campaign, however, there is nearly no drive to keep playing the game. Conclusion In my opinoin, every penny I put into this game has been worth it, because I purchased it when it was only $13.59. If you like South Park, and the game is on sale, do not pass it up! Since I don't watch the show very much because I never got into it, I actually only bought it because it was on sale. Once I installed it and played it I soon realized that it was a great purchase! While it is at its normal price of $40, it's really up to you whether or not you want to get it, but it is a fantastic game and you probably will come close to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants because it is so funny. This game is definitely in my Top 5 favorites, and I completely recommend this game!Thank you for reading my review of South Park™: The Stick of Truth™			"

												A really, really funny game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, and always cracking a smile. The entire game from start to finish is funny, the combat is surprisingly fun for a game I expected to be handled by amateurs. I'd recommend this to any RPG lover, South Park fan, or anyone looking for a single player campaign to keep you glued to your seat for hours. The one negative thing I would say about this game is that even on hardcore mode the game can seem pretty easy once you have a handle on using potions, healing yourself, and making use of special abilities. Don't let that deter you from buying this game at full price, or on sale! The game is hilarious, and is well worth the money!			"

												This game is honestly way better than I thought it would be. I'm not a fan of South Park, but my husband received this gift for Christmas and as I watched him play this it looked really cute. So I played it and it's a really well thought out turn based RPG. It makes many fun references to other science fiction, fantasy, video games, and RPGs so you don't /have/ to be a huge fan of South Park to find yourself laughing throughout this game. Only thing I found myself wanting in this game was a crafting system, but if that's really my only complaint then that should tell you how good of a game this really is. Would recommend.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E14 South Park: The Stick of Truth 

			Views: 164		

			South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great love letter to fans. Its role-playing elements may be simple and easy but, if you enjoy the humor of South Park it will be more than enough to go through the...		

South Park: The Stick of Truth: It’s a very rare thing to see licenses from television shows or movies be made into a videogame and actually turn out to be a great game. South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of those rare occasions. A great role-playing game made by Obsidian Entertainment (creators of Fallout: New Vegas) along with the creators of South Park (who also do a lot of the voice acting) to create a funny and simple game in which to celebrate the world of South Park and also to give fans something to enjoy for years to come. While relatively short by most role-playing game standards, lasting between 15-18 hours, The Stick of Truth gives enough variety and plenty of humor to make it an easily enjoyable experience and worth the asking price. Everything in the game is wholly belonging to South Park, it has songs from episodes dotted throughout the game, voice actors make a return to voice their respective characters and everything feels like South Park. Visuals also feel directly translated from the show, the game feels like a very long episode of the show. Controls are simple and easy to learn, the game overall is pretty easy with only a few enemies posing a decent challenge so you won’t feel very much pressure from the combat portion of the game. The only real detriment to South Park: The Stick of Truth is the fact that it is everything South Park. While I personally find the game to be funny and enjoy the jokes, it is easy to see how this game can turn away those who aren’t huge fans or hate the humor that South Park has and there isn’t an amazing enough role-playing game here to win those on the fence about South Park over. The other minor gripe with the game is the controls when using the mouse and keyboards. Some of the abilities didn’t feel like they responded as well when using their respective keys versus a controller. I also experience a few glitches such as Jimmy not getting out of his stuttering loop and some minor glitches of my character flickering in and out of a scene during a cinematic. Overall I enjoyed my time with South Park: The Stick of Truth, there is a fun role-playing game here along with the great humor of South Park. Those who won’t enjoy this game are those who are going to be offended by what is displayed in the game or just don’t enjoy the humor of South Park. If you are middle of the ground and don’t mind the humor the role-playing game beneath may not be enough to warrant a full $60.00 USD price tag. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Review: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												If you are a fan of South Park or black humor and RPG you HAVE to play this game. It’s like watching a whole season of SP where you are one of the guys. If you are sort of a person that gets easily offended – stay away from this game. The amount of inappropriate things you will be exposed to, probably will give you a brain seizure.			"

												I came for the standard South Park humor, but ended up getting a LOT more playtime because...well, you can dress your character up like a girl, and it suits him (it helps that he keeps his month shut for most of the game). Any game that has a playable trap is objectively good and worth sinking hours into.Aside from that, the game itself is easy (well, at least on Normal; haven't tried Hardcore yet) and the main story is short, but it's entertaining. And really, games are just about having fun, right?			"

												Well, that was quite the adventure.  I almost don't know where to begin.Stick of Truth is a turn-based RPG, specifically more of the JRPG variety despite taking a few notes from the WRPG games.  But when I say turn-based, I don't mean that you simply click on the enemy you want to fight exactly one time and watch an attack happen.  This type of turn-based is much more interactive where you have to press certain buttons in a certain fashion for attacks to connect properly and deliver the most potential damage.  For example, when using Butter's Hammer of Storms ability, you have to click a button when the lightning strikes his hammer, or else the attack will fail and you'll perform a pitiful amount of damage to your target.  Then also, this same combat mechanic is used for blocking or quick time events, allowing you to either lessen the damage you receive or outright avoid it in certain situations.  It's very similar to the Mario RPGs in that regard, making it very interactive and forcing you to pay close attention.  Thanks to this, combat never really felt boring to me.The world of Stick of Truth is also extremely fun to explore.  I really did feel like the city of South Park was created to its fullest, giving me access to just about every location that was known in the show.  Most of the city is accessable right away for the most part, though there are a few places you can't reach until you unlock certain abilities.  But the game isn't harsh by allowing you to stay lost, for your menu will always tell you where you need to go and have a giant exclamation point over it on your map.  It even does the same thing for any side quests you're doing at the moment.  Now I know you might be worried about having to walk EVERYWHERE in this huge town to accomplish your many tasks, but thankfully, this game provides instant transport, reducing that monotomy.  It is such a huge time saver.The plot of the story, as you can probably guess, is pure comedy.  I mean, it's South Park, what do you expect?  As the story progresses, you'll find yourself laughing at just about everything in the game, whether it's for the ridiculous dirty humor or the jabs at the JRPG genre.  And yet, despite the humor, there really is a certain kind of epic feel to the story.  Yeah I know its just a bunch of fourth graders LARPing and blowing everything out of proportion, but I'm serious when I say I felt this game had some genuinely awesome moments.  Rescuing Princess Kenny from one of the elves that was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥her was one fine example.  Well pretending to♥♥♥♥♥♥her by jumping up and down on the bed with Kenny tied up next to him and just standing there (what you thought I was serious?). So to rescue her, you have to break into the bedroom, climb up some shelves, then rip the ceiling lamp dangling above the elf out so that the wiring is all loose so that it resembles a zipline.  Then you slide down the wire and with your momentum, ram right into the guy to knock him out and break the whole bed and get Kenny out.  It's so stupid and childish, but it was awesome at the same time.  And the music certainly helps give off that epic feel too.  The entire soundtrack sounds like something out of Skyrim or Lord of the Rings, which is just amazing and really helps add to the atmosphere of the whole thing.  With all that said, this game isn't for the sensitive.  Stick of Truth is merely South Park in video game format, meaning that the offensive and vulgar humor is still all there in its purest form.  And this time, absolutely nothing has to be censored (unless you're getting the European or Australlian version).  Some small spoilers here, but there is a part in the game where you have been shrunk down and there's a boss battle in your parent's bedroom on their bed.  While your parents are there.  Having sex while you are battling the boss underneath them.  With porno music playing the background.  Don't even get me started on the quick time event that occurs during the fight.  I feel bad for the poor suckers who played this in front of their sensitive friends/Twitch viewers and never saw it coming.  And only worse things happen, as hard as it is to believe.  But hey it's South Park.  I wouldn't expect anything less.  Especially since one of the achievements is even named ""Too Far"" and requires you to do something really messed up.  This was Trey Parker and Matt Stone's first attempt at becoming involved in a South Park video game.  There were previous South Park games, but none of them had Trey and Matt actively working alongside the development team.  And boy, can you tell that those two had put everything into this game.  I couldn't even begin to name all of the references to the show that they put in here.  It's simply impossible.  This game, is without a doubt, one of the most entertaining and hilarious games I've played in a very long time and I applaud those two for all of the effort they put into it.  Despite it being only about 10-20 hours long, kind of easy at times, and awkward to watch other times, they did a fantastic job.Here's looking forward to the Fractured But Whole.And whatever you do, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT HEADPHONES.  It is extremely NSFW and your parents will probably disown if they see you doing even half of the stuff in the game.			"

												This game is fantastic! If you are a fan of the South Park show then you'll love it. It's different from any other TV/Movie turned game that I've ever played in the way that this one is actually worth playing. Not only is it funny, but it's fun. The game mechanics, while a bit dated, work well. The artwork/graphics were done perfectly. The voices are perfect. Above all else though the game it's self is good. There is no poor, glossed over, rushed feel to this game, it doesn't have that lack luster, ""I'm trying to just milk this franchise for everything it's worth"" feel. Not being bad isn't enough though to make it good. What makes it good is not only the glitch free game play, but that the game play it's self is fun. There are four different classes and each plays differently. You can choose different sides while playing the game and there are plenty of side missions to keep you busy as well. Some offer up new gear, while others help you unlock more perks. This game follows the South Park tradition of being raunchy and some times just plain wrong... Only you are dealing with more than just a cut scene, you are playing through it. I laughed my a$$ off the first time I played it and still had some laughs the second time though. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who has yet to play though it, and I was careful about that in my screen shots. If you have been thinking about picking this up, go for it. You don't even have to wait for a sale for it to be worth it. I have some screen shots posted as well without any spoilers so feel free to check them out.Two very big thumbs up for South Park fans!

												So this is the game of South Park. This game is by far the BEST south park game due to the fact it was made with Matt and Trey being there for the hole creation making it feel like you are really inside of the show, also if you have seen every episode all the way to 2014 you would really enjoy all the references within the show. There are SO many references in the game its great. So here are some pros and cons, by the way I havent finished this game (I only have 49 minutes so far) but I see so many great things in this game I really reccomend you to buy it.Pros:- Matt and Trey were heavily involved with the creation of the game so it gives the game a large feeling of the actuall show- The fighting is really fun and is very interactive with the fighting not being just like Pokemon (no hate plz) where its just press this attack then they use the attack, in this game you have to time things and it's really fun!Cons:-So far none!So this is my first look, when I finish the game I will update with a lengthier review, but so far I really reccomend this game to any fans of the show.

												Being a long-time South Park fan I really appriciated the work Matt & Trey + team put into making this awsome game.I was a bit sceptic at first glance but after a friend of mine told me that it feels like a longer episode of the series...I was hooked, bought it, played it and loved it.Now we have to look forward to the nex entry in the series: ""the Fractured but Whole"".--- Pros ---+ Humour, it dosen´t get more south park than this+ Great visuals (yes I mean it)+ the Story, the characters it´s all there--- Cons ---- Not too fond of all the Ubisoft collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- It DOES outstay it´s welcome for some reason, IF you want to do EVERYTHING. At least for me it did.--------------------------Didn´t see anyone write this when I bought it, but being from europe and being neighbur with Germany I wanted to to reasure that THIS version of the game is NOT the censured one. It is not the censured version, thankfully. Now I don´t know how Steam releases these games to other countrys, but since I could play the game uncesured maybe you could too!?---------------------------			"

												Stick of truth is the funniest, most disgusting and entraining games I've played. The game recreates the show perfectly, the voice acting is amazing, the script is the funniest and most disgusting of all the south park stuff I've seen (saw until season 13 I think).Even if I prefer real-time combat (big fan of hack-n-slash games and shooters) this combat felt great because the attacks and armor the enemies wore was so ridiculous, I hate turn based RPGs but I like this type of game where you get damage boost or can avoid some damage by clicking/pressing a button at the right time (Paper Mario was my favourite RPG before this one). But in it could have been a little bit harder, I had no problems except for one optional boss battle (I'm super cereal) and I didn't felt the necesity to change partner except for the part where you had to, I only changed them for the lulz but the first partner felt like it was the best.The story is hilarious, there wasn't a 10 minutes period where I didn't at least giggle. The only thing that annoyed me is that most characters acted like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to me x3 but is South Park.. so... and there were a lot of things I wish were included in the game but I'm hoping the sequel has them. And I hated the junk stuff was really good and packed with references, I didn't wanted to sell anything haha. Loved that the chinpokomon were collectibles (one of my favorite episodes).It had problems, the combat felt a little too easy and repetitive by the end (but not much) but in the end it was a total plessure to play it and it was the first game that made me actually laugh out loud through out the whole game. I rate it 9/10.SPOILER!!I'm a sick ♥♥♥♥ and loved the Mr. Slave♥♥♥♥♥♥level and the gnomes part xD (it was as awkward as funny). "

												Ubisoft titles on PC do not have a good reputation. Because of that I approached this game with trepidation. I am glad to say that it doesn't require that god awful Uplay. The game itself is what you would expect of South Park. The game feels as though you are seeing/playing an actual episode of the titular show. Your favorite characters are here including Cartman, Butters, Tweek, Jimmy, Craig, Kenny and more. You start by creating your very own character who is a bit of a blank slate. In true South Park fashion Cartman starts the mud slinging as soon as you give your character a name. Its from this moment that you nod your head knowingly that this is indeed South Park. You are on a quest to protect the stick of truth and keep it from the hands of the elves. Along the way you will meet meth addicts, aliens and more. Its hard to write a review without spoiling some of the great moments in the game that will put a smile on your face. Beneath its crass, crude and faithful exterior is a surprising amount of depth in the gameplay itself. You have magic, ranged and melee attacks and find various bits of gear to equip. You have abilities that use PP while others like your fart attacks use mana. The game makes clever use of allowing you to time a counter and block incoming damage. One of my favorite abilities is kicking enemies in the nuts to stun them. Completing sidequests can also net you some powerful summons that you can use as well. In the end Stick of Truth is not only one of the more faithful licensed games I have played. But it may just be one of the best licensed games I have played. If you are a fan of South Park you are sure to enjoy this adventure. Pick it up on sale now or preorder the sequel and get this one for free.			"

												Use your potions.  Liker seriously, every turn until your down to cleaning up the last guy.  Most rpg's you never use potions cause you never need them, and you want to save them for a boss battle and end up never needing them there either.  Maybe theyre expensive or hard to find in most rpgs.  Not in South Park.  You get a ton of every kind of potion for free everywhere.  You can use them every turn, and never buy one, and you'll never run out.  So really, feel free to use them early and often.  Not using the potions can actually make even some trash battles very difficult.Game is great.  If you like the show, you'll like the storyline.  Tons of inside jokes and references to old episodes.  All the 'junk' that you accumulate (which btw you can freely sell, there is no crafting or any use for it whatsoever) is stuff mentioned in the episodes.Tons of cameos from minor or incidental characters (underpants gnomes, lemmiwinks, etc).Battle system takes a bit of getting used to.  It's not purely a turn based rpg, there are some twitch elements to doing every action.  But you get used to it and can just avoid any actions that you have trouble with and use others instead.			"

												If you're a south park fan, and you miss having a good old RPG kinda feel to things- this is your game. I was highly doubtful of this game, and then after watching videos on it and playing it myself, all doubt is removed. Not for the easily offended, the humor goes to the levels we see in the south park movie and beyond. Great for a laugh and it really is some of the best work done by the creators.			"

												Amazing game, a great story line and the game looks just like it is in the cartoon. For all the southpark fans out there, I would advise you to get it immediately, as there are lots of cool references from the series that are put in the game and I loved every single minute of it. I can't wait for the next game that is going to come out in December 2016!Too bad I couldn't find the last kindergaten child, poor kid has been hiding for 3 days... 10/10			"

												Well well well... not bad. Not bad at all. The South Park (SP) guys have really done it. They have managed to make a game that looks and plays like a SP episode. The characters are there, the humour is there, the music is there and ofc the raunchiness is there. If you are into SP you will not be disappointed. So, you are the new kid - in my case a black Jewish kid with freckles and purple hair - and you just moved into SP. It is your mission to make friends, beat up elves and bums, loot what you can and deal with a fair deal of anal probing. Your charter is customizable up to the balls (no pun intended, you can have balls on your chin) with various clothes, weapons, haircuts, glasses etc. As in most rpg-s you get levels from fighting and questing and upon levelling up your stats go up (you can’t pick which stats) and you unlock more abilities (you can choose perks and you gain magic spells and special abilities that level up). The battle is turn based, but has a quick time event system built into it every step of the way. Oddly enough, I really did not not like it! In fact, the game is pretty solid all around. It’s a good RPG.True RPG fans will ofc be missing the ability to assign your str/agi/int etc and maybe they will expect a larger variety of skills and especially magic (8h in, I find the magic/fart system to be perhaps the most disappointing part of it, but still ok) but you do get to shape how you do your damage so you feel in control all the time.The game is well paced, there is always something for you to do, the game world is easy to travel /a bit small maybe even/ so you don’t waste time just travelling. New areas of the world open up as you gain new abilities giving you reasons to go back to places you have visited already.If you can take the SP humour, you will never have a dull moment and you will be adventuring with smile on your face the whole time.  This game is fab aside from the lacklustre magic system.9/10			"

												One of the first RPGs I've bothered playing the side quests for... and played them alongside the main quest. They use the console war clans for their plot (Grand Wizard Cartman, Butters, and Princess Kenny vs the Elves).Active turn based combat similar to Super Mario RPG... with Skyrim style questing. Facebook feed.Complete fan service. References litterred in the form of Bethesda junk (Skyrim cups, random trash from Fallout), music from the show playing in various buildings, characters from every part of the show, etcIt's funny and the game South Park fans deserve.

												I came for the standard South Park humor, but ended up getting a LOT more playtime because...well, you can dress your character up like a girl, and it suits him (it helps that he keeps his month shut for most of the game). Any game that has a playable trap is objectively good and worth sinking hours into.Aside from that, the game itself is easy (well, at least on Normal; haven't tried Hardcore yet) and the main story is short, but it's entertaining. And really, games are just about having fun, right?			"

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati.

												South Park is a tough game to review. From a game mechanic standpoint it doesn't break any new ground. Gameplay is thin, the controls (to fart) are annoying and it's relatively short (15 hours) for what it costs.If this were any other RPG, it would be widely condemned. But it's South Park through and through, which means you'll both laugh and cringe at the same time. What other game will have you fighting an underpants gnome while trying to dodge a giant ball sack? What game has you crawling through someone's rear end while a gerbil sings to you? Occasionally side-splitting, often head-shaking, the humor in Stick of Truth is exactly like the show. That's really what you're playing and paying for here. You're interacting with a 15 hour episode of South Park, lovingly nurtured, written and voice acted by Matt and Trey. The RPG mechanics are just an excuse to call it a game. You're playing this because it's just like watching a season of the show. You're going to visit all of the areas you know and love from the series. You're going to the Mongorian grill. You're going to meet up with Jesus. You're going to the wrong side of the tracks to Kenny's House. And you're going to do this as the ""New Kid"" that fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast of characters for a wild, weird and wonderful time.If that doesn't sound like it's funny then this game isn't for you. If you find the show rude, crude and reprehensible, then you should run (not walk)away. But if you like the show, if you like the humor, wit, crudeness and everything else that goes on in South Park then you'll enjoy this game as I did. If you don't, well...respect my authoritah!			"

												I almost never play(ed) RPG games but this game is an exception for sure. You basicly play a whole South Park story with your choices. At the start you make your own south park character which is quite nice, although you can easily change everything later in the game too, while playing. If you like RPG and/or South Park itself, then I recommend you to try this out for sure. The humor is obviously there just like in the series and references too. The game is quite detailed, you can explore the whole map, loot a lot of stuff, there are main and side-quests, abilities, collectables, skills, upgrades ... and a lot more stuff. The game is turn-based and you can notice that in battles, every side gets its turn untill you knock out/kill the other team. You can easily get some potions in loot to increase your attack and stuff or refill some health. A good hint before confronting enemies and get into a battle is that there are puzzles in the game, which abilities are meant to use for. You can knock someone out before getting into battle, but you can loose health too before getting into the battle ! For the rest I'll say there are way more features I did not mentioned, so get this great game.About negative sides, I don't see any major ones... The people who say it doesn't have any replay potentional, well I already can say I wanna see what happens when I pick other choices. If you're a curious person, you will check that out and replay it. An example is that you have to choose a side where you fight for (Elves or humans). Maybe another point is the main price (30 €) - I rather feel like that 5-10 € too much.So again, if you get the game you'll like it. But get it when there's discount. I bought the game in the summer sale when it was -66% and I love it.			"

												It's like playing an extra-long episode of South Park that you drive forward by completing tasks. The game plays a lot like the Paper Mario series, which really fits in with the theme. There are 4 classes to choose from, but aside from 3 specific armor sets, each class uses the same weapons and armor. This means that you'll have new ways to play the game with each playthrough without it being too out of focus.			"

												South Park The Stick Of Truth is exactly what you'd thought it would be. It's hilarious, over the top and fun. The writing is top notch, it's like you're in the show when you play. The combat is fun, fast and easy to pick up. Nothing too hard there. There are tons of collectables and people to talk to that will keep you busy for hours and hours. You're constantly unlocking new abilities that grant you access to more and more areas as well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the show. The sheer amount of crossover from the show to the game is amazing. You'll love it.			"

												This is probably the best South Park game one could hope for, and it's one of the best and most fulfilling games I've played in recent years.For one, the sidequests don't feel tacked-on.They're an integral part of the whole, and they're actually worth doing in order to receive some more hilarious rewards.The combat is simple, but it does feel as rewarding as in any other turn-based RPG to see the high numbers fly.The length of the game is perfect.It took me about 16 hours of gameplay in order to wrap up all of the collectables, sidequests, and main story missions.On top of all of this, it looks and sounds amazing as well.Definite must-own for the South Park fan, and potential gateway drug for the fan-recruit.

												♥♥♥♥♥jokes - check.Shameless and merciless satire - check.Kenny dies - check.Exploration - check.QTE that doesn't annoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me - check.Seriously, get this game right now if you had ever watched at least one episode of South Park and laughed.

I've only seen a couple of episodes and actually quite liked them. So it's not like you have to watch every episode of South Park to enjoy this game.Also, Obsidian Entertainment did quite an awesome job this time, I've expected the game to have much more bugs.PS. The game is pretty easy. I've played it on hard difficulty, and even that felt like a walk in the park. Still, I wouldn't say that challenge is the most important thing in this game, but it's definitely lacking most of the time.			"

												So i have been waiting for this game for over 2 years and now its finally here, and WOW it meet my expectations. From the start of your adventure you as a new kid needs to make friends and oh boy you do, as in typical fashion south park delivers its over the top missions. This RPG kicks♥♥♥♥♥ i have never laughed so much in a video game it's refreshing and hilarious.                  south park studio in my eyes have already created a season 18 but in a video game, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made magic ! This is an amazing Game and i'd recommend this to any one !			"

												I've always liked South Park, and this review is probably gonna be a little biased by that. I can say straight away, if you don't like the series, then don't get this game, and stop reading.I was a little worried about what to expect with this game when I saw the first gameplay videos. A mix of adventure and turnbased combat is a very rare thing to see these days, atleast among the ""larger"" titles. As soon as the game or rather episode started, my worries disappeared. This is not so much a game,as it is another episode in South Park.You take on the role as the new kid in town, and as you get forced to make friends in the neighbourhood, all sorts of crazy adventures and humorous catastrophes happen. The story is very good and the progression in this, has never been to slow or to fast. I find that in some games the story gets lost in to much gameplay or the gameplay gets ruined by the story. This game seems to keep the balance between gameplay and story very nicely, which I find is very important to a game with so much comedy. This leads me to the main reason to get the game. The amount of profanity, insanity and sexuality mixed in with a nice amount of violence left me laughing out loud more times I can remember. If you like South Park humour the game is certainly required in your game collection.The gameplay is nothing elaborate or even diffecult. You wander around on maps, interacting with items, people or enemies, and move between these maps without any load time. When you encounter an enemy, the game switches to a turnbased combat phase. The combat is fairly straightforward and for each attack there is a combination of mouseclicking and button-mashing to get it to work. Even if you fail in this sorta easy mash-click-buttoning (Which I did plenty of times), you will still damage your enemy, albeit for a smaller amount of damage. The combat sorta has a tactical element with selecting the right attack for the correct enemy and at the same time requiring a bit of skill with that click-button-mashing. The same applies to the enemy attacks, which you can defend yourself from.The graphics and sound are the same as in the series, though there was a part in the game that changed considerably. I wont spoil anything in this review, but I can tell that I liked the retro-feel of it, and in combination with the story it was a little detail that left me smiling and laughing.The game in itself would be 5 out of 5 stars from me. This however leaving out the price of the game and also the replay value. There are some small elements of choice in the game, but none that will make the story change to much. There are some choices with your class, and some choices during the game, none of which really makes that much of an impact on the story, which is my main reason to get the game. I spent 22 hours playing the game and with a price of 40 euros, that is a big price to pay for a game with nearly no replay value. Still, I look at this game as a gem, and 22 hours laughing and smiling, well... I pay around 10 euros to go to the movies, and those only last what? Like 2 hours?			"

 “Think of your favorite South Park Episode. And now throw that thought away and play this. It’s even better.""  TL;DR:  ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore. It’s worth buying it 2 times. Note: This review doesn’t contain any spoiler. Graphic 9/10 What can I say? It’s your typical South Park look. Even though some effects seem dull, you’ll get what you expect. Every little detail is beautiful designed and there are some surprises. But don’t expect any graphical wonders. I love it. Sound 10/10 I wish I could give more than 10/10. Some Soundtracks are damn good and remind you of certain games like Skyrim and such. But even funnier and better. Perfect synchro as in the series. Some weapon could sound more…”Damaging”, but overall you’ll feel mighty and strong and it is all accompanied by gorgeous music. Story: 9/10 Normally I’d give here a 7/10, since the Story isn’t THAT innovative, but since it’s South Park, they managed to do fantastic things out of seemingly tedious things. It’s all well told and it doesn’t get boring at all. For me it was.. or is.. THE best South Park Episode I’ve experienced so far. And it gets weirder the further you get.  Gameplay: 8/10 Oh boy where do I start? I’ll quote Smash Mouth here: “So much to do, so much to see.” And that’s on point. You have so many items to gather and equip, so many different enemy types to fight, so many places to visit… I could go on forever. I spent the first hour just walking through the whole town and visiting every building, talking to everyone. It was great. The Fights are well done and you have a lot of ways to handle them. May it be through magical farts or combining your abilities with some heavy sword attacks. You even get to set who is accompanying you. You can choose wether it is Butters, Kyle, Cartman etc.. They all have different abilities and offering advantages in certain fights. So try them all out!The options seem endless. The only thing I really didn’t like about it is that later on it gets so annoying to fight since it gets way too easy (I recommend a higher difficulty level). But you are greatly entertained for some hours. Difficulty: 4/10 The first half of the game was really challenging and some quest I had to leave out and do them later since I didn’t had a chance, but around Level 9 it starts getting way too easy. I played on normal (You can switch difficulty settings mid-game if you want) and I smashed just through the enemy lines. It’s easy for beginners, but don’t expect that much of a challenge. ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore. Notable: - I haven't come along one single bug. Just One or two minor lags that aren’t even worth mentioning.- Funniest Game ever.- ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore.- Lack of options, which is also not really worth mentioning because.. come on.. You didn’t really expect changing the graphic settings here, did you?- Runs smoothly - I completed it in around 16 hours and that is quite a lot! I left out 2 quests, which you can still complete after beating the game, but I was satisfied and happy at the end.-  The End is perfect.  Conclusion: If you’re a fan of South Park: Get it.If you’re no fan of South Park: Get it and become a fan.Thanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below.			"

												Oookay, I did not have such a good laugh for a very long time. I don't even have to tell you that  the game is just as genuine as an entire season on TV, with nothing cut short and with every single nasty detail of it. It was awesome. It has original voice acting, the same awesome characters we know and love, and a huge repertoire of jokes that will never cease to surprise you.The gameplay itself is played as an open world RPG with turn based battles. The battle itself is actually very good in RPG way, simple enough for anybody to understand it, and hillarious at the same time. We can talk about an ""open world"" here. But this open world is pretty 2D, which of course matches perfectly the game, and the show. Also South park was recreated in incredible detail, and everything will instantly feel familiar.For the fans of the show: It's a must have! Absolutely. For those who don't like the show, you should stay away of this game. Because anything you don't like about the show, you will find it in here.I had an awesome time, and I am very glad that I picked this one up.			"

It's funny yes, but the story is very short, the sidequests are easy as all hell and its not got enough gameplay to be worth £30, wait till it goes on sale for £20 and then pick it up.It's basically a playable 3 episode south park story arc.

												My god. This is a rarity. This is a gem of a game, not because the combat system is good, or the gameplay is good, they both are, but where this game truly shines is how funny it is. It abuses video game tropes, and really ♥♥♥♥s with you, sometimes breaking the fourth wall. The plot is silly, you play as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" (No you cannot choose another name) and must play a game, which is basically LARPing. You dress up in warrior clothes, and fight other kids. And then later adults. And aliens. It's just as silly and rediculous as it sounds. I reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the show, or has good humor, or even just likes RPG games. 9/10			"

												The game is full of mature humor and the story has a bunch of twists and turns that kept me playing. Very entertaining, and the ending was epic and touching. It was a memorable game, although after the main story line, playing the game purely for completion is stale.*UpdateScore: 10/10Not just a great RPG game, but a perfect game in general. Engaging story with a perfect length, great battle system, hilarious moments sprinkled throughout every corner of the game, tackles the serious parts of the game that prevents it from being a shallow game. Buy it NOW, buy it when its on sale. Just make sure you try this game ASAP! I promise you'll be begging for the sequel soon			"

												+ Constantly humorous+ Interesting (but small) world to explore+ Fan service for South Park fans+ Good length considering the source material- Simplistic, unchallenging combat- Spotty save system     South Park fans rejoice! This game is fanservice at its best. As an unabashed South Park fan, this game had me literally laughing out loud for most of the game. If you are a South Park fan, do not hesitate to buy The Stick of Truth! If you're not, I'm afraid that the RPG-style gameplay may be a bit dull and a bit too easy to keep you interested. You'll find yourself spamming the same couple of attacks in every battle. The timed button presses make it a bit more engaging, but once you're doing them by muscle memory... battle kinda becomes a chore.      There are a fair amount of collectable elements that make exploring all the nooks and crannies of the seemingly shrunken town of South Park more interesting, at least on the first playthough. Absolutely no grinding, very few fetch quests, and the game doesn't draw anything out unneccisarily, making it short but sweet. It's sort of like an RPG for people who don't play RPG's, but honestly the gameplay is just there to add a 'game' element to what is otherwise a long episode of South Park.     Be wary of the autosave system! Reloading a game may mean you have to go back and re-do something because it doesn't save your exact moment of progress! Pay attention each time you load your game, as there are some missable collectables! I missed out on a major achievement because of this wonky system. TALK TO CLYDE AS SOON AS YOU ENTER KUPA KEEP! You'll thank me later!89/100Funny and fun, South Park fans should definitely play this! This RPG-stlye game is simple, but doesn't drag you through hours of pointless distractions.			"

												Alright 5 hours into the game (including time wasted between laughter, exploration, and being outright stuck), it's been pretty reminiscent as well as enjoyful. A lot of references, and definitely the humor most people recognize the series as being known for.Pros:- Customization (character, appearance, stats, abilities)- Interactivity (Really does feel like an RPG game, in both fights and exploration of the overworld.)- The same stupid (but laughable) comedy this series has been known for.Cons:- Known bugs that can interrupt your playthrough (Experienced one such bug when learning my first Magic spell. I had to reload a checkpoint about 1 minute before the tutorial).- Instructions can sometimes be unclear of where to go next, or interactable items can be difficult to notice (This may not apply to all people. I was stuck twice for about 10 minutes each unsure of what to do next.).- Even for the humor and gameplay (Let's be serious, this was not a game for a high graphics expectation), compared to other games available now at similar or lower prices, I say it is not worth the FULL $60. It's worth a good chunk of that in my opinion (Like $30-$40), but not the full $60.Overall: Worth getting if you see it on sale. It's a good time filler when I want to play a game on my own, that a 3-year old laptop can still run at perfect frames.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a role-playing adventure game.The game starts with the mute protagonist being ordered to leave the house and make friends in his new home town of South Park. Immediately you become a friend of Butters and he gets you into the Human clan of a Dungeon & Dragons-esque group ruled by the Grand Wizard Cartman. You are given the choice between four character classes. You can be a Fighter, a Mage, a Thief, or a Jew.At the first part of South Park: The Stick of Truth you spend your time recruiting factions and battling elves to reclaim the stick. In true South Park fashion the story escalates out of control leading to being abducted by aliens, shrank by underpants gnomes and travelling to 8-bit Canada to translate abortion documents written in French. The story makes sense in the context of South Park and it was genuinely a lot of fun to play through.Between collecting Chinpokomon, completing all the side quests and levelling up this game will take up close to 20 hours to complete.The game looks exactly like the show.The voice acting is very good, all known voices from the television show are there. The music is also very good. Besides of epic middle-earth music playing in the town, you can listen to songs from the television show in stores.Overall South Park: The Stick of Truth is absolutely epic! It literally feels like the show. If you are a fan of South Park you will love it.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												South Park™: The Stick of Truth™ is one of the few TV series based games out there that totally excels at both storytelling and gameplay. It feels like a 15 hour long (well, a little less for you if you don't do sidequests, level up or just walk around) episode.It has everything you can expect from South Park and more. It parodies almost all RPG games ever created in such an hilarious way, because remember, it IS South Park after all.Having explicit +18 content like it should, the PC version doesn't have any censorship which is great because censoring South Park is missing the point of it. Also, it borders the riddiculous so many times it's amazing how they managed to put this whole story together while keeping its humour fresh.On the technical side, a few bugs and glitches here and there that hopefully will be fixed with later patches. Nothing too serious, only a few character flickers in the cinematics and sometimes the music won't play, but nothing that breaks the game in any way (maybe some of the immersion, but that being said, reloading the last checkpoint usually helped).Now, to the most important part on where you should or not buy the game: IS IT WORTH THE $60 PRICETAG? No. Not at all. I expect playing it only once more right now and maybe replaying it at a later date ocassionally just for the laughs. No multiplayer because remember this is a turn based RPG and we wouldn't have it any other way, but that removes a lot from the replayability value and thus the pricetag should be lower. 30 bucks is about right, 1.50 an hour. Maybe even less, like 15 bucks.But that shouldn't stop me from recommending this anyway. Because this game is awesome. It feels like a game. It IS a game. And also a 15 hour long South Park episode. And both are worth the time and the cash to enjoy.I hope they release some DLC with an expansion on the story or something because it still has room for more content.			"

												This game...where do I begin? Oh yes, its South Park alright, and dear god, it gets even hilarious while you play. As a avid fan of South Park, this game is purely 100% genuine from the show (from the original developers), definitely much better than the other South Park games since the show's debut. The gameplay is from what you're expected from a normal rpg game, although its quite similiar to Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga (as well as Dream Team and Bowser's Inside Story). Although, it has puzzle elements too, which I didn't expect but it was really fun. Otherwise, I would highly reccomend this to fans of RPG and South Park alike. Bravo, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

												Feels like you are playing multiple South Park episodes in a single format.  Customizable player that never talks and the game makes fun of that the entire time.  There is an orignal plot and storyline.  Plently of content for fans.   Summon Mr. Slave, Mr. Hanky, Jesus, and more.  All junk items have meaning from the TV shows (Promise ring, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the Universe award, etc.).   Butters is OP and butters.  You have annoying Jimmy stu.. stutt... stutteri.... you have Jimmy stu... stuuu.. stuttering scenes.  The main boys plus butters and jimmy will party up with you.  Al Gore and other fan favorites make appearences.   This game has been enjoyable from the start.   Def pick it up if you love South Park.			"

												Feels like you are playing multiple South Park episodes in a single format.  Customizable player that never talks and the game makes fun of that the entire time.  There is an orignal plot and storyline.  Plently of content for fans.   Summon Mr. Slave, Mr. Hanky, Jesus, and more.  All junk items have meaning from the TV shows (Promise ring, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the Universe award, etc.).   Butters is OP and butters.  You have annoying Jimmy stu.. stutt... stutteri.... you have Jimmy stu... stuuu.. stuttering scenes.  The main boys plus butters and jimmy will party up with you.  Al Gore and other fan favorites make appearences.   This game has been enjoyable from the start.   Def pick it up if you love South Park.			"

												If you're a South Park fan, then this game is probably for you. It isn't that easy though, as you will also need to be someone that can enjoy the actual gameplay that the game is comprised of. Turn based RPG elements from games like Mario RPG and Costume Quest is what South Park: TSoT offers. If that would drive you insane, then jsut watch a walkthrough of the game on Youtube. The gameplay mixes things up enough to get you through the game, but after a few hours, the repetative actions in battle do get old. Despite this, I got exactly what I wanted from the game. A very lengthy episode of South Park with references galor to every season and what seems like every episode. The look and feel is spot on with the show and most importantly the nothing is sacred humor is spot on. If you're a SP fan, the game is a 5/5If you're an RPG fan expecting something like The Elder Scrolls or The Witcher and you have no interest in SP or its style of comedy, then this will surely be a 1/5For me, this was an easy 5/5			"

												If you are a South Park fan, this is a must have. The Stick of Truth is a long South Park movie starring you. The game has tons of nods to previous episodes from the series, I spent several hours just exploring the town checking things out. The gameplay is similar to Paper Mario. It's a turn based RPG that gives you bonuses for well timed button presses durring attacks and defensive actions. These end up playing a vital role in surviving during your battles. The controls and certain ""puzzles"" can actually be a little confusing at times and some tutorials are obnoxious if you don't put in the correct inputs.  Unfortuneatley the game is very short for an RPG style game. If you do just the main story line you may easily come in under 10 hours. If you do all of the extra content you might be able to squeeze out 20 hours. By the end of the game I was sastified with all the hype that I carried coming into the release of this game having laughed myself silly several times through the course of the game. So in Summation:Buy it now if your a HUGE fan of South Park, you will not be displeased with the story, otherwise pick it up during the upcoming steam sale.			"

												I'm super cereal.There are some badly designed games out there that tack on a popular name (TWD:Survival Instinct, Colonial Marines), but don't hold up to the quality of the show/movie itself. Fortunately, for any South Park fan, this isn't the case with The Stick of Truth. Some jokes can fall flat, but this game holds its own and there were several times when I had to pause the game to let my laughter die down (any scene with Randy).A lot of people are complaining about the short game time, comparing it to games like Skyrim, which boasts 100+ hours of game time. I can attest that if you rush through this game, you will finish it rather quickly. However, many people pay $60 for games from the Call of Duty or Assassin Creed series, and end up with a 5-6 hour campaign. South park's game time easily tops games like this and in no way is claimed to be as extensive as a game like Skyrim, which promotes a world 100x bigger than the little mountain town of South Park.My solution was to take my time with the game. Before I even finished the first story quest, I was already exploring houses, garages, back alleys, and stores. I followed through with side quests and found myself enjoying most of them. Every now and then, I'd lead myself back to the story quests to push myself forward, only to find more side quests I wanted to do (Howdy Hooo). This kept the game fresh, and here I am, 15 hours in and I still haven't beaten the game on normal difficulty. Maybe I'm just not as fast as some of these other people, but just like with sex, it's best to take your time with such quality fun and stop rushing to the end result. ;)This game isn't without its faults, but I paid full price and as a South Park fan, I'm satisfied with my purchase. When I beat the game, I will be going back to play it once more on hardcore mode (apparently Cartman has different dialogue if you play as a Jew), to get any missed items, trophies, etc. And just like with the Arkham series, I'm happy to do so.Pros:- Graphics, characters, and voices match the show accurately.- Fun rpg mechanics similar to that of Paper Mario. Enjoyable. Cool combat elements, summons, buffs/debuffs.- Enough side quests and collectables to let you soak in the South Park atmosphere and extend playtime.- Typical South Park humor in the form of jokes, obscenities, and surprise encounters. (Hint: Walk into people's houses.)- You get achievements for farting on people, what more could you want?Cons:- Weapons and armor are a little unbalanced and the number of them seems unnecessary.- Could be more difficult, no alternate game mode (New Game+, etc).- Not an extensive rpg, like most people think. More of a south park exploration game with rpg elements.- Ingame timer seems glitched. I've played for 15 hours, in game says 8 hours.- Game feels worth $30-40, not $60. I got my money's worth, but other people might not feel the same.Overall score: 7/10.Summary: Play this game and take your time with it. Soak it in and enjoy it for what it is. Comparing it to games like Skyrim will only get you disappointment. This game holds its own merit and is an accurate representation of the South Park universe, filled with laughs and hilarious references. South Park fans with enjoy it.It's worth playing, even if you have to wait for it to go on sale this summer.			"

												Playthrough with a bit of sidequesting took me around 14h - ( got ~40% achievements). 14h filled with mindlowing fun, clever mini-riddles (ie. how to take out enemy without fight), great dialogues, intresting and hilarious story with many completely unexpected plot twists. Combat system is very clever - easy to learn but takes some practice to master. Absolute must-have for any South Park fan and pretty much anyone who like RPG's filled with humor.Also, you can fart with the right mouse button.			"

												i've been a South Park fan for a long time, and was anticipating this game. Rarely have I been disappointed with what these guys have done, but there are some really obvious things that need fixing in this game.  I've only got an hour into the game so far, but these things are seriously detracting from the enjoyment of the game in my view. These flaws in my view are annoying as a gamer, not so much as a South Park fan.  Flaws first, pros later.Flaws -  Battle system: After selecting an enemy to attack, you have to hit the button when the flash goes off. Amount of damages is  based on reaction time. Typically it is a skill based thing with combo attacks or abilities. No so much here. But that might be due to this being tactical turn based in game play. Battle Locations : Climbing a ladder to a billboard walkway gets me an encounter with two enemies. Instead of the battle taking place on the walkway, the battle is moved to the street below. An encounter with an enemy dog on one screen, but the battle takes place to the left of that screen. UI : No ability to adjust sound for UI interface separate from in game sound effects. The booming sound going from game to map/inventory gets annoying fast. Turning it down means turning down all other environmental sound effects.Map location :  Does not accuratley show your position on the map compared to where you are in the game. I can stand left side  of the Cinema and the map shows I am still at Tweak's Coffee House (two buildings to the right).UI Map/Inventory Abilities.  On the first tab, everything is visible, when clicking on other tabs, it overlaps everything else instead of staying within the confines of the screen outlay.  It's also to ... clean, not something you expect with the animation style of South Park. Collection of items : Inability to collect certain items eventhough it looks like you should be able to reach. Example an item under a park bench is not accessible. No popup interaction menu. And after smashing a wall grate I cannot get the item right behind it. Fast Travel : At times I want to fast travel to a location like back to Cartman's house, but I don't want to be IN Cartman's house as there is something close by I want to check out. So each time you fast travel there, you have to go through the whole house again. ProsOverall the game looks and feels like South Park.  Atmosphere is quite full and has lots of nice audio clips from many episodes. Some inside jokes you will get. The voice acting is what you expect and all the characters are there as well. I will continue to play it and provide an update to see if things get better.  You will get some good laughs out of it, but the game might really be for the hardest of the hardcore South Park fans.  If you are not then I'd suggest waiting for the game to go on sale.  It won't be worth 60$ to you.			"

It is pretty much as though you're playing through an episode of the show - specifically the ""Fellowship of the return of the Ring to the King"" episode, which the whole premise seems to be cribbed off.  The combat system is pretty much par for a turn-based RPG, and is deep enough that the fights don't feel too repetitive, and the fights themselves are paced thoughtfully (not just random encounters all the time a la Pokemon).

												If you like South Park, you will love this game. It's probably the best South Park game ever made.That said, it is relatively ""light"" compared to what you'd expect from an Obsidian RPG. Gameplay gets a little repetitive until you recruit more party members, but the game isn't long enough to require grinding and the enemy types stay fresh as you move through the story. Maybe 12-14 hours if you do every single sidequest.Everything about this game is entertaining and funny. But know that it's a South Park game first, RPG second.			"

												This was a short but very well done game.  It really does look, sound, and feel like the TV show.  I can't think of another cartoon to videogame adaptation that stays as true to form.  It would be great if there was more content or a content creator released someday.			"

												What can I say? This is a game that encapsulates all things South Park. If it was in the show, it gets a mention here. Anything from special attacks, weapons, costumes and even the ""junk' items(the stuff you sell for spending cash) count. The graphics are absolutely perfect in that they look EXACTLY like the show does, and it sounds EXACTLY like the show does. I never saw a single graphical error my entire 16 hour run through the game.It plays out akin to your typical ""JRPG"" with you and your ""party"" running around the town of South Park, Colorado completing ""quests"" for the Grand Wizard, King of Kupa Keep. However. like usual things get out of hand very quickly and eventually you end up having to save the world. Really, even without the gameplay this feels like an extended episode of the show with some truly outrageous sections that I won't spoil here. If you are any more than a casual fan of South Park, I urge you to give this game a shot. If you're a fan of the JRPG genre of gaming AND a South Park fan in general, you owe it to yourself to play this. I laughed nearly the entire time playing this, it's just that fun.			"

												Edit:  The more I think about this game being over, the more I miss it.  Perhaps that's why I'm now thinking: really? $60 for a game of this length?  In fact, I daresay that this game's short length is a critical flaw.  But the fact that I still would heartily recommend this game, even at way too high a price, is testament to its quality.Not only probably the best licensed game of all time but one of the best traditional RPGs I've played in a long time as well.  I'm already hopeful for future endeavors and wondering what will come next!A great game that should appeal both to fans of RPGs and fans of South Park; if you happen to be both, you're really in luck.The game does not wear out its welcome; on the other hand, for me, I felt it was over too fast.  It's sort of a sad feeling when it's all over.  But the ending is fantastic, the final boss battle is one of the coolest, and being left wanting more is better than being left sick of it, I suppose.  One characteristic of this game is that there is very little (if any) padding.  Everything that happens is crafted to be fun.  There's nothing to artificially extend it.I would like a sequel.  I also think I'll probably replay this game as a different character class.  There's nothing, other than that, to bring someone back, except for the fact that everything that the game includes is of such high quality, and is so fresh and non-repeated, that you'll probably want to see it all again, even if it isn't a whole lot different, and even if you probably didn't miss very much.Although it says I played the game 24 hours, the in-game clock had me at about 18.  Maybe I spend about 20 total.  I'm not sure where the 24 came from, but that might be correct.  I am a slow, methodical gamer, however (which the game will actually chastize you for--Cartman: ""Wow, the new kid has checked out everything in my backyard.  Hardcore gamer.""  Butters: ""Well, they're probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥our friend, but take your time"").  You might end up spending less time.  I didn't uncover every single thing but just about.			"

												Do you like South Park? Then you need to stop looking at recommendations and get this. This is as far from a quick cash-in as you can get. There is so much love and fan service poured into this game that even if the basic mechanics were crap it would be worth it.Fortunately the game itself is great as well. It's an nicely weird take on turn based RPGs with lots of exploration and even one or two story choices to make.The only thing speaking against it would be if you don't like the show. Then you definitely need to stay away, because this is South Park turned up to 11.			"

The only problem I encountered was some glitches that need to be worked out, but what game doesn't have glitches?  I give two thumbs up to the creators.  I loved how everything in the game stayed true to the television series, even making the player feel like they were in the show.  Being a fan of South Park for a while I found joy in every reference and character they brought from the series.  I couldn't help but laugh and smile through pretty much the entire game.  It's definately a game any South Park fan should own.  I give a rating of 10/10 and highly reccomend anyone who needs a good laugh to go experience and enjoy this game for themselves.			"

												I've intended this review to be mostly spoiler free, a lot of the fun is with how random the game is, so I'd advise not to go rummaging through the achievements and too many reviews so you don't spoil it for yourself.If you like South Park even a little bit you should buy this game. Even if the game was rubbish - which it isn't - it would still contain more jokes and South Park footage than almost an entire series contains. The jokes are often quite entertaining standing alone, but there are plenty of references to the show and other pop culture references (including other game references). I'm a great fan of the show, and the game not only does it justice but takes the show to new heights.The game is highly offensive and is really not afraid to press buttons. In fact, if it's a sensitive topic South Park pushes it even harder. The game has been censored in some regions (but not on Steam!) and in my opinion the censored scenes were not the worst in the game.On the gameplay side the game is not particularly difficult, but not completely challenge-less. It's a turn based RPG and has lots of weapons, weapon modifiers. It also has 'magic'. The combat requires precise timing of specific button presses to get the full weapon strength and to block attacks. I found this a little infuriating at times, especially for the more complicated special moves (some of which are absolutely hilarious).Make sure you go exploring, there is tons of content in the game and some of it is quite amusing. There are very few South Park characters that have not made an appearance.I hit a couple of bugs when playing, in two cases I had to restart from an earlier save. Be careful around the save system too, it doesn't save at the exact point you are at. If you are in doubt, change area to save - although you may find the enemies re-spawn in some cases if you do this.I finished the main storyline and side-quests in around 18 hours. Do I think this is too short for the money? No, the game is just the right length and there is more than enough content to justify the full price tag. Was it worth the wait? Most definitely, I'm glad they took the time to polish it.This game is easily a 9/10 and probably in my top 10 games list of all time. Well done Obsidian, well done South Park Digital Studios!			"

												If you're a fan of South Park, then you'll love this game! Each class is unique, and the abilities for the various classes and buddies are diverse and entertaining, not to mention the magic (farting) skills that all classes learn throughout the game.  It's a little short (my 4 playthroughs - one for each class - took me 55 hours, which is almost 14 hours a playthrough on average), but if you've watched enough of the show to appreciate all the humor and inside jokes, it's pretty much worth getting even at $60...definitely worth getting once it goes on sale!!!

												So far from what I have seen this is a fully functional RPG. Fun and interesting loot, skill trees, upgrade slots for weapons and armor, an action oriented turn base battle system that works really well, hidden treasure and secrets everywhere, fun loot too, just everywhere. The fights are fun and interesting, and the bosses are not a walk in the park. If you are just a South Park fan, and only want to see the content I suggest you lower the difficulty. I personally am enjoying the skill needed to kill some of these amazingly fun fights. FULLY voiced by Matt and Trey, and all the other cast members of south park, no file footage from the show that I have found... Not just a great South Park game, this is fast becoming one of my favorite RPGs of all time.			"

All the references to the actual series, items you find, characters. It really makes it feel like you're in an actual episode.The humor is cruel and wrong, which is the reason why I love it so much!

It is so much like playing your own south park movie.  I find myself listening to the music playing in defferent locations  (everything from montage to chef songs to cartman faith+1 and kyles mom is a b***h) and the things people say.  All that aside the gameplay is fun and easy to learn.   Your classic rpg battles with a bit of timed button presses.  Kinda easy atm really.  Oh did i mention there is a class called Jew? this game has plenty of mature themes in it so know that this is as uncut as the movie.Seriously if you grew up with south park as i did pcik this up!

Like an interactive episode.To start with the cons: The game is a bit repetetive when it comes to the fighting.The positives is that the humor of South Park is totally present. All the characters are just like in a regular episode. Not to speak of the class Jew. Oh man, I laughed so hard. The story in catching and fun. It is almost better the second time around. Still discovering hilarious new stuff. If you like South Park, just buy the game. It is by far the most fun game i played in 2014. "

												Coming back to Steam with a pretty big determination to buy and play this game was a set goal I'm so glad I've done. I love South Park a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton and the references throughout this game got me eager to keep playing it even more.. Nvm the clock saying 3am. ☺ The story is hilarious and the attacks are pure genius. I'd recommend it repeatedly! Overall; just fricking play the game. Screw you guys, I'm going to play it.			"

												*There once was a maiden from Stoneberry Hollow**She didn't talk much but she sure like'd to swallow**I had a lance that she sat upon**The maiden from Stoneberry who was also...your mum*Just had to throw this in there first, because EVERY time I hear this in-game it sends me into hysterics.This review is designed to get the people who are questioning whether to buy it or not...to JUST BUY IT! So if you're ""um""ing and ""ah""ing about it, sorry but I have been sent here to destroy you!Firstly, if you've been a fan of the show since epsiode 1, there is not a chance that you're not going to enjoy this game. From Visitors, to Underpants Gnomes, to ManBearPig...this game has all the best nostalgic references from the show done in a completely new light. You've probably heard that this game is basically an extra season of the show, which is accurate. Except being a game it is uncensored and they were able to take it to new places. What's even better is that it is in RPG format and you create your own character that is assimilated into the game as the new kid (your character never speaks but the other characters make jokes about it). You always have a buddy with you through out the game, you can change your buddy at any time but have to unlock them first & they join you in battle. Once all unlocked you can choose from Butters, Jimmy, Kenny, Stan, Kyle or Cartman (I personally don't think they could have chosen better for the buddies, pretty much my 6 favourite characters, and I won't give away what classes they are because some of them are just hilariously suiting). My final broad description of the game is this: picture a fantasy RPG done from the perspective of the collective imaginations' of the boys (eg, when Cartman cast Ice Storm, he just runs out of screen, then runs back in with a cooler full of icy water and throws it on you!) It's funny stuff, and there are plenty others.It has been said that the combat gets repetitive, but if you are a avid fan of the show & a patient sort of person I don't find this to be the case. There are 4 classes to play as well so surely each of them are different enough to want to explore. The enemies that you face are hilarious in their own right, and side-splitting dialogue is exchanged during battle (eg, Al Gore summons the Secret Service, 4 armed guys in black suits rock up and say ""C'mon, protect the kinda ex-Vice President, kinda...""). All the hilarious familiar faces of South Park make an appearance, and yes you don't even need to ask, Randy is hilarious as always and is involved in a few of the quests that you do. Oh, and in case this is your first window into the game and you HAVEN'T watched any trailers...the game is done in the same animation as the show, so you can't really feel any more like you're engrossed in this quiet little mountain town.I could keep going all day, but perhaps I should just leave it there and say this...If you are a fan of the show, BUY THIS GAME! No chance of regrets. If you aren't a fan of the show, you will still find it funny & enjoy the combat and story etc, but won't understand any of the references from past episodes or dynamics between the characters for that matter. There is a reason this game won so many awards! It is awsome. And with a sequel on the way...I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next			"

												Brilliant and simple game thats hilariously funny.  If you like South Park, then you simply must play it.  But even if you dont, or are new to it all, then its also worth a look.  Its almost perfect.  The only thing it misses (IMO) is a song you participate in.			"

												Really good game, if you enjoy the show you will enjoy the game! Only annoying thing was the button mashing in a part of the game, trying to mash a button fast enough for 5-10 minutes is just boring. Also, I completed a lot of sidequests and got to level 15 quite a bit before the end of the game, but those are the only complaints I have, probably the funniest game I've played			"

												The South Park video game is not only hysterical but legitimately one of the best RPGS to come out in the past 3 years. From start to finish the game had me chuckling to bursting out in laughter at the jokes and references to the show. The combat is tight and well thought out (even though it is a little easy, even on the hardest difficulty). However, I can say I would NOT reccommend this game unless you are both a fan of old school RPGs and South Park,			"

												Very fun game. Looks just like the show and you feel like you are playing an episode or movie. Has all the humor you'd expect froma South Park product and has loads of references. The battles feel very similar to Paper Mario and to an extent the Mario and Luigi RPGs. If you like South Park you'll love this game. If you are indifferent about South Park but love RPGs you'd enjoy this game. 8/10 for sure. I did however run into a game breaking glitch near the begining, where if I fought the enemies beating up Scott Malkinson first the game would fail to load Cartman's line and wouldnt let me do anything after preforming the counter block or whatever its called. I fixed it by fighting the other enemies forst. It could very well have been on my end though. But just in case look out for that.			"

												Excellent South Park material, good menu-combat RPG.  I'll let the good parts go without saying, but here are my gripes: The initial $60 price point still seems excessive, and it's really disappointing to learn that the one collectable (Chinpokomon) that I'm missed is in an area that's impossible to return to.  Compared with the Mario RPGs, the active gameplay mechanics are not very kinesthetic.  You don't get a feeling of direct control over these reactions, but rather you just mash buttons while focused on HUD indicators, QTE-style, while a static animation pauses and plays, or switchs to a failure animation.

												If you like South Park, you will love this game. It's probably the best South Park game ever made.That said, it is relatively ""light"" compared to what you'd expect from an Obsidian RPG. Gameplay gets a little repetitive until you recruit more party members, but the game isn't long enough to require grinding and the enemy types stay fresh as you move through the story. Maybe 12-14 hours if you do every single sidequest.Everything about this game is entertaining and funny. But know that it's a South Park game first, RPG second.			"

I haven't watched South Park since the first and second seasons, but I was able to pick this up and laugh with just how silly everything is. 3D feel in a 2D world. I can't explain it. It's like you're actually in the game itself. Only thing I do wish was that I could make a female character, but beggers can't be choosers. This game leapt over ALL my expectations and surprised me by how in depth it was (in a good way). I recommend this game to EVERYONE.			"

												Everything that is South Park has been condensed into this game. Never has a game made me laugh out loud as much as this one has. This is a great rpg with a rich story and lots of customizable gear & abilities. The best part of this game is feeling like you're really participating in an episode of the series. The worst part of this game unfortunatly is its ease, even on hardcore only a couple boss battles are truly difficult, everything else was a breeze. That said I think it's an issue more for replayability than anything else as I found the pacing of the overall game to be perfect. Any South Park or rpg fan will thoroughly enjoy playing this game.

												A rather short game, but definately worth the time.  It screams South Park at every turn with its profanity, absudity, and general mockery.  Unless you plan on testing out the four classes, it doesn't have much to pull you in after the game ""ends"" (as you can still roam around the town after the credits to finish getting collectibles).It actually manages to be a solid tactical turn-based RPG.  Clothing carries bonuses, not stats, and can be upgraded with removable patches or stickers.  I kept a level 2 pair of gloves through the final boss because of it's natural damage boosting ability.Without revealing spoilers, even though I knew that there would be some craziness with the adults of the town, but even still I couldn't help but laugh.  There are so many references to the show, you almost feel like a citizen yourself.  If you're a fan, then this game is for you.  If you're a fan of RPGs, then even better.  If you like RPGs and hate South Park, then you can imagine beating up the townsfolk.  Either way--GET IT.			"

												This game makes you feel as if your actually in the show itself except for the fact that it's in rpg form. It's an epic game overall. Super creative for every weapon and armor piece is unique in it's own way. They really worked hard to make every item special. Even the items you can only use once, I feel as the developers tried there best to make them cool looking. Also doing side quests really pays off. I spent over 5 hours on side quests, and there not boring, they are all fun to do, seriously! This game is like the best thing ever! You have to buy it now! I know it's a bit expencive but it's worth it! It even works smoothly on crappy computers! If it lags a little, there is like a settings place where u can change the resolution and stuff. I highly doubt you'll need to lower the standards because the default settings run very smooth. This is an RPG everyone can enjoy...except for like younger peeps because this game can take advantage of whatever sense it's a game and not a show. So it has like everything bad you can think of. Alot of rude humor but put that aside and the gameplay is great! YES YOU SHOULD BUY IT! WORTH IT!			"

												This game is great! If you like or love South Park you need to treat yourself to this game. All the elements that make the show great are poured into this game. From the up front humor of the game's story, to finding little things throughout the town that tie into jokes from the tv show, the game is great. I mean, you have a fart button! You play a new kid in town so you get to create your own South Park kid and jump into the fun.Graphics:Nothing fancy, but the point is, it looks exactly like the show, and that really helps you feel like you are contributing to an actual South Park episode. Noticed here and there a few graphic glitches on my outfits that didn't quite work with the hair style I picked, but that was mainly the DLC outfits for pre-ordering. Other than those, it's been fine.Gameplay:Gameplay is pretty solid. Standard turn based RPG. You choose a class, Fighter, Mage, Thief, Jew. Each has special abilities, but really any class can use any item or armor, each will just have different perks. You can use an item on your turn if you choose, then also use an attack ability. Not like early Final Fantasy games where an item uses up your turn, the catch is you can only use one item per character turn to keep it fair.Attacks are fun, certain attacks have certain button combos you will hit to perform, so you're not just clicking attack then watching an animation. So it keeps you engaged in the fight.There are a few button mashing events that are slightly annoying through the game play, I've never been the fastest button masher and for me it's even harder on the keyboard than a controller, so those were kind of annoying, but nothing I could not beat after a few attempts. The game does support controller options so I'm sure that does help for those instances.Story line is pretty great, great humor, and good twists so far. This is definitely a mature game, not for kids and not for people that can't handle dirty humor, nudity, drug use, sexual jokes, violence and tons of swearing. But if you love those things, you'll love this game. It's worth the $60 price tag, and will definitely be worth it when it goes on sale for anything less.			"

												I never laughed so hard and had so much fun playing a game as this.  Crude and vulgar as it may be, it was still a very fun and very entertaining trip through the town of South Park with the gang and all its quirky characters.  Played it twice and am going for it again ... Recommended!!			"

												I am a firm believer in the rule that “All games based on movie or TV licenses suck until proven otherwise.” That rule has served me well and is almost always right. Well, here’s one case it is wrong. This game is great. It is well done, funny, has good mechanics, and most importantly is fun to play.If you are a South Park fan, this is a must buy as it really is very much like “playing an episode.” The art style, voice acting, humour, all are dead on. You’ll enjoy it thoroughly.If you are not a South Park fan, I’d still recommend it if you like RPGs as it is a fairly competent one. The mechanics are good and it is a pleasure to play. The only issue would be if the crass humour offends you. So long as you are ok with that, I think you’ll find it an enjoyable RPG. "

												This is a very enjoyable game that greatly mimics the style used in the cartoon. You'll really feel like you're playing in the South Park universe. If you like South Park, you'll like this game. The battle mechanics are based on pressing the right button at the right time. Requires very fast reaction at times, but in general it's pretty easy. It reminds me of the old Super Mario RPG for the SNES.It doesn't have great replay value, since the most interesting part is watching the story unfold, though there are plenty of missable collectables, so if you're an achievement hoarder like me, expect to spend at least 15 hours playing it.

												If you are a South Park fan (you can take a hint by my avatar) you have to play this game. Because of its art style being similar to the TV series, it feels like a big and funny episode of this great series. What is so good about it is that you will feel like you are in South Park and you will be able to explore the city at its fullest with your friends and fart on everyone.The one thing I don't like about it is that its replay value is not appealing. Sure, you can go with other classes and such, but the first experience will never be achieved again. The end-game content is next to nothing.Parker and Stone did not let me down. You must get it.

												If you don't like South Park, the chances of you liking this game are slim to none.If you do like South Park, but have only seen less than half of all the episodes, I'm sure you'll like the game.If you do like South Park and have seen close to all episodes, I'd recommend the game to you.Since South Park: The Stick of Truth is somewhat of a walk down the memory lane with tons of references, having seen all the episodes do help and will most likely make the game more enjoyable for you. With that said, having seen all the episodes, you've seen pretty much the whole game (with a few exceptions). It didn't ""ruin"" the experience for me, it was fun to take part in it.This game wasn't as short as I thought it would be, but it still wasn't a very long game. I got it on a sale for about 5 bucks, which was more of a reasonable price than 30.9/10 would take my dads balls to the face again			"

												South Park The Stick of TruthAnyone who is a fan of the South Park television series will certainly feel right at home at the game.The game is filled with humor and episode content, and with episode content i ment that everyone you've seen inthe past episodes is somehow put into the game. From items such as Butters' creamy goo or items such as 'toys'You'll find all of your favorite characters back into the game.The general game follows a storyline of which the story feels familiar as a similar story has been playedin the television series.The main game is about you being a new kid which has just moved to the 'quiet' town of South Park.The new kid carries some secret which his parents are trying to keep from himself and the world.As you start playing you'll get sucked into the game and main story pretty much directly.The sidequests are honestly somewhat boring due to them being mostly catch and fetch quests. Yet you will havea good time thus reward for the sidequests.Conclusion,If you are a fan of the series, this game is definitely to you.It's a must have game for anyone who loves or even likes the series.Although i must warn you, i personally find the game more offensive than the series.

												A rather short game, but definately worth the time.  It screams South Park at every turn with its profanity, absudity, and general mockery.  Unless you plan on testing out the four classes, it doesn't have much to pull you in after the game ""ends"" (as you can still roam around the town after the credits to finish getting collectibles).It actually manages to be a solid tactical turn-based RPG.  Clothing carries bonuses, not stats, and can be upgraded with removable patches or stickers.  I kept a level 2 pair of gloves through the final boss because of it's natural damage boosting ability.Without revealing spoilers, even though I knew that there would be some craziness with the adults of the town, but even still I couldn't help but laugh.  There are so many references to the show, you almost feel like a citizen yourself.  If you're a fan, then this game is for you.  If you're a fan of RPGs, then even better.  If you like RPGs and hate South Park, then you can imagine beating up the townsfolk.  Either way--GET IT.			"

												This game makes you feel as if your actually in the show itself except for the fact that it's in rpg form. It's an epic game overall. Super creative for every weapon and armor piece is unique in it's own way. They really worked hard to make every item special. Even the items you can only use once, I feel as the developers tried there best to make them cool looking. Also doing side quests really pays off. I spent over 5 hours on side quests, and there not boring, they are all fun to do, seriously! This game is like the best thing ever! You have to buy it now! I know it's a bit expencive but it's worth it! It even works smoothly on crappy computers! If it lags a little, there is like a settings place where u can change the resolution and stuff. I highly doubt you'll need to lower the standards because the default settings run very smooth. This is an RPG everyone can enjoy...except for like younger peeps because this game can take advantage of whatever sense it's a game and not a show. So it has like everything bad you can think of. Alot of rude humor but put that aside and the gameplay is great! YES YOU SHOULD BUY IT! WORTH IT!			"

												This game is great! If you like or love South Park you need to treat yourself to this game. All the elements that make the show great are poured into this game. From the up front humor of the game's story, to finding little things throughout the town that tie into jokes from the tv show, the game is great. I mean, you have a fart button! You play a new kid in town so you get to create your own South Park kid and jump into the fun.Graphics:Nothing fancy, but the point is, it looks exactly like the show, and that really helps you feel like you are contributing to an actual South Park episode. Noticed here and there a few graphic glitches on my outfits that didn't quite work with the hair style I picked, but that was mainly the DLC outfits for pre-ordering. Other than those, it's been fine.Gameplay:Gameplay is pretty solid. Standard turn based RPG. You choose a class, Fighter, Mage, Thief, Jew. Each has special abilities, but really any class can use any item or armor, each will just have different perks. You can use an item on your turn if you choose, then also use an attack ability. Not like early Final Fantasy games where an item uses up your turn, the catch is you can only use one item per character turn to keep it fair.Attacks are fun, certain attacks have certain button combos you will hit to perform, so you're not just clicking attack then watching an animation. So it keeps you engaged in the fight.There are a few button mashing events that are slightly annoying through the game play, I've never been the fastest button masher and for me it's even harder on the keyboard than a controller, so those were kind of annoying, but nothing I could not beat after a few attempts. The game does support controller options so I'm sure that does help for those instances.Story line is pretty great, great humor, and good twists so far. This is definitely a mature game, not for kids and not for people that can't handle dirty humor, nudity, drug use, sexual jokes, violence and tons of swearing. But if you love those things, you'll love this game. It's worth the $60 price tag, and will definitely be worth it when it goes on sale for anything less.			"

I find myself listening to the music playing in defferent locations  (everything from montage to chef songs to cartman faith+1 and kyles mom is a b***h) and the things people say.  All that aside the gameplay is fun and easy to learn.   Your classic rpg battles with a bit of timed button presses.  Kinda easy atm really.  Oh did i mention there is a class called Jew? this game has plenty of mature themes in it so know that this is as uncut as the movie.Seriously if you grew up with south park as i did pcik this up!

It is the best South Park game, for sure.I might pick a few nits and say the controls feel clunky/slow, or that the story is basically a greatest hits riff so far (which is hard to complain about) but it does feel like you are controlling an episode, and that's a helluva thing. Hella sweet. Hella hella hella.This game will make you fear hobos tho (or fear them more if you're already a hobophobe.) Only fight I've backed down from so far was a hidden hobo camp.I hope they make a sequel with more original elements, but any videogame with Randy Marsh is good by me. Keeeeyaaaa!			"

												Have you ever watched a South Park episode and laughed your pants off? Did you watch the movie and was left wanting more? This game is basically a combination of both scripted by Matt and Trey and acted out by you. It's so simple yet it captures the feel of the episodes perfectly. It is also incredibly offensive, still can't believe they got away without an adult only rating. And that's what makes it beautiful. As far as gameplay goes, it's a turn-based RPG where you pick a class and choose from a series of skills, which have 4 levels each and then duke it out fighting. Since you can't max out your character, and since you'll most likely pick your skills for the fun of it the first time you play, there is quite some replay value. You also have serveral perks to choose from, which you unlock by making friends, which usually involves just talking to npcs.Bottom line, I'd recommend this game to any south park fan or any RPG-with-a-stupid-story fan. I'm both so I assume there must be others out there			"

												First gameplay:Totally supprised by the quality of the game. Not... all games now are so good quality.Most of them lack of something producing dissatisfaction at some point of the game.The game made me think it's the end of story I think 3 times? :)How You can possibly feel upset and happy about it?Well because You are happy that You can continue a nice game.Well... You are upset because You really want to know what kind of ending they prepared.I do see some cons too. For example I never really needed to sell anything as I always had enough money for everything.Cons is that You don't know what to do with junk, pros in this situation is that inventory is unlimited.Overall the game is great and gave me a lot of fun and laugh, to the point that I am now considering to start it all over,BUT I am not ready mentally YET because not many games made me feel this way and since I'm a person who has visual memory, I do remeber games quite good just by ending them once.BUT I will give it another try, and let You know!

												     An absolute must buy for any South Park fans. The game is riddiled with little refrences to the show that will have you laughing when you stumble across them. For example, finding copies of The Poop That Took a Pee in Butter's room, and throughout South Park as lootable ""Junk."" Sometimes even the ""Junk"" you don't want to sell because they all hold hilarious captions.      On top of that the gameplay is very well made. At no point does it feel boring as you are always interacting within the combat, during attacks etc. So far NONE of the quests seem repetitive and they are done in such a way where you WANT to do them. So far, 10/10. Can't recommend this enough if you love South Park. Brillantly hilarious.			"

												Great Game! It felt really good. The story and humor was on par with an episode of South Park.  Lots of just game play that kept it from feeling like a dull video game adaption of TV show.  The combat was fun, and didn't drag, as a turn based RPG can tend to do. A must buy for any fan of the show.			"

												Hands down, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic RPG. It's filled with adult humor, classic RPG elements, and many moments that will keep you laughing. The Underpants Gnome Boss Fight is one of the most classic, if not EPIC boss fights ever created in video game history. It feels a little short, but it's an interactive South Park Mega-Movie. It's well worth a full retail value for all the laughs, and awesomeness.			"

												The most awesome mediocre game I have ever played.The Awesome!It's South Park with no holding back.  This is an episode of South Park where nothing is sacred.  Even the sacred becomes defiled.  If you are a fan of the show you will love the game.  If you're not, I would stay far away from this game.The mediocre...The game itself seems boring.  I played it on Hard from the very beginning and was bored out of my mind with combat.  Combat was just an excuse to give you items to equip.  Completing quests gave you the majority of your experience and leveled you up.  Even the South Park characters complain about having to fight things that can't hurt you.  By the time I got to the end of the game, I was using everything I could to speed through combat.  The real action was outside of combat.  I was left wanting more out of my character.			"

												I find myself in two minds about this game. Let me explain..If you're a South Park fan then you will most likely enjoy the experience and find about 15 hours (assuming you do all the side quests) of typical hilarious comedy, South Park style. However if you are in it for the RPG experience I would avoid it as its somewhat basic and has little replay value.Playing this game is almost like watching a season of South Park but playing as one of the characters. In ways, this sounds better than it is because theres very little you can infuence when it comes to the story. If i remember rightly, theres only one point in the game (about half way through) that allows you to actualy make a decision. Think of this as a simplified, comedy version of Dragon Age.At the start of the game you get to choose a ""class"" as in most RPG's however the class you choose doesn't really effect the story, weapons, or armor selections in anyway and gives you a maximum of 5 different attacks you can make. This adds little to the replay value as the story is far too linear and lets you make very few (only one) important decisions. At the end of the day, I'm going to recommend this game to any South Park fans purely for its comedy appeal (there are some hilarious moments throughout the game). But if you are not a massive South Park fan and are instead, hoping for a decent RPG, I would advise avoiding it as its linear and very short when comparing it to other role playing games. "

												I wasn't sure to recommend this game, I had fun and ejoyed all of it but there are a bunch of things which disappointed me. To be clear, The Stick of Truth really gives you a genuine South Park experience, the story is good, the gameplay features are nicely set to the narrative background and the gags are funny.So, what's the problem? Many who want to buy this game are South Park fans -I am as well-, ok, but beeing a fan doen't prevent me to see some ""big"" flaws: this title rely on the narrative part, and it's a great part, but as a game, and turn based rpg, it doesn't offer much. Here my pros and cons:PROS- Story, great story, worth of a South Park movie,- Graphics, like a real episode, not highest standards of course, but it delivers all you need to ""feel"" the South Parl atmosphere,- Gags, it's a South Park game, gags are foundamental, and they works great,- Gameplay Features, features are very bound to the South Park setting, contributing to create a unique experience.CONS- Game Lenght, there are few hours to play, on a normal difficulty you'll beat the game in about 20 hours,- Playable Characters, compared to others turn based rpg, you'll have 6 companions only to use in your party and just 4 summons,- Level Cap, 15 levels and that's it, character progression will stop and you'll reach it long before game's end (you could unlock some more ""perks"", related to number of ""friends"" you make, but also this possibility is limited), this makes further encounters useless exept for loots,- Character Customization, there are just for basic classes, some cosmetics and equipment you'll find/unlock during the game, but (again) not a great varaiety compared to other good rpgs,- Longevity, unless you're a huge South Park fan and you love keep wandering in it, you want to unlock all achievements or maybe try other classes, you probably won't play it a second time.CONCLUSIONI still recommend this game cause it's funny, well made and it gives some hours of good time. It isn't very difficult, but this is a very subjective aspect, some prefer easy games others difficult ones, so if this is in PROS or CONS depends on you. It should have been longer and deeper, but if you're a South Park fan (or you like gags and comedy) it won't be a problem. Keeping in mind that South Park fans will probably be very amused but turn-based rpgs fans could be disappointed, I think its price is a bit high for what it delivers, so buying it on sale is the best option (I know it always is, my point is that I don't see a game value worth of the full price).Well, whatever you decide, have fun guys!

												Amazingly fun game. It may be a little on the short side for an RPG at around 15+ hours for a playthrough but there is such an amazingly large amount of content packed into those 15+ hours. A surprisingly in depth combat system with incredibly unique abilities that require timed button combinations in order to pull them off perfecty, unique and hilarious items and equipment with tonnes of attachments, and a variety of fun and interesting side content that will have you wanting to 100% clear the game. On top of that it does the source material incredible amounts of justice with more jokes and throwbacks to the history of South Park than you could possibly imagine. A fantastic game and with the Steam Sale price it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												Forget that this is an Obsidian game. If you're looking for a reactive gameworld and deep mecanics, look elsewhere. This is an extended South Park episode with a knockoff Paper Mario framework. It's fun, but easy and shallow, even on the hardest difficulties. Choice and consequence are virtually nil, which is a real shame for a fictional universe as richly developed as South Park. The game also goes by in a hurry; I completed virtually all of the game's sidequests very quickly, then blew through the rest of the campaign in a scant few hours. I enjoyed myself all the while, but I'm very glad I bought it on sale. Recommended at a price of $15 or lower.			"

I came into it with low expectations and was surprised to say the least, the humor was what i expected and they kept it consistent through-out the game with some being good enough to ..... disrupt my concentration mid combat . took me about 9 hours to get a moderate paced playthrough complete but i will play again with the other classes. the rpg elements of the game are entertaining and involving to keep it fresh and exciting. having got this as a new release ... i encountered one crash and 4 glitches ( 1 affected game play  the other 3 cosmetic) as for the price im not bothered by what i paid for it and am more satisfied with it then other mainstream games ive played previously			"

												Pros: recreation of south park feels true to the show and all the voice acting is spot on.The humour is exactly what you'd expect from a south park gameThe animations are great.The skills are nice and varied in selectionCons:It's short, doing almost all the quests except collecting all the chimpokomon took less that 12 hours to complete.The combat gets repetitive really fast. You just find a broken combo and stick with it, even though you may upgrade your stats youll still have the same add ons and patches.The quick time events get really numbing after awhile, you can only stand to hear jimmy do the same poem so many times before it becomes a chore and not funny anymore.Walking around town can be awkward even with the fast travel areas, some places are not well defined on if you can walk there or not.The user interface in my playthrough was terrible and I don't know if it was a bug or not but I couldnt scroll via the arrows presented in the ui to scroll through my items, i had to manually click on one and then hit the down arrow until I found the right items.  Navigating the map is clunky as well with a click and drag style that is awkward when also trying to search for target locations in the world.tl;dr dont get this game unless you are a south park fan, and even then only get it on sale as the gameplay does not match up to the story telling and is not worth full price.

												South Park: The Stick of Truth *Slight Spoilers*This game greatly exceeded my expactations of what a South Park game could be. The Animation and Dialouge are exactly what you would expect from South Park and it feels like your taking part in an actual episode. The main Story-line alone had plenty of crude humour and any south park fan would be able to enjoy as it has many refrences hidden about from older episodes. I'd Definatly Recommend it if you ever enjoyed South Park. -CombatWith its Paper Mario-Esque combat ala time-based button pressing/mashing, it manages to keep things interesting with a wide array of attacks and abilities. From using your farts as Dragonborn Shouts, to Circumsizing your enemies, all the way to summoning a dog to hump your enemies, Theres a very wide array of abilities across the classes and partners. You can even summon in backout from certain characters upon doing quests for them, such as having Mr.Kim come in and do his dragon dance, or having Mr.Slave come and force an enemy into his♥♥♥♥♥♥ they provide a quick escape from a battle incase things go awry.Upon Unlocking Friends you can slowly unlock a wide array of abilities such as doing more and taking less damage from enemies while their burned, to gaining PP from a succesful magic attack. You can also upgrade your Special Abilities to improve them like making your Circum-Sytch apply a 'gross out' effect to surrounding enemies.-Armour and WeaponryI found myself pretty frequently finding new armour and weapons, upon finding a new weapon it might not always be an upgrade as they all have diffrent stats and it may not be benificial to your class/playstyle. You can Augment weapons & armour with stickers, lighters, broken glass, and more.			"

												It's biggest crime is that it's a bit on the short side and the combat is at times a war of attrition, but this game crafted in the South Park universe is a must-play for fans of the show. The story is just as stupid as you would expect and the nods and constant in-jokes are funny, even to outsiders. A really inventive turn-based RPG with crude writing and a child facebook system? Sounds awful, I bet, but it's really pretty great. I am really looking forward to the sequel.			"

Chock-full of nudity, profanity, racism, and other such vulgarities, the game stays true to the show and offers plenty of fan service. Once I started, I was unable to stop, spending the better part of a weekend achievement whoring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.			"

												Surprisingly fun, if a bit simple role-playing game. The story draws you in pretty well, and is as good or better than many of the South Park episode plotlines. Full of easter eggs from the show as well as collectables and oddball achievements. It's a great game to spend a few hours exploring around whether you're a fan of the show or not.			"

												I'm happy to say I can jump on the bandwagon with this one; the game is phenominal! It plays like an interactive episode of the show, with Trey and Matt keeping exactly the same quality as you would find simply watching. Gameplay is very good and definitely fun, the biggest issues being a lack of balance between weapons and armor, and certain armor patches not working (X% weapon damage, thorns damage apparently being applied to your weapon) but they're easily ignored as you have fun exploring the town and hearing Butters or Cartman spout their usual banter.The only people I might not recommend this to are people not familiar with the show, but even then, credit should be given to Oblivion for helping flesh out what was essentially a 2-parter parody episode, and giving it a life of its own. My biggest regret is not picking up the game sooner. If you're somehow still on the fence about this, don't be. Worth every (Canadian) dollar.			"

												Much more than what you would expect from a licensed title. It feels like you're actually playing an 10 hour long South Park episode with surprisingly awesome RPG mechanics. I could not stop playing this game once I got it. I also recently started playing Dragon Age: Inquisition and put that on the shelf as soon I started up The Stick of Truth.Prepare to be offended and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off in the process.			"

												The stick of truth surprised me as to how good it was. First of all, this game plays out just like a ""classic"" JRPG with turned based combat, loot finding, weapons, magic, etc. However, the stick of truth uses funny parodies of how south park kids would refer to the moves as. There are a lot of loot areas that you can find, a lot of side quests, and a lot of hilarious things to discover. The stick of truth really captures the south park feel and it is almost as if you are playing through a couple of episodes of south park. I really enjoyed this game a lot and I tried to explore and find all the secrets, all the loot, etc.Rating: 8.9/10			"

Awesome voice acting and makes you feel indulged in the world of South Park.3. I literally LOL-ed when they brought in the Dragonborn joke.Cons:1. The fart (bug?) previously encountered was kinda a mood killer. (Until you googled how to resolve it)2. The game was really short, about 10-13 hours and could be a little too easy, do increase the difficulty for a better challenge.Definitely a must-get for all South Park fans, thought they could have elaborated more on other characters though, like Mr/Mrs Garrison, Jimmy, etc!

PresentationIt's been a long run for South Park: The Stick of Truth as development initially began in 2009, after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone approached Obsidian about making a role-playing game designed to look exactly like the television series, which in the final product they managed to do flawlessly as The Stick of Truth feels like an entire season of the long running TV show, and a good one too. You assume the role of the new kid in town as you try to make friends and become a part of the fantasy role playing game that everyone in South Park seems to be a part of, either by standing behind Cartman's human race or Kyle's elves, fighting against each other to hold the Stick of Truth. Throughout this 12-16 hours journey you will meet iconic South Park characters, make new friends and gather allies to join your cause, so by the end of the game everyone in South Park will have a role to play in your game. What differentiates this experience from your normal South Park episode is its length and the opportunities that come with that to tell a longer, richer story without having to rely on previous episodes of the show to introduce you to some of the scenery in which the action will take place; of course, fans of the series will instantly recognize locations from the show, as all of the kids' houses as well as community buildings which often appear in the show are all here, but this game finally defines a map of where those buildings are located throughout town, and that gives great opportunities for exploration, even for old fans of the TV show. Among those iconic buildings and locations, The Stick of Truth comes with some new ones as well, and combining those in a map of South Park that feels authentic and logical creates an amazing playground for you and your buddies, giving great opportunities for side-quests, which the games comes no short of. While The Stick of Truth has a lot to offer for long-time fans of the show as the game is filled with references and even the smallest thing will bring back some memories to fans, the game manages to offer an amazing and hilarious experience even for those who haven't caught up with the TV show for the last couple of seasons, as it relies on basic humour, jokes and parodies of hit TV shows such as Breaking Bad or video games like Skyrim to make you laugh on every occasion. Aside from the fart jokes and all the hilarious lines it's pleasing to see how the world looks through a child's imagination, even when as an adult things are way different and Red Bulls are not magic potions, but since this is a South Park experience, even with that moment of revelation, be ready for things to quickly escalate into madness involving aliens, nazi zombies and Taco Bell.Rating: 10GameplayThe Stick of Truth at its core is a turn based RPG, allowing you and one of the multiple buddies which you will unlock along the way to form a party and adventure together, helping you out in combat, as well as keeping you company and occasionally make you laugh with an unexpected joke. Even though it keeps a simplistic look and basic controls to allow everyone to jump into the action, The Stick of Truth's turn based RPG elements leave plenty of room for strategy if you're willing to give the game a try on a harder difficulty level and face a real challenge. As you start your adventure, you can choose between four character classes: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew, and even if each comes with a set of unique skills, they make little difference in battle as there are no class specific items, meaning that a Mage can pickup a sword and use it just as well as a Fighter. Each character can perform two actions each turn,first giving you the option to restore HP or Mana using a potion, remove debuffs or use the character's special skill and then allowing you to perform a secondary action, attacking your enemies by using a skill, magic attack, or normal ranged/melee attack. There are plenty of options to choose from and The Stick of Truth's higher difficulty levels will challenge you to come up with the best strategies in order to succeed, but even with all those elements, The Stick of Truth manages to keep it simple for players who only want a South Park experience without the headache of a turn based RPG, making this title accessible to anyone who wants a taste. The greatest part about the game's combat system is that it's not overused to the point where it becomes boring and repetitive, leaving plenty of room for exploration, item gathering and non-combat sidequests throughout the story, often giving you a break between battles, and allowing you to gather more loot and better equipment to satisfy your needs, sending you on different paths to acquire the things you might need to progress further, and by the time you'll encounter the next series of battles, you'll already have new spells and items to play with, making it interesting once again. Since this game is the first time you get to fully explore the town, there are plenty of locations to visit and characters to find, the game often giving you sidequests to encourage you to explore more and find out what else there is to see and even giving you more tools as the story progresses to access previously unreachable areas such as small cracks in the walls which you can only enter using the Gnome Dust in order to shrink or high rooftops which can be accessed using the Alien Probe. Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe Stick of Truth does not only feel like an episode of the show, but it looks like one as well, keeping the HUD elements to a minimum and only showing up when necessary, making the experience indistinguishable from the TV show outside of combat, and making it just as fun to watch as it is to play. Everything from the characters to the scenery and the iconic locations look authentic and add to the South Park experience you've always wanted to have. The menus are the only thing that could use a bit more work, as they can be disorienting and hard to browse at times, but that is only a minor issue as you will rarely have to use the menu as the game hardly breaks that atmospheric feeling of a South Park episode.Rating: 9AudioThis thing sounds like the real deal, as all the voice actors from the shows are here to voice their respective characters, in beautiful high definition recordings that will make you laugh with each joke a character tells using his iconic accent and voice. Numerous songs already known from the TV show are present in here as well, used in the funniest ways possible and combined with some great sound effects also taken from the show, they help recreate an authentic South Park feel; after all, there is nothing like walking into a store and Cartman's ""Kyle's Mom is a ♥♥♥♥♥"" starts playing on the radio.Rating: 10ExtrasIt can take you up to 15 hours to complete the campaign if you're willing to complete all the side quests and collect everything, unfortunately there is not much replay value after that as the character classes make no difference in combat, and there are no twists that might change the outcome of anything. The campaign is also the only thing the game has to offer, but if you're digging the turn based RPG elements, you might want to give it a second try on a higher difficulty level, unless you did that on the first try.Rating: 7VerdictThe Stick of Truth is like an entire season of South Park, keeping the humor, and its unique setting and adding some RPG mechanics that make it just as interesting to play as it is to watch, but even without giving much attention to its gameplay, the Stick of Truth is definitely a season of South Park worth watchingRating Overall: 8.9Check out the full review and a lot more about South Park: The Stick of Truth at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=334 "

												South Park: The Stick of Truth has been a long time coming, first it got delayed and delayed, then it changed publishers to Ubisoft then it got delayed again while there was some talk that it might never see the light of day.What makes matters worse is that previous games based on the series have been pretty dire, including the awful first person shooter that came out back in 1998. So we were not left with much hope when the new game was first announced.The good news is that it has finally made release, and the even better news is that it is - what I believe to be - the best South Park title that will ever make it to market. RPG developers Obsidian and the show’s creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a superb job mixing in role-playing elements and keeping true to the South Park look and feel. The GameplayThe game can be quite in-depth at times too, with numerous roles to pick from and perks, progression and levelling up you would expect to find in any decent RPG. You choose a class at the beginning of the game, I went with Warrior, but you get a choice from others such as Mage, Thief and Jew.The fighting side of things happen when you either approach or get hit by one of the enemy characters in the game. The fights are JRPG in style with regular attacks and buffs mixed in with special abilities (though South Park based!). Early on in the game you will be trained in various moves by Cartman, one involving you farting on Kenny dressed as a princess, need I say anymore.Attacks made during these battles can also be improved by timed button presses. For example, early on you are joined by Butters and he has options such as Hammer of Justice among others. One attack has you spinning the left thumbstick around and then pressing the Action button on your controller at the right time when prompted. It works well and doesn’t get tiresome, thanks to the excellent voice work, animation and variety of attacks available.It also isn’t an easy game, you can find yourself killed early on by going after enemies who are too high a level for you, and levelling up is a must-do task early on. Perks are improved by making friends in the game, the more friends you have the more perks you will get. Making friends can be done by either chatting to them or completing a task. Certain friends can also be used as a special fighting friend once in a while, such as God who will come down from the sky and mow-down your enemies in a hail of gunfire.Talking of people you meet in the game, those who you do befriend will “friend” you on the South Park social media site, Facebook. This is yet another highly funny section of the game where characters comment on pages, talk about things happening around them and basically mock you. The social page leads on to the map, perks and quest tracking.The game is full of quests which steer you away from the main one, and I found myself just wandering around South Park for at least 6-7 hours before I even bothered taking on the main story; this is a good sign that things have been done right in a licensed game for once.Side-quests themselves can involve you retrieving objects, collecting dodgy looking post for slave and more. The quests are always fun, and due to the writing and voice work they rarely feel like a chore, like they could have done if it was any other RPG.As in any RPG you can sell and buy items. Throughout the game you collect junk from destroying boxes, taking down enemies and from completing quests. This junk can be sold in shops and via various characters that you meet in the game world. Each piece of junk has a description worth reading before you sell it though once again they can be funny, despite not having any use in the game other than gaining currency. You can buy new weapons, armour and buffs for your character but they are restricted based on the level you have gained at the time.Graphics and SoundGraphically I can’t find any fault with the game whatsoever, it looks and plays out just like an episode of South Park, the animation is spot on, the look of the places you visit, the characters you meet and the cutscenes are all perfect. Cutscenes are done in-engine and you can’t tell the difference from what you would see on a TV episode to the game, and that credit goes both to the developers and the creators of the series.We have been playing both the PC and the PS3 version for the past week or so, and the PC version clearly leads the way on visuals as it can run at 1080p with little problem, the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are running at 720p, but we have to note that there was the odd bit of judder and lag in the PS3 title, but hopefully this will be fixed by launch. The game has no graphic options to fiddle with on the PC other than resolution, so just get into the game and enjoy it.Sound is excellent too, voice work is brilliant by the creators and adds to the feeling of being part of South Park. The only issue I had was some repetitive dialogue when clicking on characters, but this was few and far between and just something I had to mention.Final ThoughtsThe writing is excellent as expected, assuming you are a fan of the show of course. You get the kind of juvenile humour you would expect and more. It is one of the few games that I have ever laughed out loud at since the days of a Bevis and Butthead adventure game.Overall it is probably the best licensed game ever, it captures the look, feel, dialogue and story writing of the series while mixing some great but simple RPG elements into the mix. Obsidian have done a great job here and it was well worth the wait, but only for South Park fans. The only downside I could find is that lasting around 20 hours we can only hope that the creators actually want to produce a follow up, something that during their recent interviews they stated that they haven’t really taken a shine to.

												As a big south park fan it was a must have for me to own this game and i need to say it´s just awesome, the battle system is one of the greatest one in all games out there. the only sad thing is that it´s a bit short and after you´ve completed the game you have almost nothing to do except collecting the rest of the achievements. all in all i have to say THIS GAME ROCKS!9/10.

												Absolutely full of classic South Park humour that we've all come to know and love from subtle references to past episodes to straight up in your face crudeness.  Fight alongside all your favourite characters in an epic-battle to save to world.  I absolutely loved every minute of it.That said, there are some downsides:- There isn't much replayability.  The storyline is fairly linear and the choice of class doesn't seem to make much difference, apart from some minor dialog differences.  - The single-player campaign, excluding side quests, is quite short.- You can only play as a male character (although the reasons become evident during the story) which may be a turn off to some.As such, anyone who is not a die-hard South Park fan and just looking for a decent RPG should probably wait for a steam sale.

												Ignore low playtime. Played it in Steam Offline mode because I had no Internet Access.South Park The Stick of Truth is overall fantastic. Go buy it if you have the Chance!I really want to see more of this. This is the first South Park game that is really worth the buy.The story is just like a Episode from the show. YOU HAVE ZERO FRIENDS! You don’t play as one of the four  friends. You are actually the new kid in town and need to earn the respect on the playground. You go out and fight the evil elves, nazi zombies (of course censored here in Germany), aliens and more. You can’t hate on the graphic because it just looks like the TV Show. It happened more than once that I waited for the Cutscene to end.Animations and variety of attacks in battle is really cool for a 2D RPG but the it can get really repetitive if you watch Jimmy singing for the fifth time in a row just to attack.The controls outside of a battle is usually fine but on some rare occasions it can screw with you if you try to walk towards a ladder or something else because of the perspective. Inside a battle the controls work really well. I recommend a gamepad. "

												Heyyo, it's definitely the best South Park game. I loved South Park 64, it was hilarious times playing multiplayer deathmatch... but this game has so many tributes to so many episodes from the show and characters it's just impressive. It's not a hard game once you start progressing but it's just so much damn fun! Exploring everything and the laughs... fantastic! I'm so happy this game exsists!!! :)			"

												This game is an absolute blast. It truly is like watching a really long South Park movie. If you're a casual fan of South Park or even simple RPG elements with poddy humor, this is for you, If you truly love South Park or have watched it since the early days, like myself, you will be pleasantly surprised at every turn as you explore the entire town of South Park. Simple things like looking through each of the four boy's closets. In Stan's closet, a certain someone doesn't want to come out. Down to the 'social media' type thing they have on there where the characters all post along with the continuation of the plot. For instance, I was pepper sprayed outside of Tokken's gated community and Cartman made a post laughing at my expense. Cartman also made a post about how I bought both DLC packs and his mom only let him buy one. It is truly hilarious and stays true to what South Park is at it's core. Cartman changing Tokken from a healer to a blacksmith because 'he just sees blacksmith when looking at Tokken' lol. These little things are what make the whole game for me. Paying $25 for a seemingly wasted nose job at Tom's Rhinoplasty, had a few citizens on the street remark, ""Have you had plastic surgery?"". These parts of the game truly make it feel alive and there are no shortage of side missions. For the first two hours or so I just found myself exploring the town and finding Chinpokemon as well as many many secrets and I know I've barely scratched the surface.			"

I was having so much fun but when I got up to the Alien Abduction bit the cut scense are censored only for Australia! I am am legal age to buy this game and I think it is stupid to take this out. I got curious and checked the acheivments. Some of the Acheivments in the American version have been taken out of the Austalian version. So if your Australian and you love south park, buy the game but don't expect to get 100% acheivement completion. If you really want the propper uncensored version be adventurus and just get it from America.			"

												If you're a South Park fan, then this game is probably for you. It isn't that easy though, as you will also need to be someone that can enjoy the actual gameplay that the game is comprised of. Turn based RPG elements from games like Mario RPG and Costume Quest is what South Park: TSoT offers. If that would drive you insane, then jsut watch a walkthrough of the game on Youtube. The gameplay mixes things up enough to get you through the game, but after a few hours, the repetative actions in battle do get old. Despite this, I got exactly what I wanted from the game. A very lengthy episode of South Park with references galor to every season and what seems like every episode. The look and feel is spot on with the show and most importantly the nothing is sacred humor is spot on. If you're a SP fan, the game is a 5/5If you're an RPG fan expecting something like The Elder Scrolls or The Witcher and you have no interest in SP or its style of comedy, then this will surely be a 1/5For me, this was an easy 5/5			"

												Playthrough with a bit of sidequesting took me around 14h - ( got ~40% achievements). 14h filled with mindlowing fun, clever mini-riddles (ie. how to take out enemy without fight), great dialogues, intresting and hilarious story with many completely unexpected plot twists. Combat system is very clever - easy to learn but takes some practice to master. Absolute must-have for any South Park fan and pretty much anyone who like RPG's filled with humor.Also, you can fart with the right mouse button.			"

While time spent in the game is nowhere close to displayed there still was a decent amount of playtime throughout the story.  Several glitches randomly happen in the game.			"

												Awesome game, loved every minute. Highly recommended if you're into South Park and their type of comedy. Everytime I thought they couldn't top themselves they pushed the envelope even farther. Built like a old school turn based RPG it felt like I was watching an extended uncut movie, I just couldn't stop playing until I beat it! Slightly expensive for a new game but I feel the story-telling, amount of laughs gotten out of it, and immersive experience were worth it.			"

												Give this game 2 hours of your time and you will be hooked. Great turn based RPG with comedy throughout the excellent voice acting. Timed hits, weapon socketing and swappable teammates all make this a really enjoyable game. Story moves fast and no level grinding are a refreshing change from traditional jrpgs.There are 2 or 3 parts I have encountered where a new gameplay element is introduced and it does a poor job explaining, if it even tried at all. Small oversight but it kills the pace of the game and mabey even cause you to never continue.One of the best games on steam and top 3 funniest.			"

												Despite going through developement Hell, South Park the Stick of Truth turned out to be a really enjoyable RPG. In fact, it turned out to be one of the best video game adaptations of a tv show i've ever seen. Ubisoft, Tray Parker, and Matt Stone took their sweet time and made the necessary delays to make sure that the game was something they'd enjoy playing, and it's all the more better for that.The game itself is an RPG with turn based combat where you still have to counter and block moves yourself. I liked the combat and didn't get sick of it throughout the game.As for graphics, the games visuals are incredibly true to the show. It feels exactly like playing in a feature length episode of South Park. As far as story and humor goes, expect the same quality you would of the current season. However, there's plenty of stuff in there for new and old South Park fans alike. South Park: The Stick of Truth does not pull any punches, it seems that they went out of their way to be as controversial as humanly possible. I don't think i've ever seen so many♥♥♥♥♥♥and fart jokes in a single game. I think it's safe to say that if ever you liked South Park, or any of Matt and Tray's humor that there is something in this game that you will defenitely find very amusing since they worked very close with the developers during the creation process. I defenitely got a few good laughs out of it myself, however the fart jokes, which are the biggest focus on the game, got a bit repetitive over time.The biggest gripe I had with this game were the tutorials. When they were porting the game over to PC, this had to be a huge oversight. I dreaded having to do any tutorials, on the PC version you do what they tell you to do, but you can tell that what they were doing was meant for a gamepad or controller. So using a mouse and keyboard proved to be crazy difficult and frustrating. Despite this however, I enjoyed the game and most of the content therein.Final Verdict: (4.2 out of 5)			"

												Very nice game, but only if you have watched a decent amount of South Park (and enjoyed it). This game tries, and succeeds, at being similar to an actual episode. If you find the humor of the show unenjoyable, avoid this game. It's an RPG that is incredibly similar to Paper Mario, due to the presence of quicktime events during combat (right clicking on time to defend, clicking on time to swing, etc.) and the ""buddy"" system, where you obtain multiple friends that have different abilities both inside and out of combat. If you played and enjoyed that game (or its sequel) then you should also consider this game. PROS-Similar to South Park episodes, with loads of references-Relatively long at 10-15 hours (I finished all the quests, but not all the collectables, at about 14 hours myself)-Fun, interesting combat-You can customize your character quite a bit (but you don't have to)CONS-Too easy: while I did die a dozen times or so, I felt like the ""Hardcore"" difficulty should have been more brutal.-Quite a few loading screens (they're short, but it's still not optimal)-The music, while decent, can be repetitive-There are a couple collectables that can only be obtained during small parts of the game. If you want to get 100%, you basically have to use a guide, or be very thorough lest you have to play through the entire game twice-The saving system is poor, and obviously due to the fact that it's a console port - it uses checkpoints and I occasionally found myself using the quick travel system just to get it to trigger a checkpoint.Overall, I would get it if you like South Park and like RPGs. If you don't like one of those two things, either get it on a large sale or don't buy it at all.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the series, and I was looking forward to this game.I enjoyed throwing poo at people, I enjoyed the special moves on each character, I enjoyed the calling of a friend, and I enjoyed the fact the games mechanics were completely designed around a childish nature. It's like I was actually one of the gang in a world created by Cartman (and the creators of South park) using items around me in the game that is the Stick of Truth.There is of course many things about this game which are not for children. Of course it's south park but if you're considering giving this to a child under 18 then think again. I'm 28 now, but I wouldn't trust this one with anybody under 16. It includes some sex, bodily fluids, anal probing, an entire section dedicated to the void that is Mr. Slave's♥♥♥♥♥♥.. It really is worth your time to play this fun and creative game which acts as an episode or movie of South Park - and people not familiar would mistake much of this game (outside of combat) for being an episode or movie of South Park as the sound and animation was professionally produced by the studio that makes the TV show. Its authenticy is uncanny!There are many goods about this game and teh developers did a great job with this game but the end result is quite messy as a package and as a developer myself I find the packaging of this game unprofessional as it's not even modular - it seems it's just mashed together like a very chunky mashed potato.I am diappointed to see that Ubisoft published this title, but it's more complete than other Ubisoft titles at launch. This game will run on any entry level system, but sadly the developers have made the game quite bad to mod or uncensor. I'm an adult and I paid full price - I expect all content for this game and the only uncensor available for me is a game-breaker. I actually had to download a non-steam copy to advance in certain places, while switching to the steam copy to make sure achievements earned aren't missed. Not that this is a problem, but as a developer, I would produce a game to be easily available for all to enjoy the extra content if they know how instead of purposly getting in the way of people that want to enjoy the extra content.It's worth it, but be warned of how the game was produced in the end...

												Seriously a good game! A bit of a steep price(£39.99) for the game but luckily I got it for 33% off ^_^Some lines from main characters are repeated alot which can be annoying but easily ignored through all the hilarity you'd go through playing this game!			"

												Fantastic game. The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.But the game isn't without its flaws. I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.The game feels heavily ""consolized."" Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense. Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs. Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell. However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC. I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller. Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game. But not in combat. In combat the controls felt great. More on that later, though.On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts. This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all! The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back. I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere. The loading screens are a real slowdown.So let's see. The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention. So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right. As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight. This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat. Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability. To use it, you select it and then choose a target. The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button. Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy! If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much. Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this. When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time. Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks! Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair. The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls. Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes. Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by. Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them. Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them. But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress. As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in. The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can. It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.The writing in the game is spot on. You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character. I found the story largely fun and interesting.I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game. This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style. You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks. As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories. You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show. There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park. It's a funny game.There is also a difficulty slider bar. Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding. The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight. I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately. Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan. I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews. :) "

												South Park is finally a game, any other do not count! In its core a stratigic role-playing game, on the surface 100% South Park, with all the dark humor that comes with it.The story is presented all in show-style, well written and keeps what makes South Park great. If the show is not your cup of tea, then this game won't change that.The combat is easy to learn, offers some diversity through 4 classes and tons of equipment. The game is overall not to challenging, but the reaction tests in combat keep you busy,The graphic is also show-style, so no blockbuster but all 2D with well-wonky animated charme.With my 20 hours gameplay to completion I consider this a well spend gametime. Some archievents might keep you interested in more playthroughs.Like a good TV series, would only want more of it.Thats my 9/10 $			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a prime example of how games that are based around a non-game IP should be done as it accurately captures the essence of the show whilst remaining a solid experience in its own right. The RPG gameplay is fantastic, taking the tried and true styles that were made famous by the Final Fantasy series and reworking them into the South Park world. The story is witty, funny and satisfying, a true testament to the writing talents of the South Park studios. Honestly I went into this game with the lowest of expectations only to have them completely blown away, something that rarely happens these days. For anyone who’s a fan of this show and feels like an 11 hour, self directed episode would be up their alley then South Park; The Stick of Truth is for you.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/04/25/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-save-us-sir-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ "

												Edit:  The more I think about this game being over, the more I miss it.  Perhaps that's why I'm now thinking: really? $60 for a game of this length?  In fact, I daresay that this game's short length is a critical flaw.  But the fact that I still would heartily recommend this game, even at way too high a price, is testament to its quality.Not only probably the best licensed game of all time but one of the best traditional RPGs I've played in a long time as well.  I'm already hopeful for future endeavors and wondering what will come next!A great game that should appeal both to fans of RPGs and fans of South Park; if you happen to be both, you're really in luck.The game does not wear out its welcome; on the other hand, for me, I felt it was over too fast.  It's sort of a sad feeling when it's all over.  But the ending is fantastic, the final boss battle is one of the coolest, and being left wanting more is better than being left sick of it, I suppose.  One characteristic of this game is that there is very little (if any) padding.  Everything that happens is crafted to be fun.  There's nothing to artificially extend it.I would like a sequel.  I also think I'll probably replay this game as a different character class.  There's nothing, other than that, to bring someone back, except for the fact that everything that the game includes is of such high quality, and is so fresh and non-repeated, that you'll probably want to see it all again, even if it isn't a whole lot different, and even if you probably didn't miss very much.Although it says I played the game 24 hours, the in-game clock had me at about 18.  Maybe I spend about 20 total.  I'm not sure where the 24 came from, but that might be correct.  I am a slow, methodical gamer, however (which the game will actually chastize you for--Cartman: ""Wow, the new kid has checked out everything in my backyard.  Hardcore gamer.""  Butters: ""Well, they're probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥our friend, but take your time"").  You might end up spending less time.  I didn't uncover every single thing but just about.			"

												Do you like South Park? Then you need to stop looking at recommendations and get this. This is as far from a quick cash-in as you can get. There is so much love and fan service poured into this game that even if the basic mechanics were crap it would be worth it.Fortunately the game itself is great as well. It's an nicely weird take on turn based RPGs with lots of exploration and even one or two story choices to make.The only thing speaking against it would be if you don't like the show. Then you definitely need to stay away, because this is South Park turned up to 11.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The battle mechanics are standard RPG affair, but its just deep enough to be engaging. The graphics are perfect, and while I did see some of the screen tearing other reviews noted, it did not detract from the experience. The story is as many others have said, a 14 hour long episode. As a long time fan of the show, it was nice to see several references - the game also went a few places I was not expecting (Mr. Slave for instance). A true accomplishment is an explorable ""South Park"" itself; it makes a difference when you can explore the town as a whole rather than just piecing together components from what  the TV show provides episode to episode. Overall, the story was just long enough to be worth the playthrough without dragging. For instance, while there are several moments where you are on fetch quests, the developers put a  ""South Parkesque"" spin put on each one, so I did not find them annoying in the least. It truly is an example of a whole being better than a sum of its parts. I am guessing replay will be low for me, but considering I bought it during a sale, worth every penny paid.			"

												Fans of the show will like it, basically. It's very funny all the way through will multiple references from the series. The simple 2-D animation style makes you feel like you are in an episode and does of a good job of telling the story whilst making you feel a part of it. Entertaining combat system but it starts to get stale towards the end, but this is helped by new weapons and an interactive enviroment which allows you to defeat enemies without having to fight them. It has a decently sized campaign and some sidequests which can be continued after completion, although they are mainly fetch quets and ""find all of the"" quests, leaving little reason to complete them them after you've finished the story. There is some replayability as there are 4 differenent classes with different special attacks and play styles, but I always found myself just doing the same thing which was useing the most powerful weapon I had and putting fire on it. There is a clear cap on how good you can get as there is a max level of 15 and 2 obvious best weapons which can be found towards the end of the game in Jimbo's guns, so there really insn't much to do after completion apart from starting the game again as a different character and trying to get all of the collectables. Overall it is worth a play-through or two, but fighting the same battles begins to make you lose interest; some DLC is would be good with more weapons and missions.			"

												I'm happy to say I can jump on the bandwagon with this one; the game is phenominal! It plays like an interactive episode of the show, with Trey and Matt keeping exactly the same quality as you would find simply watching. Gameplay is very good and definitely fun, the biggest issues being a lack of balance between weapons and armor, and certain armor patches not working (X% weapon damage, thorns damage apparently being applied to your weapon) but they're easily ignored as you have fun exploring the town and hearing Butters or Cartman spout their usual banter.The only people I might not recommend this to are people not familiar with the show, but even then, credit should be given to Oblivion for helping flesh out what was essentially a 2-parter parody episode, and giving it a life of its own. My biggest regret is not picking up the game sooner. If you're somehow still on the fence about this, don't be. Worth every (Canadian) dollar.			"

												Just finished thoroughly playing through this game. It is absolutely brilliant. A lot of reviews remarked on how short it was - I disagree. It really isn't that short at all. If you like, or have ever liked South Park, this game is for you. If you don't like the humor even slightly - I wouldn't get it.I normally don't giggle at games, but I found myself laughing rather often through the game. It is far more funny than even the best episodes offer. Nearly every character or sets of characters from the entire series is either referenced or shows up at some point. Nearly every area of south park is used at some point, and some of the plot twists or surprises actually left me delighted.Normally a game will fail to keep me interested or engaged throughout itself, but this game is extremely dynamic. It changes ALL the time. Goals change, areas change, scenery, enemy types, gameplay changes - it is WONDERFUL. There is SO much packed into this game, it certainly shows me why it had such a high initial price tag. I got it on sale for a little over $10 and it is worth far far more than that. A great game, one that I cannot praise enough.Buy it, you seriously won't regret it. It's very fun, and only gets more and more fun and engaging as the game goes on. There's a TON of content, and characters to play with. 10/10			"

												well .... if you love south park this game will sit well with you and quench some of your thirst. I came into it with low expectations and was surprised to say the least, the humor was what i expected and they kept it consistent through-out the game with some being good enough to ..... disrupt my concentration mid combat . took me about 9 hours to get a moderate paced playthrough complete but i will play again with the other classes. the rpg elements of the game are entertaining and involving to keep it fresh and exciting. having got this as a new release ... i encountered one crash and 4 glitches ( 1 affected game play  the other 3 cosmetic) as for the price im not bothered by what i paid for it and am more satisfied with it then other mainstream games ive played previously			"

												South Park: Stick of Truth is an extremely fun game. You play a character in the show South Park, and it incorporates topics, props, and characters from the many years of South Park episodes (unfortunately nothing relating to Muhammad). Once you beat the game, however, you'll feel like Stan at the end of the episode ""Guitar Queer-O"" because there's nothing left to do. You can play a few times more to get more Achievements, but you'll still feel sad that the game ended so quickly. I hope Trey & Matt will release a Stick of Truth II or release additional DLC.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth *Slight Spoilers*This game greatly exceeded my expactations of what a South Park game could be. The Animation and Dialouge are exactly what you would expect from South Park and it feels like your taking part in an actual episode. The main Story-line alone had plenty of crude humour and any south park fan would be able to enjoy as it has many refrences hidden about from older episodes. I'd Definatly Recommend it if you ever enjoyed South Park. -CombatWith its Paper Mario-Esque combat ala time-based button pressing/mashing, it manages to keep things interesting with a wide array of attacks and abilities. From using your farts as Dragonborn Shouts, to Circumsizing your enemies, all the way to summoning a dog to hump your enemies, Theres a very wide array of abilities across the classes and partners. You can even summon in backout from certain characters upon doing quests for them, such as having Mr.Kim come in and do his dragon dance, or having Mr.Slave come and force an enemy into his♥♥♥♥♥♥ they provide a quick escape from a battle incase things go awry.Upon Unlocking Friends you can slowly unlock a wide array of abilities such as doing more and taking less damage from enemies while their burned, to gaining PP from a succesful magic attack. You can also upgrade your Special Abilities to improve them like making your Circum-Sytch apply a 'gross out' effect to surrounding enemies.-Armour and WeaponryI found myself pretty frequently finding new armour and weapons, upon finding a new weapon it might not always be an upgrade as they all have diffrent stats and it may not be benificial to your class/playstyle. You can Augment weapons & armour with stickers, lighters, broken glass, and more.			"

												Pros: recreation of south park feels true to the show and all the voice acting is spot on.The humour is exactly what you'd expect from a south park gameThe animations are great.The skills are nice and varied in selectionCons:It's short, doing almost all the quests except collecting all the chimpokomon took less that 12 hours to complete.The combat gets repetitive really fast. You just find a broken combo and stick with it, even though you may upgrade your stats youll still have the same add ons and patches.The quick time events get really numbing after awhile, you can only stand to hear jimmy do the same poem so many times before it becomes a chore and not funny anymore.Walking around town can be awkward even with the fast travel areas, some places are not well defined on if you can walk there or not.The user interface in my playthrough was terrible and I don't know if it was a bug or not but I couldnt scroll via the arrows presented in the ui to scroll through my items, i had to manually click on one and then hit the down arrow until I found the right items.  Navigating the map is clunky as well with a click and drag style that is awkward when also trying to search for target locations in the world.tl;dr dont get this game unless you are a south park fan, and even then only get it on sale as the gameplay does not match up to the story telling and is not worth full price.

												Forget that this is an Obsidian game. If you're looking for a reactive gameworld and deep mecanics, look elsewhere. This is an extended South Park episode with a knockoff Paper Mario framework. It's fun, but easy and shallow, even on the hardest difficulties. Choice and consequence are virtually nil, which is a real shame for a fictional universe as richly developed as South Park. The game also goes by in a hurry; I completed virtually all of the game's sidequests very quickly, then blew through the rest of the campaign in a scant few hours. I enjoyed myself all the while, but I'm very glad I bought it on sale. Recommended at a price of $15 or lower.			"

												So it’s like this....Never have I laugh more in a video game in my life and had moments of disgust, joy and confusion all rapped into one scene This RPG styled game has you playing as the new kid on the block picking from your sort of ""standard"" classes were you engage in turn based combat to determine the winner. Your menu is made to look like a mix of Facebook and Twitter were you can change your equipment, appearance and upgrade your skills, O and be spammed to death every minute if you talk to a particular character. The story is well fleshed out with each of the main faces of South Park acting in their normal fashion just as if you were watching an episode. The only down sides for me is that the game is not a bad length but I wish it was just a bit longer as I just had so much fun I didn’t want this amazing adventure to end. When the credits rolled in the classic outro of the south park series  I was left sitting  wondering how the writers after all these years still have the creativity to put me in tears of laughter, make me questions the world around and have me in complete disgust.They should be commend for the tremendous effort that was put into this game, as someone that mentally prepared himself by watching all 17 season that led up to the release, I can gladly say that that they had references dating all the way back to season 1.The only person that was sadly missed in my opinion but had a little love in a loading screen was towlieSouth Park the Stick of Truth is a one of a kind game that deserves huge praise as it was truly amazing "

												I'm a fan of Obsidian, and a slightly-above-casual fan of South Park, and this is essentially an episode -- actually multiple episodes -- that you control. For some people, that would be enough. For me, I felt this was Obsidian's weakest game and filled with more bugs than expected in one of their non-open-world efforts.The game is a linear adventure -- definitely not an RPG -- and the fights are a weird mix of QTEs and turn-based battles. The game outside of combat is fetch quests and collect-them-all activities.On the other hand, the narrative itself is very entertaining, the voice acting is superb (although there is a problem with the audio sync), and... well, it's South Park, so hilariously offensive. Tremendous amount of fan service here.So is it a great game? No, not quite. Is it worth playing? If you're a South Park fan, absolutely. Just don't be mislead by the developer's pedigree and the description into thinking this is anything but a 20-hour linear adventure.			"

												I was not prepared for so much awesomeness.THIS is how you adapt a media property into a video game. The plot is befitting of a South Park movie.The look, feel, and mechanics of the game are identical to what you see on television series... This is how such a story would play out on television, no question.It plays upon the tropes of RPGs, something the creators of South Park a very skilled at satirizing on the show. There were several times I just dropped my game controller and sat there laughing for several minutes.Because of the visual style South Park has always had, it can be tricky at times to spot certain things on screen. This is not a game where you can pan around for a view of the landscape... you're IN South Park, moving around in pretty much a 2-D world like on the show. That said, the characters move and act EXACTLY as they should in such a context. So, the limitations of such perspective work perfectly.Had this tried to be a FPS or some other 3-D setting, the game would have likely suffered for it. By keeping the same style you know, they made something darn near perfect for what it set out to be.			"

												First off, this game is perfect. It can't be made better. 2nd, there's no Towelie in it, so its only sub-perfect. Its short (I had a pretty thorough run at 14 hours), pricey, and had some bugs which I didn't seem to run into in the steam version, so I guess that's fine. In spite of that, this is exactly what I want out of a South Park game, and probably the best game ever made based on a tv show.On the DLC though: I'd skip it. Its some good low level gear, but you'll grow out of it pretty quickly.			"

												As a fan of the showing (seen every episode) i can easily say this game stays true to the series. From the get go the humour is non stop and just the  things you can interact with are comcial to say the least. In the first 5 minutes of the game i took a dump in my toilet, Cartman's toilet and left his shower running. I found chin balls (nostalgia trip) and put them on my face. The sheer content of this game is amazing. The combat was great as well. I'm normally not a fan of turn-based combat, but this was well thought and developed like all games should. Overall this game has set a standard for rpgs and i would love to see more south park games. Definitely worth for the price, but if you're in Australia like me, then you'll miss out on 7 banned scenes/activites. 10/10 loved it.			"

												Really good game, if you enjoy the show you will enjoy the game! Only annoying thing was the button mashing in a part of the game, trying to mash a button fast enough for 5-10 minutes is just boring. Also, I completed a lot of sidequests and got to level 15 quite a bit before the end of the game, but those are the only complaints I have, probably the funniest game I've played			"

												Excellent South Park material, good menu-combat RPG.  I'll let the good parts go without saying, but here are my gripes: The initial $60 price point still seems excessive, and it's really disappointing to learn that the one collectable (Chinpokomon) that I'm missed is in an area that's impossible to return to.  Compared with the Mario RPGs, the active gameplay mechanics are not very kinesthetic.  You don't get a feeling of direct control over these reactions, but rather you just mash buttons while focused on HUD indicators, QTE-style, while a static animation pauses and plays, or switchs to a failure animation.

												For a JRPG game that is around $55, i'd expected better. It seems your enemies stats gets adjusted whenever you level up, which makes this game easy even on hardcore mode, and you can easily finish the game without effort. But the combat system was fun! The jokes are funny, but when it comes to games it's a different story. Anyway i really enjoy this game and i really do hope there will be a sequal that has more difficulty! 9/10 :D			"

												If you're a fan of South Park the show, then chances are you'll be a fan of the game.  I was wary at first because I loathe turn-based RPG games, but in true South Park fashion the game parodies the mechanics to make it fun to play and challenging (at least to non-TBRPG players).    You play the new kid in town who finds himself caught in a power struggle over The Stick of Truth between the Cartman-led humans and the Kyle-led Elves.  Naturally, there's more to the Stick of Truth than either of these two sides realize, and soon you find yourself the only one who can save the town of South Park from an unforseen darkness!  The whole town is there for the player to explore and fart on when not doing the story missions.  The developers took the time to include as many main and side characters in the show's lore as the game could hold I think, and really helps with the feeling that you are IN South Park.  The only drawbacks are the story campaign is almost too short, sometimes the keyboard controls are not instantly intuitive, and mission objectives can be VERY vague leaving one to wonder, ""what the hell am I suppossed to do??""Pros:  Excellent production design: Visuals, sound effects all straight fromt he show itself.  Voice acting is top-notch to go along with the great writing.  Main and side quests vary and are fun to play through.  Lots of options for different types of play: Warrior, Mage, Jew, etc.  Cons: A bit on the short side, limited replayability unless you want to explore all the different character classes, keyboard controls for certain powers can be confusing, vague mission objectives at times.  Again, fans of the show should enjoy it since it's about as close to playing an episode of South Park as one can get.			"

												The only bad thing I can say is that this game is short. I ""beat"" the game after about 15 hours. While I skipped most of the side quests (ok i feel silly saying side quests in a game that features a giant nazi aborted fetus as a boss) I still had a ton of fun with this. The whole game feels like a south park episode, so if you're a fan you will love this. RPG fans will love the jokes and spoofs about RPGs, so stop being elitist as ♥♥♥♥ and have fun ok. "

I would however wait for a promo, since it would be really expensive if it werent south park....I recommend it in a promo if you are just a fan of the genre and curious about it. To South Park fans however... i definetly recommend it, if you havent already bought it that is...PS 1 of the playable classes is... Jew.... lol op  "

												I'm going to start of this review by saying that I, sad as it is, have seen each and every South Park episode. I was bound to end up with this game at some point, if only to complete my collection of South Park knowledge.This said, before I talk about the story and characters, I'll talk about the game mechanics. Stick of Truth is a turn based RPG style game, incorporating the use of button sequences within fights. This is my first problem with the game, though it's really rather minor: the button mashing within some boss fights is ridiculous. My finger hurt for hours after I tried to beat one character about two thirds through the game. I didn't even successfully block those attacks, and I had to do it about 5 times before I beat him. RIP, my hands. Other than that, the fights are wonderful, and everything has such a South Park feel to it (especially the victory messages from your buddy at the end of fights.)Navigation-wise, it's really rather nice. I spent a little while trying to figure out how all the areas were connected, but after you realise how blaringly obvious some paths are they're easy to get through. Honestly, the best part of this game is the story. There's so many little references to the show that you'll end up finding that will really appeal to a South Park fan, so if you enjoy the show you really have to pick Stick of Truth up. Outside of that, the game is so nice that you'll probably enjoy it anyway. The story is just what you'd expect from a South Park episode, though said episode lasts about 18 hours. The sidequests aren't grueling, either, and once again reference little parts of the show. The characters are so perfectly IN character that it makes me want to cry.My second, and possibly final problem with this game is that some of your buddies seem terribly balanced with eachother in terms of strength. Maybe it's just my playing style, maybe it's just my main character class, but Stan and Kenny seem to do such useless attacks compared to Butters and Kyle. Butters is strong. Really strong. If you can manage button combos then Kyle is definitely a good choice. I haven't tried out Cartman as a buddy yet, but I hope he'll live up to the standards of Kyle and Butters.TL;DR buy this if it's on sale, but if you're willing to splash out a bit buy it now. good game, good story, very minor problems. 11/10 would be banished from all space and time again "

												South Park: The Stick of Truth has been a long time coming, first it got delayed and delayed, then it changed publishers to Ubisoft then it got delayed again while there was some talk that it might never see the light of day.What makes matters worse is that previous games based on the series have been pretty dire, including the awful first person shooter that came out back in 1998. So we were not left with much hope when the new game was first announced.The good news is that it has finally made release, and the even better news is that it is - what I believe to be - the best South Park title that will ever make it to market. RPG developers Obsidian and the show’s creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a superb job mixing in role-playing elements and keeping true to the South Park look and feel. The GameplayThe game can be quite in-depth at times too, with numerous roles to pick from and perks, progression and levelling up you would expect to find in any decent RPG. You choose a class at the beginning of the game, I went with Warrior, but you get a choice from others such as Mage, Thief and Jew.The fighting side of things happen when you either approach or get hit by one of the enemy characters in the game. The fights are JRPG in style with regular attacks and buffs mixed in with special abilities (though South Park based!). Early on in the game you will be trained in various moves by Cartman, one involving you farting on Kenny dressed as a princess, need I say anymore.Attacks made during these battles can also be improved by timed button presses. For example, early on you are joined by Butters and he has options such as Hammer of Justice among others. One attack has you spinning the left thumbstick around and then pressing the Action button on your controller at the right time when prompted. It works well and doesn’t get tiresome, thanks to the excellent voice work, animation and variety of attacks available.It also isn’t an easy game, you can find yourself killed early on by going after enemies who are too high a level for you, and levelling up is a must-do task early on. Perks are improved by making friends in the game, the more friends you have the more perks you will get. Making friends can be done by either chatting to them or completing a task. Certain friends can also be used as a special fighting friend once in a while, such as God who will come down from the sky and mow-down your enemies in a hail of gunfire.Talking of people you meet in the game, those who you do befriend will “friend” you on the South Park social media site, Facebook. This is yet another highly funny section of the game where characters comment on pages, talk about things happening around them and basically mock you. The social page leads on to the map, perks and quest tracking.The game is full of quests which steer you away from the main one, and I found myself just wandering around South Park for at least 6-7 hours before I even bothered taking on the main story; this is a good sign that things have been done right in a licensed game for once.Side-quests themselves can involve you retrieving objects, collecting dodgy looking post for slave and more. The quests are always fun, and due to the writing and voice work they rarely feel like a chore, like they could have done if it was any other RPG.As in any RPG you can sell and buy items. Throughout the game you collect junk from destroying boxes, taking down enemies and from completing quests. This junk can be sold in shops and via various characters that you meet in the game world. Each piece of junk has a description worth reading before you sell it though once again they can be funny, despite not having any use in the game other than gaining currency. You can buy new weapons, armour and buffs for your character but they are restricted based on the level you have gained at the time.Graphics and SoundGraphically I can’t find any fault with the game whatsoever, it looks and plays out just like an episode of South Park, the animation is spot on, the look of the places you visit, the characters you meet and the cutscenes are all perfect. Cutscenes are done in-engine and you can’t tell the difference from what you would see on a TV episode to the game, and that credit goes both to the developers and the creators of the series.We have been playing both the PC and the PS3 version for the past week or so, and the PC version clearly leads the way on visuals as it can run at 1080p with little problem, the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are running at 720p, but we have to note that there was the odd bit of judder and lag in the PS3 title, but hopefully this will be fixed by launch. The game has no graphic options to fiddle with on the PC other than resolution, so just get into the game and enjoy it.Sound is excellent too, voice work is brilliant by the creators and adds to the feeling of being part of South Park. The only issue I had was some repetitive dialogue when clicking on characters, but this was few and far between and just something I had to mention.Final ThoughtsThe writing is excellent as expected, assuming you are a fan of the show of course. You get the kind of juvenile humour you would expect and more. It is one of the few games that I have ever laughed out loud at since the days of a Bevis and Butthead adventure game.Overall it is probably the best licensed game ever, it captures the look, feel, dialogue and story writing of the series while mixing some great but simple RPG elements into the mix. Obsidian have done a great job here and it was well worth the wait, but only for South Park fans. The only downside I could find is that lasting around 20 hours we can only hope that the creators actually want to produce a follow up, something that during their recent interviews they stated that they haven’t really taken a shine to.

												Hands down one thee funniest, and most obscene game's I ever played. If you are a fan of south park you will love this game ( if not you might think what a silly game ). its just like playing an episode of south park. While the game is very good and entertaining I have a few complaints, #1 problem There is no real replay value to it. sure you can backtrack through the game but that seems more like a chore then fun and not very rewarding (except if you liek achievements but who cares about those). The fights are way to easy even on hardcore difficulty, if you are a gamer play this on hardcore dificulity, not like it matters you will mow through everything anyways. And the whole backtracking through previous explored areas to use ability's you newly acquire is lazy and doesnt feel worth it imo, the game is WAY TO SHORT. and the fights are WAY TO EASY, to few quest and the game is very small not worth the $40 tag on it now. those are the few complaints i have But this is still a great game. Got it on sale ($13) and glad i did cause i don't think i would have been to happy paying full price for this id value this game at max $30. MUST PLAY!!!!!  7/10			"

Posted: March 21, 2015
												If you think the review is way too long, go to the conclusion !I advise anyone reading this to keep in mind that I am a big fan of South Park.There's a lot of people that love this show, but when I say fan, I say that I must have watched every episodes past season 16 at least 3-4 times in french, and re-watch everything included the latest episodes in their ""almighty original english version"" at least once (still, the french version is for me the best french dubbing in the world).So, when a South Park game comes out, made by Obsidian... Of course it's gonna be at least very good.But damn, I never laugh and smiled that hard playing a game, since a long time ago !The concept is: you are a new kid in the city of South Park, after you create your character you meet Cartman, Butters and other kids that are playing this ""role play fantasy game"" really heavily. It's basically the sequel to the Game of Thrones trilogy episodes, which are in the same spirit as the LotR episode.This setup makes you do quest, meet well known and loved South Park characters, and go through crazy thing. All of that in 3 consecutive days. The game ""ends"" after that, but you can still do stuff in the city, search for items, do secondary quests and all that.It looks exactly like the show, it couldn't really be better graphically when you think about it. The city is quite big, there is stuff to do, see, hear and take in almost every building so don't hesitate exploring everything before passing to another game.The mechanics are totally RPG based, it's simplified compared to some classical RPG titles but still, there is classes, stats, perks, levels... Combats are turn based and pretty interesting. Basically it's you and a companion of your choice VS 1 up to 6 opponents. Each turn you choose between attacking with your main weapon, attacking with your range weapon (bows, objects you can throw etc...), using magic (consumes mana) or use an ability (consumes power points). In addition to attacking, and I insist on the term ""addition"", you can also use an item to restore some of your -or your companion's- health, power points or mana or you can revive your partner, debuff yourself, debuff your enemy's power ups, gain in power and defense (with the same item !) or give yourself the ability to attack twice. All those items you can find them everywhere, you can buy them and there is a -large- limit of what you can carry.The combats are fun. I have to say, at first it feels a bit flat, like fights are gonna be the same and won't evolve much. But it's amazing how a fairly simple combat mechanic can be, also, quite deep. Enemy's are well thought and can give you some challenge. Opponents with armor and shields for example can be really scary depending of your characters and you will have to build a tactic to beat some combat events. Negative effects like bleeding, burning, being unable to use items because you are sick thanks to ""gross damage"", can also force you to adapt those tactics.The progression of your character is also interesting, I spend time changing my weapons, bound relics to them to add some bonus effects to them. Upgrading your special attacks is a difficult task, you won't be able to upgrade everything so you will have to specialize. You also earn a point to unlock perks at certain milestones of the amount of friend you collect on the social network hub (yes, your menu is basically Facebook), you gain them in the general progression but a big chunk of them is available only for those who explore the city and finish side quests. And like every good RPG I planned what perk will I want to unlock.A really smart aspect of the game is that it's not just about fetching quests and fighting, a lot of those sequences are linked by ""puzzles"", you have to progress but the road is blocked, so you need to search for an item or use your awesome abilities that you collect throughout the main adventure to open the way. Sometime you can use those abilities to take down opponents with the environment even before fighting them to make the combat easier. And there is a nice difficulty curve to those puzzles, plus a good sense of reward completing them.Still there is I think flaws to the game. A big one is that in combat you can select an item to use at EVERY turn. Without any disadvantages ! Except having to maybe spends a bit of money to refill some of your stack, which is nothing since your won't use your big pile of money much anyway to buy weapons, clothes and relics. That means that you can always heal yourself, revive your companion, build up your attack and defense, but the most overpowered of those is in my opinion the ""Speed up"". That gives you the ability to attack twice ! So basically, you can attack twice at every turn, unless your character is sick (but you can also debuff that easily with one item). Having a limit or some constraint to the use of items would have made combats a lot more strategic, fun, and challenging.The first time you are thrown in the city is also a bit unthought. It's a huge space, you feel like you have to visit everything, and so you are subject to let down quests and completely derailed from the main branch of the game.I liked that feeling in Skyrim for example, but The Stick of Truth is more of a story heavy adventure, exploring is not as interesting. You just beat the crap out of every pole, letter boxes and open every drawer to loot items and money. And you don't have yet any ability that will allow you to reach the most interesting places. So, beside collecting quests (and forgetting them because you collect so many quests) exploring at the very beginning of the game is quite long, boring and without much purpose.Having the city expend throughout the main progression would have made that ""unleashing"" less abrupt and overwhelming. I would have imagined a territory unlocking being on point with the lore of the game, for example since human fights against elves, you can't go to a elven territory if you are not welcome within it.Conclusion:But overall you can see they really worked on all aspects of the game, the details are amazing. The fact that this is a RPG based adventure means you are free to make some choices, good or bad and everything has been thought. Look, the skin of your character's parents are changing relative to the skin you selected for your character, it's awesome !All items in the game are references. Guys I'm serial, there is references everywhere ! To the show mostly, but also other games. There is a tone of items you find on defeated enemy and bags that serve the unique purpose of being sold for quite little money and those are amazing references to South Park episodes.In the end they did a great job of throwing all those references in a 15 hours game cleverly within a totally new scenario. It's really a new way to ""watch"" South Park. It's everything the show is, but in a well designed game that makes fun of games in general, while offering some crazy moments that you will remember. There is even times when I though that they went even more nuts than in the TV show. You feel by the escalating chaos this scenario is evolving into that they have absolutely no limits (I advise any parents to not show any kid under 13 to play or watch this game, seriously).I will not forget the moment when you finish the first day and your character goes to bed, you think you where in some crazy sh*t all along and now you can rest a little. And then, the craziest♥♥♥♥♥♥among them all happens ! And the second night, oh god...End Word:The game is gold for South Park fans. If you are not one of them, then watch the show, if you don't like it, fine. If you like it, watch every single one of the episodes and then play the game. Without knowing the references to the episodes, you loose so much of the fun, the main interest of the game really.If you are a fan of South Park, you MUSTN'T miss this ! It's the game made for you.			"

												I've watched the entire South Park series front and back a few times, so I got just about every reference in the game.  It looks exactly like the show, and dialogue and characters are great.  So, my only complaints are the difficulty and the length.  Even with the game set on the hardest difficulty, the battles are a joke because you're just so strong.  Since you're only a 2 person party, the enemies only attack in groups only up to 4.  The spells are way too powerful and it's too easy to strip the enemy of armor.  Additionally, you're healed after every battle and can save anywhere, so there's never any threat of dying and losing progress.Second is the length.  You'd think a show that spans more than 15 years can have enough content to make a game that's longer than 10 hours (15 if you take your time and do all the side quests and collection.)  So many characters and locations are just given a tiny cameo or mention.Still though, I hope this is a the start of a beautiful journey of quality SP games.  I would love to explore its world with a full 4-5 man party with an actual challenge.9/10The Canada and uh...butt diving segments just had me laughing the entire time.			"

												This game is quite unusual in the fact that it has a perfect balance of absurd comedy and professional design.  The developers were very true to follow the blueprint of the show and this game is a harmonious complement.  While the game is still a little bit pricey as of this writing, it might only warrant purchase by the true fans.  Rest assured it is packed with the raunchy humor and twisted atmosphere that makes South Park what it is.  The developers did not hold back and do deliver an immersive and fun experience.  Just like when watching the show, I smiled, laughed and rolled my eyes.Keep up the great work guys – best one yet.This game is worth its weight in gold sh(i)t !!			"

I could not stop playing this game once I got it. I also recently started playing Dragon Age: Inquisition and put that on the shelf as soon I started up The Stick of Truth.Prepare to be offended and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off in the process.			"

I came into it with low expectations and was surprised to say the least, the humor was what i expected and they kept it consistent through-out the game with some being good enough to ..... disrupt my concentration mid combat . took me about 9 hours to get a moderate paced playthrough complete but i will play again with the other classes. the rpg elements of the game are entertaining and involving to keep it fresh and exciting. having got this as a new release ... i encountered one crash and 4 glitches ( 1 affected game play  the other 3 cosmetic) as for the price im not bothered by what i paid for it and am more satisfied with it then other mainstream games ive played previously			"

												Forget that this is an Obsidian game. If you're looking for a reactive gameworld and deep mecanics, look elsewhere. This is an extended South Park episode with a knockoff Paper Mario framework. It's fun, but easy and shallow, even on the hardest difficulties. Choice and consequence are virtually nil, which is a real shame for a fictional universe as richly developed as South Park. The game also goes by in a hurry; I completed virtually all of the game's sidequests very quickly, then blew through the rest of the campaign in a scant few hours. I enjoyed myself all the while, but I'm very glad I bought it on sale. Recommended at a price of $15 or lower.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth *Slight Spoilers*This game greatly exceeded my expactations of what a South Park game could be. The Animation and Dialouge are exactly what you would expect from South Park and it feels like your taking part in an actual episode. The main Story-line alone had plenty of crude humour and any south park fan would be able to enjoy as it has many refrences hidden about from older episodes. I'd Definatly Recommend it if you ever enjoyed South Park. -CombatWith its Paper Mario-Esque combat ala time-based button pressing/mashing, it manages to keep things interesting with a wide array of attacks and abilities. From using your farts as Dragonborn Shouts, to Circumsizing your enemies, all the way to summoning a dog to hump your enemies, Theres a very wide array of abilities across the classes and partners. You can even summon in backout from certain characters upon doing quests for them, such as having Mr.Kim come in and do his dragon dance, or having Mr.Slave come and force an enemy into his♥♥♥♥♥♥ they provide a quick escape from a battle incase things go awry.Upon Unlocking Friends you can slowly unlock a wide array of abilities such as doing more and taking less damage from enemies while their burned, to gaining PP from a succesful magic attack. You can also upgrade your Special Abilities to improve them like making your Circum-Sytch apply a 'gross out' effect to surrounding enemies.-Armour and WeaponryI found myself pretty frequently finding new armour and weapons, upon finding a new weapon it might not always be an upgrade as they all have diffrent stats and it may not be benificial to your class/playstyle. You can Augment weapons & armour with stickers, lighters, broken glass, and more.			"

												A must buy for South Park fans out there. The efforts put on the realisation are really impressive. Everything has been made so we'd feel like we're playing an episode.The game, under its guises of immaturity and fart jokes proper to the show, also shows an intelligent design all around, with exploration and puzzle solving at the core, and a solid combat system.Definitely had a blast playing through this and will start a new game for sure.

												I'm going to go ahead and give my rating and then explain why I gave it such. South Park: The Stick of Truth, in my opinion, gets a 9/10. Now, you start off the game by creating your character. The amount of different customization combinations is actually pretty impressive. There are plenty of hairstyles, makeup, facial features and much more when you actually get into the game so I felt like my character was unique. I'll go ahead and compare it to Skyrim's character creation. Now, I'm not talking about all of the different things you can tweak on your character. I'm talking about the way you can make a character that is yours and yours only. I've yet to actually see someone else that has any characters looking similar to mine.Alright then, now let's get onto the rest of the game since talking about cool character creation woulnd't be much of a review. I enjoyed the story very much. It was exactly of the quality you would expect from an episode of South Park. In fact, the whole game made me feel as if I was in the show because of how immersed I was in it. It was funny, weird, disgusting, racist and the many other terms that South Park is famous for. They even reference some old episodes in the game, whether by dialogue or abilities or even some items you see while exploring the town. There's a very good variety of side quests that you can do if you don't want to just breeze through the main one. The combat system is also well-done. They do their own take on a turn-based battle sytem that I thought was pretty refreshing since I haven't played one of those in a while since Pokemon Y. What is even better is that their are so many things that can happen in combat that it actually makes you strategize so that you can win the battle. Your character can Bleed, Slow, become Grossed Out, set on Fire, and Dazed. Not sure if that's all of them either. And then their are things that do that opposite and increase either Attack, Defense, give you Shields, or restore your PP so that you can use another ability. There are also a TON of weapons that you can use for combat. You either buy them, find them, or are given them at any time during the game. Each weapon comes with their own unique stat boosts or perks that can help you dominate a battle. Then you can even add more boosts onto them via Stickers, each either increasing the different types of damage you decide to do, increasing your health, gives you armor so that you basically become a tank if you have enough stacked on you, or even heal you after landing a perfect attack or blocking one. Needless to say, you won't be short on the different types of weapons that you can have and kick all of the other kids asses, whether it be with a sword or a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh, and the same goes with the armor. Plenty of them to put on your character and they can also have Stickers be put on them as well. I like to talk about graphics but I kind of don't really see the point since... it's South Park. Not exactly supposed to be graphically oriented. I was happy with getting to walk around the town by having my character haphazerdly hop with each step everywhere he went. Another cool thing is that you get to have a companion with you, both in and out of fights. The first one you start off with is Butters. He goes around with you, talking about where you are or what you're supposed to be doing for the main mission in the game, plus all of his own unique dialogue. The rest of the companions do the same as well and none of them sound like each other. No one says the same sentence another companion would and I really liked that. I'm going to go ahead and wrap this up by saying that you will completely enjoy the main storyline in the game. It's about 12 hours long but they're going to be a DAMN good 12 hours. I was laughing and enjoying myself during the entire game and the ending was satisfying to me. Sure, the humor is crude but I've always loved that about South Park so I didn't mind it at all. The only reason I didn't give this game a perfect score was because I had some performance issues at one point in the game. Don't know if it was because of my system or not but it just bothered me a bit. Other than that, it's a great game and deserves the sixty bucks you'll not have if you buy it.			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth has been a long time coming, first it got delayed and delayed, then it changed publishers to Ubisoft then it got delayed again while there was some talk that it might never see the light of day.What makes matters worse is that previous games based on the series have been pretty dire, including the awful first person shooter that came out back in 1998. So we were not left with much hope when the new game was first announced.The good news is that it has finally made release, and the even better news is that it is - what I believe to be - the best South Park title that will ever make it to market. RPG developers Obsidian and the show’s creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a superb job mixing in role-playing elements and keeping true to the South Park look and feel. The GameplayThe game can be quite in-depth at times too, with numerous roles to pick from and perks, progression and levelling up you would expect to find in any decent RPG. You choose a class at the beginning of the game, I went with Warrior, but you get a choice from others such as Mage, Thief and Jew.The fighting side of things happen when you either approach or get hit by one of the enemy characters in the game. The fights are JRPG in style with regular attacks and buffs mixed in with special abilities (though South Park based!). Early on in the game you will be trained in various moves by Cartman, one involving you farting on Kenny dressed as a princess, need I say anymore.Attacks made during these battles can also be improved by timed button presses. For example, early on you are joined by Butters and he has options such as Hammer of Justice among others. One attack has you spinning the left thumbstick around and then pressing the Action button on your controller at the right time when prompted. It works well and doesn’t get tiresome, thanks to the excellent voice work, animation and variety of attacks available.It also isn’t an easy game, you can find yourself killed early on by going after enemies who are too high a level for you, and levelling up is a must-do task early on. Perks are improved by making friends in the game, the more friends you have the more perks you will get. Making friends can be done by either chatting to them or completing a task. Certain friends can also be used as a special fighting friend once in a while, such as God who will come down from the sky and mow-down your enemies in a hail of gunfire.Talking of people you meet in the game, those who you do befriend will “friend” you on the South Park social media site, Facebook. This is yet another highly funny section of the game where characters comment on pages, talk about things happening around them and basically mock you. The social page leads on to the map, perks and quest tracking.The game is full of quests which steer you away from the main one, and I found myself just wandering around South Park for at least 6-7 hours before I even bothered taking on the main story; this is a good sign that things have been done right in a licensed game for once.Side-quests themselves can involve you retrieving objects, collecting dodgy looking post for slave and more. The quests are always fun, and due to the writing and voice work they rarely feel like a chore, like they could have done if it was any other RPG.As in any RPG you can sell and buy items. Throughout the game you collect junk from destroying boxes, taking down enemies and from completing quests. This junk can be sold in shops and via various characters that you meet in the game world. Each piece of junk has a description worth reading before you sell it though once again they can be funny, despite not having any use in the game other than gaining currency. You can buy new weapons, armour and buffs for your character but they are restricted based on the level you have gained at the time.Graphics and SoundGraphically I can’t find any fault with the game whatsoever, it looks and plays out just like an episode of South Park, the animation is spot on, the look of the places you visit, the characters you meet and the cutscenes are all perfect. Cutscenes are done in-engine and you can’t tell the difference from what you would see on a TV episode to the game, and that credit goes both to the developers and the creators of the series.We have been playing both the PC and the PS3 version for the past week or so, and the PC version clearly leads the way on visuals as it can run at 1080p with little problem, the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are running at 720p, but we have to note that there was the odd bit of judder and lag in the PS3 title, but hopefully this will be fixed by launch. The game has no graphic options to fiddle with on the PC other than resolution, so just get into the game and enjoy it.Sound is excellent too, voice work is brilliant by the creators and adds to the feeling of being part of South Park. The only issue I had was some repetitive dialogue when clicking on characters, but this was few and far between and just something I had to mention.Final ThoughtsThe writing is excellent as expected, assuming you are a fan of the show of course. You get the kind of juvenile humour you would expect and more. It is one of the few games that I have ever laughed out loud at since the days of a Bevis and Butthead adventure game.Overall it is probably the best licensed game ever, it captures the look, feel, dialogue and story writing of the series while mixing some great but simple RPG elements into the mix. Obsidian have done a great job here and it was well worth the wait, but only for South Park fans. The only downside I could find is that lasting around 20 hours we can only hope that the creators actually want to produce a follow up, something that during their recent interviews they stated that they haven’t really taken a shine to.

PresentationIt's been a long run for South Park: The Stick of Truth as development initially began in 2009, after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone approached Obsidian about making a role-playing game designed to look exactly like the television series, which in the final product they managed to do flawlessly as The Stick of Truth feels like an entire season of the long running TV show, and a good one too. You assume the role of the new kid in town as you try to make friends and become a part of the fantasy role playing game that everyone in South Park seems to be a part of, either by standing behind Cartman's human race or Kyle's elves, fighting against each other to hold the Stick of Truth. Throughout this 12-16 hours journey you will meet iconic South Park characters, make new friends and gather allies to join your cause, so by the end of the game everyone in South Park will have a role to play in your game. What differentiates this experience from your normal South Park episode is its length and the opportunities that come with that to tell a longer, richer story without having to rely on previous episodes of the show to introduce you to some of the scenery in which the action will take place; of course, fans of the series will instantly recognize locations from the show, as all of the kids' houses as well as community buildings which often appear in the show are all here, but this game finally defines a map of where those buildings are located throughout town, and that gives great opportunities for exploration, even for old fans of the TV show. Among those iconic buildings and locations, The Stick of Truth comes with some new ones as well, and combining those in a map of South Park that feels authentic and logical creates an amazing playground for you and your buddies, giving great opportunities for side-quests, which the games comes no short of. While The Stick of Truth has a lot to offer for long-time fans of the show as the game is filled with references and even the smallest thing will bring back some memories to fans, the game manages to offer an amazing and hilarious experience even for those who haven't caught up with the TV show for the last couple of seasons, as it relies on basic humour, jokes and parodies of hit TV shows such as Breaking Bad or video games like Skyrim to make you laugh on every occasion. Aside from the fart jokes and all the hilarious lines it's pleasing to see how the world looks through a child's imagination, even when as an adult things are way different and Red Bulls are not magic potions, but since this is a South Park experience, even with that moment of revelation, be ready for things to quickly escalate into madness involving aliens, nazi zombies and Taco Bell.Rating: 10GameplayThe Stick of Truth at its core is a turn based RPG, allowing you and one of the multiple buddies which you will unlock along the way to form a party and adventure together, helping you out in combat, as well as keeping you company and occasionally make you laugh with an unexpected joke. Even though it keeps a simplistic look and basic controls to allow everyone to jump into the action, The Stick of Truth's turn based RPG elements leave plenty of room for strategy if you're willing to give the game a try on a harder difficulty level and face a real challenge. As you start your adventure, you can choose between four character classes: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew, and even if each comes with a set of unique skills, they make little difference in battle as there are no class specific items, meaning that a Mage can pickup a sword and use it just as well as a Fighter. Each character can perform two actions each turn,first giving you the option to restore HP or Mana using a potion, remove debuffs or use the character's special skill and then allowing you to perform a secondary action, attacking your enemies by using a skill, magic attack, or normal ranged/melee attack. There are plenty of options to choose from and The Stick of Truth's higher difficulty levels will challenge you to come up with the best strategies in order to succeed, but even with all those elements, The Stick of Truth manages to keep it simple for players who only want a South Park experience without the headache of a turn based RPG, making this title accessible to anyone who wants a taste. The greatest part about the game's combat system is that it's not overused to the point where it becomes boring and repetitive, leaving plenty of room for exploration, item gathering and non-combat sidequests throughout the story, often giving you a break between battles, and allowing you to gather more loot and better equipment to satisfy your needs, sending you on different paths to acquire the things you might need to progress further, and by the time you'll encounter the next series of battles, you'll already have new spells and items to play with, making it interesting once again. Since this game is the first time you get to fully explore the town, there are plenty of locations to visit and characters to find, the game often giving you sidequests to encourage you to explore more and find out what else there is to see and even giving you more tools as the story progresses to access previously unreachable areas such as small cracks in the walls which you can only enter using the Gnome Dust in order to shrink or high rooftops which can be accessed using the Alien Probe. Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe Stick of Truth does not only feel like an episode of the show, but it looks like one as well, keeping the HUD elements to a minimum and only showing up when necessary, making the experience indistinguishable from the TV show outside of combat, and making it just as fun to watch as it is to play. Everything from the characters to the scenery and the iconic locations look authentic and add to the South Park experience you've always wanted to have. The menus are the only thing that could use a bit more work, as they can be disorienting and hard to browse at times, but that is only a minor issue as you will rarely have to use the menu as the game hardly breaks that atmospheric feeling of a South Park episode.Rating: 9AudioThis thing sounds like the real deal, as all the voice actors from the shows are here to voice their respective characters, in beautiful high definition recordings that will make you laugh with each joke a character tells using his iconic accent and voice. Numerous songs already known from the TV show are present in here as well, used in the funniest ways possible and combined with some great sound effects also taken from the show, they help recreate an authentic South Park feel; after all, there is nothing like walking into a store and Cartman's ""Kyle's Mom is a ♥♥♥♥♥"" starts playing on the radio.Rating: 10ExtrasIt can take you up to 15 hours to complete the campaign if you're willing to complete all the side quests and collect everything, unfortunately there is not much replay value after that as the character classes make no difference in combat, and there are no twists that might change the outcome of anything. The campaign is also the only thing the game has to offer, but if you're digging the turn based RPG elements, you might want to give it a second try on a higher difficulty level, unless you did that on the first try.Rating: 7VerdictThe Stick of Truth is like an entire season of South Park, keeping the humor, and its unique setting and adding some RPG mechanics that make it just as interesting to play as it is to watch, but even without giving much attention to its gameplay, the Stick of Truth is definitely a season of South Park worth watchingRating Overall: 8.9Check out the full review and a lot more about South Park: The Stick of Truth at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=334 "

												If you're a fan of South Park, then you'll love this game! Each class is unique, and the abilities for the various classes and buddies are diverse and entertaining, not to mention the magic (farting) skills that all classes learn throughout the game.  It's a little short (my 4 playthroughs - one for each class - took me 55 hours, which is almost 14 hours a playthrough on average), but if you've watched enough of the show to appreciate all the humor and inside jokes, it's pretty much worth getting even at $60...definitely worth getting once it goes on sale!!!

Now that I am picking it up again I haven't had a crash and the humor is as to be expected from South Park, which is generally to my liking.  The graphics are fabulous...

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a prime example of how games that are based around a non-game IP should be done as it accurately captures the essence of the show whilst remaining a solid experience in its own right. The RPG gameplay is fantastic, taking the tried and true styles that were made famous by the Final Fantasy series and reworking them into the South Park world. The story is witty, funny and satisfying, a true testament to the writing talents of the South Park studios. Honestly I went into this game with the lowest of expectations only to have them completely blown away, something that rarely happens these days. For anyone who’s a fan of this show and feels like an 11 hour, self directed episode would be up their alley then South Park; The Stick of Truth is for you.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/04/25/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-save-us-sir-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ "

												For those South Park fans, this is a typical South Park game. Throughout the game you will keep comming through classical South Park jokes one after another. And there are many details hiding in the game just like presents waiting for those real fans to find out. When you play, it feels like seeing a new episode of South Park, only bigger, longer and uncut(Sorry for the europeans, your version got some scenes censored)As a turn-based RPG, the game itself is pretty good. Not extrodinary or mind-blowing, but definitely good.But after all, this is a South Park product, so it is not suitable for ANYONE!			"

												I will just start off by saying that this game is very good.  There are a few quirky controls and frankly that is the only big issue I can find with the game other than the overall length.The characters and dialogue are 100% South Park so if you enjoy the show, this game will be more of the same type of jokes.  Most of the characters, even very minor ones, from the show make an appearance at some point.The combat system is fairly well done.  Attacking is very easy and you will be performing non stop perfect attacks within the first 20 minutes of playing the game.  The defensive side of combat takes some getting used to though as each enemy has multiple different attacks that all need to be timed differently to get ""Perfect"" blocks which will greatly reduce the damage you take.  It only takes getting hit a few times though to get most of them down.  I played on normal difficulty and did not have much trouble with any of the fights.  I only had to replay three I think and only because my teammate died to an enemy attack and the enemy died to bleed or fire damage after it killed him which would have voided a playthrough long achievement had I kept going and not reverted to a prior save.The quests in the game are not overly tedious and you are not really kept in any area long enough to get bored with it.  The downside to this was that I ended up finishing up the last of my playthrough around the 20 hour mark which is a bit short for an RPG.  If I had to add one thing to this game, it would have been about 10-15 more side missions.The controls are good save for some placed where you must perform on screen commands.  I played using an XBOX 360 controller and some of these events were just brutal.  Learning the first spell from Cartman took me like 10 tries.  There is another part, towards the end of the story, where using a controlled will make you pull your hair out.  To remain spoiler free, you will know it when you get there and there are numerous threads discussing it.  When you have to spin the stick for this part, placing my palm on the stick and spinning it as fast is possible is the only way I made it.  Others have said that quitting and starting up the game with mouse and keyboard is much easier.Overall, I would give this game a solid 8/10.  If it were another 15 hours or so longer, that score would be higher.			"

												I have never laughed so much while playing a game.  I was not a huge South Park (show) fan but always appreciated the way they addressed current events in a non-politically correct manner.  This game has all of the crude humor you expect from the creators and kept me entertained while playing.  Like most reviews suggest there is not a lot of replay value but if you want to be grossed-out, have a good laugh and enjoy RPG based games, get it.  I am now looking forward to the sequel.  Occasionally the game would hang or crash for no reason but the frequent saves kept me from having to repeat any missed steps.			"

												Even if you expect the content of South Park, nothing will save you from the awkward silence when someone looks over your shoulder and sees scenes from this game out of context.Hell, it's still f***ed up with context.But with South Park, you can not expect it to be any other way.I was impressed with the amount of content in the game and even the amount of depth (from what I thought was a spoof game) put into the turn based fighting mechanics.Otherwise, it's South Park - boiled down without alteration into a pretty fun game.But seriously, if someone unfamiliar with South Park sees you playing at a bad time, you will be judged. Poorly.10/10 - Would look people in the eye and dare them to say anything about it again.			"

												Do you like fishsticks?Then you'll probably like this game.It may not be the most original RPG out there and a lot of people disdain turn-based battles on a computer game nowadays but everything is well done in this game.You should ""feel"" the story of the game, in the sense that while you can see the epic and the fantastic, in the meantime it's clear that everything is just some made up game by silly kids in a remote mountain town just playing around. It's very easy to feel inside the show and there's even some kind of filter for the cutscenes that makes it seem like a movie file and not an in-game scene so you can feel like your character is in fact in a South Park episode.You will enter the show.Be a character, play your role.And be insulted and insult someone else.If you like the show it won't disappoint you.

												Awesome game I played it 5 times through first time through on PC and I have to say it's prefect for South Park fans or people looking for a comdey game or just a turn based RPG.  Not many Side Quests but the Story makes up for it in more ways.  I believe Matt and Trey did a great job on this game.  Now get back to making the show.			"

												If you're a South Park fan, then this game is probably for you. It isn't that easy though, as you will also need to be someone that can enjoy the actual gameplay that the game is comprised of. Turn based RPG elements from games like Mario RPG and Costume Quest is what South Park: TSoT offers. If that would drive you insane, then jsut watch a walkthrough of the game on Youtube. The gameplay mixes things up enough to get you through the game, but after a few hours, the repetative actions in battle do get old. Despite this, I got exactly what I wanted from the game. A very lengthy episode of South Park with references galor to every season and what seems like every episode. The look and feel is spot on with the show and most importantly the nothing is sacred humor is spot on. If you're a SP fan, the game is a 5/5If you're an RPG fan expecting something like The Elder Scrolls or The Witcher and you have no interest in SP or its style of comedy, then this will surely be a 1/5For me, this was an easy 5/5			"

												Game had a good length for me. Not too terribly long about 30 hours. Combat was fun and fast paced, lots of different armor and weapons to play with. Talent trees and perks are neat but you end up with just about everything in the end and consumable are far too easy to come by. Nice casual RPG experience. Highly recommend to anyone! Especially, SP fans there is so many running jokes/references and some things that just made me laugh uncontrollably at times.What I didn't like, The DLC is worthless unless you want to run through the game in the same set of armorHad some graphical issues with characters disappearing during cuts scenes at the end of the game (not too bad or gamebreaking)Collectables can be missed forever. I planned on going to back to look for the chinpokomon and ended up 29/30 for my playthrough because there was one I couldn't find (Upon looking it up the area I missed it in is no longer accessable.)

												This game is extremely faithful to its franchise, with one difference: its content does not need to adhere to FCC guidelines for television broadcast.  When you release Trey Parker and Matt Stone from the chains of censorship, you get South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and you get South Park: Stick of Truth.  The writers are *trying* to offend you.  So imagine the most cringeworthy South Park episode you have ever seen, and step it up a notch.  Hold it there for a second, and push it even farther.  Now you're ready to play, new kid.Pay no attention to that Ubisoft logo.  Focus on the Obsidian Entertainment--the folks that gave you KotOR II, NWN 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Pillars of Eternity.  Apparently, they can do a JRPG.  It's replayable, too.			"

												Fans of the show will fall in love with this game. If you aren't a fan of the show and love obscene humor and pop culture references, you will still find a great deal of enjoyment. The entire world of South Park is brought to life in this beautiful rendition mimicking the exact art style of the show. The game feels like an entire season of south park dedicated to a singular plot. The only shallow part of the game is the combat, which is definitely very basic and could be improved upon in the upcoming sequel.9/10 as a show fan.			"

												Worth playing if you've ever laughed at a South Park joke. I haven't seen every episode (I'd say I've seen roughly half of the series), so there some references that left me wondering, but overall still enjoyable.I think the premise of being a new kid, and stepping into a fantasy themed, imagination based game is very clever. This appealed to me as my favorite South Park scenarios are those where they're doing kid things, and hijinks ensue.One note, this isn't the best one to play with a Steam Controller. I found the right stick and lack of vibration made the magic hard to work with. I ended up switching back to a 360 controller when necessary. "

												TL,DR: A South Park fans must own. Everyone else, give it a play, most fun you'll probably have had since Blood Dragon.I've never, ever been a big proponent of DLC - let it be items like clothing, weapons or skins - but this is the first game that's left me wanting more to play with other than rerolling a new class after the final boss battle. A game that actually makes you want to buy the next adventure/side-mission pack for the game is faaaaaar to rare to come by these days. Yet in honesty, the sticker price for the game isn't worth the 60$ but I still found myself fulfilled with a great, fun time that made me feel like I was playing a South Park game set in South Park, unlike pretty much every South Park up until the release of SoT.The mechanic of mix-and-match flair with costumes is a great alternative to the often rigid armor and equipment set-ups for modern rpg/arpg's and the straight forward ""Yes, x item is better then y item"" interface that many modern RPG's have taken up is present and in place and keeps you playing the game then weighing stats.On the Kenny side of the tracks; the classes feel a bit on the 'samey' side, with little to differentiate them aside from their class names and spell animation flair. I played a Thief and rerolled to a mage after the final boss battle and found that he pretty much had the exact same starting abilities as my Thief: A stun and a dot - although their advancements do seperate them marginally, I think greater attention to how the classes could have been different really should be priority if there will be any additional content or sequels to the game. Old Mister Hat's to the RPG/ARPG genre should probably play it on the hardest difficulty if you're looking for a challange, otherwise the myriad of stuns you're afforded will make much of the game a cake walk. Upon retreving your first ranged weapon, you're able to stun a member of the enemies you'll be facing on the battle screen by shooting them from the overworld and hitting one of their buddies. They're stunned for a round or two, which buys you a lot of time to work with, in addition to the way speed is handled, you'll find it incredibly hard to die on the lowest difficulty.Which kinda brings me to my one major point: The game doesn't focus so much on being an RPG set in South Park but more as a South Park episode you get to be part of with it's 'magic', stylized turn-based combat and Matt Stone and Trey Parker humor that'll probably keep me coming back for more.

												I'm not a big South Park fan (the only episode I'll go out of my way to watch is 'Make Love Not Warcraft,') but that doesn't change the fact that I very much enjoyed this game. This is a very simple RPG to learn the mechanics of: easy for beginner's, intracite enough for experts. The writing is sublime, the humor is over the top like only South Park does, the amount of references to the show are endless, and it's a great RPG all around. Even if your not a fan of South Park, I'd easily recommend this for your first RPG. Hell, even if it isn't your first RPG. It's a fantastic game all around. The only downside is that the summons are rather underplayed and feel somewhat forced to be in there for the sake of having summons, but if that's the worst of it, I have nothing to complain about.

												A great game for South Park fans. SPOILER ALERT: (obviously) for people new to South Park. Hilariously funny jokes are eveywhere with all your favourite characters. A new battle technique has been implemented that is extremely different from RPG's, but still makes the game feel like one. Definitely recommend this for anyone that's a big fan.			"

The fighting style takes a little getting used to, but it's so worth it. Obviously involves a fair amount of offensive content, but wouldn't be South Park without it, eh?PRINCESS KENNYYYYYYY			"

												If you're a fan of South Park, then you probably don't need me to tell you to play this game. It's certainly more than a lame RPG with a South Park skin, but it's less than an a masterpiece that elevates the genre and the source material.Pros:*Funny story from start to finish*Fun to explore the South Park world on your own*Fun, somewhat-deep combat system that even non-rpg fans can enjoy*High quality cut scenes and writing*Good environment varietyCons:*Brings nothing new to the table*No real reason to return to the game after you've completed the main story*NOT for people who have never seen South ParkI feel like the pros are self explanatory, so I'll elaborate on the cons. The game does not introduce any new ideas that do not already exist in the South Park universe. Almost every single joke in the game is a reference to something that is in the show. For fans of the show, like myself, this is a good thing. But this completely closes the door for any non-SouthPark fans. Even in terms of combat, which I found to be very engaging as an RPG-enthusiast, there is nothing new here. The combat is good overall, and much deeper than I expected it to be, but it's still not as deep as what you might find in your typical RPG. There's a good tutorial and scalable difficulty, so even people new to the RPG genre can jump right into the game and have a good time. It comes off as RPG-lite, which is understandable as the game needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of South Park fans. The main story is high quality all the way through, and the writing is solid, but once you've completed the main quest and side quests, there is nothing else to do. You can achievement hunt and look for collectibles, but many of the previous mission areas are inaccessible, and there's no real reason to explore. You won't find a secret side quest that you never knew about, or a mini-boss that you'll have to grind to level 99 to beat. As an RPGer, I found this to be a detriment, as even the old school Final Fantasy games had this.Overall, I had a great time with this game, and I highly recommend to any and all South Park fans. Even those who aren't interested in RPGs. Non-South Park fans would do best to stay away, as there's not enough new things to appeal to people just looking for a good RPG, and almost all the jokes are show-referential.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The control was perfect, the atmosphere didn't just feel like South Park, it WAS South Park. The only problem with the game is the ending, and the post game. The end game feels unfinished and if you focus on the sub quests before the end of the game you will find yourself too over powered for the enemies you are facing. I reccomend this game on sale, because what it does it does well, but it doesn't last very long at all.			"

												For those South Park fans, this is a typical South Park game. Throughout the game you will keep comming through classical South Park jokes one after another. And there are many details hiding in the game just like presents waiting for those real fans to find out. When you play, it feels like seeing a new episode of South Park, only bigger, longer and uncut(Sorry for the europeans, your version got some scenes censored)As a turn-based RPG, the game itself is pretty good. Not extrodinary or mind-blowing, but definitely good.But after all, this is a South Park product, so it is not suitable for ANYONE!			"

												As someone who likes South Park, but doesn't avidly watch it, this game was still unbelievely funny, fun, and very well made. To be honest I was not expecting such a well thought out game in terms of details and references. As for Pros, the game is well crafted in terms of being true to the South Park name by creating the world thoroughly with tons of easter egg interactions and items. In such a short span it hits a lot of the characters that you're familiar with, and makes good sense of how their imaginations create their characters.As for Cons, the game is definitely too short, hitting up everything takes around 12 hours. I hope that it's successor will be longer but as detailed as this game was. Further the combat system could have used a tiny bit more depth, I honestly didn't use half the skills/weapons that I came across and just stuck with 2-3 skills that got the job done. I think the creators could have done a much better job making the battles both more challenging and more South Parky.All in all still a game worth checking out as long as you're okay with the kind of humor and vulgarity that South Park employs.

												What can I say about South Park the stick of truth? Well it is a very well done rpg if you like south Park then you should already have this game. It puts you right in the middle of the South Park world you play as the new kid with the power of the Dragonborn by South Park standards. It puts most of the content of the show into this game as possible it has many many collectibles. Another thing that I like is that a potato could run this game it takes minimal resources to run this game. If you end up liking this game another one is coming in a few months.

You meet Butters and get thrrown into a hillarious story line. Wandering around South Park is funn attempting to freind as manny people as you can, but the game is very easy to beat, and unless your atempting to unlock all the achivements or find all the easter eggs in this game, you will find yourself finished with the game a lot faster then what you wanted to.

												This is the South Park game the show, and the fans, deserve. You can explore South Park (and even Canada) in its entirety. The writing and humor are top notch; if you like South Park, this won't disappoint. There are references stretching back all the way to the first season, from songs that play on radios to the stuffed Scuzzlebutt in Jimbo's gun shop. And since this was developed by Obsidian, the combat is surprisingly good. It's your standard turn-based battle system, but it has a real-time block/parry system, and some of the status ailments are truly hilarious. Want to make your enemy skip their turns? Throw that turd you fished out of the toilet at them and they'll be too busy throwing up.The only downside, if you can call it that is that the game is relatively short, clocking in at around 15 hours (I clocked 20 on my first playthrough), give or take a few depending on how many sidequests you do. Naturally sidequests will tack on some extra hours, and if you're a South Park fan, you'll want to explore everything you can regardless, just to see everything you can (like walking around Mr. Slave's bedroom). And to collect all the Chinpokomon. But considering the quality of the game, it's more like paying $60 for an interactive season of South Park than just an ordinary game. If you like South Park, you'll like this game, end of story.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. No Joke. You can tell the developers spent a ton of time working on this. It has a ton of references to the South Park episodes and other video games. It has the perfect turn-based RPG battle system ever. It tells an amazing story that the South Park show can't do. 10/10 Absolutely nothing wrong with the game.			"

												A wonderful script written by the creators of the show, so if you enjoy the TV show you'll throughly enjoy this game. Nice turn based RPG gameplay, where you have to interact during your attacking/defending phases to get critical hits, preform special moves and block.Not much replay value unless your a achivement completionist, but your laugh yourself silly on the first playthrough.

												A game for the ages. No, seriously. Although hard-core South Park fans may be disappointed by the lack of 'topical' cntent, the show's humor and skewed take on life clearly shows in the writing, the gags, and the hundreds of in-jokes that cover all of the seasons to date. There are so many easter eggs and references that it will drive me, a 100% completionist, to absolute distraction. So, let's break down the gameplay:Controls: easy, but somewhat non-intuitive when it comes down to the puzzle-solving aspects. As you gain levels and special powers, keeping their effects straight may get wearisome. Fortunately, the pause menu tutorials are well-written and easy to understand.Combat: Moderate, depending on difficulty. There is a level of strategy involved between item management, special attack and buff/debuff parameters to keep min-maxers on the boards for a year. The basics are very intuitive and are well described during the tutorials, so I won't go into detail. Putting together effects management and planning for the next 3 turns of battle becomes essential during some of the boss fights.Visuals/sound: Perfect. Captures both the visual effects and 'feel' of the show from the get-go, including character creation. Putting together my own paper doll to play the game with was one of the most enjoyable experiences, as a gamer and long-time fan of the show. Trey and Matt of course do the voice acting and it really feels like you're playing an episode. Even the grinding/exploration has just enough interjections from your AI companion to remind you you're supposed to be doing something on the main quest, without getting overly annoying.RPG/customization elements: So simple they're frightening in their complexity. The amounts of perks/abilities and weapon/armor customizations run into the hundreds by the time you've completed your first series of main story quests. The ability to mod your weapons/armor perks just before a battle are going to fuel hours of debate between gamers of all stripes.Fun level: 5 stars. The most subjective of all categories, I can't wait to finish my first run-through and try it all again with a new character build.			"

												If you like South Park the TV show, and you enjoy the type of humor that its known for, you'll probably enjoy this game.  I've watched most of the episodes since the pilot and I thought this game was in part a tribute to South Park's hardcore fanbase.  That said, the game has interesting rpg elements that make it playable even if you've never seen the show regularly.  Turn based timing attacks and lots of new gear keep the relatively actionless gameplay interesting.  Normally, when I play games, I will have something playing on my second monitor, like a TV show or a movie, but when I played through this game, it was compelling enough for me to turn off my second monitor.  There are bugs in the windows version of the game, and some of the controls are unweildly.  The inventory system is brutal, requiring a carpal tunnel inducing amount of clicks to unload an entire inventory.  There are some elements of the game that are left unexplained and some that are explained every time you do a specific action.  That said, I was highly entertained by the game overall.  The format was successful and my biggest complaint is that it wasn't longer.  I really feel like this game could be adapted for a sequel, or maybe an even larger more open world fallout/skyrim type game.  I know its a longshot, but I felt a sense of emotional connection with the characters, music, sound effects and visual elements of this game and I'd love for it to be the first in a long franchise.  9.5/10			"

												A heady blend of the very best of South Park writing and characters, with simple JRPG-style gameplay that most folks will grasp in very little time; all conjoined in a grotesque but hilarious specimen that often makes you forget you're actually playing a game, and might have you appreciate the puerility of Matt and Trey if you weren't previously a fan.  My only sinking worry is that, at 19-ish hours of gameplay, my time might be over soon, as the escalation of zany happennings appears to have ceased.  Certainly, buy this game, just perhaps not right away.			"

												This game is an absolute blast. It truly is like watching a really long South Park movie. If you're a casual fan of South Park or even simple RPG elements with poddy humor, this is for you, If you truly love South Park or have watched it since the early days, like myself, you will be pleasantly surprised at every turn as you explore the entire town of South Park. Simple things like looking through each of the four boy's closets. In Stan's closet, a certain someone doesn't want to come out. Down to the 'social media' type thing they have on there where the characters all post along with the continuation of the plot. For instance, I was pepper sprayed outside of Tokken's gated community and Cartman made a post laughing at my expense. Cartman also made a post about how I bought both DLC packs and his mom only let him buy one. It is truly hilarious and stays true to what South Park is at it's core. Cartman changing Tokken from a healer to a blacksmith because 'he just sees blacksmith when looking at Tokken' lol. These little things are what make the whole game for me. Paying $25 for a seemingly wasted nose job at Tom's Rhinoplasty, had a few citizens on the street remark, ""Have you had plastic surgery?"". These parts of the game truly make it feel alive and there are no shortage of side missions. For the first two hours or so I just found myself exploring the town and finding Chinpokemon as well as many many secrets and I know I've barely scratched the surface.			"

												My review so far into the South Park: The Stick of Truth game. So far, I found this to be a parody game similar to Lord of the Rings, Skyrim and World of Warcraft. In the game you are the new kid in South Park (who is a mute) when your father kicks you out of the house and locks it. (father is a major jerk) You first meet Butters who is your neighbour. He was in a battle against a fellow kid and here you save him. He takes you to Cartman's house where you befriend the rest of the KKK league. You learn fart magick xD and May I add I have a weird sense of humour its funny to me. You become from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Sir ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You fight elves to protect the Stick of Truth. Its a very interesting LARPing type that the children of South Park does and thats it. There are various classes you can take: Mage, Warrior, Thief and Jew. You gain potions, PP, mana to do your battles. Potions comes in handy a lot. The difficulty I am currently playing on was from normal to easy since bosses can be quite difficult. You get various questing from all over South Park and you gain friends on a social media network (parody facebook). Your father treats you like dirt so far into the game. I am recently been captured by the aliens that we see from the show, and saved myself from getting full probed which given me the ability to teleport within the game. After you have the world from Alien invasion there is a new invasion you have to highly concern yourself about... The new evil? Nazi Zombies! The Nazi Zombies uses gross mana (you are not safe with this ability while battling them) They do tend to be very odd in a sense, especially with the clinic you go to, with the Giant Nazi Baby Boss Fetus! I found this quite disturbing in my eyes when playing. After all this finish occuring you go to Canada where you learn a new fart spell from none other then Terrance and Phillip <3 I love these guys from the show. They teach you a very powerful spell you will use averagely (not alot but not minor) You will also defeat a Bishop and cut his balls off. (I am not catholic but I have family members who are so somewhat a disappointment but not surprised from South Park at all) I especially love seeing your parents having sex in their room and we see it all and almost get hit by the father's balls including after defeating the villianous Clyde, Princess Kenny, and the Nazi Zombies we go back to normal with everything but not long before this. We get to go inside Mr. Slave's♥♥♥♥♥ This cracked me up!! And you stop the bomb. Not only were you known as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ we find out the real name you have. Same name as the dude from Sykrim: The Dragonborn: Dovahkiin. Yes! This is your real name in the game! You became from Sir and King ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! (I missed pieces here and there, but that would be 100% spoilers instead of 75%)Music: The music is very different then what we would usually hear in South Park. The music has a similar sound to Lord of the Rings in my opinion which sounds absolutely fantastic to me. Better then the music they usually play in the show. They do minorly have original music from the show in stores, the PTA/community hall)Insults: So far the insulting has been small, they insulted gingers so far and that is all. Very shocking for me being 7.1 hours in and only that insult. :O They do have some crude humour here and there with farting (due to the fart magick) Only one thing that really got to me is when Princess Kenny was captured by the elves with one particular word they enjoy saying. Lets leave it at that. Child Molesters, Christianity mocked, Abortions mocked, and more.. What you expect from South Park. Graphics: Not much different from the show, they did a fantastic job capturing the detail of South Park. No more things need to be mentioned here. Comparisons: So far I have only notised two parody similarities. LOTR, Skyrim and WoW. I have found no comparisons to FF VII or any FF for all that matter. I have heard from one ""reviewer"" that this has a similarity to FF. Only thing that is remotely similar is the party similarities and that is all. Questing: Most of the questing is simple, Timmy's fast travel comes in handy if you don't want to long walk to each quest. A few quests is nerve racking! I have a few quests I truly hated and left the game for a few days and came right back to it They are: The alien spaceship trying to reach the control rooms. This was very very tough for me. The key ones in the school was minorly difficult. Beating Kenny over 4 times was the most challenging to me, and currently one I really do hate is trying to defeat Al Gore because he annoys you to death in Facebook message and YES! I AM SEVERELY TRAPPED HERE NOW with remaining side quests. My overall rating in this game is 8/10 Fun, addicting, and if your into South Park and the crude humour. Highly Recommended.			"

												South Park has always had a rough run in video games. From the original South Park video game for the original Playstation and N64 to the more recent South Park: Tenorman’s Revenge, pretty much all South Park games have been less than spectacular. None of them have even truly felt like a real South Park experience. Well, South Park: The Stick Of Truth is here to change that. South Park: The Stick Of Truth is an RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the developers behind Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic 2, Dungeon Siege III and Fallout: New Vegas. The game has gone through a lot in its development time. Originally planned to be published by the now defunct THQ, it then vanished only to be re-risen by it’s new publisher Ubisoft. I am quite thankful that Ubisoft has made sure The Stick Of Truth has seen the light of day because it was a truly fun experience.The game begins as the gang is engaging in a war over the stick of truth, a stick which gives it’s holder ultimate control over the universe. You are the new kid. Your parents tell you to go out and make some friends and shortly after, you’re sucked into the world of the game. The game offers you four different classes to choose from consisting of Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew, all of which are self explanatory with the exception of Jew which plays like a paladin would. It also offers three different difficulties which are Easy, Normal and Hardcore. For my first play through I chose to play as a Mage and it played exactly like you’d expect a Mage in an RPG would. As I progressed and leveled new spells and abilities became available and it played out as you would expect in a standard RPG. The leveling system is straight from the books as well and is pretty much on par. Without giving too much information away the story plays out pretty much exactly as you would expect from South Park. It’s absolutely ridiculous, but in an extremely fun and entertaining way. The game progresses from the boy’s tiny Lord Of The Rings stylized game to a world filled with chaos with no one realizing just how ridiculous and insane everything has become.The game play of The Stick Of Truth is pretty unoriginal but it worked out perfect for the game. The fights are turn-based with you and your buddy up against your enemies. The HUD is nice and easy to use and makes battling an easy system to master. When not in battle, you are either running around completing side quests or working on the main quest line. The main quests are generally longer and much more complicated and will take you across a variety of locations where as the side quests are generally short and to the point. There were a few “find and kill” side quests but not enough to be an annoyance. The main quests were really where the majority of the fun was but you will definitely need to have done side quests in between or you’ll be too low of a level to actually compete with any enemies you may encounter on the main quest. The loot system consists of both finding and collecting items from defeated foes. You can loot anything from money, to weapons to armor to potions to a turd (which can be used to gross out your enemies). The map of South Park is not overly huge so you’ll end up going back and forth to many of the same places multiple times. If you don’t feel like running you can take a fast travel (thanks to your little bud Timmy) but I found it much nicer and only slightly longer to run it. If you’re playing the uncensored version of the game while free roaming around town you may enter locations and spot random events going on. In general, they were pretty hysterical but I am sure that none of them have made it into the uncensored version of the game.The Stick Of Truth also has a collecting system were throughout the game you must try and collect all of the 30 chinpokomon scattered around South Park. Along with this is another collection goal to become friends with everyone in South Park on Facebook. Both systems were nice and added slight side goals, but at the same time I felt both were a bit on the easy side. Collecting friends generally would just happen by playing through quests or talking to people while roaming town, while the chinpokomon were, with a few exceptions, generally hidden in plain sight. Still it added a bit of extra content and a few things to do other than questing. Almost every character from the South Park universe does makes an appearance in the game so if you’re dedicated it will take a lot of searching to find everyone.In many ways, Stick Of Truth actually feels like a new South Park movie only much longer and more interactive than a movie could be. The animations and voice acting was done by South Park Studios so when you end up in a cut-scene it really feels like you are actually watching the show. While playing the game the animations are just as great but it does feel somewhat different. It could just be due to the fact that you are busy playing and not just sitting back and watching a scene. Obviously the game carries it’s own unique story but the game contains more references, to episodes of the show, than I could count. Whether it was completing a side quest to help Mr. Hankey find his children to helping Mr. Kim fight off the Mongolians there was a lot of nostalgia from past events. Unfortunately, while the main quest line focuses on the new story a good portion of the side quests are actually geared towards reminiscing on past episodes rather than building onto the new story. It isn’t a problem but I would have preferred to have seen the side quests add more new content into the new plot. You will also find references everywhere by picking them up as junk items or even simply having the references be a part of the actual world.The Stick Of Truth is a game which has plenty of replay value as well. My first play through took me about 16 hours to complete entirely. Every single quest was done. Now normally for an RPG I would expect a longer game but this one felt right being shorter. The game was extremely well written and was fully enjoyable and I think pushing it on longer may have actually hurt the game. Once you’ve completed the game you’ve still got three other classes to go back and play through, or you can go back as the same class and choose a different faction to side with which will change the story, though only slightly.Overall, South Park: The Stick Of Truth is a great game. It is the South Park game fan’s of the series have been waiting for. The fighting systems are well balanced and play smoothly, the cut scenes and voice acting feels straight out of the show and the story is one that is humorous and could only make sense in the world of South Park. South Park: The Stick Of Truth gets a 8.5/10.8.5/10PROS• Extremely entertaining story told with the exact feel of the South Park TV show• Open World with plenty of things to do when not completing the main quest line• Four different classes resulting in all different ways to play• Large assortment of different weapons and armors to choose from to truly customize your warriorCONS• Too many references to past South Park events -Not enough of the new story/plot• Short loading screens break up parts of the world			"

												Never before have I played such a vulgar and obscene game like South Park and i love it!This game is filled to the brim with references to the show, you name it, there's an easter egg for it.the humour is 10/10 unless you don't like mature (or immature, depending how you look at it) jokes, and let's face it, you'll get this game for the laughs, just make sure you try to get your hands on the uncensored version, cause that probe scene... But, other than humour there's also friends to make and nazi zombies to kill (or is it re-kill?). the only part of this hilarious RPG adventure that's lacking is the RPG part. It's a bit of a shame that the highest level is 14 and nothing much in terms of items. overall though, if you're a fan of the show well, you've probably bought the game by now, and if you don't mind the dirty jokes than it's still fun to explore the town of south park (and 16-bit canada).  but, i can't recomend this game if you hate South Park like hitler hated the jews. Can't wait for the sequel!			"

												This is not just a hilarious, high-quality South Park, but a great RPG as well. This game feels like a true part of South Park, bringing back great moments from the show's past as well as some ideas that are brand new to the game. Loved it, loved discovering everything I could about the game and the town.A huge recommendation for any South Park fan!			"

												TL,DR: A South Park fans must own. Everyone else, give it a play, most fun you'll probably have had since Blood Dragon.I've never, ever been a big proponent of DLC - let it be items like clothing, weapons or skins - but this is the first game that's left me wanting more to play with other than rerolling a new class after the final boss battle. A game that actually makes you want to buy the next adventure/side-mission pack for the game is faaaaaar to rare to come by these days. Yet in honesty, the sticker price for the game isn't worth the 60$ but I still found myself fulfilled with a great, fun time that made me feel like I was playing a South Park game set in South Park, unlike pretty much every South Park up until the release of SoT.The mechanic of mix-and-match flair with costumes is a great alternative to the often rigid armor and equipment set-ups for modern rpg/arpg's and the straight forward ""Yes, x item is better then y item"" interface that many modern RPG's have taken up is present and in place and keeps you playing the game then weighing stats.On the Kenny side of the tracks; the classes feel a bit on the 'samey' side, with little to differentiate them aside from their class names and spell animation flair. I played a Thief and rerolled to a mage after the final boss battle and found that he pretty much had the exact same starting abilities as my Thief: A stun and a dot - although their advancements do seperate them marginally, I think greater attention to how the classes could have been different really should be priority if there will be any additional content or sequels to the game. Old Mister Hat's to the RPG/ARPG genre should probably play it on the hardest difficulty if you're looking for a challange, otherwise the myriad of stuns you're afforded will make much of the game a cake walk. Upon retreving your first ranged weapon, you're able to stun a member of the enemies you'll be facing on the battle screen by shooting them from the overworld and hitting one of their buddies. They're stunned for a round or two, which buys you a lot of time to work with, in addition to the way speed is handled, you'll find it incredibly hard to die on the lowest difficulty.Which kinda brings me to my one major point: The game doesn't focus so much on being an RPG set in South Park but more as a South Park episode you get to be part of with it's 'magic', stylized turn-based combat and Matt Stone and Trey Parker humor that'll probably keep me coming back for more.

Im a big fan of South Park and I give it a 9.6/10, if you like South Park you actually have to own this game.

												This game is an absolute blast. It truly is like watching a really long South Park movie. If you're a casual fan of South Park or even simple RPG elements with poddy humor, this is for you, If you truly love South Park or have watched it since the early days, like myself, you will be pleasantly surprised at every turn as you explore the entire town of South Park. Simple things like looking through each of the four boy's closets. In Stan's closet, a certain someone doesn't want to come out. Down to the 'social media' type thing they have on there where the characters all post along with the continuation of the plot. For instance, I was pepper sprayed outside of Tokken's gated community and Cartman made a post laughing at my expense. Cartman also made a post about how I bought both DLC packs and his mom only let him buy one. It is truly hilarious and stays true to what South Park is at it's core. Cartman changing Tokken from a healer to a blacksmith because 'he just sees blacksmith when looking at Tokken' lol. These little things are what make the whole game for me. Paying $25 for a seemingly wasted nose job at Tom's Rhinoplasty, had a few citizens on the street remark, ""Have you had plastic surgery?"". These parts of the game truly make it feel alive and there are no shortage of side missions. For the first two hours or so I just found myself exploring the town and finding Chinpokemon as well as many many secrets and I know I've barely scratched the surface.			"

												The most awesome mediocre game I have ever played.The Awesome!It's South Park with no holding back.  This is an episode of South Park where nothing is sacred.  Even the sacred becomes defiled.  If you are a fan of the show you will love the game.  If you're not, I would stay far away from this game.The mediocre...The game itself seems boring.  I played it on Hard from the very beginning and was bored out of my mind with combat.  Combat was just an excuse to give you items to equip.  Completing quests gave you the majority of your experience and leveled you up.  Even the South Park characters complain about having to fight things that can't hurt you.  By the time I got to the end of the game, I was using everything I could to speed through combat.  The real action was outside of combat.  I was left wanting more out of my character.			"

												An incredibly funny, irreverent RPG which cheerfully plays with and mocks standardized RPG elements with South Park's typical humor. While it may seem simplistic on the surface, the battle system still left me coming back for more, especially with the humor and charm attached to the various abilities of the characters (Magic is Farting. What else do we need?) The writing and dialogue of the character is where the game shines the most to me, as I enjoyed the character's interactions, and, moreso, how horrible and funny they were to one another. Warning though, this game is not for the faint of heart or easily offended, as some content can be VERY disturbing. If you can stomach it though, I'd heartily recommend playing through this delightful satire of an RPG.			"

Gameplay is quick to pick up and enjoy. Replayability is a bit limited, with the exception for achievements. Overall presentation and execution of the game are spot-on. I hope that some DLC is in the works for this games future, few areas that could be used to explore and expand on an already great game.I Highly recommend playing this great title today!			"

												Hands down one thee funniest, and most obscene game's I ever played. If you are a fan of south park you will love this game ( if not you might think what a silly game ). its just like playing an episode of south park. While the game is very good and entertaining I have a few complaints, #1 problem There is no real replay value to it. sure you can backtrack through the game but that seems more like a chore then fun and not very rewarding (except if you liek achievements but who cares about those). The fights are way to easy even on hardcore difficulty, if you are a gamer play this on hardcore dificulity, not like it matters you will mow through everything anyways. And the whole backtracking through previous explored areas to use ability's you newly acquire is lazy and doesnt feel worth it imo, the game is WAY TO SHORT. and the fights are WAY TO EASY, to few quest and the game is very small not worth the $40 tag on it now. those are the few complaints i have But this is still a great game. Got it on sale ($13) and glad i did cause i don't think i would have been to happy paying full price for this id value this game at max $30. MUST PLAY!!!!!  7/10			"

												Some of the best 11 hours of my life. I'm not even done with the game yet (I plan to do all the sidequests. I completed the main story, and I thought it was hilarious all the way through.)I can't think of anything bad about this game. I've been a longtime fan of South Park. I love the show, and playing this was my first experience with their games (I hear the others are really bad but, I don't know first hand). I laughed all the way through, I thought the gameplay was amazing, and it was great. Normally I hate turn-based games, with few exceptions like Pokemon or old Final Fantasy or Paper Mario. This game actually brought me a feeling of nostalgia, not just because I watched South Park throughout my life, but the nostalgia of using the turn-based system that's comparable to Paper Mario. Take the combat of Paper Mario, and the ridiculousness and humor of South Park, and you've got an amazing game.10/10 would go to Ottawa again.			"

												A word of caution: if you're the sort of person who gets offended (not 'easily offended'; any kind of offended) stay well away. The only thing that could make this game more offensive is if they added the Prophet Muhammed. (Hopefully there'll be a DLC.)This game is basically one long, awesome episode of South Park. I can't remember the last time I played a game where I laughed out loud so frequently. Every time you think you've got used to the surreal story the game throws something even stranger at you... by the end you won't even think Nazi zombie cows are that weird compared to some of the stuff you get up to.I wouldn't say a knowledge of South Park is essential (I haven't watched it in years and was surprised how many references I still got) but fans of the show will be beside themselves with glee playing this. It's a genuinely enjoyable RPG made by a great team. I wouldn't say any game is worth £40, but add it to your wishlist and wait for a Steam sale or the price to drop because this game is worth your time.PS - Don't bother with the DLC, it's just costumes (which the game has an abundance of)PPS - At the time of writing there's a typo in the combat prompts.

I loved how everything in the game stayed true to the television series, even making the player feel like they were in the show.  Being a fan of South Park for a while I found joy in every reference and character they brought from the series.  I couldn't help but laugh and smile through pretty much the entire game.

												They nailed the feel of the show and made combat more interesting that Click And Wait/Take Turns. I can't see why someone who doesn't like South Park would even bother with the game, if you're not a fan of the show there is nothing here for you. If you can get with the humor and style, i.e. LOVE the show, this game is a must. It's a parody of Old Skool style RPGs while still managing to be it's own game. Every piece of Junk Loot in the game is a show reference, the gear is creative and fun, they inventory/Friends system is perfect. I have been lucky and not seen any of the bigs that supposedly exist, so I can't say anything bad about the game. I have seen small graphic bumps here and there, but the game itself is exactly what I hoped it would be. I can't say enough how it FEELS like you are in South Park and the voices and writing are dead on. This really is the South park game that I have been waiting for. Great work!! "

												This game is truly astounding because you truly feel like you're inside of South Park participating in an epic tale of becoming cool in the suburban Colorado town. The visuals are top notch and it looks even better than episodes of the show.The combat is fluid, never dull and has just the right amount of difficulty that keeps you interested in the game, and if it feels too easy or hard you can change the difficultyon the fly allowing for a better user experience. There are also endless  character / weapon / armor customization options that can change the way you play the game making sure that there is never a dull moment.The game is a moderate length, on my first playthrough as a Thief I put about 18 hours into game, but it's jam packed with references, side quests, and jokes that are good enough to keep you laughing throughout the whole game. The only downsides to the game are the max level capping out at 15 and how you just never want the game to come to an end even when you know that you're playing it's final moments. (The level cap could easily be raised through dlc so it's not really a big deal and you don't hit that level until you're near the last stretch of the game anyway.)South Park: The Stick of Truth is truly an experience that is well worth the money and well worth your attention and time. I can't wait for dlc, and to start my next playthrough as a mage. I give South Park The Stick of Truth a 10/10.			"

												First off, the game is incredibly short. Probably 10 hours if you don't really explore. It also is pretty easy. The most challenge aspect is the QTE events thrown in to spice up a decade old style of gameplay. What you really get with this game is story and visuals. It's more like an episode that never would have been released on air or even in theaters. Most of all, it combines the absurdity of early South Park episodes with the more realistic styling and current pop-culture references. It's one of the most shocking and hilarious games I've ever played. It would clearly be one of the top episodes of the show if it was an episode. But that's really what the game is, an interactive episode. So you'd have to be at least open to South Park to enjoy the game. If you hate South Park, don't expect anything different. If fact, the game probably worse.Secondly is the exploration. While the game is not huge, it does offer a lot of searching and traveling. Lots of hidden references. I was originally worried about this because early gameplay videos kind of pointed everything out. The game seemed to reference South Park episodes for the sake of referencing them, which really sucks. But most of that is background stuff that is easily missed. It does feel like some things were shifted during development and if you have been following everything about the game you'll probably catch some of it. While I would recommend this game, unless you pre-ordered or can absolutely stay away from spoilers, it's probably not worth the release price. A quick hop onto YouTube could spoil most of the surprise and ruin the majority of the game. But that may also force you to buy the game because most of the 'Let's Play' videos are being played by idiots. I personally had to stop some of the early videos because the player didn't seem to know what they were doing and wouldn't shut the hell up. But the game would be a great game to play with friends in the room. But actually in the room where they can rip on you for sucking.So you can get a good price, are a fan of crude and shocking humor, and looking for some quick fun; pick it up. But if you’re looking for some epic game with hours of intense gameplay, look elsewhere. "

												In general, this is a pretty great game. It is the best South Park game, for sure.I might pick a few nits and say the controls feel clunky/slow, or that the story is basically a greatest hits riff so far (which is hard to complain about) but it does feel like you are controlling an episode, and that's a helluva thing. Hella sweet. Hella hella hella.This game will make you fear hobos tho (or fear them more if you're already a hobophobe.) Only fight I've backed down from so far was a hidden hobo camp.I hope they make a sequel with more original elements, but any videogame with Randy Marsh is good by me. Keeeeyaaaa!			"

												Such a Great game. Pros: The gameplay is just simply brilliant, everything you'd imagine from South Park has been delved into this game. I enjoyed the combat system, it was a unique turn base system. The crude humor also made it fun.Cons: No replay ability, forgetting 2 chimpokomon really frustrates you when you beat the game and can't go back and get it. I wish that this game had a new game +, or at least some more end game side quests.I basically did all the side quests while doing the main storyline. I also didn't like how there was no one to fight with towards the end of the game. Other than that, if you can get this game for cheap, I say buy it my reason is because it doesn't have much of a replaybility as one would expect, but one play through is more than enough, unless you want all of the achievements.

												I've been playing this game for a few hours now (4 or 5, I think) and just when I thought I was about to beat it and be disappointed in a short game, this game ripped me a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not even close to being exclusively what you thought it would be. (A LoTR style story)I'm not sure pre-ordering it was as beneficial as I would have liked, because your clothes and armor stats are dependent on your level. That said, I did the first story mission and before I reached Token I ♥♥♥♥ed around town doing side missions and leveled up before getting back into the story missions. Don't do that. Cartman leveled me up and gave me items as a story quest reward, but the rewards were level 3 and I was already a level 5. Now it seems the extra outfits that came with the pre-order don't suit me anymore because I got them at Level 2, and I'm now level 5-6 so their stats aren't up to par with what I've unlocked. They don't seem to be any more beneficial than the ones I acquire throughout the game. Leveling up does take some time unless you fight and defeat every single group of enemies you see as you walk through town.The battling took me a few minutes to get used to because timing is everything. You're required to pay close attention to a ""sparkle"" on your weapon in order to inflict the most damage. It took me a few tries to get the timing down but I finally did. Some people may have a problem with certain instructions showing up on the bottom of the screen for certain abilities but I am so glad they're there because remembering every combination for every ability would not be easy for me.The explorer in me loves the environment. I have so much fun shooting everything with arrows, collecting Chinpokomon and the different outfits/make-up/hair/dyes! This is the only thing keeping me from being bummed out about playing a male-only character. I understand it was needed for the story line, as well as not being able to choose your own name, but I have collected enough girly-looking items that I am still happy with how I can customize my character! Overall I look forward to seeing what else this game is going to throw at me, and judging by the acheivements I see I'll have to restart in order to get a few of them. I'm glad I bought this but pre-ordering didn't seem to make much of a difference early on in the game. I'm also hoping that selling all that junk I collected around town won't bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥later on...			"

												Who played it? What did everyone think. I just beat it and I know it is not even out everywhere in the world yet. I give it an 8.7 out of 10. I do this because I both love South Park, and turn based RPG's. It was really up my alley. This is the first time in a long time that I have enjoyed playing every minute of a game up until the very end.... Which brings me to the only downside... I have 12 hours played and I beat it. Now I know there is likely another 3 or 4 hours of side content in there... But I am max level... I have the best equipment... I can run around looking behind buildings and getting lost in the sewers trying to collect every last friend and chimpokemon (Spelling pending) but I just do not find joy in that. The other issue being it is a 60$ game... It is very hard to justify that price tag when Skyrim is sitting at the same for literally unlimited content... Not saying they are comparable genre wise really. I am just noting total play hours.( Do not get too hung up on why Skyrim is completely unlike SP, I know; thanks.) Do not focus on that negative part of the review though. The whole thing was hilarious as one would expect. I was worried it would be funny in the beginning and then trail off and I must say I think it was a snowball getting funnier and funnier until the very last moment.BUY IT!-Russell Lowman			"

												Perhaps the greatest South Park game ever created. The combat system is traditional turn-based RPG which I love very much. The graphics are classic South Park style. The whole town of South Park you know and love from the show is explorable, including good ol' Canada. Now to the negatives: For one, this game is very short for the price tag $59.99, and to my experience has very little replayability considering there's only one choice for each quest/situation. There is some in poor taste jokes thrown in, but considering it's South Park, it's nothing new. Another peeve I have is that there's no difficulty option, so depending how thorough you are, the game will become extremely easy in the mid-late stages of the game. Overall, I would recommend this game as a definite buy for South Park fans. However, to traditional RPG lovers, this game is not for you for the obvious reasons stated above. Overall great game. It's ultimately up to you.			"

												If you are a South Park fan and wondering if you should play in this RPG game, then yes! Do it! It's like a 12 hour long interactive episode where you get to fight, fart, probe and shoot your way through your missions, theres even fun mini games where you probe someone :) Need more reasons? Theres also many non mandatory funny side quests that you can do! Theres also tons of references all over the game from the episodes in the TV show. Btw, if you do buy this game. Look forward to Canada :)			"

												Considering this is the type of game that's based off a tv show/movie/series/etc. I didn't really have high hopes for the game, but it went on sale and I'd heard people say good things about it so I gave it a go.  I was incredibly impressed!  They did a very good job with this game.  It really has the feel as if you are interacting with the town and characters in the world of South Park.  It gives the feeling of being in an explorable and interactive movie. If you are a fan of the South Park series and/or RPGs I would highly suggest this game.  The game wasn't too hard, but it was a fun adventure.			"

												A must-own game for any fan of the South Park franchise. Thankfully, the South Park co-creators, Matt and Trey, were closely involved in the storyboarding and plot of South Park: The Stick of Truth, so the humor that we have come to know and love from the series is delivered perfectly. One of the greatest achievements of The Stick of Truth is its ability to immerse the player in the South Park universe. To put it plainly: The Stick of Truth achieves greatness by it's ability to stay faithful to the original TV show while providing players with an interesting story and satisfying gameplay to boot. Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (but still satisfying), but that is more a fault on the genre. The game is a 2-D turn-based RPG, so most combat sequences will follow a similar pattern, with some variation in strategy from one character to the next. I liked it enough to play through twice.			"

												WARNING: Extremely lude with graphic sex, nudity, violence, language, situations, etc... Matt and Trey really went over the top. Highly halarious, this game touches back on past episodes while keeping it fresh. You'll see references to your favorite episodes  everwhere and wait till you go to Canada. Combat is turned based, and things you do before battle can effect it, such as premptive strikes, farting on enemies, and dropping objects from the environment on foes. Its a spin on classic RPGs.Pick from four classes: Fighter, Mage, Thief, and Jew.   Fighters take a lot of damage and cause a lot of effects. Mages cause a lot of damage with their homemade fireworks.  I haven't tried the other two classes yet. No matter the class, usually gear isn't class restricted!You are the Dragonborn.  You learn the way of controlling your second mouth, your butt, to use farts (not shouts). Learn from Eric Cartman and other masters of the way of the butt. Summon South Park citizens to fight for you, like Mister Hanky and Mister Slave. Experience an epic medieval journey in South Park through the eyes of a child for the Stick of Truth; while fighting aliens, nazi zombies and homeless people. Its a game that very well could be game of the year, if it wasn't so controversial.			"

But this was exceptional on all levels. If you are a fan of South Park you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game. The exceptional amount of lore that South Park brings to the table makes world creation so easy that even the peices of vendor trash are rife with in-jokes. I found the combat to be rather too easy, but there were times when I had to figure out how to kill specific enemies. 10/10			"

												If you like South Park you'll like this game. Not crazy for turn based RPG's but this is a pretty simple formula that keeps it fun and engaging with humor and some timed attacks/defences during turns. You don't have to grind at all, and even leveling is very simple and fast. Theres not much for branching paths so your choice of faction does not amount to much but a few cutscenes and dialogue. Not much in the way of replay value but it was still worth the sale price of $14. Pick it up on the next sale if you were on the fence, you'll have some fun.			"

												Despite going through developement Hell, South Park the Stick of Truth turned out to be a really enjoyable RPG. In fact, it turned out to be one of the best video game adaptations of a tv show i've ever seen. Ubisoft, Tray Parker, and Matt Stone took their sweet time and made the necessary delays to make sure that the game was something they'd enjoy playing, and it's all the more better for that.The game itself is an RPG with turn based combat where you still have to counter and block moves yourself. I liked the combat and didn't get sick of it throughout the game.As for graphics, the games visuals are incredibly true to the show. It feels exactly like playing in a feature length episode of South Park. As far as story and humor goes, expect the same quality you would of the current season. However, there's plenty of stuff in there for new and old South Park fans alike. South Park: The Stick of Truth does not pull any punches, it seems that they went out of their way to be as controversial as humanly possible. I don't think i've ever seen so many♥♥♥♥♥♥and fart jokes in a single game. I think it's safe to say that if ever you liked South Park, or any of Matt and Tray's humor that there is something in this game that you will defenitely find very amusing since they worked very close with the developers during the creation process. I defenitely got a few good laughs out of it myself, however the fart jokes, which are the biggest focus on the game, got a bit repetitive over time.The biggest gripe I had with this game were the tutorials. When they were porting the game over to PC, this had to be a huge oversight. I dreaded having to do any tutorials, on the PC version you do what they tell you to do, but you can tell that what they were doing was meant for a gamepad or controller. So using a mouse and keyboard proved to be crazy difficult and frustrating. Despite this however, I enjoyed the game and most of the content therein.Final Verdict: (4.2 out of 5)			"

As an aside I feel Squaresoft could take note that turn based RPG does not have to equal stodge!40 pounds could seem somewhat steep for what is about 17 hours of gameplay but I would definitely recommend SP TSOT on sale for fans of South Park.

												If you are a fan of Paper Mario, South Park Stick of Truth is the game for you. It has the same wacky turn based combat of paper mario, and due to the 2D paper characters of southpark, it feels similar there as well. That being said, this is much more vulgar than any nintendo game! Some of the levels are downright disgusting in a hilariously awesome way.  I'm looking at doing a replay, because the graphical requirements are extremely low and I think it would be fun on my surface PRO (which runs it very well).  The humor is southpark quality, and unlike other crappy southpark games of the N64 era, this wans't outsourced. Matt and Trey worked on it themselves, and they insisted that it meet certain quality standards. They also refused to let the publisher (ubisoft) include uplay in the steam version.

My only sinking worry is that, at 19-ish hours of gameplay, my time might be over soon, as the escalation of zany happennings appears to have ceased.

												Absolutely full of classic South Park humour that we've all come to know and love from subtle references to past episodes to straight up in your face crudeness.  Fight alongside all your favourite characters in an epic-battle to save to world.  I absolutely loved every minute of it.That said, there are some downsides:- There isn't much replayability.  The storyline is fairly linear and the choice of class doesn't seem to make much difference, apart from some minor dialog differences.  - The single-player campaign, excluding side quests, is quite short.- You can only play as a male character (although the reasons become evident during the story) which may be a turn off to some.As such, anyone who is not a die-hard South Park fan and just looking for a decent RPG should probably wait for a steam sale.

												*There once was a maiden from Stoneberry Hollow**She didn't talk much but she sure like'd to swallow**I had a lance that she sat upon**The maiden from Stoneberry who was also...your mum*Just had to throw this in there first, because EVERY time I hear this in-game it sends me into hysterics.This review is designed to get the people who are questioning whether to buy it or not...to JUST BUY IT! So if you're ""um""ing and ""ah""ing about it, sorry but I have been sent here to destroy you!Firstly, if you've been a fan of the show since epsiode 1, there is not a chance that you're not going to enjoy this game. From Visitors, to Underpants Gnomes, to ManBearPig...this game has all the best nostalgic references from the show done in a completely new light. You've probably heard that this game is basically an extra season of the show, which is accurate. Except being a game it is uncensored and they were able to take it to new places. What's even better is that it is in RPG format and you create your own character that is assimilated into the game as the new kid (your character never speaks but the other characters make jokes about it). You always have a buddy with you through out the game, you can change your buddy at any time but have to unlock them first & they join you in battle. Once all unlocked you can choose from Butters, Jimmy, Kenny, Stan, Kyle or Cartman (I personally don't think they could have chosen better for the buddies, pretty much my 6 favourite characters, and I won't give away what classes they are because some of them are just hilariously suiting). My final broad description of the game is this: picture a fantasy RPG done from the perspective of the collective imaginations' of the boys (eg, when Cartman cast Ice Storm, he just runs out of screen, then runs back in with a cooler full of icy water and throws it on you!) It's funny stuff, and there are plenty others.It has been said that the combat gets repetitive, but if you are a avid fan of the show & a patient sort of person I don't find this to be the case. There are 4 classes to play as well so surely each of them are different enough to want to explore. The enemies that you face are hilarious in their own right, and side-splitting dialogue is exchanged during battle (eg, Al Gore summons the Secret Service, 4 armed guys in black suits rock up and say ""C'mon, protect the kinda ex-Vice President, kinda...""). All the hilarious familiar faces of South Park make an appearance, and yes you don't even need to ask, Randy is hilarious as always and is involved in a few of the quests that you do. Oh, and in case this is your first window into the game and you HAVEN'T watched any trailers...the game is done in the same animation as the show, so you can't really feel any more like you're engrossed in this quiet little mountain town.I could keep going all day, but perhaps I should just leave it there and say this...If you are a fan of the show, BUY THIS GAME! No chance of regrets. If you aren't a fan of the show, you will still find it funny & enjoy the combat and story etc, but won't understand any of the references from past episodes or dynamics between the characters for that matter. There is a reason this game won so many awards! It is awsome. And with a sequel on the way...I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next			"

												This game is great. Overpriced, but great.For starters, the game is a typical RPG that everyone knows. I would say 2-D, but that is a little misleading. Some real good points of the game are: [SPOILERS]  Interactive environment.  Finding Jesus (and having him shoot your enemies away)  Building another Facebook friends list.  Replayability. (Try all four classes, they're all good in their own way.)  Making fun of Al Gore. I'm super cereal.  Nazi Zombies. Damnit, I thought those died in 2008!  Having Mr. Hankey♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your enemies.  Performing abortions on a... man?  Going up a gay man's♥♥♥♥♥  Fighting an apparition of a sparrow.  PRINCESSU KENNY!  Farting on your enemies to kill them. Only in South Park, ladies and gents.  Watching your parents have sex while fighting Underpants Gnomes.  REFERENCES EVERYWHERE.  Kicking people in the balls.  Did I mention you fight people, too?Wow, what a list. If you are still awake, go buy it now and play it. Or not... that- that's cool too... "

												South Park The Stick ofTruth is a hillarious game overfilled with comedy from begining to end. What I love the most with this game is all the hidden ""jewels"". There's a lot of parodies of other games and real life companies and public people. The game often provides you with several ways of solving a riddle, which is something I highly appreciate. It's also important to always keep your eyes open, or you'll easily miss a chinpokomon, and you do want to catch 'em all. ;-)  "

												Overall the game was enjoyable to play and was what one would come to exapct with the southpark brand. The whole thing looks and feels as if you were taking part in an extended episode. The combat however follows the JRPG style which means after a while it becomes a repetitive chore if you do not like that sort of thing.Fortunatly there are options in the game world to use the environment and avoid combat plus a few abilities that essentianlly give an auto win making it a bit more bearable.There have been some comments about value for money being sub par but I would tend to disgaree. The comments suggest there is too little content and it is too short. I feel this is an apple to oranges comparsion since the content in this game is highly polished with high quality voice acting and side quests that are interesting and entertaining. I would much prefer that to 100 hours of fetch quests and tedious travelling that seem to serve no purpose other than to drag the game out.			"

												Do you like fishsticks?Then you'll probably like this game.It may not be the most original RPG out there and a lot of people disdain turn-based battles on a computer game nowadays but everything is well done in this game.You should ""feel"" the story of the game, in the sense that while you can see the epic and the fantastic, in the meantime it's clear that everything is just some made up game by silly kids in a remote mountain town just playing around. It's very easy to feel inside the show and there's even some kind of filter for the cutscenes that makes it seem like a movie file and not an in-game scene so you can feel like your character is in fact in a South Park episode.You will enter the show.Be a character, play your role.And be insulted and insult someone else.If you like the show it won't disappoint you.

												It's like playing an episode of South Park, with all the creative talent and humor of the original show. It has countless references to old episodes, and you can tell effort went into this game in at all levels; writing, programming, and producing. My only complaint is its length, (can't talk about South Park without a♥♥♥♥♥♥joke), it's a bit pricy for how long the game is. If its on sale for ant percent off I'd say give it a shot if you like the show.			"

												When I was just a young'n I craved the vulgar antics of the South Park cartoon, but was (sadly or thankfully, depending on your perspective) forbidden from watching the show.  My dad even went as far as putting a password on Comedy Central, preventing me from sneaking a viewing without their knowledge.  I finally got some of the first episodes under my belt at a friend's birthday party.  They were shoddy VHS recordings from the live airings playing on a TV the size of a Triscuit but I was hooked.  Come High School I reignited the passion and ended up watching all of the back-episodes when SouthParkStudios.com first launched, and I have kept up ever since.Why the backstory?  I like to provide a sense of context when giving my take on tie-in games like this, since I feel that having intimate knowledge of the show really helps take this game the extra mile.  If you're a South Park fan, you could probably get through the entire game without even caring one way or the other about the gameplay, and just letting all of the show-like elements carry the game for you.  The game is positively oozing with references to the show that devout viewers like myself will appreciate.  Dialog, props, and cameos scatter the sand-box-ish town, all giving nods to famous and obscure moments alike from the show's long legacy.  My biggest woe about the game is how now when I watch the show, I picture everything in reference to where it appears on the map in the game.  It's kind of like when you read a book and then a movie for that book comes out and it spoils your imagination's idea of what that character looked like.  That being said, pretty much every major location in the show (at least within the inner-confines of the town-proper) is on the map and visitable.  You can wander around at your leisure or use fast travel to quickly reach the other side of the map.  The city exploration is kind of like a top down RPG, but from a side scrollers prespective (but you can still move in all four directions to explore, kind of like Pokemon, just not totally top-down).  These sequences are busted up by plenty of awesome cut scenes that play out just like the animation of the show, as well as combat sequences.Combat takes on the form of random encounters with enemy groups throughout the map (though you can usually avoid these as you can see them when you enter that area of the map) with a dash of unavoidable fights for the main story and certain side quests.  Combat is turn based, with some rhythm game like timing mechanics for nailing perfect hits on certain moves.  Your moveset is determined by your character's class (which you choose at the start), with stats determined by your level and current equipment set.  Aside from traditional RPG elements like weapon, armor, helmet, etc.  There are also patches you can apply to your individual equipment pieces to modify their stats.  Getting the timing right to land certain special moves can be a bit tedious, but by the end of the game you'll more than likely be in step.As much as I love this game, the show part completely dominates the gameplay part for me.  If you even remotely appreciate the work of Stone and Parker pick this up.  However, if this would be set to be your first South Park experience, you might want to wait until you figure out if you find the show pallatable and build up a better working knowledge of the show's special brand of socially-aware humor.  All that being said, I cannot wait for the sequel!			"

												A game for the ages. No, seriously. Although hard-core South Park fans may be disappointed by the lack of 'topical' cntent, the show's humor and skewed take on life clearly shows in the writing, the gags, and the hundreds of in-jokes that cover all of the seasons to date. There are so many easter eggs and references that it will drive me, a 100% completionist, to absolute distraction. So, let's break down the gameplay:Controls: easy, but somewhat non-intuitive when it comes down to the puzzle-solving aspects. As you gain levels and special powers, keeping their effects straight may get wearisome. Fortunately, the pause menu tutorials are well-written and easy to understand.Combat: Moderate, depending on difficulty. There is a level of strategy involved between item management, special attack and buff/debuff parameters to keep min-maxers on the boards for a year. The basics are very intuitive and are well described during the tutorials, so I won't go into detail. Putting together effects management and planning for the next 3 turns of battle becomes essential during some of the boss fights.Visuals/sound: Perfect. Captures both the visual effects and 'feel' of the show from the get-go, including character creation. Putting together my own paper doll to play the game with was one of the most enjoyable experiences, as a gamer and long-time fan of the show. Trey and Matt of course do the voice acting and it really feels like you're playing an episode. Even the grinding/exploration has just enough interjections from your AI companion to remind you you're supposed to be doing something on the main quest, without getting overly annoying.RPG/customization elements: So simple they're frightening in their complexity. The amounts of perks/abilities and weapon/armor customizations run into the hundreds by the time you've completed your first series of main story quests. The ability to mod your weapons/armor perks just before a battle are going to fuel hours of debate between gamers of all stripes.Fun level: 5 stars. The most subjective of all categories, I can't wait to finish my first run-through and try it all again with a new character build.			"

												Fantastic game. I'm a fan of South Park, so obviously I'm biased in that regard to be someone who enjoys the story and comedy - a good balance of 'smart' and 'toilet' humour. I didn't expect much from a 'licensed game' (I've been watching South Park for nearly 20 years now, and there have been some pretty terrible games) but playing through this felt like participating in an episode. The animation style, voice timing and plot were spot on, to the point where this could easily have been one of South Park's 3-episode arc stories like Imaginationland.The actual gameplay mechanics are simple enough. Some of the 'puzzles' do require a bit of thought (admittedly, not much), so it's not just walk, walk, cutscene, fight, walk, walk. The RPG elements - equipment, levels, turn-based fights - are played with a little bit, it's not usually my cup of tea but introducing some of the South Park 'lore' meant that spamming magic attacks didn't boring.The graphics are brilliant, not because they're photorealistic wonders, but because it matches exactly how an episode of South Park looks. There's a point where you walk past the familiar South Park sign and it's 'photorealistic' to anyone familiar with the (modern) intro to the show. I played with a relatively old graphics card and had no trouble.I played with the Steam Controller, using one of the community configurations. It felt natural and the only issue I had was having to move the cursor out of the way at the start with the mouse so that it didn't just sit in the middle of the screen - the rest of the game doesn't use the cursor.Value-wise, I got this game from the Humble Monthly Bundle, so there wasn't a set price tag. However, even if the only game I got for that $10 was Stick of Truth, I got ~20 enjoyable hours from this on my first play through, which even as someone with thousands of hours in other 'replayable' games is good value for me.  For the completionist, there are dozens of achievements that are not 'automatic' so playing through it again with a differemt play style would be rewarding, if that was your cup of tea. I don't often replay 'story' games but I might give this a another go some day.The real entertainment here is in the story and exploring the town of South Park, so if you dislike South Park, you won't get much from the game itself. If you do like South Park, this will probably be the best South Park game you ever play.			"

												Fans of the show will fall in love with this game. If you aren't a fan of the show and love obscene humor and pop culture references, you will still find a great deal of enjoyment. The entire world of South Park is brought to life in this beautiful rendition mimicking the exact art style of the show. The game feels like an entire season of south park dedicated to a singular plot. The only shallow part of the game is the combat, which is definitely very basic and could be improved upon in the upcoming sequel.9/10 as a show fan.			"

												The game is short but fun and easy for someone who doesn't play Rpgs but can be made harder for someone who loves a Great Rpg.  The game keeps to the southpark universe and is funny and crude the way you exspcet southpark to be.  I love this game well worth the buy.			"

												This is a very enjoyable game that greatly mimics the style used in the cartoon. You'll really feel like you're playing in the South Park universe. If you like South Park, you'll like this game. The battle mechanics are based on pressing the right button at the right time. Requires very fast reaction at times, but in general it's pretty easy. It reminds me of the old Super Mario RPG for the SNES.It doesn't have great replay value, since the most interesting part is watching the story unfold, though there are plenty of missable collectables, so if you're an achievement hoarder like me, expect to spend at least 15 hours playing it.

												I am a firm believer in the rule that “All games based on movie or TV licenses suck until proven otherwise.” That rule has served me well and is almost always right. Well, here’s one case it is wrong. This game is great. It is well done, funny, has good mechanics, and most importantly is fun to play.If you are a South Park fan, this is a must buy as it really is very much like “playing an episode.” The art style, voice acting, humour, all are dead on. You’ll enjoy it thoroughly.If you are not a South Park fan, I’d still recommend it if you like RPGs as it is a fairly competent one. The mechanics are good and it is a pleasure to play. The only issue would be if the crass humour offends you. So long as you are ok with that, I think you’ll find it an enjoyable RPG. "

												If you are a South Park fan (you can take a hint by my avatar) you have to play this game. Because of its art style being similar to the TV series, it feels like a big and funny episode of this great series. What is so good about it is that you will feel like you are in South Park and you will be able to explore the city at its fullest with your friends and fart on everyone.The one thing I don't like about it is that its replay value is not appealing. Sure, you can go with other classes and such, but the first experience will never be achieved again. The end-game content is next to nothing.Parker and Stone did not let me down. You must get it.

												BUY IT. Although I wouldn't pay full 30 (euros), get it on sale and it's definitely worth it. Took me 19hours for main story and lots of exploration, but I still have other quests to do and achievements to get. I am not a big fan of the TV show, but the humour fits really well into the game, even though I don't always like it on the show. Great game because it doesn't get boring, I could play for hours without wanting to switch to a different game (I feel like that a lot with others) just get it on sale because there isn't really enough playtime for the full price.

												Suprisingly excellent with little room to complain if you're a fan of both South Park and RPGs. The humor is right up there with some of South Park's finest in recent years (though with a heavy reliance on referencing gags from the show at times), and the gameplay is thankfully engaging in its simplicity--not unlike the Paper Mario series. The action can become a bit repetitive towards the end game, but it's forgivable. Fans of the show should definitely give this a pick up, but anyone who hates South Park will not find their feelings changed here. It's still irreverent as hell. I mean, you can get an achievement for farting on a dead nazi zombie fetus.			"

												Very fun game, it is basically a running version of the TV show starting from the very beginning to now. Tons of little Easter eggs for the avid show fan to the casual gamer to enjoy.  I dislike the combat system though, which is 75% of this game.  Learning new moves/weapons can take a few attempts sometimes leaving you vulnerable to missing a turn entirely.  Basically it's wait for something shiny, hit a button, hope you master it quickly.  Still very enjoyable considering I don't play RPG's... Nothing about this game is difficult, your inventory has no limits, you pick up everything you can with zero consequence, buy anything you need, sell anything you don't. Considering I purchased 2 copies for 15 bucks, I'd say I'm super happy!			"

												First off, this game is perfect. It can't be made better. 2nd, there's no Towelie in it, so its only sub-perfect. Its short (I had a pretty thorough run at 14 hours), pricey, and had some bugs which I didn't seem to run into in the steam version, so I guess that's fine. In spite of that, this is exactly what I want out of a South Park game, and probably the best game ever made based on a tv show.On the DLC though: I'd skip it. Its some good low level gear, but you'll grow out of it pretty quickly.			"

												I have played and completed the console version of this game and have re-bought it for my laptop here's why.South Park The Stick of Truth is a love letter to fans of the show. The game is light hearted and stays true to all the characters within the show and would keep anyone laughing throughout the entire approx 15hr story! The gameplay is simple and easy to come to terms with but combat is very repetitve. It has tons of customisation options for the character class of your choosing whether its clothing, melee or ranged weaponary and there is tons of loot to collect. However once you finished the story there's not much you can do after you finished the game. Huge fan of the show then? Then i highly recommend that you pick this up and to new people to the franchise if you see this game on sale then you should definitely pick this up and give it a try!

												Let me start by saying that i do not watch South Park avidly but i feel i have to write a review about this awesome mind ♥♥♥♥ game. I loved it. This game gave me the most WTF moments in my life. I was always like, "" No they didnt!"", "" Holy f***ing♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and rest of it was always full of giggles or laughs.I am not gonna go deep in class mechanics or fights or etc. Even if you are a player like me who doesnt watch South Park, i can guarantee you, you will enjoy your time in this bloody South Park universe.I have finished the story but i am gonna give another go because i just cant get enough!

												Give this game 2 hours of your time and you will be hooked. Great turn based RPG with comedy throughout the excellent voice acting. Timed hits, weapon socketing and swappable teammates all make this a really enjoyable game. Story moves fast and no level grinding are a refreshing change from traditional jrpgs.There are 2 or 3 parts I have encountered where a new gameplay element is introduced and it does a poor job explaining, if it even tried at all. Small oversight but it kills the pace of the game and mabey even cause you to never continue.One of the best games on steam and top 3 funniest.			"

												Despite going through developement Hell, South Park the Stick of Truth turned out to be a really enjoyable RPG. In fact, it turned out to be one of the best video game adaptations of a tv show i've ever seen. Ubisoft, Tray Parker, and Matt Stone took their sweet time and made the necessary delays to make sure that the game was something they'd enjoy playing, and it's all the more better for that.The game itself is an RPG with turn based combat where you still have to counter and block moves yourself. I liked the combat and didn't get sick of it throughout the game.As for graphics, the games visuals are incredibly true to the show. It feels exactly like playing in a feature length episode of South Park. As far as story and humor goes, expect the same quality you would of the current season. However, there's plenty of stuff in there for new and old South Park fans alike. South Park: The Stick of Truth does not pull any punches, it seems that they went out of their way to be as controversial as humanly possible. I don't think i've ever seen so many♥♥♥♥♥♥and fart jokes in a single game. I think it's safe to say that if ever you liked South Park, or any of Matt and Tray's humor that there is something in this game that you will defenitely find very amusing since they worked very close with the developers during the creation process. I defenitely got a few good laughs out of it myself, however the fart jokes, which are the biggest focus on the game, got a bit repetitive over time.The biggest gripe I had with this game were the tutorials. When they were porting the game over to PC, this had to be a huge oversight. I dreaded having to do any tutorials, on the PC version you do what they tell you to do, but you can tell that what they were doing was meant for a gamepad or controller. So using a mouse and keyboard proved to be crazy difficult and frustrating. Despite this however, I enjoyed the game and most of the content therein.Final Verdict: (4.2 out of 5)			"

												South Park: The Stick of Truth is a prime example of how games that are based around a non-game IP should be done as it accurately captures the essence of the show whilst remaining a solid experience in its own right. The RPG gameplay is fantastic, taking the tried and true styles that were made famous by the Final Fantasy series and reworking them into the South Park world. The story is witty, funny and satisfying, a true testament to the writing talents of the South Park studios. Honestly I went into this game with the lowest of expectations only to have them completely blown away, something that rarely happens these days. For anyone who’s a fan of this show and feels like an 11 hour, self directed episode would be up their alley then South Park; The Stick of Truth is for you.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/04/25/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-save-us-sir-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ "

												I bought this game when it was on sale, absolutely no regret. Everyone I know whines about the combat system and stuff but I kinda like it. It's not too difficult or complex and allows for experimenting. Gameplay is smooth and hilarious. Only thing that bothered me was that the sound acted odd sometimes and it was running ahead of the screen during cutscenes most of the time (probably just because of my bad pc though). I finished the game once on thief, my next goals: all the achievements, finish on all classes, find all the loot, find all the secrets, etc. I'll be busy for a while. I'm already struggling with the 'leave no kid behind' achievement :D "

												Worth playing if you've ever laughed at a South Park joke. I haven't seen every episode (I'd say I've seen roughly half of the series), so there some references that left me wondering, but overall still enjoyable.I think the premise of being a new kid, and stepping into a fantasy themed, imagination based game is very clever. This appealed to me as my favorite South Park scenarios are those where they're doing kid things, and hijinks ensue.One note, this isn't the best one to play with a Steam Controller. I found the right stick and lack of vibration made the magic hard to work with. I ended up switching back to a 360 controller when necessary. "

												First of all: if you like the serie South Park than you will love this game because it is so hilareous, so funny, so comic and it has the typical South Park humour. After playing 3 hours of the game, you will start to feel that this game could become  one of your favourites as right at the beginning there is one of the most funny acts of the game. I also love those rounds where you fight. It is like in a Paper Mario. At the end of the game, if you are a Skyrim player like me, you will have a big laugh as this game is from Ubisoft and Skyrim is from Bethesda. So have fun. I can really recommend this game.			"

												Most negative reviews: game's price, length and difficulty. First of all who says ""$60 is not worth for this game"" is not a real South Park fan imo. The developers, their labor for this game and their effort is totally worth $60. They are adapting South Park to an RPG game for the first and the real time. About length 20 hours a bit less maybe but the point of the game shouldn't be beating it, it should be for having fun right? You can later pick another class and hunt some achievements maybe. For difficulty I can't say neither really easy nor so hard. You're a sir douichebag, don't forget it. (P.S.: You can fart on ppl for hours. IT'S LENGTH IS NOT SHORT)			"

In fact, it might serve as a greatest-hit collection.If you do not have delicate sensibilities and would like an 20 hour interactive South Park episode with light RPG elements, this might be for you.

												Very fun game, it is basically a running version of the TV show starting from the very beginning to now. Tons of little Easter eggs for the avid show fan to the casual gamer to enjoy.  I dislike the combat system though, which is 75% of this game.  Learning new moves/weapons can take a few attempts sometimes leaving you vulnerable to missing a turn entirely.  Basically it's wait for something shiny, hit a button, hope you master it quickly.  Still very enjoyable considering I don't play RPG's... Nothing about this game is difficult, your inventory has no limits, you pick up everything you can with zero consequence, buy anything you need, sell anything you don't. Considering I purchased 2 copies for 15 bucks, I'd say I'm super happy!			"

												If you are a South Park fan (you can take a hint by my avatar) you have to play this game. Because of its art style being similar to the TV series, it feels like a big and funny episode of this great series. What is so good about it is that you will feel like you are in South Park and you will be able to explore the city at its fullest with your friends and fart on everyone.The one thing I don't like about it is that its replay value is not appealing. Sure, you can go with other classes and such, but the first experience will never be achieved again. The end-game content is next to nothing.Parker and Stone did not let me down. You must get it.

												This game makes me feel young. It calls to a time that reminds me of what it means to be young, and to want to consume every aspect of my games in one sitting. Everything about South Park is fun, and while it may not be challenging, it is everything else and more. Well written script, a beautiful cast of existing characters, tons of collectibles, fantastic summons, sharp references to modern gaming, classic gaming, and self-referencing that will make any fan giddy. Is it worth $60? If gaming has gotten a little stale in the past few months, and you're a fan, then I'd say most definitely yes; but if you're having a great time in other games? I'd say wait. The game maxes out at around 15 hours on Hardcore (which isn't hard), and has little immediate replayability. It is a mostly one and done adventure with a ton of heart, a ton of laughs, and some decent gameplay to get you from point A to B.			"

												If you're a fan of South Park, then you probably don't need me to tell you to play this game. It's certainly more than a lame RPG with a South Park skin, but it's less than an a masterpiece that elevates the genre and the source material.Pros:*Funny story from start to finish*Fun to explore the South Park world on your own*Fun, somewhat-deep combat system that even non-rpg fans can enjoy*High quality cut scenes and writing*Good environment varietyCons:*Brings nothing new to the table*No real reason to return to the game after you've completed the main story*NOT for people who have never seen South ParkI feel like the pros are self explanatory, so I'll elaborate on the cons. The game does not introduce any new ideas that do not already exist in the South Park universe. Almost every single joke in the game is a reference to something that is in the show. For fans of the show, like myself, this is a good thing. But this completely closes the door for any non-SouthPark fans. Even in terms of combat, which I found to be very engaging as an RPG-enthusiast, there is nothing new here. The combat is good overall, and much deeper than I expected it to be, but it's still not as deep as what you might find in your typical RPG. There's a good tutorial and scalable difficulty, so even people new to the RPG genre can jump right into the game and have a good time. It comes off as RPG-lite, which is understandable as the game needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of South Park fans. The main story is high quality all the way through, and the writing is solid, but once you've completed the main quest and side quests, there is nothing else to do. You can achievement hunt and look for collectibles, but many of the previous mission areas are inaccessible, and there's no real reason to explore. You won't find a secret side quest that you never knew about, or a mini-boss that you'll have to grind to level 99 to beat. As an RPGer, I found this to be a detriment, as even the old school Final Fantasy games had this.Overall, I had a great time with this game, and I highly recommend to any and all South Park fans. Even those who aren't interested in RPGs. Non-South Park fans would do best to stay away, as there's not enough new things to appeal to people just looking for a good RPG, and almost all the jokes are show-referential.			"

												Fun game.  Not always a fan of these type of games, but the South Park theme and story, and the simple but fun gameplay makes this a must play.  If your a South Park fan, and enjoy rpg style elements, this game is made for you.  Would buy again, would recommend.  Enjoy!			"

												Game had a good length for me. Not too terribly long about 30 hours. Combat was fun and fast paced, lots of different armor and weapons to play with. Talent trees and perks are neat but you end up with just about everything in the end and consumable are far too easy to come by. Nice casual RPG experience. Highly recommend to anyone! Especially, SP fans there is so many running jokes/references and some things that just made me laugh uncontrollably at times.What I didn't like, The DLC is worthless unless you want to run through the game in the same set of armorHad some graphical issues with characters disappearing during cuts scenes at the end of the game (not too bad or gamebreaking)Collectables can be missed forever. I planned on going to back to look for the chinpokomon and ended up 29/30 for my playthrough because there was one I couldn't find (Upon looking it up the area I missed it in is no longer accessable.)

												By far the funniest game ever! Not suprising coming from South Park. This game is defiantly a controllable South Park movie/episode. It pops in many referances and canadian jokes. If you are looking for a humorous game with constant laughs around each corner, then South Park: The Stick of Truth is meant for you.			"

												Even if you expect the content of South Park, nothing will save you from the awkward silence when someone looks over your shoulder and sees scenes from this game out of context.Hell, it's still f***ed up with context.But with South Park, you can not expect it to be any other way.I was impressed with the amount of content in the game and even the amount of depth (from what I thought was a spoof game) put into the turn based fighting mechanics.Otherwise, it's South Park - boiled down without alteration into a pretty fun game.But seriously, if someone unfamiliar with South Park sees you playing at a bad time, you will be judged. Poorly.10/10 - Would look people in the eye and dare them to say anything about it again.			"

												Do you like fishsticks?Then you'll probably like this game.It may not be the most original RPG out there and a lot of people disdain turn-based battles on a computer game nowadays but everything is well done in this game.You should ""feel"" the story of the game, in the sense that while you can see the epic and the fantastic, in the meantime it's clear that everything is just some made up game by silly kids in a remote mountain town just playing around. It's very easy to feel inside the show and there's even some kind of filter for the cutscenes that makes it seem like a movie file and not an in-game scene so you can feel like your character is in fact in a South Park episode.You will enter the show.Be a character, play your role.And be insulted and insult someone else.If you like the show it won't disappoint you.

												Overall the game was enjoyable to play and was what one would come to exapct with the southpark brand. The whole thing looks and feels as if you were taking part in an extended episode. The combat however follows the JRPG style which means after a while it becomes a repetitive chore if you do not like that sort of thing.Fortunatly there are options in the game world to use the environment and avoid combat plus a few abilities that essentianlly give an auto win making it a bit more bearable.There have been some comments about value for money being sub par but I would tend to disgaree. The comments suggest there is too little content and it is too short. I feel this is an apple to oranges comparsion since the content in this game is highly polished with high quality voice acting and side quests that are interesting and entertaining. I would much prefer that to 100 hours of fetch quests and tedious travelling that seem to serve no purpose other than to drag the game out.			"

												It's like playing an episode of South Park, with all the creative talent and humor of the original show. It has countless references to old episodes, and you can tell effort went into this game in at all levels; writing, programming, and producing. My only complaint is its length, (can't talk about South Park without a♥♥♥♥♥♥joke), it's a bit pricy for how long the game is. If its on sale for ant percent off I'd say give it a shot if you like the show.			"

												I'm a fan of Obsidian, and a slightly-above-casual fan of South Park, and this is essentially an episode -- actually multiple episodes -- that you control. For some people, that would be enough. For me, I felt this was Obsidian's weakest game and filled with more bugs than expected in one of their non-open-world efforts.The game is a linear adventure -- definitely not an RPG -- and the fights are a weird mix of QTEs and turn-based battles. The game outside of combat is fetch quests and collect-them-all activities.On the other hand, the narrative itself is very entertaining, the voice acting is superb (although there is a problem with the audio sync), and... well, it's South Park, so hilariously offensive. Tremendous amount of fan service here.So is it a great game? No, not quite. Is it worth playing? If you're a South Park fan, absolutely. Just don't be mislead by the developer's pedigree and the description into thinking this is anything but a 20-hour linear adventure.			"

												I'm happy to say I can jump on the bandwagon with this one; the game is phenominal! It plays like an interactive episode of the show, with Trey and Matt keeping exactly the same quality as you would find simply watching. Gameplay is very good and definitely fun, the biggest issues being a lack of balance between weapons and armor, and certain armor patches not working (X% weapon damage, thorns damage apparently being applied to your weapon) but they're easily ignored as you have fun exploring the town and hearing Butters or Cartman spout their usual banter.The only people I might not recommend this to are people not familiar with the show, but even then, credit should be given to Oblivion for helping flesh out what was essentially a 2-parter parody episode, and giving it a life of its own. My biggest regret is not picking up the game sooner. If you're somehow still on the fence about this, don't be. Worth every (Canadian) dollar.			"

Some real good points of the game are: [SPOILERS]  Interactive environment.  Finding Jesus (and having him shoot your enemies away)  Building another Facebook friends list.  Replayability. (Try all four classes, they're all good in their own way.)  Making fun of Al Gore. I'm super cereal.  Nazi Zombies. Damnit, I thought those died in 2008!  Having Mr. Hankey♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your enemies.  Performing abortions on a... man?  Going up a gay man's♥♥♥♥♥  Fighting an apparition of a sparrow.  PRINCESSU KENNY!  Farting on your enemies to kill them. Only in South Park, ladies and gents.  Watching your parents have sex while fighting Underpants Gnomes.  REFERENCES EVERYWHERE.  Kicking people in the balls.  Did I mention you fight people, too?Wow, what a list. If you are still awake, go buy it now and play it. Or not... that- that's cool too... "

												Take on the role as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a new kid in town who is looking to make friends, collect strange loot, battle enemies and complete quests. The game itself is easy to play with basic techniques within a turn based combat system. Content comes in the form of questing to progress the story line. I found the story line patchy in places and there were to many fodder quests when recruiting friends. Overall the story provides plenty of laughs with tongue in cheek none politically correct humour.Graphics are simple in keeping with the TV show and don't really take anything away from the game.7/10, would of been a 6/10 if it wasn't so funny.

There's a lot of parodies of other games and real life companies and public people. The game often provides you with several ways of solving a riddle, which is something I highly appreciate. It's also important to always keep your eyes open, or you'll easily miss a chinpokomon, and you do want to catch 'em all. ;-)  "

												A fun and entertaining romp through the town of Southpark complete with all the twisted, dark, silly, and unapologetic humor that made the TV series a success. The RPG elements, and combat in general are a bit lackluster, and would have became extremely repetitive if you were forced to fight every battle. Thankfully many of the battles can be skipped, or made easier in various ways by exploiting the environment. That is not to say that some of the battles weren't enjoyable or challenging. But the majority of them were to easy (on normal difficulty).   The voice acting and graphics are what is to be expected from Southpark however the soundtrack ranges from meh to ugh throughout and is at its best when not noticed.   The game took about 14 hours with 48% of the achievements to complete. I don't think a second playthrough will yield enough enjoyment to justify it, but you can continue on after finishing the main story to tie up any loose ends, or achievement hunt if you wish. I personally won't but it's a nice feature.I would give it an 8/10 at the price point I paid (about 10 usd)			"

												It's like watching an episode, but you are the hero.I think the game is a must play for any big South Park fan: it was really funny. The game is filled with references to every seasons. There's a lot of stuff to do (main and side quests) and to collect (chinpokemon, friends, equipments, clothes, beards... ). The combat system is classic rpg turn based fight. There are some stuff kind of unique to South Park though (the fart mechanic), but I'll let you discover that on your own.I think the only downside to me was that the game was really easy... Considering South Park is an adult mature show, so the game is probably too, I think the hard mode should've been a bit more punishing. I almost never died through the whole game and I didn't really tried that hard. It was still fun though, just not hard enough for a 'hardcore' mode.7/10 It's like Super Mario RPG meets Skyrim in South Park.			"

												This is a brilliant game. I would highly recommend it to any South park fan, and anyone who hates South Park (I'm looking at you Catholics). The story is simply superb, and the gameplay is smooth and (relatively) bug-free, even on my sh*t pile of a PC.One piece of advice. Don't purchase this bundle of joy on Steam. You can buy it on Amazon for £28, and that's all the DLC, and uncensored. Just stick the code into Steam, and you're set.NOW PLAY. PLAY UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD.UPDATE: I WANT A BADGE			"

												This game is beyond hilarious.This is one of the ways that fart jokes can make me laugh, due to everyone's various reactions. I always wanted this game but always found something more intriguing to buy, and I thank my friend for gifting it to me, because it's honestly quite the funny game.The combat is solid and is a really nice change for turn based combat. It's not tedious or grindy in a way, with the way the system works, and it's something that definitely won't get boring. I will update my review as I delve further into the game, but so far the fundamentals of this game are good, and it really feels like a South Park story.			"

												This game is the closest you can get to playing through a really good season of South Park. Everything about this game is crafted by the creators of the show, and it shows. You are truly getting what you pay for here, no funny business (Apart from all the jokes which are hilarious).Not only is this game a must-own for all fans of the show, but its also a very fun RPG to-boot! Combat is very similar to the turn-based combat of Final Fantasy VII, but everything has its South Park twist. You are free to roam around South Park, meeting its residents and finding interesting side-quests to complete. I've already met Al Gore, unfriended him, defeated ManBearPig, been abducted by aliens, bitten by gingers, killed by Nazi Zombie Kittens and watched my parents have sex while I was battling giant rats in the wall. Besides that, right click is fart, so... 10/10 Would South Park again.			"

Posted: January 2, 2015
												Fantastic game. The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.But the game isn't without its flaws. I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.The game feels heavily ""consolized."" Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense. Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs. Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell. However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC. I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller. Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game. But not in combat. In combat the controls felt great. More on that later, though.On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts. This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all! The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back. I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere. The loading screens are a real slowdown.So let's see. The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention. So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right. As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight. This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat. Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability. To use it, you select it and then choose a target. The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button. Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy! If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much. Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this. When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time. Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks! Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair. The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls. Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes. Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by. Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them. Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them. But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress. As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in. The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can. It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.The writing in the game is spot on. You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character. I found the story largely fun and interesting.I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game. This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style. You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks. As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories. You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show. There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park. It's a funny game.There is also a difficulty slider bar. Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding. The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight. I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately. Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan. I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews. :) "

												I'm only a 1/3 of the way through the game and I've already gotten my money's worth.  Even if you're a casual fan of South Park and enjoy RPGs, this should definitely be on your list.  There's plenty of laughs for everyone.The game itself is pretty deep.  There are lots of missions to complete, lots of areas to explore and a crapton of stuff to loot.  The combat system is relatively easy to learn yet complex (as you level up and acquire more interesting gear).  Random fights don't feel like a slog (I'm looking at you, More-Established-RPG-Franchises) and leveling up doesn't feel like a chore.  As many have said before, it really does feel like playing in an extended South Park episode.tl;dr - On the fence about picking this game up?  Answer the quick questionaire below to see if this game is for you!1 - Like South Park?2 - Like RPGs?3 - Like looting a ton of weird and unique personal items from people's homes and garages for no apparent reason?If you've answered YES to at least 2 out of the 3 questions, then ...

												A solid game that seems to hit that sweet spot between too much simplicity and being overly complex, particularly with the combat system. The combat is one of the highlights, with the kids using common household items for weapons and armor, and the system is deeper than you might imagine, but still simple enough to remain immersed within the story.And what a story it is. Many have said it already, but this is just like playing through several episodes of South Park. There will be all the jokes you might expect from the show, so those who are easily offended (or have no idea what South Park is – where have you been living the past 15 years or so?) might want to give the game a pass. In fact, it's more like South Park the Movie, as it can get away with a lot more than the show itself can.With tons of characters to befriend and items to find, as well as four classes to play through as, there is plenty of reason to replay the game at least one more time to see it all, for roughly 30 hours total.

												If you love South Park, you'll love this. It feels like I'm playing a TV episode or movie. I loved the references that go way, way back to early seasons of South Park.If you don't like South Park because it goes too far. you'll be offended and hate it. But maybe you should buy it anyway.Also worth noting, I am not an RPG fan. This is probably the first RPG game I've played (or at least with RPG elements). I loved the story and playing so much that I feel I got tricked into playing an RPG.			"

												If you love South Park, you'll love the game. Just going around exploring the town and finding all the references is by far the best part of the game.If you don't like South Park but want to try an RPG game, I can not recommend it. It's very easy, even on hardest, and you'll get good enough gear just going through the main missions to beat the game without a problem, so there's no need to search for loot. You can't make a bad build. It doesn't matter where you place your skills, since the damage output levels with you. You'll make short work of most enemies. It's a very short game. 28 hours for me is 3 playthroughs and 100 % achievements.But damn it's hilarious and wonderful. And when the 8-bit version of ""Blame Canada"" started playing... I cried tears of joy. Beautiful.			"

South Park + The characters LARP-ing LOTR style = One hell of an epic RPG-game! If you love RPGs and South Park (and also LOTR) then you can't go wrong with this game! To have three things I really like combined into a game is fantastic.This game is like starring in an actual South Park movie. It's amazing! Go buy it now, and become a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag too! You won't regret it!I rate this game 666/666 gunshots from Jesus' rifle.			"

Aside from te hilarious combat, you also spend a lot of time just roaming around the quiet mountain town of south park.  The dailaogues are some of the funniest I have ever heard in any game. 10/10 "

												If you like South Park, you will likely scream in laughter when playing the game.If you're not a fan of ""childish gross"" humor, this game isn't for you. But if you aren't, why are you even looking at South Park the game in the first place?I can't begin to describe how funny this game is without major spoilers, but however funny and outrageous you think it is - it's more funny and outrageous than that. If you're now thinking ""Not so sure, I can think of some pretty funny and outrageous things"", you're not even close to some of the stuff in this game.Bad stuff?Well. You can't play as a girl. That kinda sucks. You can't change key-bindings which is slightly annoying but the bindings are actually already set up very nice and I can't imagine anyone having real problems with them.I haven't seen many bugs but I will admit that it could be because it's hard to see through the tears as I'm laughing while playing this game.I did have to restart the game once because the font got all messed up. I also hope that they smoothen out the scrolling of the game as you walk around - it's not the jerky scrolling that people have reported on the console version, but it could be smoother still.			"

												This is a hilarious game about a farting kid who plays with other kids a game where they role play the ancient time characters. I haven't watched any South Park TV show's episodes, but after playing this game, I can surely say the TV show would be great. The hilarious dialogue sequences involving kids cursing each other with turn based RPG combat system, this game does what it aims for, provide entertainment. There are several side quests to keep you involved in the game even after the story is completed, but as I have other games to play as well, I left it after the story. Would definitely return to it when I am free again. I surely recommend this game.			"

												first off, this is an awesome RPG game that will definitely keep you on your feet for the entire game. 8/10only concern is that it's a tad bit too short; there's 'starter packs' which contains bonus content for your character but after playing it for 4 hours straight you can save yourself a bit of money and still be stronger than the starter pack that you would be normally provided to upon buying the starter pack.if there were more things to do, such as completing more of the campaign mode to defeat Clyde, i'd give this a possible 9/10.other than that, this game is well made and great for South Park fans out there.

												Matt and Trey are geniuses. I used to watch South Park religiously but havent much anymore but decided to pick this game up while it was on sale. Its a fun RPG set in the South Park world. You're the new kid in town and are invited to play along with the boys in an adventure surrounding the beloved Stick of Truth. They only have a few classes to choose from though. Not your ""typical"" RPG classes. I decided to go with The Thief. The Jew Class was a close second. They called me, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Bag the Thief."" I could dig it.Anyways, its a pretty entertaining story with easter eggs from the show and guest appearances from the other characters. I def recommend to those that havent bought the game to buy it and play it. At worst, just pick it up whenever it goes on sale. And those that have it already, and havent tried yet... JUST DO IT.Plus, I was shrunk by underpants gnomes and forced to crawl into the♥♥♥♥♥♥of a gay man to deactivate an Atom bomb. 11/10. GG.			"

												A must have for any longtime fans of South Park. Obsidian did a fantastic job with this game and it feels like they threw you right into the show itself. Great writing, plenty of shout outs, fun character customization, a lot of fun. The Al Gore and Underpants Gnomes references are probably my favorite. The battle system is tons of fun and reminiscent of what you'd find in Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (maybe a bit of the Mario & Luigi series too). If you're a fan of any of those games, or of turn based RPGs in general, I'd recommend this game just for the entertaining combat. Ridiculous in the best possible way. Due to its short length, though, I would also recommend snagging it when it's on sale.			"

												Utter joy for any SP fan - the attention to detail is staggering, there are hundreds and hundreds of references to past shows (all the way back to the very first series), even in the 'junk' that you can find and sell for cash.  Other pluses: *All the voices are 'real' not botched or cut'n'pasted. *Storyline is original and long (when many TV-franchise spinoff games have any old crap for a story (whatever you'll buy it anyway F.U!)) but is not out of place with real SP stories. My few downsides: *almost every character you can think of shows up but Where's Pip? *Need ways to collect hints about most difficult search-items else you have to go to cheat files. *Obsession with 'bosses'. *SP epics need music a la Bigger Longer!Arise Sir D**ch*b*g!

												Take the irreverant antics of South Park, mix in some light RPG and you get South Park the Stick of Truth.This game is a must have for fans of the long running animated series.  The best part is that the game isn't some lame adaptation but rather a faithful complement to the TV series.  If you remember the great PS4 versus Xbox1 conflict of 2013 then you have the backstory for this game.It was co-developed with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone with game voice overs performed by the current series cast.  In short playing ""The Stick of Truth"" is like having the starring role in the TV series.  Gameplay is typical RPG but greatly simplified.  There's ample options to customize your character,  level him/her up, collect ever more powerful items and choose your destinty be it good or evil. Don't expect bragging rights or leaderboards though.  That's not what this game's about.  Enjoy the 20 or so hours like you would a season of South Park.			"

												Absolutely loved this game! Perfect example of how a franchise should be used for a video game. It was like one 20 hour episode of the show, with humor more funny than any episode in the series! The gameplay is good, not great, but good. The animation is perfect. The soundtrack is awesome. I loved the ride this game gave me. If you are a fan of the show you MUST play this. I have not laughed so hard in my entire life! Now, it is a short game, took me 20 hours to complete, but I took my time and explored every nook and cranny. I would guess that you could blaze through the game in 15 hours if you really wanted to. The gameplay is pretty simple, which is good and bad I suppose. When I bought this game, it was 60 bucks, and I don't think it was worth that, but now it's $40, and that is a much more appropriate price. When the game goes on sale from time to time you would be cheating yourself by not purchasing it. Overall, I highly reccomend this game. 8/10			"

												From fighting aborted Nazi zombie fetuses to getting a David Hasslehoff nose job, South Park: The Stick of Truth is one crazy adventure. Generally, the gameplay kept me on my toes, the story was funny as hell, and the art style was on point with the construction paper style of the show. Keep in mind, however, that this is a game made for the fans. Personally, as a huge South Park Fan, I enjoyed every little detail that helped me feel like a part of the neighborhood. Secrets and easter eggs are scattered everywhere referencing past plots and characters that haven't been seen in years. So if you don't watch the show, expect not to understand 70% of what is going on. My only real complaints are that the game was way too short, overall lasting about 15 hours, and that there is little to no replay value after finishing all the quest and finding all the collectibles. The DLC isn't really worth it unless for some reason you really wanted a couple pieces of aesthetic low level armors. But if there's any story-related DLC coming in the future, count me in.			"

It's essentially dozens of hours of an interactive episode with well crafted turn-based RPG elements and hilarious gameplay with meticulous details referencing the show's history hidden all over the place.  It also basically kinda ""feels"" like it's the second half of Season 17, all runs together very nicely.10/10			"

												Worth playing, but not really a serious RPG.The value of this game is in it's comedy. If you are a South Park fan, you will enjoy this. But the RPG elements feel more like a means to an end, and lack the sastifaction of a trueRPG. The game is rather short, and you level up so quickly that you barely have time to really 'kit out' your character. By the time you get used to one set of weapons and armor,you have already found a new and better loadout.The plot is as far-fetched and ridiculous as one would come to expect from the South Parkcreators. The animation, dialogue, and story progression make you feel like you are watching an episode at times. The game gives you the sense that you need to make a few difficult choices to change the outcome, but in the end, the storyline is very linear and your decisions affect very little.Overall, I would recommend the game to a fan of the show. It is worth a laugh, but not a wholelot more than that.			"

												Great fun, while im personally not really into rpg's, the huge amount of south park stuffed into this game makes it all worth it, and even for me the rpg element isnt bad either, fights usually dont drag along and offer enough fun and diversion for my taste.Another thing i really like is the bucketloads of collectible 'scrap' items scattered across the world, sarcastaball tropy? check, biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the universe award? check, the sword of a thousand truths? check, chinballs? offcourse! (wearable too) and the list goes on and on.If you enjoy south park, get this game, if you dont really watch/know south park, but like a casual rpg, get this game. "

												This game feels like the show. That's one of the first things I want to stress. The problem with alot of games based on movies or shows is they feel like a game that just has a loosely based wrapping of the thing they are based on (including previous South Park videogames). The Stick of Truth however... you feel like you're involved with the real show universe. The artwork, the plot, the humor and absurdity and complete disreguard of political correctness... it's all the same way the show would come across.You basically play as the new kid that just arrived in town and get quickly swept up in this pretend medival humans-vs-elves game the South Park cast of kids are playing in a real life setting. Like all the kids in town. That pretty much remains a theme throughout the game. I don't really want to detail much about the story though since SPOILERS and all.The combat in this game is more interactive than most RPG style games. It's turn based but you don't just select ""attack"" and select a target. In this game just about every move requires some interaction - usually clicking at the right time to make a hit land.Seriously if you like South Park the show then you'll like this game! It's practically like watching the show.			"

												Maybe not for kids, but amazing fun, with a deeper than it seems battle system, hundreds of collectables (a golden globe award is worth 70 cents), skills, and plenty excellent storyline to keep you laughing out loud for a very long time. Sheer entertainment with amazing detail (the music, the social media system, the inventory names)If you're a south park fan, this is the one for you, featurring references from sexual harassment panda music, through mr slave's indiscretions, al gore, the cow-destroying aliens, Ike kicking and the incredibly strange, untamed land of Canada (which has its different ways, languages, and a strangely familiar gameplay mechanic). Frankly, if you just like rude games and enjoy RPGs, you're also in tor a treat.So far I've defeated Kloe Kardashian's giant zombie nazi foetus using Cartman's giant flaming fart, played mini abortion mini-games on Randy Marsh, Found Jesus (He was hiding behind the seat, and now I can summon him to murder my foes), learned how to misdirect with farts, learned how to smoke and drink coffee while dressed as a goth (it's a guitar hero minigame, with sighs), been promoted to commander d*****ebag, rectally probed a number of people, teleported using technology in my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and been squashed by my father's love spuds while fighting underpands gnomes on the same bed he is having relations with my mother on at the time. With all this, I've not had much time to unfriend Al Gore from my facebook page because of his manbearpig posts.I have arthiritic hands, and can't use a keyboard for gaming for long; this game works excellently with an XBOX 360 PC pad under Windows. I'm sure a flame war will commence from this.			"

												This recommendation comes from sort of an interesting place. I love Paper Mario and I love Earthbound. I do not really like South Park all that much, though this game has kind of made me appreciate it a bit more. I really wanted to play this game for a while, and when it went on the steam sale I had to pick it up just because I had a big RPG itch that needed scratching. I wasn't disappointed. I completed the 11-12 hour game in about two days, being completely hooked. The game is filled with humor poking fun at video games and culture in general. Graphically speaking it looks identical to the TV show and your character fits in extremely well, while being a silent protagonist(which leads to some very funny jokes). I can't believe how much I laughed at a game based off a show I never really cared for. This game is a MUST buy for RPG fans even if you don't like South Park I'd say. Unless you're TOTALLY against the idea of South Park.Alright Pros and Cons time.Pros:+Looks visually identical to the TV show+Hilarious+Really fun timed battle system+Does not hold back on the rudness and crudeness of the show(may be a con to some, though I felt it was MOSTLY a strength)+Tons of collectables and interactions+Feels like an entire season of South Park starring you+have to add another pro saying again how hilarious the game isCons:-Some flickering graphical bugs that were easily fixed by restarting the game, but still something to look out for-Incredibly easy, I only died once in my whole playthrough -Only able to use one other party member -Maximum level is only 15 as far as I can tell (in general I think the combat system is great, but the damage and levels and party members should be revamped if they ever do a sequel)TL;DREven if you aren't a South Park fan, or even dislike it, there is still a lot to like here. Try it out!			"

												I think its one of the best rpgs out there to be honest my only complaint is that i beat the game (and all of the side quests) in 15 hours and there really isnt anything else to do. typically playing as a different character would be the thing to do but its like borderlands 2 (without dlc) once you beat it there isnt anything to do and you dont really wanna play it again. overall if there were more sidequests and maybe better dlc this game would get a 10/10 by me but right now im kind of at an 8.5/10.

												Moderarely deep turn based RPG system, classic South Park lore, and so much raunchy humor make this a definite contender for game of the year for 2014 in my personal opinion.  This is easily one of the funniest & funnest games I have ever played in my whole life.  I'll admit it.  I'm an RPG lover, and a South Park fanatic, so I have been lusting after this game since it was first announced, but only because A) Matt & Trey, the dudes behind South Park, are in charge of writing it with full control, and B) they went to Obsidian for development (Fallout New Vegas, KOTOR2.)  Now, this game isn't 100% perfect, but no game will ever be perfect for everyone.  However, this game is a must own for anyone who finds themselves in the center of venn diagram of people who love both South Park and RPG games.  For everyone else, ask yourself, does playing a long episode of South Park sound like fun?  If you answer yes, then this game is probably for you.  For people who play RPGs, but are not familar with South Park, have you been living under a rock?  I'd recommend watching a few episodes of the show first  because the game is the show, only in game format, so you would definitely be missing out on the multitude of references.  Luckily, you can head over to southparkstudios.com which is the official South Park website and you can watch every full episode there for free.  There's my two cents.  I love this game.  I give it a 9.8/10			"

												Well I just stayed up until 7 am to finish a game I wasn't really expecting to like. I'm not a South Park fan at all, having only watched a few episodes ever. I have to say, South Park: The Stick of Truth has pleasantly surprised me. I can honestly recommend this to non South Park fans. In my opinion, the toilet humour gets a bit grating sometimes but the absurd and political humour is quite intelligent and often well written. Then there's the self aware ""video game"" humour, making fun of what a typical video game and especially rpg is known for. South Park often mocks you for thinking it will play like a standard rpg. I laughed a lot more at these kinds of jokes than the endless edgy race/sexuality/etc jokes. That being said, I found there to be a surprising amount of funny ""offensive"" humour. One of the enemies summons 4 clones, 3 of which are identical to him, the other being black or asian instead of white. This caught me off guard and made me laugh quite a bit the first time. All in all, this game is just great. A fantastic RPG with unexpectedly deep mechanics and for the most part, exceptional writing. However, there are some negatives that I'll mention - Save states don't actually save from when you pressed save, instead creating a save at the last checkpoint you were at. I understand this exists to minimize ""save state abuse"" where you can save seconds before an encounter and reload it so as to avoid repurcussions but,- There are some areas with really bad checkpoint systems imo and there was somewhere I got stuck for 20-25 mins because not only did I have to retry the part I was failing (will mention that in next point) but I had to swap party members, cycle to their skill (which was 3 presses of LB) and loot a chest. I had to do this 9 or 10 times for every time I failed my quest because of how the checkpoint system worked in this area (there was no room to enter so as to create a new checkpoint, it would just use the save from when I entered that room).- The abortion minigame was one of the most frustrating and finicky experiences I've ever had playing video games. I'm fine with QTEs but both of these were nightmares and seemed to not process input on my controller. Hope it's fixed/removed for SP:FBW.tl;dr, great RPG with solid mechanics and puzzles in the South Park universe. If you're a fan of South Park, you will love this game. If you're not, you will still probably like it a hell of a lot if you like good RPGs. Highly recommended. 8.5/10			"

												I've seen pretty much all of the South park episodes and movies, and they've never dissapointed to make me laugh. This is truly exceptional to the best of their creativity. To keep it short and sweet, it's completely worth every penny. Not many games kept me laughing so hard consistently and I still wanted to keep on playing...half the time I decided to wander and contiue beat and fart on people endlessly in this game... It's fun to explore around, the graphics are great, and the music is awesome as well...A touch of nostalgia is also imprinted in the game when you recognize previous songs from South Park and Team America...but they've also added some sweet music in it too. I highly recommend this game to those whom are interested to try it. For those who played it...Just remember...""Don't fart on someone's balls"" ...Haha...Enjoy! :)10/10			"
