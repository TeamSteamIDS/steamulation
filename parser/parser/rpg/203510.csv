												Before trying this, let it be known that it has a huge cliffhanger and the main developer has quit making games as they just weren't making enough of a profit.With that said:Don't let the cute anime little girls fool you, this is a great and challenging game, where you need to pay attention to enemy patterns, know your and your partners moves and watch out for them. A controller is highly recommended as playing with the keyboard might be a little painful.			"

												If you want an idea as to what this game is like, try combining Castlevania 2 - Simon's Quest's gameplay with Atelier Rorona's art style and Dark Souls' AI / difficulty in your mind.  The storyline is adorable and the graphics are colorful, but the play control and difficulty will give you a massive headache.  Wandering monsters with stun mechanics or knockback abilities will ruin your day as they are extremely difficult to dodge.  Bottomless pits are everywhere, so knockback enemies are particularly dangerous here.  There is no status immunity and there is no way to overlevel to make the game easier - the game caps your level dependent on the number of a certain relic you've obtained.If you're in for a challenge and enjoy sidescroller ARPG gameplay, you will like this game.  If you're the average COD or Madden obsessed gamer, stay at least 50 feet away!			"

												Fortune Summoners has effectively awakened my long dormant love for video games. Despite having been an enthusiastic fan of games since the 80's, I fell out of the mix around 2000. Since then I've played modern games like Dark Souls and Left4Dead2, and liked them, but the nagging urge to alt tab the game and do something else was always there. But not with this game. What a refreshing feeling. I can play this game all day and not have any nagging urge to do anything else.  Its retro jrpg style mixed with modern anime design is so well done that I feel like I'm a part of this magical world.  The characters are all lovable and the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay is engaging and challenging. It's not just a button masher. The game is very immersive by the time you get used to the controls and the brutal difficulty. 10/10 Wonderful game.			"

												I don't normally review games I haven't finished. There are loads of games I just don't like and I couldn't bring myself to finish. I never bothered to give them a poor review simply because they weren't my cup of tea; to me, that's a bit disingenuous. However, if I cannot finish a game due to design flaws so astonishingly glaring and blatant, well... then it's fair game. And Fortune Summoners is definitely fair game.This game is broken. Full stop.Let's start at the beginning. Fortune Summoners is a side-scrolling action RPG developed by former indie game dev Lizsoft. Apparently their games haven't sold enough to warrant further investment, so I heard they shut down. It's a very charming game with graphics reminiscent of the 16-bit era's ""last hurrah"" during the mid 90s. The characters are adorable and well-designed while the story is simple but cute and a nice refreshing break from all the blood, metal and grime that seems to permeate gaming these days.The story may be simple but the game's combat system has a lot of depth. There's quite a bit of different techniques you can pull off, with Arche, the protagonist, having a wide variety of sword skills that can be used to deal with various enemies. Sana and Stella are the mages, where water-aspected Sana fills the support and healing role with only sub-par offensive magic, Stella brings the pain with fire-based damage dealing. The AI scripting controls two of the characters while the player controls one--you can swap between them on the fly in the middle of a fight and it feels like the developer expected swapping character control to be a major facet of gameplay.So what's the problem, you might ask? How is Fortune Summoners broken, if it has no major bugs and seems to be a cute little Japanese indie title?Two words: difficulty and controls.Fortune Summoners suffers from the absolute worst difficulty curve I've ever seen in any game I've ever played. Part of the problem here is that everything is so extreme. Arche can take a reasonable amount of punishment, but when she does damage she might as well be wielding a feather instead of a sword. Even basic enemies at-level can take such an enormous number of hits before they go down. It's simply tedious. Sana and Stella have the defense of wet tissue paper and enemies can rapidly kill them, especially since all of their best offensive powers--their magic, of course--takes some time to activate and any hit will interrupt their spell-casting. It doesn't help that Sana's first offensive spell cannot be aimed directly forward, but forward and down, making hitting anything at all nearly impossible without getting right in its face (and then being interrupted forever). The magic-users hit hard, but they also take hits hard and trying to set them up to kill things is quite a chore (though Stella does make things a lot easier once you get her on your team).The difficulty of this game is beyond challenging and enters the realm of punishing. Monsters can strike you repeatedly and you do not get a moment of invincibility after being hit, so you can easily be juggled to death by a small group of basic enemies around you. The enemy AI scripting is way, way too tight--enemies will read your moves as you use them and dodge your more powerful techniques with annoying regularity. This, to me, is poor game design--if you want to make a side-scroller where the enemies are very good at dodging attacks and the skill factor is placed on precision and timing, you really can't also turn every basic mook into a damage sponge. That's just absurd.The difficulty settings don't seem to do much, either. Setting the game to ""Easy"" didn't seem to affect damage dealt or received. Monsters seemed to still have exactly the same number of HP. The only real difference I could even detect is that you receive less XP from monsters (how backwards is that?) and the number of healing items that drop from slain enemies seems to be higher.The difficulty curve is bad enough, but it's exacerbated and amplified, cranked up to eleven, by the controls. The controls in this game are an utter trainwreck. I've played unlicensed hacked NES cartridge games with better controls than this game. Movement is very imprecise and ""slidy"" with a significant amount of inertia to almost every movement. Turning around is slow, especially when enemies are hitting you (and, of course, you get no invincibility frames after being hit). In order to perform any of Arche's special moves, which you'll need to do in order to fight effectively, requires that you tap out a combination within a very narrow window. It feels like a bad fighting game in some ways, where instead of rolling your thumb across the d-pad in a quarter circle and then pressing Attack, you have to tap down, tap left and, while you tap left, also tap the attack button. It's terribly unintuitive and needlessly finicky. For a lighthearted title like this, combat should be relatively easy to learn but potentially hard to master with a smooth curve from being able to kill the enemies and progress to pulling off insane combos and specials in rapid succession once you've practiced. This game is not like that at all. The gameplay is brutally demanding of precision and exact button timing to the point where the entire combat system feels like a giant disjointed string of quick-time events rather than smooth and fluid action.The combat system in Fortune Summoners could be a joy to play if they fixed the absurd precision requirements. For example, you should be able to hold the direction while using the attack button to perform a special move, rather than having to tap both buttons within a few milliseconds of each other else the attack simply fails and Arche performs a basic standing attack. Turning around should be faster. Executing a dodge roll should be a single button press or a double-tap of left or right, and the dodge roll should yield invincibility frames for the entire animation.Even running and walking is needlessly clunky. To run you have to double-tap the d-pad... and it doesn't matter which direction you double-tap. I can't count how many times I've run off an edge and fallen into a pit in the middle of battle because I tapped two opposing directions too rapidly in succession. That should never happen; in a game with two movement speeds, you should be able to hold a button down to run or walk! The jumping mechanics in the game are extremely strange as well, allowing a great deal of movement while in mid-air as well as your run speed unaffecting your jump distance. You can leap over a large pit from a dead stop and trying to get a running start adds no distance to your jump. This is unintuitive and runs counter to basically every platform side-scroller ever made. The controls in Fortune Summoners are so horrendously awful and counterintuitive that I spent the entire time playing, all six hours or so, trying to intentionally forget the muscle memory I built up from years of 8- and 16-bit console gaming.I really wanted to like this game. I really did. It ticks most of my boxes when it comes to RPGs and being a side-scroller had me feeling a bit of nostalgia. Cute characters, a charming and light-hearted plot, something nice to balance out the endless waves of ""grimdark"" games that seem to dominate the market these days. Unfortunately the game is, in my opinion, so frustrating that it's virtually unplayable. If you're in the market for a side-scrolling hack and slash action RPG, don't buy Fortune Summoners. Do yourself a favor and pick up Dust: An Elysian Tail, which has many of the same elements as this game (and more besides) with excellent controls and fast, fluid combat.			"

												What stood out the most for this game was just how hard it can be. It's not terrible, but you have to be willing to learn to progress or even the low level slimes in the beginning will kick your butt. Every character has various moves that are performed via short and fast code-like combos. Mashing attack will get you literally nowhere - enemies react quickly to your moves. And they all play to win. If you just walk up beside an enemy and start mashing attack it's ducking under or jumping over and countering your attack with something of its own. The game plan ultimately is to catch them in a position they can't block or dodge - such as dodging around their attack to strike. The NPCs are alarmingly more unpredictable and fast to respond as the game continues so getting down your moves is a much needed talent for the player to have. You have to perform various moves as well or the enemy will catch on and start hitting via weak areas (normal attack is a simple overhead strike. Low range and no movement while performed - thus lunging or attacks that strike further in general would get through  your attacks easily).The concept of the story and setting feel like something you'd see in a Miyuzaki film; adorable little children learning to be witches in a school for witches. Rushing around an old fantasy-themed world for the purposes of everything from class field trips to dangerous dungeon crawling (though it's all fairly dangerous considering).It's cute and fun. Can be frustrating if you don't take every fight with some level of seriousness. Even seemingly weak enemies have a sense of self-presevation.			"

												A light platforming adventure JRPG, it actually borrows some mechancis from fighting-type games, of all places.  Enemies dodge basic attack spam, so you often have to find tricks of combos to pin them down.  It's occasionally frustrating when you can't get anything working, which other reviewers seem to harp upon, but when you learn how to make everything work, it's a ton of fun, and feels like the real accomplishment for the difficulty.

												Funny things about games. Espechially about video games: Big companies will rain you with more and more realistik graphics, gameplay may resemble a sheit load mess of everything, big names actors and actresses will do voices, huge marketing... But people still wll play and most of gamers will prefer something simple, something that will lend you a hand in killing time. Think of this; Battlefield 4 may be bells and whistles fest, but would not your ather play deathmatch in Unreal? New Thief and Dishonored are hiding in shadows when original Thief and Thief 2 appear. Morrowind community is no less than Skyrim one. Pacman gets his HD remake, while Modern Warfare is a long dead with a bunch of lads still playing it (when nobody's watching). Why is it? Maybe because before games became buisness, developers tryed to entertain their consumers with what gamers actually wanted! Simple doesn't mean easy, and hard doesn't mean frustrating. As opposite for modern games, they are easy or frustrating. rarely we can experience an actuall blast from the past, even indy many times don't understand what made games from the past so great -- they making games, like dem pioners of arkcde developpment. Of course past was not a magic land with ponies eating rainbows and farting butterflyes. But back than, experiments where conducting! A lot of games, -- masterpiece mind you -- where born as a joke, or with developers themselfs not beleving in sucsess (Deus Ex, Thief, Unreal, Rainbow 6, Operation Flaspoint). But did it matter? No, developers where bold, the where making games, not movies and not the same game over and over (at least on PC and early consoles). Now it's like there are 5 games, only diffrent wrap. And you know what... Oh sheit! I was suppose to write a rewiew or just my own thought about this game... How did it jumped into nostalgia and ranting? Whatever, a good old platformer-JRPG mix; Fun, challenging, adorable charecters and great time killer. I like it, and if you're into Platformer-action-JRPG with school gals as charecters, you sure will like this one too.			"

												If I were to keep it short : This game is an experience. A really good one while at that. And I hope a miracle happens that creates a sequel.Usually, I'm not a fan of RPG games. Turn-based, real-time, the random loot ones, you name it. I honestly despise the genre.And yet, somehow, I fell in love with this game. The cute art, the gameplay, the atmosphere and the brutal difficulty made me literally not stop playing it until the point where the sun is shining and I realise that I just played it for 6+ hours straight. I mean it, I pretty much didn't stop playing it until the sun started to shine or I completed it. At the time of writing the review, I had 27 hours put into this game. This includes moments where I got lost for a few hours and had to figure out what to do as I refused to make use of a guide. The story and the characters while not really being that unique, completely work within the game and actually give it quite a bit of charm.Aside from that, the movement might take a slight amount of getting used as turning around to face the other direction takes a split second. Along side that, you might want to adjust the run input sensitivity until you no longer can tap a direction twice at a slow pace to run.If you're going to have doubts after reading this..thing, there is also the demo which I believe is the entire prologue of the game.Fortune Summoners is a brutal game, it does not hold your hand. Early on, at least.The whole brutality comes from the fact that this game is more similar to a fighter or a more complex beat em up game than an RPG at its core where you are more likely to focus on guarding or avoiding attacks via Arche's mobility or the other characters backwards hopping neither of which provide you with any invulnerability frames and only serve as a method of avoiding. I guess there's jumping too as a method of avoiding damage.As such, the thing that you must learn early on is either to avoid/block things or to learn ways to hit your target for as long as possible to prevent it from hitting you before that. Oh and, the enemies will actively try to guard or if they're unable to guard, move out of the way of your attacks in the similar manner that you yourself are able to. They will also actively try to make sure you will not be in a position to fight back by mercilessly beating on you. No one will blame you if you die to your first enemy even if it feels humiliating.The only help you will have at the very start is that there's an option to guard for you when you are not attacking, jumping or doing the dodge moves.The main characters here all feel different to play, with there being some similarities between the two mages.The playable characters are as follows :Arche, the first character in this game that transfers in to the magic school, while she wishes to learn magic she is more capable in the ways of the sword than magic. Thankfully, due to the fact that she uses a sword, she has become rather agile. Alongside that, she is the most durable of the 3 characters and will take a few hits. Unlike the other two characters which primarily use spells, Arche has a rather large move set that expands as you level up. Some of these moves also chain together and if you focus on playing mostly her, you will have to make use of the moveset to defeat things.Sana, the second character that you meet shortly after. Using the water element she is more of a support character than an offensive one. Having excellent support abilities but rather small set of offensive abilities. Unlike Arche, she does not have a huge set of moves, and she does not have a dodging ability until way later on in the game. Thankfully, since she is a mage, she has a wide variety of magic that expands as she levels up. Even if most of these are support skills. As a mage, she has casting time before she can make use of her magic.Stella, the third character that you encounter much later on in the game. Using the fire element she is purely an offensive mage with minimal support abilities. Unlike Sana, she has her dodge ability from the start. Outside of the part where she is an offensive mage, and as such has mostly high damage dealing spells of varying sizes or usage situations. Her magic behaves similarly in that you select it in the same way and it also has casting time.This is where the game surprised me. With no co-op multiplayer of any description, I expected the worst when it came to the party members. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised as the CPU is incredibly competent in combat without having strange priorities nor being horrible at following you.If you're playing Arche, Sana will use her buffs primarily on you, healing whoever has the lowest hp first. If both of these are not currently possible, she will make use of her weaker offensive spells instead. Stella meanwhile uses her shorter range or defensive spells if there are enemies near her, longer range or homing spells on enemies further away or if the enemies are above her she will use spells that primarily hit the air instead.If you're not playing Arche, the CPU for Arche expects you to fill the same role as the CPU you just replaced, in the way that she will leap straight into combat, making use of the sword moves that close the distance if she has them. In most cases she is able to handle any situation she is thrown in without much of an issue. You will however need to support her in the same way the CPU supports you when you're playing her.This is the other and later method of hand holding the game provides you, in the manner that your party members actively assist you in combat. I can't really complain about it either because the game is difficult as it is and if the CPU was incompetent I'd probably just ragequit the game and never play it again.While the story and characters are nothing special, they work well enough with the art and the game itself to give it a unique feel while being written well enough to make the game entertaining.The game is also adorable. Mostly because of the writing and the artstyle this game has as it gives the game tons of personality. The backgrounds, the character portraits, the character sprites and animation. The enemy sprites, animation. Just all of it gives the game such an adorable feel that it's impossible to not mention it. It's honestly hard to believe that such a cute looking game is incredibly merciless when it comes to the difficulty. While the cuteness might be a turnoff for some people, I feel that if this were the case they would've already left the store page upon seeing the screenshots. The music also adds to the cuteness.For a game made by a single person, they have done a great job at making the game seem alive and fun to play. Not to mention making it completely adorable.With all the praise I gave the game, surely there are some flaws. Right? Well, yeah.One of the major issues I've already mentioned at the very start is the run input sensitivity, but that can be easily adjusted.Outside the lack of steam overlay making screenshots rather difficult to upload (Although, there is a guide provided for that) the largest issue is also the game's brutality, as silly as it sounds as I've been praising it earlier. Just like in a fighter game against the CPU, your enemies will be reading your input to avoid or block your attacks the very instant you hit the attack key, and they will also not hesitate to punish you for doing that. This means that unless you know what exactly you're doing or switch to one of the mages to allow Arche CPU to fight for you, you will have to stay on the defensive most of the time. Responding and punishing the enemy accordingly to what it does, rather than being the one to attack first.This can be an incredibly frustrating experience and might be a huge turnoff from the game for some. If this seems like it isn't for you, I suggest you to try the demo before you buy this.			"

												I love this game so it's high time I reviewed it.tl;dr: awesome 2d action RPG with fantastic combatI have trouble finding a specific genre for it, I still have to find something quite like this, but you could say it's a 2d sidescroller action RPG, and here's why:RPG, because you have your equipment screen and can change it, and you have your 2 party members that you can control too if you want, otherwise they have their own AI;2d sidescroller because, well, it's a 2d sidescroller... and it has platforming sections and puzzles;Action, because of the combat; you can think of it as a 2d Dark Souls with no stamina bar, you won't achieve anything by going full hack'n'slash on the enemies, you have to watch how the opponent moves and react accordingly, and of course they'll do the same thanks to a pretty impressive AI.About the combat, this is where the game really shines. If you've played some fighting games you'll feel right at home here, because with only the 4 directional buttons plus jump and attack buttons, you can perform all kinds of moves: slash, upward slash, forward slash, quick poke/thrust, jumping attacks, aerial attacks, running charge, rolling attacks and of course block and dodge/roll.The enemies also have various attacks, that combined with a very good AI makes for some really fun and memorable fights, even against basic slimes at the beginning.Your 2 friends in your party are casters, and they can learn all kinds of spells to support you from the distance, or buff and heal.The story is nothing incredibly serious or dramatic, since the main characters are little girls that go to school (by the way yes, you play as a little girl... that goes to school with a sword... how awesome is that?), but the dialogues are never boring and the characters are all likeable, and you're always wanting to know what happens next, and begin a new adventure... !!!...Sadly, this is also one of the bad points of the game, because it ends giving a clear indication that the story will continue in the next game, only... there is no next game. The developer stopped making games and... this is the only one. And this saddens me to no end.It's not a short game, since I think it took me more than 30 hours the first time through, without trying to find all secrets and rare items, but a lack of sequel is incredibly painful after that ending, and especially for a game as good as this one.

												As much as I want to recommend this game.  I simply can't.  It is a fun game and unique being a JRPG action based game.  The story is great, the characters are colorful and it's not bad in that department.  What it fails in is it's playthrough.  Some parts didn't make sense at all where to go next and some parts totally made sense.  I found myself looking at a guide vs the clues it gave me for my next objective, the game could have worded it better.Another aspect was control.  I'm not sure about KB but I'd recommend a controller.  Even with a 360 controller, the control was sometimes very stiff.  In most action games I've played, if you have to button mash and change directions the character would usually do that automatically, here it does not.  You have to stop turn then resume your attack if you want to change directions.  A thing someone can forget in the heat of battle.  Also jumping/attacking just feels sluggish and inaccurate.Finally, the enemies.  While at first it's not bad at all; about midway point through the game.  The stupid switch gets turned on....BAD!  I've never seen such enemies become super smart on normal mode.  They know when your gonna jump (they counter it), they know when to avoid a trap just at the right moment, they know when to dodge, and know when to attack.  It's like super smart, I'm only human!  Also enemies are VERY relentless AND brutal.  They will chase you down, spam attacks, while at the same time predicting your every move.  Amazingly, it was only boss fights that weren't as brutal compared to normal enemies.I got this game for $10 and for the most part it is worth it, but if you can't get past these flaws.  If controller or really unfair enemies isn't in your forte then don't get this game.  On the bright side, the game is VERY forgiveable about restarting as you'll resume in the last room your in.  This doesn't change how I feel, doing this just makes the game feel sorry for you and is frustrating to retry something just because the enemies are brutally unfair.			"

												""Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone"" is a sidescrolling action RPG developed by a japanese indie developer Lizsoft and localised by Carpe Fulgur. In this game, you follow the story of a young girl named Arche, who will learn new things, make new friends, and go on a grand adventure in order to reveal the secret behind a certain artifact, along with her hidden powers.When I saw this game in the Steam Store, it looked interesting and unique, so I bought it. After playing it, I must say that I really loved it. This is in my opinion a one of a kind game, which is a combat-based platformer wih an anime art-style, classical music and action jRPG elements.The audiovisual presentation is really good. The music is really good, and is a joy to listen to. It is mostly made of classical-style compositions, which are definitely vivid and not generic. The visuals, bearing a 16-bit aesthetic, are gorgous as well. They are colourful are well detailed, characters are pretty well animated. The actual anime artwork of characters in the game is actually really pretty as well. The enviroments are varied, every area looks interesting and unique. You will travel through mountain paths, dungeons, watery caves, medieval cities and more.The combat system is quite nice. The game is quite challenging, as the foes and level design do not hold back. Enemy AI will make them block, jump, evade and use attacks depending on the situation, just pressing the attack button repetitively without any other action(like with ettins in Hexen 1) will not get you anywhere. A lot of enemies require different tactics to beat them, so use you brain effectively there. There are even a few bosses indluded, be prepared.  Over the course of the game, you will have two playable sidekicks added to your party(and a third one, that is passive). You can play as one of the three people in the party, without spoiling anything, one is a powerful short-range attacker, second is a mostly healing mage, and the last one is a mostly offensive mage.  Don't worry, they definitely are not plagued by the likes of retail version Daikatana sidekick AI, they will not get blocked by geometry and will follow you without having to babysit them. Just like the enemies, they will do things depending on the situation. If someone in the party is hurt, someone will heal you with a spell, if there's a lot of enemies, they will use powerful attacks, if there's a tough enemy, they will use buff spells, and so on. During the game, you can adjust what the AI is supposed to be doing with just a press of a few hotkeys. You can set their behavior to follow you, stop dead in their tracks or just fight whoever they want without needing to follow you. What kind of magic spells they are allowed to use can be managed too, you can set to not use magic, only heal, use powerful attacks, use buff spells, and burn their magic power as fast as possible. You can also set the camera to be static, dynamic or locked onto an enemy. Arche, the sword using character, relies on not so easy to pull off button combinations to perform attacks, later in the game she learns more combos, making fights easier. Mages generally rely on holding the button and letting go of it to cast a spell, so playing as one of them an letting Arche go berserk could be easier for some people. There is also a quickheal button, status effects are cured before wounds, mind that. Don't forget that during battle, applying items takes longer time.The game is a metroidvania, therefore it's not a linear platformer where you just hunt the exit. You will go around towns and dungeons, and look and ask people around to ask for clues in order to progress through the plot. The game often involves puzzles, where you push things to solve them. In some cases, the game might get too cryptic, but that's not that much of an issue. You can only save in certain spots, however if you all your characters get K.O.'d you are given the option to restart at the beginning of the last room you were in, or be taken to the last safe area you've been in at the cost of 10% of your money. When a character gets K.O.'d, she can not be used at all. The only way to revive her is to use a special item or return to a safe area, or perhaps find a regenerating spot.The story, due to involving cute little girls, is somewhat light-hearted, but it is actually interesting and gripping. During the course of the game, some serious business will be going on, especially at the end. The game is quite humorous, some adult jokes are even thrown in, so the story absolutely is not bad. The characters have their distinct personalities, the main protagonists consist of an energetic, brave and spontanous girl, a shy, but kind-hearted girl, and a cynical, easily annoyed, somewhat selfish, yet intelligent and helpful girl, and a cheerful cute animal, who speaks.You will level up and gain new items as you progress, some of them have unique effects, so make sure to upgrade your characters correctly. The world contains a lot of secret areas and items, look them up, they totally can be helpful! There's also a few sidequests, so after you beat the game you will still have some things to do.There is also a bonus mode, where you can see the characters autoplay an early portion of the game without your input. Unique, but not very exciting, to be honest. There is also a versus mode, where you can fight against characters from your party(except that you can totally have four of the same character on the battlefield). It is either AI vs. AI, or player vs. AI. Can be 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2. There further you are in the game, the more features that mode has. It is kind of cool. You can have fun with it.Game does not support Steam Overlay, and can run in a window, fullscreen(with bad resolution for some), and fullscreen with border, making the whole game take place on a square in the middle. However, you can still use F11 to make screenshots, so for that matter you will be fine, check guides on how to inject them into Steam.In conclusion, this a very great game, that sadly is not very well known. If you like challenging games, anime artstyles and not too serious stories, go for it and buy it, you will be in a treat!			"

												Lots of reviewers bash Fortune Summoners for its ""unfair"" difficulty, but that is not true. This game is hard and sometimes frustrating, but if you think it's unfair then you need to practice more and stop mashing buttons mindlessly, because it's not going to work in this game. The good news is that once you start figuring out how to beat each type of enemy properly, it becomes incredibly fun. It gets a LOT better and easier once you get the 3rd party member and more skills/spells though, too bad it takes a while.You will have to master the controls, your available skills (each one exists for a reason, do not ignore them), strategies for each enemy, item/mana management, and your ANGER. No, really, you WILL get mad at times and you WILL want to just jump at that little ****er with all guns blazing, but that will only make it worse. Stop, think, try different approaches, observe his movements, defend, and most importantly: do NOT be stingy with recovery items and mana. They are there to be used and abused. Do not expect to get by most fights without recovering or using spells.This is looking more like a guide than a review.. Let's just say I greatly recommend this game as long as you know what to expect from it and isn't afraid of a challenge.			"

The reason for most negative reviews, and why you can (probably) ignore thoseAt the time of writing this, from what I can see, almost all of the recent negative reviews are due to lagging and low FPS, but please don't let that turn you away from such a great game, because it's highly likely that you can fix this without much trouble.In explaining, I also had poor FPS until I researched and found the reason explained and a simple solution given by Toff here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/203510/discussions/0/846963165559152822/THAT SAID, if you read some posts in that thread, some people haven't been so lucky. Therefore..If unsure if it'll work, you can just try the fix on the demo version:The simple solution is to download the demo, apply the fix, and if it doesn't lag, buy the game. If it still continues to lag, it's a bummer and my heart is sad for you, but hey, no money lost and no need to go through a refund process.			"

												This is an incredible game. It's gameplay and AI are nuanced and clever, making for a challenging and engaging combat system in which both your enemies and allies make intelligent moves.

												This game is pretty fun. Fair warning: There's a fair amount of forced backtracking, as well as a lack of direction, so i'm going to recommend a guide so that you can know where to go, because the game is EXTREMELY vague and will NOT tell you sometimes. Other than that, the game is pretty great. The combat feels good, the bosses are fun, and the difficulty is high, even on the lowest setting. If you like tough action games then this is for you. If you don't like a challenge then steer clear, this game is quite difficult.			"

												Carpe Fulgur does excellent translations of Japanese games, and while Recettear was a massive hit for its item shop, Fortune Summoners is a bit more standard. It's a 2D dungeon crawler with AI companions you can switch to and fighting game-esque moves for main character Arche, many of which you learn as you progress. The plot and writing are on par with Carpe Fulgur's prior works, though there is a lack of ""Capitalism! Ho!"" moments.The combat early on is centered around Arche and the tight swordplay she provides, with a heavy emphasis on spacing. Later on, though, the party acquires not one but two squishy mages whose heavy artillery evolves the flavor of combat over time, as some encounters become obliterated in a flood of water or explosion of fire. When Arche finally gets a use for that MP bar of hers, using it gives *everything* a radically different flavor.In all, highly recommended.			"

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING.The combat is deceptively deep and active for a game with a veneer of a cute and simple action platformer.  The amount of finesse the game demends of you in controlling Arche's swordplay is really satisfying to a dedicated player.  That said, I can see how the difficulty might turn people away.  The party system and the AI for party members is actually impressively responsive and adaptive.  Your allies feel like real people, and are not often a source of frustration.The plot is intriguing, and has an undertone of Magical Girl anime, but not the kind that gets wrapped up in its genre trappings.  It really takes care to construct a world and real characters that have a lot of dimension.  Again, CarpeFulgur's OUTSTANDING localization shows through.Highly recommended for action RPG fans, fans of quirky action games, and magical girl fans.			"

												Fortune Summoners is a side-scrolling/platformer/puzzle/hack'n'slash/JRPG. Many people have likened it to Dark Souls, however I have never played Dark Souls so I wouldn't know. All I know is that I really fell in love with this game, and it broke my heart. Allow me to explain.The story starts a young girl named Arche whose family has just moved into a new town, and she has enrolled in the local magic school. From there she and her two new friends embark on adventures around the countryside, exploring caves, helping people and such. There is more to the story, but I shan't spoil it for you.Before I talk about anything else, I must address (as just about every review does) the controls. They aren't the easiest to learn and master, but it is possible if you just practice. One should definitely not expect to have mastered them without putting in at least an hour practicing against some basic enemies - you won't be able to beat this game by simply spamming the attack button - but I whole heartedly encourage anyone who likes a challenge to keep at it. The sense of accomplishment is well worth it.I should emphasise that THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING - do not let it's happy-go-lucky illustrations and music fool you. The vast majority of negative reviews simply slate the controls. I can only assume those players didn't know what they were getting into and just gave up without taking the time to get to grips with the controls. Coupled with the surprisingly fiendish AI it will take some time to master.Now, I have completed this game and from start to finish I was charmed by the characters, the simplistic yet elegeant storyline, the pleasant and atmospheric music, and the challenge that the game itself presented. You remember all those games you played as a kid, you know, those ones 'that you never managed to beat'? This is what this game was to me. It gave me a sense of nostalgia even though I'd never played it before, and a sense of longing for that time when you're just a child playing your first RPG for the first time, and everything is so whimsical and fascinating.Sadly, this story does have a sad ending, hence my broken heart.Just as I was thinking that the game was about to explode into a larger world ripe for the exploring, it ended, and I was presented with the classic 'To Be Continued' message. Undeterred I sought out any sign of a sequel, and unfortunately Lizsoft - the studio that made the game - has since stopped operating.In conclusion, there will be no sequel. EVER.The three girls will never get to finish the grand adventure that only just seemed to be starting when the game came to an end, and that is how this game broke my heart.Nevertheless, I fully recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience that retro-like challenge combined with a simple yet engaging storyline. This game really did make me feel like a kid again, and I can't say that about many games.Just be prepared for the gut-wrenching lack of closure at the end.			"

												Decided to nominate this game for the last unnamed, as of writing this review, steam award category.Called it ""The really really hard to notice small gems"", because calling it ""underrated indie game"" would be sad.I'll keep the review short. The story is rather simple. You play as a swordsman's daughter who follows in his footsteps. She also goes to school. The roads are a bit dangerous, but that is a good enough reason to take out your sword and swing it around, eh?The graphics are quite eye pleasing, in the style of old-school 16bit. The sprite art is nice. Though it depends on the person whether he'll like such art or not.Music and sounds are pretty good, not too memorable but doesn't hurt the ear.As for the gameplay... For those who are not used to tight controls and don't have a gamepad this could be torture.  Otherwise you will most definitely find a challenging game with controls that require learning and feel quite rewarding. Some compare it to Dark Souls, though I'm not 100 percent about that. The game does reward the player for learning how to properly combat enemies with interesting combos which deal much more damage than seperate hits.In overall, this is the game that should be played by people looking for a challenge, from somewhere else rather than the mainstream majority. If you're interested in a side-scrolling RPG adventure made by a small gaming studio - do consider picking up this lil' gem.			"

												Simple and cute looking 2D actione adventure game with a bit higher difficulty.Fortune Summoners has a good and child like story, what could be aimed to a younger audiance but there are still plenty of things even more mature people can enjoy and laugh at. The difficulty is a bit hard, its not like you could easily run through enemies. Until the end eniemies can easily kill you and if you go into places you not suppost to be with your current level you will fall flat on your face very quickly. Still the game is not grindy, you level up very fast inside the dungeons with your currenty mission. Same also for earning money.good things:- story- sound- voice acting (japanese only)- anime style grafics- boss fights - A.I. partners  (very helpfull and reacting quite good in the fight for themself)bad things:- platforming (you slide a bit after you land causing you to overshoot the platform)- controls (with keyboard takes awhile to get use to it)- high spikes of difficulty special then you beginn the game (but you can lower the difficulty of the game) "

												A difficult, technical side-scrolling dungeon crawler with a refreshingly lighthearted tone. Your main character is not a chosen hero on a quest to save the world; she's an adventurous girl who wants to get an elemental stone so she can practice magic with her classmates.The game's combat seems very strange at first - I immediately noticed that jamming the attack button did not perform any kind of combo; rather I just kept swinging my sword in the same way. To combo, you actually have to use different attacks via directional inputs plus the attack button and chain them together. The fact that each attack differs widely in terms of attack radius, range, and speed means that every attack is useful in some respect, and makes properly performing combos and using them in the right circumstances somewhat of an art.This is a really cool system that makes even the simplest fights enjoyable, and that's without even considering the enemies and their behaviors.Enemies are tough. The first slimes I fought posed a challenge, as rather than flopping around at snail-speeds and waiting five seconds before striking, they actually moved quite quickly, performed several types of attacks, and seemed quite adept at jumping to avoid my sloppy strikes. The game does not hold your hand in combat, and rather than coaching you through every aspect, it expects you to pay attention and learn. Yes, this game actually respects your intelligence as a human being - thank heavens for that.Within half an hour or so, I had learned to be patient while fighting. To block, to dodge, to poke quickly at enemies with fast attacks and retreat, and to counter aerial attacks with well-timed uppercuts. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts to learn the combat system come to fruition, let me tell you.I haven't played enough of the game to give full impressions just yet, but I'm already having an absolute blast with the combat, and as someone who's rather picky about combat in games, that's saying something.

												Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone is side-scrolling japanese action RPG developed by LizSoft and localized by Carpe Fulgur. Story is set in the country of Scotsholm and follows an energetic 10-year old girl Arche as she and her family just moved in town of Tonkiness.As you progress through the game, two more girls will join Arche - Sana, a water-type magician specialized in support and crowd control magic (beware of the nice ones - Sana gains insanely powerful offensive spells near the end of the game), and Stella, a fire-type magician specialized in offensive magic. Those two girls can as well be controlled (and will be required to pass certain point - you might easily get frustrated once you get to those points without them only to figure out you need them), albeit only one at a time - AI will control the other two and WILL ASSIST you. Playstyle with each of the 3 characters is different, so you can pick whoever you're most comfortable with.Why did I emphasized ""AI will assist""? Because, unlike most games with AI controlled partners, AI in Fortune Summoners is great at doing its job. Girls will attack and defend themselves, use magic, assist you with supportive spells, coordinate their attacks with you etc. You can also modify AI's behavior - how often will it use spells (none of the characters regenerates mana), which spells will it use and other parameters so you can configure the AI for each situation.Opponent AI is equally good. Opponents will dodge your attacks, try to strike you from vulnerable spot, use their spells, parry your attacks, and do everything like human opponent would do. That alone raises challenge to 11, and on several places (beginning of the game, flying opponents, DAMNED HARPIES for example) it might get highly frustrating. Beating flying opponents is especially difficult as Arche learns Moonsault technique (""spinning sword in midair"") fairly late in the game.Controls need some time to adjust to. As you start with the game, there will be some difficulties in controlling characters - especially Arche, who uses sword to fight, and controls might seem to be unresponsive. However, there isn't any fake difficulty - manuevering through map and battles need a good timing on the button pressing, similar to the fighter games. Due to that, once you get a feel for controls, you'll just mow down everything in your path.In conclusion, fun and interesting game. Graphic style might repel someone, learning curve as well. If you give it a try and some time, you might be satisfied with this hidden little gem.Definite recommendation for anyone who wants a little challenge and nice story.			"

												tl,dr: The story is well made.  Keep your AI on the fighter as much as possible.  And probably keep the difficulty on easy.  The enemy AI in this game punishes you for almost any kind of movement.ADDED:I would like to add this to my original review.  The gameplay is well made.  The problem is that the AI will punish you for any normal action.  Jump over an enemy?  They react almost instantly and will wail on you for it.  You can't get a single string of attacks in even on easy mode.  They can, and likely will, beat the living daylights out of you.  Bring healing items at all times.Original:Fortune Summoners is, from what I played, a good story.  It isn't a good platform RPG for those wondering about the gameplay.Reason: It's the difficulty and the controls.First off, the difficulty.  The enemies can deal a significant amount of damage in such a short amount of time.  Not only that but they can knock you down or render you unable to even fight.  All this in normal difficulty.If it were only the difficulty this game would be fun.  It's not.  The controls for the fighter are so contrived and stiff it makes even the most simplest of fights like a battle for your life.  I generally run past them when I am given the opportunity.Am I being too hard on this game?  No.  The game is making it hard on itself.  The first boss you will encounter will decimate you if you play the fighter.  Try fighting with those controls with actions that are hard to fire off.Although, credit due where it is given.  Their AI for both the enemy and your allies are well done.  Especially for the fighter.Returning to the first boss fight and letting the AI take control of the fighter while controlling the mage/healer.  The fight is much, much more easier.Still, I intend on playing this to the end.  But I am going to keep the difficulty on easy and I'm going to have the AI control the fighter for any available moment.			"

												This is a great game. Totally recommend it.Pros:+ The atmosphere of the game is very charming. The storyline is out of a fairy-tale book.+ Fun combat, especially when you got 3 girls together.+ Good companion AI, mostly.Cons:- A little of going back and forth to towns and dungeons, but I find it ok due to fun combat.- A few time it is not obvious how to progress the story line, especially in town. You have to talk to a specific person (which sometimes not obvious if you did not pay good attention when talking to NPCs).- In later parts of the game, it can be confusing in battle when your girls and enemies casting several spells at once and the screen is filled with special effects.- Not much variety or interesting dungeon design. Cave, Tower, Dungeon. They all look the same.Design choices that may irritate some people:- Limited inventory space and limited number of each item. This make the game more difficult. Your equipment and ""dressing up clothings"" are counted as part of the limit! Which I personally hate (I want to dress up the girls but doing so will be wasting space)- Timer when using item in battle (about 1-2 seconds). Again make it more difficult because in the later stages your whole party can be wiped out in 5 seconds. The game lets you restart from the previous screen though (and just record your party death number.)Comments:Many people may find the combat a bit difficult, which is partially true. You have to learn enemy strength and weakness and how to use the girls' abilities according to a given situation. Some people complains about the control, but I find it very crisp and unforgiving. When something happened unintentionally, it is always your mistake in inputing combos. This game plays like a fighting game. Your skill is as equally important as your stats and equipment. I'd say that the combat is difficult but fair.Another minor complaint is that in the 2 last dungeons both you and enemies are powerful, so sometimes outcome of similar battles can differ widely depending on the sequence of what happening. For example, I can usually wipe the floor with Orgs+Mages enemies, but sometimes **** happens and they kill my healer or mage first and wipe the floor with my party instead. Also, I lost badly in the final battle for 3-4 times, but when I won I won quite easily (without changing tactics).Final Verdict:Totally recommended for action rpg fans that find challenge in taking control of combat personally similar to a fighting game. If you don't like fighting games you may become frustrate with combat.			"

												While this game has a lot in common with the other works localized by Carpe Fulgur, it is miles behind even the level of polish on EasyGameStation titles. I recommend the game overall, but be warned that it aggravates on multiple levels. Don't pick it up if you're not willing to tolerate the cons below.Having said that, the characters were memorable enough that I think back on it fondly.Pros:+ It really is just as adorable as it looks.+ The combat is more involved than the mindless hack and slash in a lot of Recettear.+ The animation has some cute details, like the way Sana transitions from a run to a slide-crouch.+ The soundtrack is fun! I particularly enjoy how it reacts dynamically to the aggregate difficulty of combat.+ While not particularly novel, the characters are robust enough to get attached to.Cons:- It really _is_ as adorable as it looks.

												Put about thirty hours into this; loved it for what it was - though I was a little disappointed that it is apparently a TBC game in terms of story, and from what I've found out, there's no sequel. I got my money's worth out of the game and for its difficulty, it amps up quickly, I was a little frustrated at points, but mainly just due to the challenge of it. It was a good amount of fun for the challenge given.			"

												While this game has a lot in common with the other works localized by Carpe Fulgur, it is miles behind even the level of polish on EasyGameStation titles. I recommend the game overall, but be warned that it aggravates on multiple levels. Don't pick it up if you're not willing to tolerate the cons below.Having said that, the characters were memorable enough that I think back on it fondly.Pros:+ It really is just as adorable as it looks.+ The combat is more involved than the mindless hack and slash in a lot of Recettear.+ The animation has some cute details, like the way Sana transitions from a run to a slide-crouch.+ The soundtrack is fun! I particularly enjoy how it reacts dynamically to the aggregate difficulty of combat.+ While not particularly novel, the characters are robust enough to get attached to.Cons:- It really _is_ as adorable as it looks.

												Cute lolis with swords and magic, a story that's heartwarming and light, yet engaging and a difficulty that reminds me of the classic JRPGs and like. While I do agree the controls _could_ be a bit better, they're far from unusable. They're also not that bad once you get to them. The strange movement inertia on anything you do is annoying at first, but once you get the hang of it you can compensate your timings accordingly. I see a lot of people complain the game is impossibly difficult but I'm on my first playthrough on hard and while it's certainly challening, it's definitely nothing new to people who are familiar with ""difficult"" games like Ys and the like. As mentioned in some other reviews, buttom mashing is a one way ticket to an endless loop of dying. Learn your combos and figure out what works on what enemies. What you can use on a slime won't work on a mothbee. What works on a mothbee most certainly won't work on a Cocorat. What works on a Cocorat won't work on a Merkid Mage. Each character you use will obviously require different tactics to use and with each character, your combos and tactic will again change depending on which enemy. It's a challenging game in that you need to be able to quickly execute, chain and modify your tactics as you go because rarely will you ever be fighting just one type of monster at a time. The game itself is immensely adorable and the localization by Carpe Fulgur is absolutely fantastic. If you're like me, you'll come to love the characters very quickly. (And also feel terrible when you accidentally die. Whoops) The art is definitely a double thumbs up and the variety of character portraits for dialogue really add to the atmosphere and feeling of the game. One thing I also want to highly praise is the music. I know it's not an international award winning soundtrack or anything, but the cutesy, lighthearted music is really enjoyable.Overall, just be prepared for a steep learning curve that'll be mercilessly brutal, but once you get the hang of it and you get the ball rolling, oh boy oh boy is this an enjoyable game. Arche's adorable.			"

												The combat is pretty cool. When you're the swordsgirl, it's almost like Super Smash Bros. This is definitely not a button mash game, and the game is most rewarding when you improvise your combos. As with most RPGs, you can always grind if it gets too difficult, which doesn't seem long if you see it as an opportunity to hone your sword skills.The thing that stands out in this game is the AI. Some enemies have perfect reaction time, which makes it seem like they can predict your moves and counter whatever you do. If you like learning enemy patterns and countering them, this is the game for you. Even if you suck, your allies are strong enough that they can bail you out.Money is plentiful in the game, so you can always adventure with good healing items. You'll still need to save up for better equipment, though. You won't have to worry about permanently missing any items, but a walkthrough will make sure you get them all. In fact, I highly suggest using one with maps for the dungeons. I find myself going in circles a lot because I forget where I had already explored.The cute art and dialogue makes up for its lackluster plot, which ends on a bit of a cliffhanger. I heard that the developer(s) won't make a sequel because it didn't sell well. It's a shame, because the swordsgirl learns some very cool magic spells, but the only good time to use it is for the final boss.			"

												Very impressive title.Combat is robust and quite visceral for a seemingly archaic sidescroller beat-em-up. Characters run, jump, and slide with convincing weight and momentum. Weapons and attacks feel meaty and very satisfying. Attacks and animations require time and commitment: button-mashing will get you nowhere. Swordfighting with large groups is unabashedly frenetic at times.Translation errs on the side of being a little silly, but is quirky enough to help the story and characters be quite memorable.			"

To the game itself: It was a really nice experience, awesome combat style and charming characters. Japanese voices are also nice. (even if there aren't much). It is however very hard with it's AI which seems to always find your weaknesses regardless if you are a strategist or a button-masher. Definite recommendation to everyone who likes JRPGs, cute characters and calming ""Field"" BGM.

You can change the difficulty between four settings, and there's an additional menu where you can modify the keyboard or controller controls. The gameplay is really smooth, and the only bug I've encountered is a small glitch where you can't draw your weapon after leaving the school--I fixed it by saving at the nurse and restarting my game, haven't encountered it since.Pros:artLolisStory, cutscenes, and dialogueUnique, elaborate dungeonsSmart enemy AI (They dodge attacks and stuff)Comfortable controls that are easy to learnMultiple ways to playCan run on low specsInteractable environmentAnimated spritesCons:Not fullscreen.

												A 2D side-scrolling action RPG with fantastic visuals, strong fighting mechanics and an adorable, likeable cast.  The combat in particular is the highlight, with the key to fighting being parrying enemy attacks, taking note of their patterns and going in when you have the opportunity- not one for mashing buttons wildly. It is possible to get stuck with what to do next to advance the story (it's mostly 'tak to everyone first') but its cheery visuals/feel and engaging combat mechanics make it an easy recommendation.Also you can dropkick slimes.I wrote a more in-depth review here if you want to learn more about this little gem:http://www.retrocollect.com/Reviews/indie-review-fortune-summoners-secret-of-the-elemental-stone-pcsteam.html "

												Short version: A fun, enjoyable side-scrolling 2D action game with some RPG elements and puzzles, only held back by the occasionally confusing combat from being truly great.Long version: There's a lot to like about Fortune Summoners. The sprite art is just lovely, you can see a lot of love went into the graphics. Even the main characters' idle animations perfectly reflect their personalities. The characters themselves are, well, little girls who go on adventures through caves and dungeons. The story, told mostly through dialogue boxes, is fairly simple and straightforward, but charming in its own way. Talking to NPCs is mostly optional, but it reveals more about the characters and the world they live in. They even have to ask their parents for permission to go out adventuring!The gameplay consists of controlling the party of one-to-three characters. The players controls only one character at the time, the AI controls the others, and it's possible to change the controllable character with the press of a button, even in the heat of battle. Technically this means it's possible to attack the enemy with the melee character, switch to the fire-throwing mage and burn them until they're dead, and finally switch to the healer and bring everyone's HP back up.In practice, it's more likely that the player sticks to the melee character (the main character of the story) and just lets the AI handle the others. The AI does a good job and doesn't require handholding, and it's even possible to tweak the AI settings per character.As the story progresses, the party visits several towns to heal up, stock up on items and purchase new equipment, while also exploring dungeons searching for whatever they need to find there, as mandated by the narrative. Naturally, there's enemies abound, which leads to the game's most problematic part: the combat.At first the combat feels great. As the sword-wielding main character, the player has several different attacks at their disposal: Down + Attack for a quick forward thrust, Up + Attack for an upreaching swipe with which to hit flying enemies, and so on. More sword techniques are learned as the character levels up, requiring slightly more complex button combinations. At this point the combat feels nice and methodical: block the enemy's attack, thrust, slash, block again, roll behind him, slash some more, and so on. It's fun.Unfortunately, at some point the enemies become numerous (though never more than 5-6 at a time) and the combat often becomes a confusing mess. Colorful spells fly, enemies swoop and jump around, the AI party members do their own thing, and the player is left wondering just what is going on. This isn't helped by the fact that some enemies can trap the player into a loop: they pick the character up, toss them down, then come back for another go or three before the character can even get up. The enemies can also dodge attacks proficiently, and it feels if the player and an enemy attack each other at the same time, the enemy's attack always has priority. This can be quite frustrating. The game's dungeons can be large, and there are no maps of any kinds available, so a good sense of direction (or making your own maps) is recommended. Some dungeons also have puzzles that need to be solved, mostly of the block-pushing variety. But they're never terribly hard, so they don't kill the flow of the game.With a run through the game lasting about 25 hours it certainly has a nice length to it, but in the end I was personally getting weary of the combat. I'd still recommend the game, though.			"

												I have renamed this game to ""Kawaii Souls"". The art work is cute and the character designs are cute. The game story is fairly well made, other than the fact that it takes every opportunity to force you to explore a hardcore dungeon. I was kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the 'hot springs arc', the part where the party of adventurous magical school girls goes to an Onsen for a field trip and I was so keen on seeing the artworks for that but...I had to explore 2 dungeons before getting to the Onsen and guess what happens when I get to the Onsen? ****SPOILERS**** The Onsen is dry... ****SPOILERS END**** Now here we go to explore a few more dungeons. I stopped playing for quite a while after that.It may sound easy to you, 'pfffft... a few school girls clearing dungeons, it'll just be one of those easy Japanese made weeaboo games.' Well, you are wrong, for the most part. There is a reason why I chose to call this game ""Kawaii Souls"". Because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥, therefore I hereby make a Dark Souls reference. I play on normal and the monsters are so hard to kill, oh my god, I sometimes contemplate killing myself. But it's a good point, to some, the combat AI is amazing. I feel like the AI learns the way you fight, and calculate strategies on how to break the way you fight. Normally there would be a sequence that each mob follow in combat situations in other games, and you just have to figure out that sequence and you'd get through the game easy. But it's the complete opposite in this game, if you don't constantly improve and change the way you fight, the AI would kill you off, easy.Other than the amazing...ly hard combat, the dialogue and story is quite good too. The humourous and cute (omg the babbling Sana, so cute, kya kya) dialogues always cheer me up after spending hours trying to clear a dungeon. But sometimes I wonder what's actually keeping me here playing this game...Overall, 8/10 game with over 20 hours gameplay. Would play again.			"

Big chunk of world to explore, a LOT of humor (mostly parodies on action RPG stuff, for example - armored bikini for women). As for combat - if (and most likely you will) u're going to play as pretty much main character only - u'll gonna have to do a very precise combat maneurs. Especially since the further u go the more u're gonna need to block and parry. This is a great game not only for anime and Japan fans in Europe and USA, but also for people who just want a very fun experience.P.S.

There are MANY annoying aspects to the game. There's no map, and many sections of the maze like dungeons you roam around in look very nearly identical to each other. Enemies spam attacks in ways that are occasionally overwhelming. Status effects...are all evil. There's the constant knockdowns and the poison that won't quit. The sleep that if you're lucky only guarantees you get hit once or twice, and can otherwise disable a character for around thirty seconds. The confusion that will cause Arche to slaughter the rest of the party mercilessly! Fortune Summoners is punishing, but it isn't so unforgiving. In the typical worst case scenario you can restart at the last room transition from the game over screen. Later in the game I would just take the death if an encounter went too sour for me. Gearing up properly and figuring out the right amount of caution to approach a situation with is very helpful, but there are going to be cheap shots constantly regardless of what you do.Some weird issues with multi-monitor setups. The game will begin to slow down when you have any menu open, it gets slower the longer you run the game. PC Gaming Wiki has a (psuedo) fix for this, but I still started to get slowdown after about two hours in session. Outside of the combat, the game has a fairly charming goonies/rascal theme going on about it, as you run about becoming a master social engineer, breaking everyone's luggage, stealing people's underwear, commiting genocide and eating various other humanoid creatures ('canned salmon' and 'chicken leg' indeed). Adults are about as negligent as you'd find in any children's story. There's what I'd call a fairly standard RPG level of exploration, mostly hidden nooks and crannies, like you'd find in grandia or some of the older final fantasy games. Some spotty platforming, characters have a lot of momentum in movement and it takes a bit of getting used to. Definitely recommend playing with a controller. Oh and there are a number of clever, simple puzzles, nothing really challenging, but a bit creative. Fortune Summoners is a competent action RPG, that falls short in several ways. It will challenge, it will frustrate and annoy. Some people find that rewarding I suppose. As a final note, I don't normally like to talk price, but I'm 100% confident there are better games to pick up for $20 or less. If you're curious I suggest you try the demo and if you enjoy that, well, it's bound to go on sale eventually.			"

												Don't be fooled by this game. The game looks very girlish but this game has one of the best AI I've ever seen. Its got some fighting elements to it but it is mainly an adventure RPG and a rather difficult one too. As you are getting used to the controls and the lack of moves you have available at the start of the game the AI will just destroy you by yourself. At these points in the game it isn't very fun but if you can tough through it you'll eventually gain party members and then its starts getting fun. Grinding is pretty big in this game if you don't like getting destroyed by the AI. Some of the dungeons in this game are confusing as well, near the end of the game they get very big and there is no map, but i guess it forces you to grind while figuring out where to go.All in all, if you're gonna play this game be prepared to get your ♥♥♥ kicked the first few hours (but it'll be worth it).

												While the ending is unlikely to satisfy, Fortune Summoners is a side-scrolling action RPG worth playing.  Between bouts of gleefully jumping and stabbing things, I got more enjoyment out of the moe girl dialogue than is socially acceptable for a man of my age.The controls take some getting used to and it's possible to get stuck facing the wrong direction.  However, it all functions and I enjoyed the various moves of the melee character when I could pull them off.  Outside of a few boss battles and puzzles, I left the spellcasters to the AI due to the difficulty of switching between spells with a gamepad.  Keyboard users may have more luck.Some grinding is advised for unlocking abilities.  However, I suggest avoiding the money-grinding trap I fell into when gaining access to an endgame piece of equipment that probably didn't matter.  I set the game aside for ages because of the chore it became.  I should have just beat it and left happy.  This review would be much more glowing if I had written it months ago when the bulk of the game was still fresh in my memory.Note that multimonitor users may wish to turn their extra monitors off as the game performance is affected.Thanks go to Isotower developer Todd Barchok who celebrated his birthday by handing out gifts.  I had fun. =)			"

												Fortune summoners is an action RPG featuring 3 cute little girls going out on an adventure. The story is pretty great, the artwork is polished, it has a memorable and fitting soundtrack.The story talks about Arche, a girl who just moved over to the town of Tonkiness, and now attends the Minasa-Ratis school, where students are being taught about magic using their elemental stone. Not having a coin to spare for an elemental stone however, Arche ends up not being able to learn magic. As a result, she decides to go on an adventure with her new friends to find her own elemental stone.The only thing that may get on the nerve of some players is the stiff controlls. This is NOT a button-mashing combat game. The delays are put in there on purpose, which raises the difficulty drastically. The main character, Arche, wields a sword and is reliant on street fighter-like combos (which is why the delays were implemented i think) to use special moves. The other playable characters use magic, which function on selecting a spell, then casting them after a brief amount of time. This allows for some variety when playing the game.Overall this is a great game, and was well worth my money. If you enjoy anime or a good game, this is something you want to try out.			"

												Fortune Summoners is a tough as nails platformers combined with a visual novelesque story about cute lolis girls going on adventures. The game uses animation based combat like dark souls games where you must commit to your attacks and the enemies will punish you if you button mash. The difficulty ramps up extremely after the demo but becomes more managable when you get the third character in the game. The ai on both enemies and npc characters are extremely good and often you will be jealous on how good the the npc ai is in comparison to yourself in the beginning. If you struggle with the main character if you can  press on and get the third character the difficulty curve is fair as long as you explore.The game mostly killing monsters, occassionally solving puzzles, back tracking and finding items to stock your papa's store. the combat is very engaging and skill based, its often difficult to out level the content in early portions of the game because you need to collect these items called mark of heroism to increase your wallet size and level cap. The first character plays like a traditional sword fighting character that uses fighting game inputs to use abilities. The second character is a healer that has status abilities that supports the party that gets a heavy damage ability late in the game. The third character is a dps aoe mage and like the healer requires cast time to use spells but have weak basic attacks.The game has some technical issues like buttons are extremely precise and it has memory leak issue with the menus with multi monitors. Also if you are running Windows 10 or Windows 8 make sure you are running in  window mode because the framerate will dip below 10 fps in battles. The game is definitely worth buying as long as you pick it up on a sale, it has cons like a cliff hanger ending but there is a lot of heart and good gameplay mechanics to be worth the prize tag. a second playthrough allows you to get the all abilities of the main character earned at the start and a optional dungeon quest in the final area if you get the password at the end of the game.If you enjoy the punishing combat of dark souls this title should scratch your itch.

												I'm not sure if I should honestly recommend this to most rather than simply use the 'recommend' feature as a sort of reviewing platform after finishing this unique game.  Here goes;Fortune Summoners is, at its core, an platform-style action-rpg, in the vein of games like Zelda II or Castlevania: SotN.  However, don't expect a feel quite like those; the graphical style and slower gameplay evoke something more like a very polished, offline Maple Story.  But don't let that necessarily deter you.To make a long review short, I'll put it this way: The graphics may seem almost appallingly cutesy at first, but they absolutely grow on you.  The characters and story may seem pathetically shallow and childish at first, but they absolutely grow on you.  The music may not seem special (and indeed, the default battle music you'll hear often early in the game is pretty atrocious) but it absolutely grows on you.  The gameplay... well, frankly, it feels very sloppy and frustrating, but it does, too, grow on you.Really, that's the key here.  The gameplay is... a noble attempt to make your average sidescrolling hack-n'-slash much deeper and more involved than you may be used to.  In fact, I'd say it's rather TOO deep for how straightforward and, frankly, enjoyable, the rest of the game is; swordplay is rather needlessly over-complex and it can be difficult to pull off specific moves when you need them most, even with a gamepad and lots of practice.  But as you work your way through the game, improve statistically and most importantly grow your party, this becomes less and less of an issue -- though still somewhat of an annoyance here and there.Overall, though, I can't deny that this game utterly charmed me and once it was over, I found myself quite satisfied.  If you feel brave enough to attempt to overcome the flaws of what is otherwise a gem, I certainly do recommend it to you.			"

												Fortune Summoners is a sidescrolling action RPG in which you play as cute little girls who attend a magic school. They go on adventures, they laugh, the cry, and they beat the tar out of just about everything they encounter - although only after they've been brow beaten by enemy attacks such that they learn to fight correctly.The game is cute, features some enjoyable classical music, and has a very tight combat system. Many players label it as very hard, although by the time you've got all three girls on your party, you should have past some of the more difficult obstacles. I cannot stress enough that the combat is very well thought out, although I found it just at the point of being repetative by the end of the game.The game ends way too abruptly and feels like any/every anime where the company ran out of time/money and slapped together a ""everything is dealt with for now, but more adventures await! The status quo remains and everyone is happy."" The company obviously had plans to do more with Fortune Summoners, but by this point I think its highly doubtful that we will see any additional content or sequels. On that note, the game's length is just where I liked it, however, they needed to spend time actually writing a conclusion.Overall, I enjoyed Fortune Summoners, I recommend it if it is on sale. You will be better at this game if you are good at platformers rather than RPGs, as precise movements, controls, and combos are the key to fighting effectively.			"

												This is one of those games that is gonna take a lot of time to get used to the controls, which means it's best to get a game controller for this game. This game also categorizes as a ""cutesy"" game since it has little girls. The storyline moves slower than other RPG games, so that is another thing to get used to. Overall: A decent RPG game to grab. Not one of the awesome ones...just one of the ""okay it's good"" ones. P.S Sword combos are your friend!			"

												A lighthearted story about a tomboy,who attends magical school near a small countryside town.Well,it's almost normal school,if you thought of Hogwarts,then you're a little off =) the point is,all students need an ""elemental stone"" to utilize magic.The problem is,it's not a cheap thing.Luckily for our little protagonist,there's supposed to be one in the cave near the town,or so the gossip says...That's a beggining of the story.As for the gameplay-imagine metroidvania with some rather harsh platforming elements(harsh for those who don't know what NES-era platformers was like,that is ;) ),interesting combat system,which strangely resembles that of a ""Tales of"" series a lil' bit, to do any special movies you need to tap buttons,not hold them,which is  GREAT for keyboard users like myself.There's chain specials,combos,blocking and jumping and rolling...and you need to utilize all of that to stay alive on higher difficulty,at least.Also,there's a party members others than little sword-girl,in prologue only one available is Sana,which is your typical ""cleric-type""-healing,killing and occasionly mashing everything close enough with her stick.You can give her a set of commands,which again force you to remember one of Namco's famous RPGs,because battle strategies menu is virtually the same.Did I mention that you can switch between party members any time,which will not only be useful in fights,but outside them as well,because this game also drawn inspiration from ""Lost Vikings"" or some game similar.Arche(that's the name of a little tomboy,yes)can push objects around,while Sana(cleric),can walk underwater.Both of them can pull levers,press buttons,or stand still if need be.Well,you get the idea,yes?CONCLUSION IF YOU WISH TO SKIP THE WALL OF TEXT HERE:Metroidvania meets Lost Vikings and happily goes on a little epic quest.I strongly suggests you to try it.This game is nothing revolutionary,and it wasn't meant to be.Instead,it's just very,very fun.And that is what people play games for,right?

												This game is an… experience. I’m not even sure where to start with this review, so I think I’ll start with an address to something I’ve never felt a need to mention before: The other reviews.This game is not in any fashion like Dark Souls whatsoever, and it’s very disappointing that this statement is immediately added to every single game that people consider to be even remotely difficult… particularly because it’s added for the wrong reasons. Dark Souls was difficult because it was punishing on your mistakes. When you died, it made certain you needed to understand why you died: so that it would not happen again. Failing to learn and making the same mistake twice would result in you losing your experience points, as you needed to be capable of reaching the same place as before, or further, in order to retrieve that experience. The game itself was not very difficult if you understood the mechanics. The swordplay was forgiving, the magic rather powerful, and the paths to victory were easy to understand and reach. Enemies had low HP but did high quantities of damage: You would die in 5 to 6 hits unless you built very tank-like.This game holds none of these traits. Combat is very slidey, Arche constantly moves like she is on ice. It takes a full second to stop moving once you let go of the running key, and more often than not you will be running in-between combat, and even during combat in order to re-position yourself. The combat is nothing special either: as enemies soak up five to fifteen hits, even from the start of the game, as several other reviewers have mentioned, the enemies also seem to read your inputs as you make them, dodging with inhuman accuracy whenever possible. Leave spell casting to the CPU: Slimes will dodge the gouts of water less often if you don’t aim them yourself. As if these faults in the AI weren’t enough, you are knocked back whenever hit, and have no invincibility frames granted to you upon receiving damage. It’s very easy to be knocked into a permanent stun lock, and very difficult to avoid it once the game starts ramping up its difficulty and mob density.Flying enemies are a whole new level of hell. Even your aerial attack (up + x) will do a poor job at handling those foes, and like everything else in this game they will take seven or eight hits to defeat. Honestly I almost threw in the towel then and there, but I presumed things might get better if I moved forward. I regret being so presumptuous. Flying enemies only got mildly easier to deal with, as I figured out when and how to strike them to minimize conflict times. Right as I felt I had the game down to a frustrating but playable science, I encountered a boss fight: A skeleton with a sleeping spell that fills half of the room and must be manually dodged. Even though I could succeed at dodging, my CPU ally performed far more poorly at this act: and constantly was thrown into dreamland, before being executed by the skeleton before they could react. The skeleton would ignore any attempts I made to bash it off my ally, with my meager blows that did 1% of it’s max life each. A part of me considered if I should play the spell caster for this encounter, and when I tried, I discovered the game does a poorer job playing Arche than I do… and honestly I was under the impression I’d been doing pretty poorly at that. I lowered the difficulty to Easy after this, only to discover that I do the exact same amount of damage on easy as I do on Very Hard. The enemies also take the same amount of damage on Very Hard as they do on Easy, and as far as I could tell, their reaction times were just as good as ever. So what did change? You earn less experience if you play on a lower difficulty. I decided to stop playing there, having concluded that Diety difficulty of Civ 5 was a better put together experience than this is, and if I suffer a serious accident in the near future, I am positive my biggest regret in life as I laid on my deathbed would be purchasing this game.

												Not my game im afraid. I much more enjoyed Chantelise and some of the other games like it.Might be cool to see how it progresses though, i didn't give it that much time.I gave it a shot though, and for those who like the genre and have patience and time on their hand might like it.

												I tend not to review games I dont like, but I grabbed this one based on the >90% positive review and was left wondering how it got there... I tried hard to enjoy this game and searched hard to find positive factor but... I dont like it. The main reason is the controls which dont feel confortable and often fail. Jumping and moving with precision are difficult because the amount of inertia given to the character with the two speed movement system (any movement results in substantial sliding when you stop). As a result trying to jump from moving platform to moving platform is more deficult then it needs to be. Another issue comes with the timeing of button presses to activate combo. You get a number of abilities for melee combat on the main character Arche they each have a combination of button presses to activate, but something in the controller detection is finicky and often they wont activate when pressed correctly.The next big issue is the difficulty curve. The most basic enemies (slimes) will dodge your ranged attacks as you press them. It seems like your button presses are fed directly to the enemies AI rather then you position and movement and the AI will dodge every attack that is possible to dodge and if capable block the rest, To make matter worse when you do hit the enemies they have massive amounts of hit points and can soak up several hits even without blocking. Changing the difficult doesnt fix it either, it just makes it take longer to level up. Encounters in room tend to have about 4 times as enemies are their are members of your party and any hit will interupt movement casting and most attacks, but getting struck doesnt grant the typical momentary invincible common to most platformers, so often if 3 or more enemies can appoach you at once (even if they are greatly underleveled to you) they can knockback juggle you from full health to death. The final problem that was really glaring was the lack of any direction on how to progress (you can see this even in the demo). The game plays like a click everything adventure game requiring you to talk to everyone in the room then building then later town in order to find the right que to allow advancement of the story (if you play the demo I'll save you a little grief before finishing it, when you get stuck go talk to everyone at the school). Although at first I thought this was neat by the time I got to the point where I had talk to everyone in the big city twice I was tired of it. Some things I'd like to mention that are good about the game I found with some searching... Your characters appearance and the proformance of their equipment are not linked so you can look like any custom change your bought/found without hindering battle performance, I really liked this. Having to play a fighter style combat system and trying to time my attacks precisely in order to get a kill was entertaining and if the enemies only took a single strike it would be an entiretaining way to do combat.I enjoyed how each character abilities allowed your team to take different paths but I think it would have bean more enjoyable if the ability to breath unwater was granted to the party earlier then level 7.

Well-executed graphics and amusing characters do not make up for glitchy controls and extremely repetetive combat.If you're looking for a side-scroller with RPG elements, try Dust: An Elysian Tale instead.  If you find the art style and story concept attractive, try Recetteer: An Item Shop's Tale (by the same studio as this) instead.  Both are much more enjoyable.			"

												For it's idea by walking & jumping on a 2D sidescroller platform roleplay styled gameplay including storyline and such is an amazing concept going on. There are voices implemented in the game which is pretty cute as of how it plays during the game I must say but not voices as in voiceacting during dialogue but as in voices as in during gameplay like attacking, spells, getting damage and such. Gameplay as of how it plays is, even on the easier difficulty not that easy to play especially on specific areas where it changes your party and other areas if you don't do or have specific abilities until you learn it... but honestly, I love how the gameplay is acted. Loved the story, loved how it's played and even for being difficult by myself while playing on the easier difficulty at specific areas on the game I still absolutely love it. Recommended for someone who likes 2D RPGs with sidescrolling Jump & Runs and cute stuff included!			"

												Fortune Summoners is a midly fun game that is something that I wanted to play before going into it. However, while the game may be fun, there are some major faults that must be highlighted.First for the good parts. Fortune Summoners has a pretty nice game concept, environment creation, and overall story design. The game concept is basically like a platforming JPRG and ARPG. There are some similarities, such as slimes, that almost all of these RPG games have. The evnironment looks very good and whoever crafted it did a good job. The story, sometimes rather lengthy with the text to read through, is definitly not horrible.However, on the other hand. The mechanics of this game were pretty clunky. The buttons were often not too responsive and attack motions were often Qed up inocrrectly if I pressed a button twice in trying to get it to work. The fighting therefore became rather annoying because of this. Another mechanical annoyance was that walking was so slow and jumping actually moved you faster than walking. Unless I am stupid, there was no run option. The final mechanical isue I had with the game was the buttons themselves. Why the hell would you combine two unique action possibilities into one key and not give the option to seperate them. The attack and use buttons were the same ones, so if you are holding a weapon, you couldnt even use anything easily without sheating your weapon. Furthermore, I could not figure out how to change the menu from f1 to esc for my life. Another flaw of this game that I thought was annoying was that there is A LOT of walking around. To complete one ""quest"" often required you to walk back and forth and back and forth. The annoying part is sometimes those regions had monsters that you had to defeat before you can even move on, which made moving back and forth even slower. Finally, it is quite easy to get lost earlier on in this game as they don't really provide you a good quest log with directions, but only a mail system which has a brief overviews of the beginnings of a quest (not really even sometimes).Even though my cons section is way longer than the pros, do not get me wrong in saying that this game is fun if you are searching for something like this. Overall, worth the play, but I would not pay a lot for this.Rating: 7.1Recommend: $2 or less			"

The AI, just awesome, feels really alive in combat(for a small time i decided to play the Heal and let the AI play Arche so i had time to see how well the AI handels Combat).

												Great Game, Except for it's one *major* flaw* - It's so old that modern hardware (HDMI) can't run it except at less than 11 FPS. I've tried various methods to get around this and it just won't work; I get maybe 10 FPS in town, and if I'm lucky 6 FPS in dungeons/caves. Needless to say such a handicap means only die-hard fans will be able to deal with the choppy graphics...Really too bad, I miss this kinda cutesy dungeon-crawler/action game. Plus it's 2d Anime-Style Graphics to begin with...but even Anime-inducing games usually get atleast 20+ FPS by comparison. Still I gave it a thumbs up because of it's charm, but no I'm not likely to recommend it if your using a ""Modern"" PC (I Realize Some of us still have ancient hardware so it's not fair to judge it by FPS alone)Edit: * - Upon Further Testing it seems this flaw only applies to Full Screen and Zoomed Modes, Windowed Mode i get over 120 FPS.

												Once I forced myself to finish playing the game I repeatedly kept saying to myself ""I'm glad this is over so I can do something else.""The core problem with this game is that there basically aren't difficulty options. It does have them... they just don't do anything. They don't make the AI any different or easier, they don't make enemies do less damage. Apparently it has been stated that all they do is give you less xp if you play on easy. If the difficulty levels actually worked and you could make the game easier / less frustrating, I'm guessing 90% of the negative reviews would have been different. Oh well.The combat can be incredibly frustrating at times and seem unfair as you get chain stunlocked by the AI that is set to anticipate any move you make and counter it. Many times I got extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and was yelling loudly. Not worth it.			"

												Fortune Summoners is suffers greatly from terrible design decisions regarding nonstop backtracking and difficulty to the point where cheesing things and hiding between cheap stabs for long, drawn out, boring fights is often the only possible intended strategy. The story is really fun but I can't justify finishing the game when all it does is punish you. The controls are super clunky to the point where you'll often attack three or four times in the wrong direction because you simply can't turn around. The game has serious technical glitches, I shouldn't be running 10-20 fps on a platformer running in an eighth of my screen.I really wish I could enjoy this, but I just can't.			"

												This game is for HARDCORE gamers, man.All these little wimps and their ""Baww, the controls are too hard! The mobs are too smart!"" are far too weak to challenge the FINAL BOSS of side-scrolling ARPGs.Once you GIT GUD at this game, you can move Arche (main character) around like she's mofo Lancelot/Kenshin/Hercules/etc. And she has enough combos in her kit later on to make you look like a pro. For real, the fluidity and diversity of combos actually make this visually impressive, as well. It's fun to watch someone good at Arche, she kicks so much ♥♥♥.However, I shall reveal to you the easiest way to beat this game:1. Get Stella2. CHASAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH3. ?????4. Profit, although you're already filthy-stinkin' rich, so it shouldn't matter much.Final boss can be beaten by spamming CHASAHHH. Just make sure to have lots of MP pots.			"

												Technical disaster.On 'low' graphics it still stutters violelenty and struggles to maintain framerate. Other negative reviews noted this as well, I didn't really appreciate how bad it could possibly be...Controller defaults to violent seizure mode, and you have to go into options and switch to support analog inputs without it throwing a fit. I thought this was a solved problem around the time of the DualShock 1, like... 20 years ago. Apparently my standards are too high?Controls are painful at best, and movement feels super awkward. I found myself struggling to play long enough to give the game the benefit of the doubt. I've played some games with terrible movement where the rest of the game was good enough to balance out, but this game is asking for a lot of faith up front.I alt-tabbed out to switch on some developer tools so I could profile and figure out just how someone managed to make a game this non-performant. But when I alt-tabbed back in to make sure the game was still running fine before I turned the tools on, the renderer had just completely s*** itself and was just vomiting sprites all over the screen.I got like... 5 minutes into the tutorial segment, I think?

												I really wanted to like this game, but the controls are beyond bad. It's not responsive in any way, the character doesnt move the way I want her to. I made it to the first skeletton boss and almost threw it, because it's just frustrating to be beaten because of bad programming. A few minutes later, the second skeletton boss also threw in some magic sleep spell that is really difficult to dodge and incapacitates you for several seconds additional to the neverending strikes the first one did. This was too much, trading my neurones for playing this game is not worth it. Better controls would have made a HUGE difference. Thumbs down.Cuteness didnt save you this time, game!!			"

A decent RPG game where you creepily take the role of a small school girl.

The gameplay is decent, the controls are akward and stiff. Attacking you always find yourself swinging in the wrong direction and have to stop and turn to swing the other way making it really easy to get constantly hit by enemies.
The visuals and sound are really good, but the dialogue could've been much more improved.

This game is challenging as hell, it's decent up until the first boss and then I got my a**ed kicked.
There's little to no time to switch between characters, use their abilities and dodge this guy jumping around literally putting you to sleep and ra*ing you.
I tried many times and my best was getting him down to only 3/4 health...

Honestly was a decent game but holy f*ck it got incredibly hard out of no where.

I was only able to get the school before the slowdown and the flickering made it unplayable and it crashed. On loading the game again, it loaded with the same problems that had built up in the past occuring immediately.Perhaps making it possible to disable the background animations would help?

												It seems like a very good game but I just can't play it. Unfortunately, this game just has rediculously bad performance. On High graphics it gets like 2 FPS. On Low it fluctuates from 0 to 10 depending on what's happening. I can play my over 900 Steam games on this computer with ease, so maybe it's designed for old fahioned graphics cards or something. For some it will be playable on low but as for me, it hurts my eyes when the screen moves and I'm not doing that.i5-750, 16GB RAM, 760 GTX 4GB (460 GTX 2GB tested also - same problems)			"

												A damn fun and unique little game. The combat is fun and reminiscent of the Tales series which I love. Although, the controls can be a little wonky but once you figure out the combo's and timing out its smooth as butter. Not to mention fun as hell racking up combo's. The platforming is fun too although with said wonky controls it can be a little frustrating. The moderate learning curve with the controls plus a quite unforgiving AI difficulty can make it pretty tough at times but manages to still be fun. The graphics and art is actually cute and likeable; same with the translation which Carpe Fulgur did a great job with. I found the music really enjoyable as well. (I want the OST) All in all its a cute and charming if not difficult old-school side scroller with combo-lishes combat. Oh, and lots of Lolis~			"

												The other two games in the bundle were adorable and fun to play, but this one will likely be uninstalled from my computer immediately. I've utterly just guiven up. I attempted to play it four different times but it just doesn't play well. It runs at like 4fps and the text boxes are extremely slow and don't respond well to the 'next' option. Also, the farthest I got was entering her home. As soon as I would attempt to go up the stairs, it would freeze, and  the protagonist's image would just be smeared accross the screen like she'd been smashed and dragged.

And Lizsoft abandoned this long ago.CF Forums are full of people with this problem, if you have it, nothing really fixes it.

												It seems Carpe Fulgur are incapable of producing a single good game. I've now played all of the ones they've made available on Steam and I can safely say that none of them are good. Recettear is an incredibly repetitive grind that punishes you by sending you back to the start of the game if you don't fulfill outrageous dues, Chantelise has the worst camera angles of all time, and this game starts you off having the range of a lemon and a magic school that is so poorly managed that they don't have the stones to actually teach with. The story in this game was so terribly written, I have to wonder what was responsible. Was it the terrible translation or the fact that Japan just seems to be full of the worst writers in the world? The intro explicitly states, quite clearly in fact, that magic is common place. Everyone uses magic. Why then is the main character so ignorant to magic? Wouldn't she have had lots of exposure to magic before? Why then is the school fresh out of stones? Wouldn't everyday magic mean that stones are easy to produce in huge quantities for everyone to use? The combat is an absolute joke. I already stated above that you have the range of a lemon to start with. Your first enemy is a slime that takes about a million hits to destroy and your character can swing about the thickness or width of her body straight ahead. Mix that with the fact slimes bounce around a lot and snakes lunge at you and you have some of the worst combat I've seen. Plus, it's stiff. On the way to ""school"", you meet a mage who is a thousand times more competent than you. Then she leaves and has to take care of some pet...by just standing there like everyone else. Game sucks. Carpe Fulgur will never improve. It seems bad JRPGs with tiny girls and fairies are all they can come up with.			"

												Don't let the cute visuals fool you, this game is great, tricky but rewarding controls and combos give the combat a lot of depth, and the enemy AI is intelligent and aggressive enough to make you have you actually play well to push through.The games strongest feature is it's combat and it never ceases to escalate the fights as you play. Every monster has a decent set of moves and will use them to the best of their ability to shut you down, you won't be button mashing through these enemies. One of my favourite features is that while most enemies have one or two palette swap variants, these variants usually have very different movepools, often changing how you approach fighting them and always keeping you on your toes.Be prepared for some nail biting difficulty and some very very clutch moments against bosses and even certain trash mob encounters. The pain is worth it however because coming out on top feels great. (and even if you fail, the game is very lenient allowing unlimited retries)Get ready for a lengthy, charming campaign, with a lot of exploration and quests to do, sadly the game is mostly linear and you'll discover most secrets and optional content on your first playthrough, but I myself clocked around 30 hours on the first run, so you get your moneys worth.Some small weaknesses though, a lack of fast travel between save points means that giving up on a dungeon run forces you to redo the whole dungeon again, which becomes an issue lategame as the dungeons get HUGE. Additionally, there are only about 5 tilesets for dungeons, so a lot of them end up feeling samey, and even in the same dungeon you'll often do loops and get completely lost due to a lack of decent landmarks.This is a really underrated title. I'd liken it to titles like Hyper Light Drifter, Cave Story and Axiom Verge, but replace serious dark storytelling with a lighthearted, cute story.			"

												Great game, story is really good, especially the combat system. I have seen my character do action film stunts in this with the monsters, like they jump and i roll underneath them and swing my sword to impale them from behind and they jump again to counter me, so i Parry, then i get a hit in. You will see them do some interesting things while you are swinging your weapon around. you cant just button mash in this game. My biggest gripe about it though is that if you use a controller, say an xbox controller, The sensitivity goes through the roof! The combat is still fluid, but WHEN EVER you try to interact with a menu. EX: title menu, options, inventory, shops, etc the game thinks you hit the down key or should i say lightly tapping the analog controller down once makes the game think you hits it a hundred times. very irritating, especially if you are trying to save lol The game follows a set flow, as you are this Girl Arche on an adventure with her friends, uncovering secrets and learning magic. which magic adds a whole new twist to the game, also you can switch characters once you get your ""friends"" to join you. as I was talking about the flow of the game, there are set things you have to do in order to progress, if you don't, expect a lot of back tracking, I mean alot. sometimes its just be at acertain place at a certain time of day. or it has to be the next day LOL. I put the game down after 11.2 hours since i got stuck in the game myself, Im also level 18 so lots of things just get destroyed when i show up. Mainly due to back tracking and killing the monsters in my way every single time. I am picking the game up again, to see if i can actually finish it. so im starting it from scratch lol. Still irritated about the menu thing though. A must for people who want a good Multi genre game, with cute characters and a very intriging story line.			"

												I recommend this game because it allows me to fufill the life-long dream I've had since I was 22.5 years old of being the little magical anime girl. This game even allows me the be the blue one. Whenever I watch the magical girl animes on the TVs, my favorite is always the blue ones. Whenever you push a block in this game, the main character makes a lewd groan, but its not lewd, because that would be innappropiate for someone her age, you pervert. One thing amgical anime girls like to do is eat lots of sweets. When I eat lots of sweets, my parents like to remind me of my imminent diabetic coma. Magical girls never have to worry about diabetes because of all the magic. I think that all girls are magical except for the ones who stop talking to me on facebook. I swear I haven't been doing anything creepy or disgusting to their facebook pages but they never responde to my funny jokes. There was thiis one time I was said to a girl ""that dress is pretty can i borrow it? lel"" on facebook and I had to  AIM (AOL(America On-Line (Its an old ISP(Internet Service Provider)) Instant Messanger)) her 3 times before she got the joke. The joke is that I would wear the dress which is funny because I'm a guy and that would be weird. Get it? I know right? Maybe she is just slow. I can understand. I'm pretty slow alot of times too. At least I'm handsome! XD Thats what my mom tells me after she drinks the wine.Anyway, this game is fun. I beat the first boss and I'm not sure where to go now though. :/			"

												Fortune Summoners is a story-driven side-scrolling action RPG.  It is the latest in Carpe Fulgurs collection of retro-inspired funtimes with a heavy emphasis on story and combat.  The story is always in the foreground, told light-heartedly by the wonderful characters.  The combat is challenging at times, yet intuitive and forgiving, and you may actually find yourself thanking your AI-controlled comrades for their help.The game I'm most reminded of is the Mega Man Zero series on the Nintendo Handhelds, and that is a good thing.  I loved the MMZ franchise for its fast-paced combat and gripping story, and am glad to see that there is a developer still willing to carry the torch.  Fortune Summoners is a callback to some of my most memorable gaming experiences, while at the same time carving its own little niche in my heart for telling a compelling story in a way that is both challenging and enjoyable.  Thanks, Carpe Fulgur LLC.  I await the next installment.			"

												Fortune Summoners is a 2D side scrolling game with suprisely difficult controls. The player gets to control 3 different girls with each one have unique abilities, but only one at a time while the AI controls the other two. The enemy AI are tough and they show no mercy. The default setting of the gamepad is confusing as well so adjust them to your gameplay style as much as possible. Fortune Summoners is not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend to my friends, but it's really enjoyable and challenging. I guarantee you the game will become much easier once you got the controls down and practice.Do not try to mash attack against the enemies, steady,  guard, and counter attack will benefit you much better. Also, turn on auto guard.			"

A sidescrolling action adventure featuring young girls. It's cute, mature, challenging, and it's fun. The combat system has combos that are open and have room for you to play with, infinites ho~. The story is long and there's a versus mode. The art is all well done, and you can dress your characters up. The music track is good but forgettable.The bad: Nothing, Seriously. For games of this genre this is a must play. The ugly: I encountered no errors, bugs, or crashes playing this game on several Win7 machines. That said the resolution for this game is set in stone. There is no windowed fullscreen and only one windowed resolution - 640x480. Zoom mode doubles that resolution in fullscreen.			"

												This is actually one of the most fun RPG games I've played in a while. Don't let the graphics fool you because it actually fits with the style of the game. It allows the drawings of the character to stand out more, the gameplay machanics to be simple and understandable, and it gives a nostalgic feeling for old RPGs like Final Fantasy. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand but this is also one of the most difficult games to play. The monsters you fight in this game responds to how you fight so if you don't learn how to block and dodge you will be dying a lot. Even though the game is difficult it is quite fun because you get this immense satisfaction of defeating your opponent especially during the boss fights. This game also does not hold your hand. Most games nowadays just guides you to where you have to go but Fortune Summoners is different. It just gives you the name of the location and you have to figure out where that is and how to get there. I personally like it this way because it forces you to think about what you have to do and where you have to go. It even makes you think on how you have to fight sometimes.If you are not sure about buying this game you can just go to the steam page and download the demo version and judge for yourself if you might like the game or not. Save files from the demo can transfer to the full game so don't worry about restarting. If you think it is too expensive just wait for a steam sale then. I personally believe that this game is a must buy and it is a shame that so little people play it.			"

												A action RPG focusing on reflexes rather than taking time for micro management. The gameplay is fun, you'll find a few puzzles that will slow you but the worst thing is it's not always clear where the hell you go. You can talk to 15 people and none will point you in a correct direction. Also there are a few english errors but hey, it's a japanese indie. Good game, just keep a guild close for those few moments you need help just being in the right town.			"

												Looks far better in motion than it does in the screenshots (the animation is very smooth and well done).

												The combat system works like in fighting games, so use a controller and set the walk/run to use analog sticks, otherwise it's a bit clunky. Too much backtracking and sometiems you've gotta talk to some random unimportant NPCs... Aside from those flaws I loved it! The style is silly, the jokes are pretty funny and the combat is just really fun once you get used to it. I sunk 30 hours into this game, so I think it's well worth the money. :)			"

												CONTROLLER REQUIRED  (not ""required"" per se, but it makes a huge difference in the fun factor!). **Please note, that getting the controller to work was a hassle. I used a program in tandem with the game called ""JoyToKey"". If you've played Binding of Isaac, then you will know what I'm talking about. Using JoyToKey to simply emulate keyboard presses on your controller is the way to go.  The built in controller settings to the game really suck.**I deeply enjoyed this game, thought I confess it had me very frustrated at times.  The combat requires a much higher degree of skill than the cutesy graphics would lead you to believe otherwise, but, you still learn to appreciate the depth of play.  Once you get a handle on things, it's very satisfying to properly execute maneuvers.  Throughout many of the games areas and dungeons, I often felt threated and had to keep sharp in order to avoid an untimely death.  There were a couple of times where it was difficult to determine where to go next, however, if you are committed to putting in some effort into exploring, you can figure it out.  My displayed play time represents a leisurely play through (40 hours), so don't worry about this game taking far too much time.			"

												First of all, I had played demo of this game before I bought the game so I had a feeling what I was getting myself into. However, game was much longer than I had expected (and I even replayed it a little) with several dungeons and not too short story. Game itself starts with one character but later it will become possible to play one character while having 2 computer controlled characters with you. This is nice because you can choose which of the three characters you want to play. Would you rather swing around huge sword, destroy enemies with destructive spells or be the supporter with heals, debuffs and buffs (even supporter gets a powerful water spell at higher levels). There are several different enemies even though few are improved versions of some other enemies. Some of the dungeon bosses were fun to kill but I honestly think the last boss was little too easy compared to some other bosses. I really enjoyed graphics & art of this game a lot, same with music. Story was interesting enough and I really enjoyed conversations between characters. Controlling character with keyboard during battles isn't always the easiest thing but nothing you can't really get used to after few hours. Game doesn't really hold your hand when you are trying to figure out who you should talk to next to progress in the story and there were only few times when the game felt a little bit unfair. Inventory was sometimes problematic too, mostly because same kind of items didn't stack, this made it harder to decide which items to keep with me. Some of the dungeons were quite hard not only because of the enemies but mostly because lack of map so I got easily lost in dungeons later in the game. Despite of some flaws and faults in overall I enjoyed playing the game and I can recommend it.			"

												GOOD: -It is an harder version of Tales of Phantasia, and this is good.-The story is simple but well written with the classic trio of strong, kind and knowlegiable characters.-It is labeled as an hard game because you cannot save alway and because of the fights, but when you die you can choose to restart the last fight, giving infinite possibilities to beat the hard part you are facing and making the whole game easier than it looks. BAD: -The main character has NO special abilities and swings the sword from the beginning to the end with no real improvement.-Disease are too strong for what is given to counter them until later in the game...you do have only items and EVERY fight  you get poisoned or confused or asleep.-There are too many forced fights...some are justified throught the game story but others are not...-No support for compatibilities like OS or Joystick (had to play it on window mode).PRICE: Worth less then 4 euro, 75% discountRECCOMEND: I do only reccomend this game to those who enjoy hard fights, love the genre and are willing to close an eye (or maybe both) for more then few ""not well tought"" events.

												I dislike most Japanese media... but I freaking love this game.TL;DR - Must have for lovers of action RPG's. The game is not impossibly hard, people just think it is. If you spam buttons in this game you will be pulverized. Planning your attacks is very satisfying and required.It has entertained me for far more hours than shown only because I was offline. The gameplay is what makes it all worth it. Many people rating will be commenting that the game is too difficult even on easy and while there is some truth to that this game is designed that way. I cannot stress enough that this game is far from impossible. If someone is claiming the game is extremely hard even though they are good at the game... sorry... they aren't. The game is extremely punishing but rewards you if you are skilled / prepared. The controls are extremely responsive outside of the sliding that happens while you are moving fast or falling but your speed is something you can control. With that out of the way, my pros and cons.Pros:-Difficult. Enemies have telepathy (I can't describe it any better.) You will have to outsmart the last boss and you'll have to outsmart that level 1 slime too... every time. I'm going to slaughter the easy stuff but I still need to execute the mechanics to hit it. There are no free kills here.-Satisfying combat. Similar to the above comment, combat is very satisfying. Enemies do not let you hit them. It will take either a block and quick return attack or a combined effort with your party to HIT something let alone kill it. Juggling is equally as fun and skillful as it is required.-Nostalgia. It just has that older RPG vibe that reminds me of the games of my childhood. This might not apply to some of you but it was a very important part of the game to me.Cons:-It ends abruptly. This angers me and the company behind it is done. Carpe Fulgar is just a localization team... they don't actually make the game. Sadly there will be no follow up.- Enemy infintes. There are some psudeo infinite combos the enemies can get you caught in. They are rare but when you die without being able to put up a fight it is frustrating.- Can't remap all the controls. It's annoying but I got over it. You could of course use a program to swap keys if you wanted but that's a lot of work. Not acceptable in the modern PC world but this game was from a Japanese Doujin company. They understand little in the ways of proper PC gaming.Those are my main points, I play this game for the gameplay. As for the story and art I'm not an expert and it isn't my prefered style by any manner but you know what? It grew on me. I like every bit of this game. It has excellent sound design as well. If cute, little, ludicrously overpowered girls is your thing then you need look no further.Or if you just like good combo action RPG's you need look no further either. 9/10			"

												Fortune summoners is a game that may look cute, but still delivers a great game. The combat is not something for buttonmashers, but is instead a serious challenge where you have to think about what you are doing. Enemies are varied and have more inteligence than not walking off cliffs.The story is cute, but never too cute. It stays simple, yet entertaining. The characters actually have character and manage to both be adventurers and young girls at the same time, without resorting to unrealisticly girly actions.The level designs are very beautiful and quite varried. But the puzzles are not very difficult. But they are quite varied and you will not grow tired of a puzzle element being over used.The game is rather long, with around 30 hours of real content. Not pointless grinding, running around without a clue or for finding a bunch of obscure and irrelevant secret objects.			"

												風よ、我が力となれ！Arche moves to a new town, makes some friends and goes on a platformer/brawler RPG adventure!I liked the eye-pleasing sprite-based graphics engine (maybe I am a sucker for sprites). The controls felt a bit clunky at first but I got used to them after not too long (one might call this 'the brawler difficulty hump'). There's plenty of exploring to be done and the larger bosses make for hectic fights.A couple of negatives though. The steam overlay didn't work (meh) (CF are apparently looking into this one) and the initial control set up was not well-suited for my xbox controller (far too sensitive  - easily fixed in-game).

												If you need a controller to make button combinations you may have to give this game a pass. My official windows controller(not even a month old, and fairly well kept) keeps bugging out and not giving commands. Further, you cannot assign directional buttons meaning the control stick is the only way to move using a controller, and worse manuing ends up almost impossible in such a setup. However if you can play with the keyboard or wizard your way out of these issues.In a game where you play a team of cute girls in a magical world. And creatures more violent than anything in real life are largely ignored because those cute girls can(and will) kill these creatures with mostly just minor annoyance. You play an adorable little sword weilder whos only desire is to learn magic, and man does she have loops to jump through to get there. Journeymans tip; hitting up and attack at the same time makes an uppercut, which does bonus damage to flying enemies, like those pesky bats who will be annoying as all getout otherwise.Also this game is best enjoyed on easy mode, upgrading to hard once you want more of a challenge. Considering I play play on higher difficulties just fine saying ""get good scrub"" makes you look like an illiterate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.However since I haven't beaten the game yet I can't give a full review.

I warned you.The controls for this game feels like it's covered in oil (I don't understand why the attacks are executed on release of button as opposed to press of buttons) but it still plays and feels well made.  Combat is very deliberate and mashing buttons can often get yourself killed.The combat, for the most part, favors offensive play and playing defensively can get you killed... kind of like in a real swordfight!  Anything and everything can get stunned by simply hitting them, even you.  That's what usually gets you killed or gives you the edge.I played on expert, so the AI is brutal... you were warned.

												I'm a big fan of all my Carpe Fulgur games, but they do come at the cost of very bad keyboard controls, and very spotty game pad support.  So although I recommend this game, I would download the demo to make sure you can handle the quirks before purchasing.  Basically none of the gamepads I tried worked, I can't play it in a zoomed window because I'm a pleb with a 1600x900 monitor, and I had to download a shady third-party patch to get fullscreen to run over 4 fps.Once you've completed the dark ritual necessary to get the game stable enough to function and have attuned your mind to the hideous keyboard controls, the game is very good.It's one of those classic action rpgs that Japan used to be so ♥♥♥♥ing good at making.  You go through dungeons, find items, kill bosses, learn new attacks that actually change the way you fight significantly, all that good ♥♥♥♥.  I really like the way things are laid out, I feel like grinding for enough gold to buy upgrades and simply getting better at fighting are equally viable ways to progress, which is nice.  I have never been FORCED to upgrade my equipment, it's felt very natural.  The combat feels very clunky at first, but after a few hours of practice, it becomes kind of an art form with a very high (but accessible) skill cap.At a few points, I've outpaced the game and had to fight enemies that would be trivial if only I had the ability that I get next level.  Those points in the game are few, but they all seem to be at the start of the game unfortunately.  It'll sound like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when I tell you, ""the game gets WAY better after the first 6-7 hours"". but that is actually true.  It takes a LOOOOOONNNGGGG time before you have the full party and actually feel like things are going your way.If you're ready to sit down and really sink a lot of time into a game about little girls defeating monsters with glitter magic, this is the game for you.

												If you like platformers, cuteness and RPGs, this is pretty decent.  I quite enjoy playing it; I do love traditional RPGs after all.  It may be too cutsey for some; of curse I can't tell, since I just have n resistance to cute stuff.   Fortune Summoners is a platform, action, RPG about a little girl that moves into a new home, which is an item shop her parents own.  I think that's quite interesting...but you still don't get any discounts, regardless if you're the shop owner's cute little daughter.When I first played it, I found it funny that a little girl her age carries around a sword, and even funnier is she's allowed to carry it in school!  Of course, she has to, since she has to fight MONSTERS each time she has to go to school.  Not only that, she has to overcome pitfalls as well---and you think your school was tough!It doesn't bring anything ground-breaking, but it's still a worthwhile RPG!			"

												I recommend this game because it allows me to fufill the life-long dream I've had since I was 22.5 years old of being the little magical anime girl. This game even allows me the be the blue one. Whenever I watch the magical girl animes on the TVs, my favorite is always the blue ones. Whenever you push a block in this game, the main character makes a lewd groan, but its not lewd, because that would be innappropiate for someone her age, you pervert. One thing amgical anime girls like to do is eat lots of sweets. When I eat lots of sweets, my parents like to remind me of my imminent diabetic coma. Magical girls never have to worry about diabetes because of all the magic. I think that all girls are magical except for the ones who stop talking to me on facebook. I swear I haven't been doing anything creepy or disgusting to their facebook pages but they never responde to my funny jokes. There was thiis one time I was said to a girl ""that dress is pretty can i borrow it? lel"" on facebook and I had to  AIM (AOL(America On-Line (Its an old ISP(Internet Service Provider)) Instant Messanger)) her 3 times before she got the joke. The joke is that I would wear the dress which is funny because I'm a guy and that would be weird. Get it? I know right? Maybe she is just slow. I can understand. I'm pretty slow alot of times too. At least I'm handsome! XD Thats what my mom tells me after she drinks the wine.Anyway, this game is fun. I beat the first boss and I'm not sure where to go now though. :/			"

												Fortune Summoners; an interesting 2D Hack'n'Slash (if you can call it that) JRPG featuring a ton of cuteness: cute characters, cute art, super cute story that harbours within it a rather challenging experience. No, don't get distracted by the oh-so-cute lolis running around with their blunted swords and bubble shields; the game is actually quite difficult. Expect to die. A lot. (Though of course you may change the difficulty setting at any time and the death penalty is very minimal).The story itself isn't all that long, and the game limits your grinding by imposing level and currency caps that are slowly lifted as you progress through the game- and grinding truly feels like a high-effort low-reward type of thing since the experience requirement to gain one level is incredibly high and it'll take an absurdly long time to farm currency to get all the gear one wants/needs - which is probably not all that bad of a thing as the game attempts to be challenging but gives one some freedom to progress their characters when they feel lacking.Overall, the game is really cute and a ton of fun, though I'd mostly recommend it for people looking for a challenge or won't mind grinding an hour or two just to gain a single level and two thousand CP.

												A great game with no sequel and no plans for having a sequel... probably ever.  I warned you.The controls for this game feels like it's covered in oil (I don't understand why the attacks are executed on release of button as opposed to press of buttons) but it still plays and feels well made.  Combat is very deliberate and mashing buttons can often get yourself killed.The combat, for the most part, favors offensive play and playing defensively can get you killed... kind of like in a real swordfight!  Anything and everything can get stunned by simply hitting them, even you.  That's what usually gets you killed or gives you the edge.I played on expert, so the AI is brutal... you were warned.  Have fun.			"

												Fortune Summoner is a action side scroller featuring cute girls doing c... nvm  no, they are pretty much doing what veteran adventurers should be doing.Their parents gives absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ about them risking their lives in this game. Case in point, Arche father will not even question you when you buy 10 anti venoms nor will question you after spending several days at a inn of another town while pretty much skipping school for the same amount of days.Arche is also the bestest friend one could ever imagine, bringing her newfound friends to risk their lives alongside her when she knows the cave is filled with bats and slimes that attack you with tentacles (yes i had to include that detail), and doesn't give a damn when her friend wants to go home after seeing the skeleton of an unfortunate victim.As for the game itself, it's actually surprisingly challenging and fun (and sometime frustrating), you actually HAVE to adapt to the enemy you face and learn how they move and strike or you will get killed. Also note that said enemies will do the same, by that i mean their AI is actually decent and will avoid your attacks as much as they can, it's actually pretty impressive.I was fooled by the cute girls, i expected a fun and relaxing game but i ended up with a nice challenging game instead. I'm actually scared to even boot the game and get my ♥♥♥ kicked.			"

												Edit: I have beaten the game now and I just can say it was an awesome adventure (Dark Souls with Story mode depending on Difficulty) with great puzzles a more or less good fighting system and a really good Story, at least for me, to enjoy. So I can recommend this game. The hardest time is when you have to go solo at day 5 but after that you it should play smoothly.Old Edit New: Ok, if you ""torture"" yourself through the first 7-8 Days this games strongest point is it's Story for me.After 8 Days you have all 3 Party Members and the things get alot easier than before, it's still difficult but not ragingly difficult and you can enjoy the rest of the Story.I have not finished this game yet but so far I like it so much more than before :)Old:I would love to recommend it, but only for someone who likes Dark Souls with a adorable setting and story.I struggle very hard since I lost Sana cause she got ""ill"" and now I can barely stand my own without pumping out Healing items. The controls feel very unforgiven. And flying enemies, especially mothbees, are a pain if you are alone cause it's hard to get them into a combo.I am at Day 6 right now and my only chance to progress for me I see is to die my way through it, more or less.But I like the cute setting and story that it pains me to not recommend it, as much as it frustrates me already.If I am out of combat the input commands work for me. But as soon as you get pressured, especially when you fight alone is a pain xD			"

												GOOD: -It is an harder version of Tales of Phantasia, and this is good.-The story is simple but well written with the classic trio of strong, kind and knowlegiable characters.-It is labeled as an hard game because you cannot save alway and because of the fights, but when you die you can choose to restart the last fight, giving infinite possibilities to beat the hard part you are facing and making the whole game easier than it looks. BAD: -The main character has NO special abilities and swings the sword from the beginning to the end with no real improvement.-Disease are too strong for what is given to counter them until later in the game...you do have only items and EVERY fight  you get poisoned or confused or asleep.-There are too many forced fights...some are justified throught the game story but others are not...-No support for compatibilities like OS or Joystick (had to play it on window mode).PRICE: Worth less then 4 euro, 75% discountRECCOMEND: I do only reccomend this game to those who enjoy hard fights, love the genre and are willing to close an eye (or maybe both) for more then few ""not well tought"" events.

												WOW HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS GREAT I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.  Seriously, if I were the leader of a country I'd get all my citizens to play this game as a requirement before they can apply for partially subsidized health care.  The fighting mechanics tends to be a bit clunky/slow at first, but it gets much better later on.  The learning curve is steep so it won't take too long to adjust to dodging/fighting monsters.  It's a bit delayed for a reason-  it's delayed to allow you to pull off really spectacular 10-20+ hit combos.  While some may find the fight mechanics to be slightly lacklustre, I personally find the music amazing, graphics to be rather appealing,  and the story great.  You play as Arche, a super adorable and young sword-wielding girl with a happy-go-lucky and curious attitude.  Arche goes on all sorts of adventures her goal is to find the secret of the elemental stone that she stumbles upon in one of the many dungeons you explore.  The game features a lot of hilarious and endearing dialogue (as to be expected from the wizards of Carpe Fulgur) and is basically a side-scrolling 2D sword-swinging-magic-using-old-school RPG.  You can assume control as either Arche or other companions you will bump into later on in the game.The music ranges from classical to easygoing background music and even at one point Touhou-like house/trance.  Each track is memorable in its own right and I find myself going on YT sometimes to listen to the BGM of Cranbal Valley.Graphics?  They're pretty good.  It sorta reminds me of LaTale or Maple Story.  Just a bit, though.  Don't play those two games if you haven't yet.  Here's a little scale to sum things up:Story: Yay/10Music: Impressive/10Graphics: moe/10I implore that you buy it and have fun playing this absolutely amazing game!			"

												CONTROLLER REQUIRED  (not ""required"" per se, but it makes a huge difference in the fun factor!). **Please note, that getting the controller to work was a hassle. I used a program in tandem with the game called ""JoyToKey"". If you've played Binding of Isaac, then you will know what I'm talking about. Using JoyToKey to simply emulate keyboard presses on your controller is the way to go.  The built in controller settings to the game really suck.**I deeply enjoyed this game, thought I confess it had me very frustrated at times.  The combat requires a much higher degree of skill than the cutesy graphics would lead you to believe otherwise, but, you still learn to appreciate the depth of play.  Once you get a handle on things, it's very satisfying to properly execute maneuvers.  Throughout many of the games areas and dungeons, I often felt threated and had to keep sharp in order to avoid an untimely death.  There were a couple of times where it was difficult to determine where to go next, however, if you are committed to putting in some effort into exploring, you can figure it out.  My displayed play time represents a leisurely play through (40 hours), so don't worry about this game taking far too much time.			"

												I recommend this game because it allows me to fufill the life-long dream I've had since I was 22.5 years old of being the little magical anime girl. This game even allows me the be the blue one. Whenever I watch the magical girl animes on the TVs, my favorite is always the blue ones. Whenever you push a block in this game, the main character makes a lewd groan, but its not lewd, because that would be innappropiate for someone her age, you pervert. One thing amgical anime girls like to do is eat lots of sweets. When I eat lots of sweets, my parents like to remind me of my imminent diabetic coma. Magical girls never have to worry about diabetes because of all the magic. I think that all girls are magical except for the ones who stop talking to me on facebook. I swear I haven't been doing anything creepy or disgusting to their facebook pages but they never responde to my funny jokes. There was thiis one time I was said to a girl ""that dress is pretty can i borrow it? lel"" on facebook and I had to  AIM (AOL(America On-Line (Its an old ISP(Internet Service Provider)) Instant Messanger)) her 3 times before she got the joke. The joke is that I would wear the dress which is funny because I'm a guy and that would be weird. Get it? I know right? Maybe she is just slow. I can understand. I'm pretty slow alot of times too. At least I'm handsome! XD Thats what my mom tells me after she drinks the wine.Anyway, this game is fun. I beat the first boss and I'm not sure where to go now though. :/			"

												The combat system works like in fighting games, so use a controller and set the walk/run to use analog sticks, otherwise it's a bit clunky. Too much backtracking and sometiems you've gotta talk to some random unimportant NPCs... Aside from those flaws I loved it! The style is silly, the jokes are pretty funny and the combat is just really fun once you get used to it. I sunk 30 hours into this game, so I think it's well worth the money. :)			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥, it's 2D 'Tales of' game where you get to be a little girl!Erm... It's an action-RPG, where you take control of 1 of 3 characters, and the other 2 become (smart) AI. Exploring/fights are all realtime, and the key to winning is excecuting fighting game-like moves in rhythm with your party to combo the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone (COMBO CRASHING SOUND, SO GOOD!) Deceptively difficult (based on lol, little girls), this takes some getting used to. I did the 2nd highest of 4 difficulties, and thought it was well tuned.Another thing, every dungeon has ""that enemy."" The one murderface who's going to kick your ♥♥♥♥ in if you don't adapt. Makes every place memorable...So the fighting is great, but a caveat: Don't be afraid to pull up a guide for the rather brief walkin' & talkin' sections. There's some thick JRPG logic at work, but it's worth going through.Also, Arche is hilarious.			"

												Well if you look for reviews for this game you will read thinks like: movement sucks, story sucks, soundtrack is not good and all such bad stuff.Now after playing this game till the bitter end I can say it is no 10/10. this game lacks some small balance in battle and maybe a bit more end game content. But if we put this aside we look a a beautiful perl of unknown quality.There is this simple story of a shopkeepers daughter moving into a new city and start going to a magic school where kids learn to use elemental stones for controlling magic. To take part in this magic lesson she needs an own elemental stone, which cost a fortune (now you know why they called the game fortune.....well no)  So you have to get an elemental stone for the school lesson and that's all. This story looks so stupid but it is also something special because it is so well written. you permanently switch between school life and adventures in a fine manner. The graphics in this game looks nice and solid, and the the playable character are cute, it is a jrpg after all so you will get what you expect.The soundtrack fits every situation in the game. I never felt annoyed so don't listen to the people who telling you it sucks.The combat system. Everyone would lie when they are telling you they never had problems with it.sometimes you just rush through the enemies sometimes they kick your ♥♥♥ so fast you could cry. Imo the combat system is nice. you have a fine amount of skills for use and with higher level you get more and more of them. it is really fun to play but as I told you sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation you just can't handle. Enemies predict your movements and counter every attack you try. But don't give up, every time you die you will start in the room before without losing exp or money and you can try again so it's not bad at all.So If we add everything together have a nice typically  jrpg with a sweet story and a challenging combat system.Cute characters using sword and magic, getting items and equipment.This game will take 20 hours of your lifetime so don't think twice and just buy it. Even if eur 15,00 is a bit high for the normal price I still think it is worthy to pay this amount as I did.my rating: 8/10 "

												For what it's worth, I've played too many games to count including most games from ancient systems to modern games from both the east and west, mainstream to niche doujin, nearly every genre that isn't madden, on every console  and handheld most people can name and pc.  Here are some clarifications to concerns some people hadCONTROLSControls are excellent and tight, with just enough buffering leniency to ensure that your inputs go through as expected.  The game is easygoing enough that you can ""mash"" inputs to a certain degree and the game will usually produce the desired results in gapless chains, yet is strict enough that you will rarely get accidental misinterpreted inputs.  This is not 1f links the game, its probably 10f or more of leniency.  The dev went as far as putting luxury settings such as the ability to change the command interpreter sensitivity to dash with a granularity of up to 7 degrees and multiple modes of configuring keyboard and gamepad and analog.  I've tried playing the game for a while on keyboard, on a gamepad using d-pad, and on a gamepad using analog (PS3's DS3).  The DS3 analog is notoriously poor as a precision input device and I could feel its imprecision in this game with certain moves, and yet the game was lenient enough that I didn't mind playing on it.#CONCLUSION: People who complain about the ""controls"" are merely bad or want to turn off their brain and sloppily mash buttons with a mild notion of direction behind their actions, hoping that the game will let you cancel anything into anything and get away with it.  If you can't play a game without turning off your brain and mashing semi-randomly, I can't recommend this game, you will be frustrated.DIFFICULTYhttp://imgur.com/zIru7i7I've just cleared my first main game playthrough and my total party wipe count is 7.  This is normal difficulty.  Two of those deaths were because I decided to check out a place I was absolutely not supposed to go to yet and got wiped out instantly in.  Zero wipes on boss fights.  I played recklessly aggressively rather than utilizing careful defensive strategies.  I didn't use any of my permanent stat up items (locked away in the stash until the end of the game).  I rarely bothered to take the time to prepare before fights with the amazingly overpowered buffs sana provides.  I spent most of my initial dungeon runs in a low performance high efficiency set of settings designed to conserve MP rather than fight with maximum power, lending towards deeper expeditions rather than ease of combat.  Mid game buffs such as shield II and forcefield are so game breaking that they trivialize most fights.Enemies have excellent AI, as do your allies.  Both allies and enemies will dodge attacks very well, and have plenty of situational awareness.  Enemies will notice you are blocking and use unblockable attacks, they will notice you are jumping in and use their anti air, they will block and dodge your attacks.  In short, when compared to the typical easy game, even the lowliest of enemies in FS are practically a boss fight.  Not particularly a new thing if you've played stuff like dark souls or other games where enemies are granted good AI.Learning to combo will aid in breaking their defenses, as will taking advantage of their over-reliance on their defenses and reactions.  Feint a jump to trigger their anti air, but then land short and hit them.  Run in with a light fast swing, and if they jump to dodge then follow up with anti air.  Run in as though you planned to attack from the ground and they will attempt to hit you first, yet if you time your jump you will go over this and hit them from the air.  Most enemies that lack any way to guard, you can simply guard an attack and then counter attack immediately and they are simply helpless to do anything about it.  The AI is good but not so good that it will ""read your mind"", it is merely a shallow ability to react to your most predictable actions.Enemies do not respawn in a given room (bounded by a screen transition such as a door) until you go 2 rooms away, so you can take your time and clear everything out at a safe pace, and even retreat into a previous room temporarily if you accidentally bite off more than you can chew.  Once you have your other party members, in a pinch most enemies can be trivially defeated just by sitting there and blocking while they bombard the target with spells and ranged attacks.  If you continue to struggle playing as Arche, you can even even choose to switch to one of her mage friends and let the powerful AI assume control over Arche.  Status effects are almighty in this game and a real terror.  You absolutely want to bring a bag full of anti venom, and learn the enemy attack patterns that disperse horrors such as sleep and confusion.  Once you learn to avoid these their dangers to yourself are minimal but its more likely that your AI friends will still get hit by them which can be a problem (esp with confusion).  Truly this is the closest thing to real frightening difficulty in this game and it is still fair in my books since you can avoid these attacks (and with careful use of formations, movement, and prioritizing of targets your allies will generally stay out of trouble).  You will get an accessory that provides near immunity to each of these which makes things significantly easier.  There's also strategies like staying poisoned on purpose to make sleep less threatening.#CONCLUSION:As I mentioned above, I got through the game fine with my half-♥♥♥♥♥ playing.  Taking your time with more careful playing and dropping the difficulty to easy will make the game even easier!Whether you are a seasoned veteran of the RPG genre good with careful planning, preparation and optimization, or a skilled action platform fighting game player good at skillfully controlling your character and making magic happen, the game is just easy enough that you can crutch on your strengths and get by with some difficulty.If you have no patience, don't know how to set up your party commands and formations, don't know how to buy and equip, don't know how to buff up before fights, don't know how to use kite / space / make use of all your moves, don't prepare by bringing lots of useful items, don't know when to run away, don't want to learn the strategies for surviving and defeating various monster types, etc,etc,etc... then this game is just going to be impossibly hard for you and I absolutely would not recommend it.  It is a difficult game.As a matter of comparison I would say its easier/more fair than old school roguelikes, battletoads, etrian odyssey, dark/demon souls, etc pretty much any game that is supposed to be difficult without being flat out stupid.  So if you know about challenge you may want to raise the difficulty setting to hard.OPINIONS:100/10, probably the best whatever-this-genre-is I've ever played.  Challenge feels perfectly balanced so as to provide the incentive to play thoughtfully.  The level cap system prevents circumventing the difficulty by grinding which in turn removes grinding from the game.  Skill/spell escalation leads you to eventually becoming almighty, yet the difficulty ramps up via enemies learning to use powerful magic as well, leading to a satisfying follow through of balance rather than a game that is challenging in the first half and then disappointingly easy in the second half.  Story is refreshingly light-hearted, though it might not appeal to some as a result.  AI on allies is very impressive and can be further configured by enabling/disabling specific spells and configuring the party settings and formations.  My only disappointments are that you never learn a teleport2 spell to trivialize travel between areas, and the somewhat inconclusive ending that could use a sequel.Final Conclusion:If you know you're too lazy and impatient, I wouldn't bother with this game unless you have the background.

												I've been looking for good platformer RPG's / Metroidvanias for a while and this one delivers perfectly. I love the combat, it is quite challenging to master. The writing is pretty good, and it's all family friendly, but the gameplay is definitely designed for experienced gamers. The main downside is the primitive engine. There is a lot of sporadic lag even on my high-end gaming pc which seems to progressively increase the longer I leave the game open. Also the game crashes sometimes if I switch to a different application and then try to switch back to the game, which can lose me a lot of progress if I am deep in a dungeon where there are no save points or fast travel.If they made a sequel/successor I would definitely purchase it.

												Yes, the main characters are ripped right out of the Big Book of Stereotypes.  And yes, the combat can be a bit frustrating sometimes (almost every status effect can result in death).HOWEVER, this game did much better than I expected in being engaging.  I really had _fun_ as I played through the whole game.Sadly, the story is and will always be incomplete, as the game ends in a cliffhanger that obviously would lead into subsequent games, but the developer stopped making games after this one wasn't successful enough.

												I think that most people will play a Carpe Fulgur game just because it's Carpe Fulgur, but FS is really a gem. The level and monster design is exceptionally good, although the game forces you to think about fighting a lot more than most people expect out of a 2D action platformer. It's got some of the best 2D sidescrolling melee combat ever devised, though again, it's very hard. I absolutely recommend it.			"

												""I express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Jones, for gifting me this wonderful game.""In an moreorless official review about ""Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone"", this game was referred to as ""Dark Souls Lite"". I'd like to add upon that title by giving it one that better redeems the essence of this game: Light Souls.Alright, enough joking around. Fortune Summoners is a great game although the developing studio behind it, Lizsoft, has only publicly released one game before it. As I played through the game, I couldn't help but think of this as a cheerful 2D rendition of Dark Souls. As I loved playing the original Dark Souls, let me clarify why Fortune Summoners was such an addictive drug to me.The plot is moreorless alright. You start as a child named Arche who swings a sword the size of herself valliantly against generic JRPG slimes. You're later joined by two other party members (which can be seen in the steam banner) who have their own role to play in both combat and story. Every inch of dialog is seemly spoken, as if this entire game is through the perspective of 8 year old elementary students. It has so much contrast with the dark setting that starts taking place in the prologue of the game. Each main character has a distinctively different personality, keeping each conversations fresh with some comedic moments scattered around. The side that receives the greatest criticism from me is the storyline. Moreorless, the story looked like it was copied from a generic shonen manga. Only having 1-2 somewhat big plot twists, I always saw where the story was going. However, this can be overlooked depending on the age group. This game looks to target all ages, with its flimsy dialog and pleasant environments. To an actual 8 year old, I'd imagine the storyline wouldn't be as obvious to them. All in all, I wouldn't play this game just for the story but it's definitely not a reason to drop the game.The setting and music of this game is both pleasant and fitting. Like most game worlds, you don't recognize how great these things are until you realize that you've been playing for 6 hours straight. The setting is nicely drawn and clearly shows that a great amount of work has been put into every grassfield, dungeon, and household. Similar to other JRPGs, there are a variety of NPCs that bring depth and immersion into the game world. For the average player however, it seems that they'd skip past all the NPCs and focus only on the storyline. This seems like a poor playstyle, as that player will be less immersed in the world than a player who plays Fortune Summoners thoroughly. In that sense, it forces the player to adopt one playstyle which moreorless determines how immersed you are; directly affecting how much playtime you'll get out of this game. Esentially my point is that if you don't have the time to be playin this game, DON'T. It can be magical adventure with information about the world pouring into your soul every minute of gameplay, or a dull shonen manga with nothing else. The music fits this pleasant magical tale experienced by several 8 year old girls (and later some flying rabbit). The music system dynamically changes songs perfectly in tune with the gameplay, adding more immersion into the entire setting. Overall, the setting and music of Fortune Summoners is something to look forward to.Now the most controversial but most entertaining portion of the game: The combat. This factor defines why Fortune Summoners can be refferred to as Light Souls. If you live under a pineapple and don't know what I'm referring to, a title namely ""Dark Souls"" is often seen from a large majority as an insanely hard triple A title that requires a greater amount of concentration than the average modern game. The change in ""light"" refers to the plot, setting, and music experienced through 8 year old girls in a diverse amount of friendly towns, unlike Dark Souls' apocalyptic setting. The similarity between the two is the difficulty of combat. The controls for our protagonist Arche feel extremely clunky and difficulty to learn, as should be swinging a blunt sword the size of herself. However, it's extremely satisfying to kill your first slime as you learn the basic mechanics of combat (react/counterattack) instead of trying to button mash which can easily get you through other fighting games. Combat controls are in-depth and as you come to use a gallery of combos to fight off new enemies, it feels greatly accomplishing to do so. Each new level has at least one new enemy, which doesn't seem too great in terms of enemy variety, but makes up for it with the hardest AI I've ever experienced. Enemies read your inputs like clairvoyance, yet the combat is still amazing as there is always an optimal way to fight each and everyone one of them by taking only minimal damage. When you progress to the stage of group fights, the AI is usually competent (depending on your command mode) and alot of !!FUN!! pursues as you learn how to fight group as a group instead of solo. And just when you thought you've fought off the hardest enemy archetype there is, a new one appears and it's even worse. The combat is insanely challenging, but extremely satisfying once you've started to master it.The controversy with the combat comes in when judging how difficult a game should be. Dark Souls enjoys popular acclaim as being ""insanely difficult"", while multiple negative reviews about Fortune Summoners criticizes the steep learning curve and intense difficulty of the game. Therefore, I say this to any future buyers of Fortune Summoners.DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A DAMN CHALLENGE.If you're expecting this game to be as easy as any other modern platformer, it's likely that you'll repeatedly die 20+ times ON THE WAY TO AND FROM SCHOOL. If you're not going to be concentrated in learning the mechanics of this game and learning the enemies' attack patterns, you're going to drop this game before the 1 hour mark. THIS GAME WILL BE CHALLENGING. Dark Souls never told its players how to play its own game, yet is an exceptional game simply because the learning experience of how to approach each enemy is so enticing. And if you're telling me pressing ONE MORE BUTTON than Dark Souls to roll backwards is ""too complex"", then I have no hope for future games that hope to bring the difficulty of games from the 90s back in a modern fashion. Yes, this game is hard. Maybe even harder than Dark Souls (for me it was). But please give this game a try. Its negative reviews make Fortune Summoners look underrated with most of its complaints being directed to the difficulty. Personally, I enjoyed all 35 hours of my first playthrough because there was that difficulty factor to it. Without it, this game would be a simple button masher hack and slash. In conclusion, I fully recommend you try this game out (there's even a demo!) as long as you're prepared to suffer a bit of your confidence to play video games. I'll repeat this statement the fifthteenth time in this review: this game will be an insta-drop if you don't challenge yourself to beat it.Oh, and I recommend choosing the hard difficulty for maximum !!FUN!!.COMPATIBILITYAs it's commonly experienced, Windows 8.1 is a piece of trash when it deals with literally every video game out there. I had to download DXGL which supposedley fixes the DirectDraw issues with Windows 8 and list the executable for Fortune Summoners (sotes.exe) inside DXGL. It still runs (sadly) at around 40 frames per second normally although a game with ""this"" amount of graphics usually runs at 90 frames for me. I still recommend you make this game compatible for your computer (although it'll be a greater hassel than any other modern game out there) because it's well worth your effort. There's alot of content in this game that I haven't even explored although I've beaten the game, and it's a great challenge to those who look forward to it.			"

												Whenever Carpe Fulgar does an action game, why is it so damn difficult. Aside from a lot of back and forth, the difficulty setting does little to nothing (says more exp/gold in harder difficulties but it's more like playing I wanna be the guy on harder difficulties : more stress no gain as I have noticed no exp/gold changes from difficulties, the only difference is more hp on enemies and more dmg taken). The AI in the game is absurdly good, to the point where you just want to let your teammates do all the work while you just focus on not getting hit. The game has a really slow start but once you permanently get your other teammates, it does get better.			"

												The third translation by Carpe Fulgur may not be from the same game company as their previous titles, but is still just as good. Instead of being a typical ""2D platformer action RPG""-game, Fortune Summoners forces its user to stay sharp all the time. You see, the actual combat is more like a fighting-game, with combos and extremely clever enemies. This, along with tough dungeons, makes for a hard game despite its cutesy outward look.But Fortune Summoners is without any doubt worth your time. When you finally learn how the combat works every enemy encounter becomes exciting. Together with a charming story and a great soundtrack; Fortune Summoners is superb.If you like hard games, that is.			"

												This game is more than it appears. It has the general flow of a story-driven platformer, but with a battle system comparable to a medium-depth fighting game and the speed of Devil May Cry!

												Well if you look for reviews for this game you will read thinks like: movement sucks, story sucks, soundtrack is not good and all such bad stuff.Now after playing this game till the bitter end I can say it is no 10/10. this game lacks some small balance in battle and maybe a bit more end game content. But if we put this aside we look a a beautiful perl of unknown quality.There is this simple story of a shopkeepers daughter moving into a new city and start going to a magic school where kids learn to use elemental stones for controlling magic. To take part in this magic lesson she needs an own elemental stone, which cost a fortune (now you know why they called the game fortune.....well no)  So you have to get an elemental stone for the school lesson and that's all. This story looks so stupid but it is also something special because it is so well written. you permanently switch between school life and adventures in a fine manner. The graphics in this game looks nice and solid, and the the playable character are cute, it is a jrpg after all so you will get what you expect.The soundtrack fits every situation in the game. I never felt annoyed so don't listen to the people who telling you it sucks.The combat system. Everyone would lie when they are telling you they never had problems with it.sometimes you just rush through the enemies sometimes they kick your ♥♥♥ so fast you could cry. Imo the combat system is nice. you have a fine amount of skills for use and with higher level you get more and more of them. it is really fun to play but as I told you sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation you just can't handle. Enemies predict your movements and counter every attack you try. But don't give up, every time you die you will start in the room before without losing exp or money and you can try again so it's not bad at all.So If we add everything together have a nice typically  jrpg with a sweet story and a challenging combat system.Cute characters using sword and magic, getting items and equipment.This game will take 20 hours of your lifetime so don't think twice and just buy it. Even if eur 15,00 is a bit high for the normal price I still think it is worthy to pay this amount as I did.my rating: 8/10 "

												CONTROLLER REQUIRED  (not ""required"" per se, but it makes a huge difference in the fun factor!). **Please note, that getting the controller to work was a hassle. I used a program in tandem with the game called ""JoyToKey"". If you've played Binding of Isaac, then you will know what I'm talking about. Using JoyToKey to simply emulate keyboard presses on your controller is the way to go.  The built in controller settings to the game really suck.**I deeply enjoyed this game, thought I confess it had me very frustrated at times.  The combat requires a much higher degree of skill than the cutesy graphics would lead you to believe otherwise, but, you still learn to appreciate the depth of play.  Once you get a handle on things, it's very satisfying to properly execute maneuvers.  Throughout many of the games areas and dungeons, I often felt threated and had to keep sharp in order to avoid an untimely death.  There were a couple of times where it was difficult to determine where to go next, however, if you are committed to putting in some effort into exploring, you can figure it out.  My displayed play time represents a leisurely play through (40 hours), so don't worry about this game taking far too much time.			"

												Imagine a classic RPG-like game, platformer like Zelda 2. Add a faster pacing to it, lot's of action and finish with kawaii little girls. That's Fortune Summoners.Pros: (or just notes I guess? I have pretty much no cons)- The game is difficult, but it's extremely rewarding for the skilled. You gotta learn how to play each character (specially because you'll be forced to at times), but if you know how to, every battle will be so much easier. In contrast, going into a battle just mashing buttons will very likely leave you dead without landing one single hit in the enemy.- The characters are very fun and well designed. Even if the story isn't that much, it's very well done, same to the dialogues. Lots of lighthearted comedy and cuteness. Sometimes Arche's dialogues with Sana just break the kawaii meter.- Metroidvania gameplay I guess? It's more like Zelda for me though. You'll often get lost. The game doesn't tell you what to do everytime (you do have some sort of journal though). Of course, this game is meant to be difficult and fun, so EXPLORE!- Zero grinding, leveling up is also very rewarding in this game. Fighting a monster may prove a difficult task when you first find them, but if you fight them again three or even two levels above the fight will be incredibly easier. That said, the game DOES NOT let you grind at all (literally can't), not that it is necessary though. The level pacing is extremely well done. Somehow it feels so meticulously perfect it's strange.- The visuals are quite nice (for a 640x480 game), but I really think there's many beautiful scenery through the game, in terms of pixel-art, and decent music too. Furthermore on the visuals, even though you spend the entire game in really only 3 ambients (forest, cave and dungeon), it pretty much never feels repetitive. Only after I finished the game that I realized how lacking in diversity the game's scenarios are, since everything is either green, brown or gray. Though, again, it doesn't bother you in-game.- Variety of skills and gameplay. Once you complete the party, you'll have a swordswoman (or swordsgirl), a defensive mage (passive, support, healer, water/ice mage) and a offensive mage (fire mage). Each of them feel very unique to play in battle, and are all equaly difficult to master, but extremely fun. It's like an entire different game when you play the game throughly as Arche (sword) and try to re-play the game with main as Sana (water/ice mage).- Fighting is very complex, even if it's a platformer game. Every battle is very fierce and precise. The controls in this game are very ""sloppy"" at first. Lots of inertia, when you launch an attack, you can't suddenly stop it to turn around etc. Enemies have VERY intelligent AI (not that it can't be exploited, it's as intelligent as it can be). But in the end, none of those things are a problem. They're what makes the game the masterpiece it is for me. Combat is always very rich, lots of action every corner, a good bestiary with different enemies, lots of times where you are fighting plays a big role too (out in the open, on a hill, stair, tunnel, next to a lake/lava etc), you have to manage how to use items in battle very well too, strategies and tactics play a big role in battle too, since you can customize in a fairly detailed way each's character's role in battle. Even Arche has a lot of skills you need to master in battle to be really good, though she isn't a spellcaster. This is a game where you play as little girls fighting to save the world, and it can surely drive many people away because of it's difficulty.- Your enemies are very smart, they will dodge, jump, block and counter-attack you next time you miss, and if you let them the fight will be over before you know it. On the other hand, your allies (the other 2 characters you are not controlling) are even more inteligent. Besides being need to be told where to stand and what spells to use, they can survive by themselves without a problem most of the time. They can block and dodge quite well, support you in battle even better. If you're trying to just exit an dungeon, just dodge through all the enemies to the exit and they will most likely get past the enemies unharmed just as well as you.- You can't save your game everywhere, which adds greatly to the difficulty of the game. Still, save points are quite well placed. You can save at any inn, some places with beds on occasion (school, Stella's house, at the end of the day when you sleep), you'll also find some wandering magicians here and there that will heal you for a fee and save your game too, and also fountains inside dungeons (mostly located before the boss at early dungeons).- Your inventory is limited, VERY limited. you can carry at most 48 items I think? Including your character's equipment, that is. So you mostly only get ~34 slots. That is VERY little, but is also quite well done for the game. Just because of this, you'll often find yourself making about ~3 trips to each dungeon until you get to actually finish it.- Dungeon design isn't really spectacular, but it's still quite good. Most dungeons are done in a way that allows you to progress, say, 1/3 of the dungeon, go back to restock on items and rest, and go back to where you last were on the dungeon with much less effort. It is such because there are often gates you need to open to progress, that end up acting as shortcuts, and also every dungeon's design is made to be quite a maze. When you first go in, you'll have to explore everything around (listen, DO EXPLORE EVERYTHING, if you miss a certain thing on a dungeon it can cost you a lot). There lots of ""dead ends"" that don't add further to getting to the dungeon's boss, but knowing your way through a dungeon saves A LOT of time and effort if you need to go back in. This maze aspect of the dungeons are also a very interesting part of the game, it adds to the exploration and can be quite fun.Cons:- Endgame best equipment is given AFTER the final battle. Why would I need that?- Big cliffhanger ending.- WHY DID IT END. The game is 30 hours long and I didn't even get close to a full gameplay. It's almost like you only go through two ""zones"" of a normal RPG (because of what I said before on scenarios). Much potential to have lots, LOTS more of content, could easily get a sequel.In the end, this game requires a lot of skill, and being skilled is highly rewarding. On the other hand, if you can't even get around the controls, this will be quite the hell to play I believe.If you're having trouble with a fight, just look at your strategy and think about it from a basic perspective and it will work out. Remember to put the mages in the back, DO tank the hits if you play melee etc. Also don't rush and button-mash. You can block and dodge, and so can your enemies.The game has a demo that goes up to the first dungeon, and (I think) the game will keep your save if you play the demo and do purchase it after, so there should be zero harm to playing the demo.This game really has potential. At least, the way the game is. I can definitely imagine a multiplayer game out of this, everyone controlling a character, it could be the craziest, funniest rpg experience ever. I believe this game truly has a lot of potential, and is overrall an outstanding experience, but sadly, the developer quit. Who know's what they're doing now.This game is amazing. For me truly a masterpiece and one of my favorites all time.			"

												Fortune Summoners is a story-driven side-scrolling action RPG.  It is the latest in Carpe Fulgurs collection of retro-inspired funtimes with a heavy emphasis on story and combat.  The story is always in the foreground, told light-heartedly by the wonderful characters.  The combat is challenging at times, yet intuitive and forgiving, and you may actually find yourself thanking your AI-controlled comrades for their help.The game I'm most reminded of is the Mega Man Zero series on the Nintendo Handhelds, and that is a good thing.  I loved the MMZ franchise for its fast-paced combat and gripping story, and am glad to see that there is a developer still willing to carry the torch.  Fortune Summoners is a callback to some of my most memorable gaming experiences, while at the same time carving its own little niche in my heart for telling a compelling story in a way that is both challenging and enjoyable.  Thanks, Carpe Fulgur LLC.  I await the next installment.			"

												This Game is Amazing its one of those Games i use to LOVE this Game just makes soooo much fun and is so well done that i cant get enough of it .Weirdly enough is that i normally dont even like Side-Scroller RPGs but i fell in love with that one.here is a pro and contra list.Pros:Beatiful Art DesignCute CharactersNice and funny StoryLittle referencesAmazing SoundtrackUnique Combat SystemA huge Variety of Spells and Attack-CombosLots of collectibles3 Different characters (classes)Good PuzzlesExtremly high difficulty (this might as well be in the Cons section for some ppl but i love challenging Games)This Game nearly thinks about everything.Cons:Sometimes the Game barely tells you whats the next step to do (even though this happens only 2 times in the Game you should try to remember the story and so on)Little control problems (first it was a little weird how the characters controlled but you can easilly fix that going in the options menu and changing the Analog Controller options oh and ignore this part if you play with keyboard)			"

												Good storyline, good character development and challenging game play, what else could you possibly want? Funny bits? It has 'em too!That said, the game itself is relatively hard, mostly because of the slippery nature of the combat system and how slow XP is to gain in the beginning, but once you get used to the combat mechanics (personally took me around 20 hours of playing before more or less understanding it, by that point I was nearly done with the story, but that could be attributed to me not generally playing this type of game) it works fine. I must admit that I used a walkthrough though, because I was lost most of the time, especially in that labyrinth.. I can see that the game itself isn't for everyone but at the very least, I suggest you try the demo first, which covers the entire prologue. (about an hour long, more or less depending if you explore and talk to everybody or not)I wasn't sure about the game at first either after seeing the combat mechanics, but the story and that completely airhead main character kept me going.

												I'm going to give this game a thumbs up, because I enjoyed it.  However, there are some issues.  Admittedly, I'm not a huge gamer, but even so, the game was very difficult to begin with, and I actually ended up buying a USB control pad as I found using the keyboard impossible.  Luckily, the player isn't penalised for dying, lol, because I probably died hundreds of times.  Oh well.The game reminded me of old Zelda games, which I love, so I'd say if you like old Zelda type games, have patience, a control pad and don't mind dying a lot, especially at first when you'll have crappy stats and can't kill anything.... you'll probably like this game.

												I picked this up as a low-risk steam sale impulse buy -- pretty much how these things always go. This game isn't the complete package.  The graphics and presentation.. have a very specific flavor.  The story is fine -- it gives context for your random adventures, but it won't really drive you to play on its own.  None of what I've said so far should really come as a surprise.The combat, which seems to be the most polarizing factor of the game, is pretty amazing.  The basic sword moves each have their purpose without giving you an explicit advantage from spamming them, and the AI is tuned to capitalize on sloppy play even at the lowest levels.  Though controls might 'feel' unresponsive to some due to the learning curve, if you actually use good combo input (blazblue is the easiest comparison to make) you'll get to use them to some really pleasant effect.  It's the sort of game where you feel cool when you (finally) manage to outmaneuver that cluster of enemies that was terrorizing you, and you WILL improve. Quickly.That being said, I'd have to qualify this as a 'a very good game with some flaws' rather than 'a completely underrated masterpiece'. The quests and puzzles thrown in are mostly trivial block-pushing or 'There and Back Again' fetch quests. There are a lot of nooks and crannies where it feels like there should be more to discover, but there simply isn't -- one gets the impression that there would very likely have been more content or an expansion if the developer had had more resources at their disposal.  The story, as mentioned previously, mostly goes nowhere.  Finally, the gameplay changes DRAMATICALLY after your party expands -- not only is it easier, but the tone switches from a patient practice in disciplined swordplay to ... well, shock & awe tactics. Blitz the screen while your mages wreck everything... and then cringe as you watch yourself get charmed and butcher your teammates in <8 seconds.  To add to this your higher level sword moves are much more similar to traditional action games, with large arcs that do tons of damage and are completely spammable. The Hedgehog-Style Ultimate Technique spin-to-win comes to mind immediately.In all, I could recommend this to anyone, with the caveat that they're slightly masochistic and value a unique experience over the bells and whistles that a typical AAA-title might offer. Though honestly, if you've gotten to the stage where you're looking at this game's store page and checking out reviews, then it's nearly guaranteed to be worth your time and money. "

You will play as a cute little school girl, and since she is still in school, she will need to go to school, on foot, through roads infested with monsters. Surprisingly the adults consider this as normal.Whack away with your sword through various type of enemies with different attack patterns in this gorgeous 2D world.Nice soundtrack and solid storyline will accompany you throughout your journey.Give it a try.

												I got this game from a bundle I bought in the Steam Summer Sale and let me say this is probably the best game in that bundle. It has cute visuals, a good story, and is deceptively hard. The developers made it so you can't over power yourself and breeze through the game. You are always at the same level as the other monsters if not usually a level beind them so running in swinging is not an option. The only downfall as many point out is that the game abrubtly ends leaving you with a rather unsatified feeling but on the plus side you can change the color of yours and your teammates clothes so thats pretty cool.

But that was just because I was playing in fullscreen mode.  Once I changed to the windowed mode, everything was pretty fluid.  A friend had the same problem with the fullscreen mode, so I'm guessing that's everyone else's problem too.			"

												I purchased a bundle on sale that included Recettear, Chantelise and Fortune Summoners. Fortune Summoners wasn't even the game I wanted out of the bundle, it was Recettear but it was on sale and it was cheaper to get all three than to purchase just Recettear at retail so I got them all.To my surprise I was more into Fortune Summoners than any of the other mentioned games. I put some time into Recettear and it was okay, Chantelise had pretty unforgiving controls but Fortune Summoners stood out. What made the game stand out? Well the game had a pretty nice artstyle even if it pales in comparison to other 2D games. The controls at first I would consider very difficult to learn, but once you get it, you get it. I'd push the game on its harder difficulties and turning off auto block for the full learning process. It might be werid to think of a 2D plantformer with difficult controls but there are multiple button combinations that are used in conjunction for attacks, spells, and just blocking requires holding a key.The game has three characters that you can take control of, I'd say this is a spolier but the title screen shows off the characters. In any case each character is given their own health and magic meter, their own levels and its possible to switch between them in the middle of combat. The CPU controlled characters (when you aren't playing as one of them), was okay. You could change the order or actions the CPU would have to take like staying in a spot or following you but for the most part the computer controlled characters were competent enough to get a few attacks in. Puzzles in the game required certain characters skills, so some switching around was neccessary and I liked the puzzles the game gave, even if there weren't that many. There was a fufilling part of the game just playing with each one of these characters and they had a lot to say.All of that adds to the game but what really made the game stick out for me was the characters. Each of them had so much to say not just to each other but to NPCs and even during cutscenes I had to read everything. The flavor text was my favorite part of the game and I went to each NPC and talked to every one of them with different characters to see what they would say. I laughed at times and smiled a lot, to me it looked like a lot of effort was put into it.But in every RPG, there's still a possiblity to be be ""overleveled"". The game locks your level into place if I recall correctly until you pass a certain story point. It might be shown below the health meter and the game to me was never easy. There might not be much variations in enemies, the game does recolor some of them, but they are indeed different (longer reach, more health, different attack) and I always wanted to be challenged. There is even a secret weapon that requires a side quest from the beginning to the end of the game that might frustrate you, if you don't know where to find the items, but I never got it and I'll have to go back and try to find it.In the end I was left wanting a sequel, the person that made the game left it wide open for additional content. There were stuff mentioned in story that was never seen in game or elaborated on and the antagonist gets away. There was also an aftergame dungeon, but since my computer died and I've replaced it I'll have to play through it again to see if it adds anything to the game/story. I looked everywhere on the personal site for the game, the publisher, etc and I know that there will probably never be a sequel. Someone even tried reaching out to the person's email, but I never knew if a response was given. Despite that I loved the art of the game, the story personally, the characters even more and I was okay with the somewhat awkward to get used to controls that may put newer players off about the game. I consider it the best purchase I've made on Steam and it wasn't even the game I wanted when I did buy it nor have I played it the most. I recommend the game if you are willing to give the controls a fair chance and appreciate the little things in the game. Otherwise the retail price of $20 might be too much and you can wait till it goes on sale.			"

												I really dont know how to review this game.Its so cute, has an original story and gameplay. Its not like going from city to city and destroy the evil in every town like every JRPG ever. Here you have goals like go to school, prepare for a field trip and so on. Its something different. There are adorable Charakters and it teaches you friendship, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry, so emotional and yet funny.But... Have delevopers of those games ever heard of HIGH DEFINITION? Such a cute game in... what is it? 640x480 or entire 800x600 resolution? Sooo much space on my screen.And dont get me started on the fighting system. It works fine, if i train my moves on a empty location, everything works fine... every Move and ability good recognized by the system.... but in the action with 5 monsters, me and 2 CPU-Controlled Partymembers? On that low resolution? Dammit i cant even find my charakter! And of course monsters are freaking awesome at dodging and blocking my attacks. Also they have muuuuch HP, also have fun screaming frustrated on this thing.I make my Review a positive one, but be warned: Its damn hard. The dev should really overdo the balance or add a mode for people who want to enjoy the story, with easier or less fights.... And i just played it on easy.			"

												Very difficult but enjoyable and cutesy side scroller with rpg-lite tendencies.  I will say that the control scheme takes some commitment, as the rolls, sprinting and some of the combat moves are performed solely by the direction of the left stick (independent of button pressess).  If you take the time to learn the moves and don't forget to block, you'll be in for a unique and rewarding experience.  On this topic, a controller is highly recommended and fully configurable, other than the thumbstick issues just mentioned.Overall, I really enjoyed the game.  The storyline (despite being about 9-11 y/o kids) is very well written.  I agree it's expensive for an indie, but worth full price if you like challenging side scrollers with a good story and lots of combat. The game does take awhile to progress, particularly the first hour or two, but it picks up considerably afterwards.  Have fun!!PS you an only save at the school nurse's office, dungeon shrines, the inn (later in game), and at the end of each chapter. I would prefer a save anywhere scheme, and this is the only big negative in the game, imho.			"
